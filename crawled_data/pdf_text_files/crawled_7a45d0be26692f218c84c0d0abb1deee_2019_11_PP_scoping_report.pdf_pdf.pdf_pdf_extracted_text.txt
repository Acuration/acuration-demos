INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document presents the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
Scoping Report for the Progress Power Project (PPP). This Scoping 
Report has been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd on behalf of 
Progress Power Limited (PPL).  
1.1.2 
PPL is promoting a new thermal generating station on land at Eye 
Airfield Industrial Estate located in Eye mid-Suffolk, East Anglia, 
England (approximate grid reference 613239, 275109) (Power 
Generation Plant). The site location is shown in Figure 1.  
1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide an electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts Electrical (MWe) and would be fuelled 
by natural gas.  
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 
(PA 2008) and therefore an application for a development consent 
order (DCO) is proposed to be made to the Secretary of State (SoS) 
(the DCO application).  
1.2 
The Proposed Development 
1.2.1 
The three main elements of the Progress Power Project would 
comprise:  
� 
A gas fired power generating station capable of providing up to 299 
MWe (referred to as the ‘Power Generation Plant’): 
� 
A new Electrical Connection (referred to as the ‘Electrical 
Connection’) to export power from the Power Generation Plant to 
the National Grid; and  
� 
A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the ‘Gas 
Connection’) to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Gas Transmission System (NTS).  
1.2.2 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection together are referred to as the ‘Progress Power Project 
or PPP’ and are all required for the generation of electricity and the 
subsequent export of that electricity to the National Grid. The DCO 
application may include the whole of the PPP.

1.2.3 
The three key elements which make up the PPP are described below:  
Power Generation Plant 
1.2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would comprise of the following principal 
elements required for the generation of electricity:  
� 
Gas / steam turbines; 
� 
Stack(s);  
� 
Cooling equipment;  
� 
Workshops and store; 
� 
Water tanks; 
� 
Administration and control buildings; 
� 
Gas receiving station; 
� 
Auxiliary boiler; and 
� 
Miscellaneous buildings and associated equipment. 
1.2.5 
All of the above elements would be located within the proposed Power 
Generation Plant site boundary shown [outlined in red] on Figure 1 and 
are integral aspects of the NSIP. A potential layout of these main plant 
items is shown in Figure 2. Further details on their size and function are 
given in Section 3.3 of this Report. 
Gas Connection  
1.2.6 
The Gas Connection would comprise a new gas pipeline which would 
connect the Power Generation Plant with Feeder 5 of the NTS, which 
runs northeast to southwest from Stowmarket, via the compressor 
station that is located immediately to the east of the Power Generation 
Plant site.  
1.2.7 
Currently, there are five connection options available to PPL, which are 
being further considered for their suitability. The connection options will 
be further refined and the options narrowed to a single connection route 
prior to submission of the DCO application.  
1.2.8 
The potential route corridor options currently under consideration for 
the Gas Connection are shown on Figure 3 and Inserts 4 - 8. Further 
details of the potential connection route options are provided in Section 
3.4 of this report.  
Electrical Connection

1.2.9 
There are currently a number of options available for the Electrical 
Connection to export power from the Power Generation Plant to the 
National Grid. These options comprise a new 400 kV electricity export 
cable, either in the form of an underground cable or overhead line. In 
either case, the cable/line would run from the Power Generation Plant 
site to an existing 400 kV overhead line situated approximately 1.5km 
to the west of the site. 
1.2.10 
A new substation and switchyard would also be required. This 
infrastructure would either be situated within the Power Generation 
Plant site, or alternatively, adjacent to the overhead line connection 
point. Should an underground export cable option be progressed, then 
a new sealing end compound (SEC) would also be required. This would 
be constructed at the point where the underground cable emerged to 
facilitate its connection to the overhead line. 
1.2.11 
Specific route corridor options have not been identified for an 
underground Electrical Connection at present, and options are being 
investigated within the Opportunity Area to the west of the A140 shown 
on Figure 3 and Insert 9. Specific options will be explored and further 
refined to a single connection prior to submission of the DCO 
Application. Similarly, options for the substation, switchyard, and any 
SEC infrastructure will be considered and selected prior to the 
submission of the application. Further details are given in Section 3.5 of 
this report.  
1.2.12 
At present, the route options for a potential overhead line connection 
are still being determined, but it is anticipated these will be within the 
footprint of the Opportunity Area. 
1.3 
Need for and Benefits of the Project  
1.3.1 
This section briefly summarises why the PPP is needed and how it 
would contribute towards ensuring greater reliability of electricity supply 
in the UK.  
1.3.2 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
sets out national policy for energy infrastructure and is part of a suite of 
National Policy Statements (NPS) designated to guide the examination 
and determination of DCO applications.  
1.3.3 
NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, and 
confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there is a 
significant need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace 
capacity that will be lost through the closure of existing large plant. 
Indeed it states that the decision-maker ‘should start with a

presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2).  
1.3.4 
Furthermore, NPS EN-1 also sets out the national policy position on 
new Electrical Connection infrastructure (Section 3.7). It concludes that: 
...there is an urgent need for new electricity transmission and 
distribution infrastructure (and in particular for new lines of 132 kV and 
above) to be provided. The IPC should consider that the need for any 
given 
proposed 
new connection 
or 
reinforcement 
has 
been 
demonstrated if it represents an efficient and economical means of 
connecting a new generating station to the transmission or distribution 
network, or reinforcing the network to ensure that it is sufficiently 
resilient and has sufficient capacity (in the light of any performance 
standards set by Ofgem) to supply current or anticipated future levels of 
demand. (Paragraph 3.7.10) 
1.3.5 
NPS EN-1 therefore establishes the general need case for energy 
NSIPs, including gas generation. This has been preceded and followed 
by other government policy and evidence, some of which is 
summarised below to provide further context.  
1.3.6 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is government policy that 
the electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of 
technologies that continuously and reliably produce stable and 
controllable power and that within this scenario, gas-fuelled electricity 
generating technologies can play a significant role. Thus in the second 
Annual Energy Statement (AES) (November, 2011), the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change (DECC) directed the need to build new 
power generation infrastructure. In line with this requirement, DECC 
acknowledged the need for gas to continue to feature strongly in the 
energy mix, and also stated that while it is important that businesses 
play their part in the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is also 
important to remain competitive. 
1.3.7 
These statements are supported by the more recent Gas Generation 
Strategy, released by DECC in December 2012
1. The Strategy sets out 
the important role that gas generation—as a reliable, flexible source of 
electricity—will play in any future generation mix, supporting a secure, 
low-carbon and affordable electricity system. It states that “Gas 
currently forms an integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is a 
reliable, flexible source of electricity. Using gas as a fuel in our power 
stations currently provides a significant proportion of our electricity 
generation (around 40% in 2011)”.

1.3.8 
Moreover, it states that “Modelling detailed in the strategy suggests that 
as much as 26 GW of new gas plant could be required by 2030, in part 
to replace older coal, gas and nuclear plant as it retires from the 
system. It also indicates that in 2030 we could need more overall gas 
capacity than we have today, although operating at lower load factors. 
The modelling shows that gas could play a more extensive role, with 
higher load factors, should the 4th Carbon Budget be revised upwards” 
(Executive Summary). 
1.3.9 
The paper also presents scenarios which indicate that up to 41 GW of 
new gas generation capacity will be needed by 2030 to underpin long 
term electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind 
generation at times of peak demand. 
1.3.10 
In October 2012, Ofgem (the electricity and gas regulatory body) 
prepared a report entitled ‘Electricity Capacity Assessment’ which was 
submitted to the SoS and estimates a set of plausible electricity 
capacity margins that could be delivered by the market over the next 
four years and the associated risks to security of supply. 
1.3.11 
One of the key findings of the Ofgem report is that electricity de-rated 
capacity margins will decrease significantly from the current historically 
high levels. In parallel, the risk of electricity customer disconnections 
will appreciably increase from near zero levels. This is primarily 
because of a significant reduction in electricity supplies from coal and 
oil plants which are due to close under European environmental 
legislation. 
1.3.12 
With the large number of wind turbines that are now providing electricity 
to the National Grid and the increasing number of solar farms being 
proposed, both of which represent an intermittent power supply, there 
is significant consideration being given to the need for flexible power on 
the network. Parsons Brinckerhoff’s “Powering the Future” report2 
which maps the route to a low carbon economy, has predicted that up 
to 9,000 MW of flexible power would be needed by 2050 to help 
stabilise the National Grid due the intermittent supply, in particular from 
offshore wind.  
1.3.13 
Given the above, there is therefore a clear and significant requirement 
for further capacity to meet the projected need for both base load (i.e. 
continuously operational) and reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated 
gas fired plant at the Power Generation Plant site could allow for the 
rapid provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid, or provide a

constant supply of reliable electricity generation, thus playing a role in 
meeting the energy requirements of the UK going forward.  
1.4 
The Developer 
1.4.1 
The Developer of the proposed PPP is PPL. PPL is the Special 
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which has been set up to develop the PPP and 
supporting infrastructure.  
1.4.2 
PPL has been established by Watt Power Limited. (WPL). WPL has 
been established to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to 
support the UK Government drive to a low carbon economy. Stag 
Energy provides the resources through a management services 
agreement with WPL. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the 
company draws on a depth of experience with a team that has created 
and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation and related 
infrastructure projects across the globe, of which, 2,500 was delivered 
in the UK.  
1.4.3 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to the Gateway Storage 
Company Ltd, which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage 
facility in the East Irish Sea. The project has been consented by the UK 
Government and the local planning authority (Barrow-in-Furness 
Borough Council, Cumbria) (for further information on the project visit: 
www.gatewaystorage.co.uk).  
1.4.4 
WPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government drive to a low carbon economy. PPL recognises the need 
to balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and 
concerns of energy projects and believes this can be responsibly 
delivered at a local level. 
1.4.5 
PPL is also committed to acting in a socially and environmentally 
responsible manner. As part of this policy, they will seek the views and 
concerns of the local community and have regard to them in the 
application proposals. The PPP and supporting infrastructure will be 
designed and developed to high quality, safety and environmental 
standards.

1.5 
The Consenting Regime and EIA Process 
The Planning Act 2008 
1.5.1 
In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is 
considered to be a NSIP if its generating capacity is more than 
50 MWe. As the proposed Power Generation Plant will have a 
generating capacity of up to 299 MWe, it will be classified as a NSIP 
under Part 3, Section 14(1)a and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008. Under 
Part 4, Section 31 of the PA 2008, development consent is required for 
development that is or forms part of a NSIP. It is PPL’s intention to 
submit the DCO application to the SoS in due course.  
1.5.2 
Section 37 of the PA 2008 governs the content of an application for a 
DCO, including the requirements for the necessary accompanying 
documents.  
1.5.3 
The consenting process under the PA 2008 has been designed to 
ensure that the public, local authorities and interest groups are 
provided the opportunity to get involved and for their views to be given 
due regard, whilst also reducing the overall time required to obtain 
permission for nationally significant infrastructure by establishing the 
national needs case for such infrastructure through the publication of 
NPSs. 
1.5.4 
Further information on the application process for NSIPs and other 
information about PINS can be found at their website: 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/application-process/planning-
inspectorate-role/ 
Requirement for an EIA and Notification under Regulation 6(1)(b) 
1.5.5 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 
2009 
(the 
EIA 
Regulations) 
impose 
procedural 
requirements, in particular, the carrying out of EIA in relation to 
applications for DCOs. All development in Schedule 1 (Schedule 1 
development) requires EIA. Development in Schedule 2 (Schedule 2 
development) requires EIA if it is likely to have significant effects on the 
environment.  
1.5.6 
The definition of Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating 
station with a thermal output of 300 MW or more (Schedule 1(2)(a)). 
1.5.7 
Although, as described above, the Power Generation Plant will have an 
electrical output of up to 299 MWe, the thermal output of the plant will

Impact Assessment Scoping Report

- 19 - 
 
be of the order of 400-950 MW (depending on the final technology 
choice) and therefore an EIA will be required under the EIA regulations.  
1.5.8 
Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’, 
which is produced as part of the process of the combustion of fuel. Only 
a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy which 
is why this is a larger value than electrical output.  
1.5.9 
This Report therefore constitutes formal notification to the SoS under 
Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations that PPL proposes to provide 
an Environmental Statement (ES) in respect of the DCO application. 
PPL understands that PINS will notify consultation bodies as required 
in accordance with Regulation 9(1)(a) of the EIA Regulations.  
1.5.10 
Section 5(2)(a) of The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed 
Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009, require that, where 
applicable, the ES required pursuant to the EIA Regulations, together 
with any scoping or screening opinions or directions, must accompany 
the DCO application. 
Additional 
Consent 
Options 
for 
the 
Gas 
and 
Electrical 
Connections 
1.5.11 
The Gas Connection is integral to the Power Generation Plant and can 
be included in the DCO application. The Electrical Connection may also 
be included, however, it may be desirable for programme reasons to 
obtain separate consents for it (the Gas Connection will be part of the 
DCO application in all cases). It is PPL’s intention to confirm its 
consenting approach in light of the identification of the preferred 
corridor routes through the Opportunity Area for the Electrical 
Connection.  
1.5.12 
PPL confirms that all components of the PPP included in the DCO 
application will be assessed (including cumulative impacts). If the 
Electrical Connection is separately consented, and therefore not 
included in the DCO application, PPL proposes to include information in 
the ES insofar as it's available on the indicative works required for an 
Electrical Connection. The aim of this is to allow the SoS to understand 
if there are likely to be constraints and to allow for an assessment of 
cumulative impacts.  
1.5.13 
For the purposes of EIA Scoping, PPL seeks views on the scope of 
assessments for all elements of the PPP and also on the proposed 
approach to the Electrical Connection if it is separately consented.

Consultation Strategy 
1.5.14 
A well designed consultation strategy will allow all potentially affected 
parties to comment on and input into the planning and development 
process. PPL will ensure that all representations made during the 
consultation process are considered carefully and, where appropriate, 
taken account of prior to submission of the DCO. 
1.5.15 
The PA 2008 and the associated secondary legislation set out the 
provisions for consultation with relevant parties prior to the submission 
of a DCO application to the SoS. As part of this legislation, a Statement 
of Community Consultation (SoCC) will be agreed with the relevant 
local authorities before being published. The SoCC will set out how 
PPL intends to consult with the local community in accordance with 
Section 47 of the PA 2008. The document will also set out how and 
when PPL intends to provide opportunities for the community to access 
the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) which will be 
prepared in due course.  
1.5.16 
In addition, and in accordance with Section 42 of the PA 2008, PPL will 
also consult with the relevant local authorities, other statutory 
consultees, and persons with an interest in any land that is affected by 
the DCO application. The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (as amended) list 
the statutory consultees.  
1.5.17 
Consultees, including members of the community, will be able to submit 
representations throughout the pre application stage and PPL will take 
account of representations made. The outputs generated from the 
formal statutory consultation undertaken in accordance with Sections 
42 and 47 of the PA 2008 will be summarised in a consultation report, 
submitted with the DCO application.  
1.5.18 
PPL recognises that the SoS has a duty under Regulation 8(6) of the 
EIA Regulations to consult widely before adopting a scoping opinion. A 
full list of the bodies consulted by the SoS under Regulation 9(1)(a) will 
accompany the Scoping Opinion provided to PPL in accordance with 
Regulation 9(1)(b). It is also noted by PPL that whilst the SoS’s list may 
inform PPL’s future consultation, it should not be relied upon for that 
purpose. PPL is familiar with PINS Advice Note 3 ‘Consultation and 
notification undertaken by the Planning Inspectorate’ (May 2012). 
1.5.19 
Before formal statutory consultation can start, it is a requirement under 
Section 46 of the PA 2008, for PPL to notify the SoS of its intention to 
commence formal consultation, and in doing so provide adequate 
information on which it intends to commence that consultation.

REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This section of the Scoping Report outlines the main regulatory and 
policy framework that is relevant to the proposed PPP.  
2.1.2 
Relevant EU directives are considered first, at a high level.  
2.1.3 
This section also gives an overview of the current and emerging 
policies relevant to the PPP at the national, regional and local levels as 
they relate to the consideration of the likely scope of EIA.  
2.1.4 
Further description of the planning policy background and its relevance 
to the PPP will be provided in the Planning Statement, which will be 
produced as a separate document to support the DCO application. A 
summary of the impacts of the proposed PPP on relevant and 
important planning policy will be discussed more fully within the ES and 
other documents submitted for examination in support of the draft DCO.  
2.2 
European Union (EU) 
2.2.1 
Current EU directives of particular relevance to the PPP with respect to 
environmental requirements are as follows: 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain 
public and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive) 
2.2.2 
The EIA Directive ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely 
to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an 
environmental assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation. The 
Directive sets the thresholds for projects that require an EIA (as stated 
in Section 1.5) and also outlines the impacts on the environment to be 
assessed in the EIA process.  
Directive 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 (the Public Participation 
Directive). 
2.2.3 
The Public Participation Directive implements the obligations arising 
from the Århus Convention and amends the EIA Directive and the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (see 2.2.4 
below) to improve public participation.

Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions 
(integrated pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial 
Emissions Directive (IED)) 
2.2.4 
In December 2007 the EU adopted a Proposal for a Directive on 
industrial emissions (IED). The IED recasts seven existing directives 
related to industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 
January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control 
(the IPPC Directive) and Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on 
the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large 
combustion plants (the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into 
a single legislative instrument to improve the permitting, compliance 
and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States. However, the 
general principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD Directive 
described below are retained and will remain relevant to the PPP.  
2.2.5 
The purpose of the IPPC Directive was to achieve integrated 
prevention and control of pollution arising from certain potentially 
polluting processes and to ensure a high level of protection for the 
environment taken as a whole. Measures were laid down to prevent or, 
where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and 
land with the introduction of emission limit values (ELV) and best 
available techniques (BAT). With regard to power projects, combustion 
installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW are subject to 
the IPPC Directive. The IPPC Directive is transposed into UK 
legislation via the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) and the IED is to be transposed 
through amendments to the Environmental Permitting (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2010. An Environmental Permit will be required for 
the operation of the Power Generation Plant. 
2.2.6 
The purpose of the LCPD was to limit the emissions of certain 
pollutants into the atmosphere from large combustion processes. The 
LCPD applied to combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to 
or greater than 50 MW. The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulphur dioxide(SO2) and particulates were subject to the stringent 
ELVs stipulated in the LCPD. The LCPD requirements for new plant are 
implemented in the UK regulations by the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010. 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of 
natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) 
2.2.7 
The aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-
diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora. Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member 
States are designed to maintain or restore, at conservation status,

natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of community 
interest whilst also taking into account economic, social and cultural 
requirements and regional and local characteristics. The Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the Habitats 
Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of 
wild birds (the Birds Directive) 
2.2.8 
The Birds Directive provides a comprehensive scheme for the 
protection of wild bird species naturally occurring within the EU. The 
Directive places great emphasis on the protection of habitats suitable 
for supporting endangered and migratory species, introducing a system 
of Special Protection Area designation to protect important habitats. 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the requirements of 
the Birds Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and 
cleaner air for Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive) 
2.2.9 
Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and 
management (the Air Quality Framework Directive) described the basic 
principles of how air quality should be assessed and managed in the 
Member States. Subsequent 'Daughter Directives' introduced numerical 
limits, thresholds and monitoring requirements for a variety of pollutants 
including oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide to guarantee that there 
are no adverse effects with regard to human health. The Air Quality 
Standards Regulations 2010 give effect, in England and Wales, to the 
Ambient Air Quality Directive. 
2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 & 
Policy Context  
2.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant is categorised as a NSIP and will be 
determined by the SoS under the regime established by the PA 2008.  
2.3.2 
As set out in NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for 
Energy), ‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-
specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for decisions’ 
(Paragraph 1.1.1) and the decision-maker ‘should start with a 
presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2).  
2.3.3 
Decisions must also be taken by the SoS having regard to the local 
impact report and any other matters which the SoS ‘thinks are both 
important and relevant to its decision’ (paragraph 1.1.1), which may

include the Development Plan Documents or other documents in the 
Local Development Framework. 
2.3.4 
The DCO application will be examined by PINS with the decision made 
by the SoS.  
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
The Planning Act 2008 required new policy to inform decisions on 
NSIPs in England and Wales. Policy for such infrastructure is set out in 
National Policy Statements (NPS). Those that are relevant to the 
consideration of the DCO application are: 
� 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1); 
� 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2);  
� 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines; and  
� 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure. 
2.4.2 
NPS EN-1 Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy contains 
government policy on energy and energy infrastructure development, 
representing the needs case for any proposal for an energy NSIP.  
2.4.3 
NPS EN-1 recognises that there is a significant need for new energy 
infrastructure. It states that pending plant closures in the UK will reduce 
available capacity by 22 GW by 2020 as a result of tightening 
environmental legislation and older power stations approaching the end 
of their useful life (paragraphs 3.3.7 to 3.3.9).  
2.4.4 
NPS EN-1 also sets out guidance on the consideration of alternatives 
when developing a new energy generation project (paragraphs 4.4.2-
4.4.3) and guidance relating to criteria for ‘good design’ of new 
developments (Section 4.5).  
2.4.5 
Specific guidance on good design is also provided in NPS EN-2, 
including that “applicants should demonstrate good design particularly 
in respect of landscape and visual amenity (…) and in the design of the 
project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, transport 
impacts and air emissions.” 
2.4.6 
In Section 4.6 of EN-1 the consideration of Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) is denoted as an assessment principle in itself and references to 
other guidance and viability considerations are set out. It is stated that

PRO-4100-PB-ENV-RPT-R40 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
May 2013 
for PPL 
 
- 29 - 
 
applicants should consider CHP from the earliest point and it should be 
a criterion for site selection (paragraph 4.6.7).  
2.4.7 
Section 4.8 of NPS EN-1 also sets out how applicants and the SoS 
should take the effects of climate change into account when developing 
and consenting NSIPs. Paragraph 4.8.11 requires any adaptation 
measures to be based on the latest set of UK Climate Projections, the 
Government's latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (when 
available) and in consultation with the EA. 
2.4.8 
Other assessment principles that are particularly likely to be relevant to 
energy NSIPs are set out as follows in EN-1 (relevant paragraph 
numbers given in brackets): 
� 
Pollution control (4.10): describes the relationship with other 
regimes (e.g. Environmental Permitting) which is essentially that 
the decision maker should be satisfied that ‘potential releases can 
be adequately regulated under the pollution control framework’ 
without unacceptable cumulative impacts arising. 
� 
Safety (4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): describes the 
relationship with other regimes and the general requirement that 
the decision maker will need to be satisfied that they are complied 
with.  
� 
Health (4.13): requires that an assessment of potential health 
impacts is made in relation to each element of the project, such as 
in relation to air quality, waste or noise and describing the 
relationship with other regimes, stating at 4.13.5 that where 
separate air quality regulations are (or will be) satisfied then the 
decision maker is likely to consider these effective mitigation, 
whereas for noise or other aspects it will take account of health 
concerns when setting requirements.  
� 
Nuisance and amenity (4.14): the relationship with common law 
nuisance, statutory nuisance, and the importance to be attached by 
the SoS to their consideration during the determination process, 
are set out.  
� 
Security (4.15): government policy is set out as being ‘to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures 
are designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in 
the project development’ with documentary requirements and 
relationships to other guidance set out. 
2.4.9 
As well as generic assessment principles, EN-1 also identifies a 
generic list of impacts which could arise from an energy NSIP. These 
specific topics include ecology, landscape, noise and socio-economics.

- 30 - 
 
These topics have been discussed in more detail when describing the 
assessment of impacts in Section 5 of this Scoping Report.  
2.4.10 
NPS EN-2 outlines considerations and factors relating to site selection 
and design for developers for fossil fuel generating stations, although it 
states that these concerns must be considered by the applicant, and 
that: ‘…the Government does not seek to direct applicants to particular 
sites for fossil fuel generating stations.’ 
2.4.11 
NPS EN-4 sets government policy on the relevant considerations and 
factors that should be taken into account as to route selection for 
developers for gas supply infrastructure and gas pipelines, along with 
likely impacts of their construction, commissioning and operation.  
2.4.12 
NPS EN-5 provides the primary basis for decisions taken by PINS on 
applications it receives for electricity networks infrastructure, the 
relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into account 
related to route selection for developers, along with likely impacts of 
their construction, commissioning and operation. 
2.5 
National Planning Policy Framework for England (NPPF) - 2012 
2.5.1 
The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the Government’s 
planning policies for England and how these are expected to be 
applied. National policy statements form part of the overall framework 
of national planning policy, and are material consideration in decisions 
on planning applications. 
2.5.2 
The NPPF sets sustainable development at the core of its guidelines. 
Policies set in paragraphs 18-219, taken as a whole constitute the 
Government’s view of what sustainable development in England means 
in practice for the planning system. 
2.5.3 
The NPPF focuses its interpretation of sustainable development into 
three dimensions: economic, social and environmental.  
2.5.4 
A set of 12 ‘Core planning principles’ are also set out in the NPPF. 
Paragraph 17 states that planning should ‘support the transition to a 
low carbon future in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk 
and coastal change, and encourage the reuse of existing resources, 
including conversion of existing buildings, and encourage the use of 
renewable resources (for example, by the development of renewable 
energy).’  
2.5.5 
As part of delivering a sustainable development, the NPPF presents 13 
different thematic titles setting out distinct ways in which Government 
expects planning and developers to achieve the 12 core land use

Local Planning Policy 
Mid Suffolk District Council Local Development Framework (LDF) 
2.6.1 
The Local Development Framework (LDF) is a portfolio created by the 
Council that contains the local planning documents for the District. Of 
the documents contained in this portfolio, the most relevant are the 
DPDs including the Core Strategy DPD which provide formal, adopted 
objectives and policies that will be used to guide future development in 
the District over the plan period. 
Core Strategy DPD

2.6.2 
The Mid Suffolk Core Strategy DPD was adopted in September 2008. 
This document is the key DPD and ‘sets out the vision, objectives, 
spatial strategy and core policies that will guide development across 
the district until 2025 and beyond’. The Core Strategy and other LDF 
documents are key components in the delivery of the Community 
Strategy (2004) for the District, particularly those elements that relate to 
the development and use of land. Following a review carried out in late 
2012, the adopted Core Strategy DPD should be read in conjunction 
with the ‘Core Strategy Focused Review (December 2012)’.

2.6.3 
The ‘Overall Spatial Vision’ of the Core Strategy DPD states: ‘By 2021 
the East of England will be realising its economic potential and 
providing a high quality of life for its people, including by meeting their 
housing needs in sustainable inclusive communities. At the same time 
it will reduce its impact on climate change and the environment, 
including through savings in energy and water use and by 
strengthening its stock of environmental assets.’ 
2.6.4 
The following objectives of the Core Strategy DPD relate to the PPP: 
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 1 – To protect, manage, enhance and 
restore the landscape, biodiversity and geodiversity of the District. 
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 2 – To seek to improve water quality 
and reduce pollution to the wider environment. 
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 3 – To respond to the possible harm 
caused by climate change Mid Suffolk will seek to minimise its 
carbon footprint, by encouraging a shift to more sustainable travel 
patterns. In particular the Council will address congestion and 
pollution and ensure that all new development minimises its carbon 
emissions, and carbon consumption and is adapted to future 
climate change.  
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 4 – To protect, manage, enhance and 
restore the historic heritage / environment and the unique character 
and identity of the towns and villages by ensuring that new 
developments are appropriate in terms of scale and location in the 
context of settlement form and character. 
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 5 – Reinforce the vitality and viability of 
local shops, schools, services, recreating and community facilities 
in towns and key service centres and primary villages. 
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 7 – To support sustainable 
communities by locating development where it will enable people to 
access jobs and key services, such as education, health, recreation 
and other facilities recognising and respecting the diversity in the 
function and character of Mid Suffolk’s towns, key service centres 
and primary and secondary villages and countryside.  
� 
Core Strategy Objective SO 11 – To support the growth of the local 
economy and rural regeneration in ways which are compatible with 
environmental objectives, and which deliver increased prosperity 
for the whole community.

Development 
Management Policies 
2.6.6 
The Development Management Policies (DMP) have yet to be 
developed by the Council. Development was put on hold due to other 
LDF commitments and changes in staff resources.  
2.6.7 
In the meantime a number of Saved Policies of the Mid Suffolk District 
Council Local Plan (1998) continue to be used for determining planning 
applications until replaced by development management / site 
allocations DPDs. Those of potential relevance to the PPP include 
Policies E2 (Industrial uses on allocated sites) and E3 (Warehousing, 
storage, distribution, and haulage depots). It should be borne in mind 
that paragraphs 214-215 of the NPPF (2012) require that pre-2004 
local planning policies are only applied insofar as they accord with the 
NPPF. 
2.6.8 
It is understood that when finalised and adopted, the Development 
Management Policies will set out the proposed approach and detailed 
policies for controlling development and delivering the vision, objectives 
and core policies in the Core Strategy. As such, it will play a role in 
determining planning applications. Work is ongoing on developing joint 
Development Management Policies between Babergh and Mid Suffolk 
District Council.  
Eye Airfield Development Framework (February 2013 post-
consultation draft) 
2.6.9 
Whilst not yet possessing formal status within the LDF, the draft EADF 
seeks to provide the Council’s interpretation of the Core Strategy and 
other policies as they relate to Eye Airfield and provide additional 
baseline information. The intention is to guide investment and provide a 
framework for the Council’s consideration of planning proposals for 
development as they come forward.  
2.6.10 
The status of the EADF and its role in development management will 
partly depend on the delivery mechanism chosen by the Mid Suffolk 
District Council.

2.6.11 
Reflecting the Mid Suffolk Core Strategy, the Framework reconfirms 
Eye Airfield’s importance as an employment area, providing jobs in 
manufacturing, as well as logistics and other B1, B2 and B8 uses. 
Different areas of the site are proposed for varying types of 
development, including; business, residential, energy, ‘common’/open 
space, allotments and agricultural. An indicative masterplan showing 
the arrangement of proposed land uses is provided.  
2.6.12 
The EADF has been informed by various stages of consultation with 
local businesses, land owners, stakeholders and residents. A number 
of aspirations were identified during consultation including: 
� 
development that is sustainable and landscape led; 
� 
the creation of on-site energy generation opportunities for new 
business; 
� 
a focus on improving skills for young people, including establishing 
links to local secondary schools. 
2.6.13 
The centre of the site has been proposed for energy producing 
developments, which should be ‘appropriate provided they meet 
environmental criteria that ensure a good quality of life for all around 
them’.  
2.7 
Other Relevant Policy and Guidance 
2.7.1 
The following are considered to be potentially relevant policy and 
guidance in considering the potential impact of the PPP:  
� 
The Electricity Market Reform (2012);  
� 
Natural Environment White Paper (2012); 
� 
Biodiversity 2020: A strategy for England’s wildlife and ecosystem 
services (2011); 
� 
The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) (2012); 
� 
Gas Generation Strategy (2012); and 
� 
Suffolk Growth Strategy (2013).  
2.7.2 
A comprehensive review of potentially relevant policy and evidence will 
be undertaken during the pre application process. 
The Electricity Market Reform (2012) 
2.7.3 
The Electricity Market Reform (EMR) has been developed to meet 
three main objectives: 
� 
Ensuring the future security of electricity supplies;

� 
Driving the decarbonisation of electricity generation; and 
� 
Minimising costs to consumers. 
2.7.4 
These measures are designed to provide both technical and economic 
encouragement for an increase in the development of low carbon 
technologies.  
2.7.5 
In terms of the proposed PPP, one of the most relevant aims of the 
EMR is to provide ‘.... a mechanism to support security of supply, if 
needed, in the form of a Capacity Market’.  
2.7.6 
Although the EMR focuses heavily on the need for decarbonisation, 
there is also a strong focus on the need for security of supply and a mix 
of energy generation technologies on line at any one time. The EMR 
also recognises that gas fired power generation will continue to play a 
crucial role in the UK energy mix going forward.  
2.7.7 
The Energy Bill will be the primary piece of legislation to come about as 
a result of the EMR although it is currently at Committee Stage in the 
House of Commons. The Energy Bill seeks to enact the key drivers that 
are necessary to achieve the recommendations set out in the EMR.  
Natural Environment White Paper (2012) 
2.7.8 
This document outlines the Government’s vision for the natural 
environment over the next 50 years. The paper makes the case that a 
healthy, properly functioning natural environment is the foundation of 
sustained economic growth, prospering communities and personal 
wellbeing. 
2.7.9 
The paper focuses on protecting and improving the UK’s natural 
environment, encouraging a green economy, the importance of 
reconnecting with people and nature and refers to International and EU 
leadership on these matters. 
Biodiversity 2020: A strategy for England’s wildlife and ecosystem 
services 
2.7.10 
This document builds on the Natural Environment White Paper for 
England and provides a comprehensive picture of how England is 
implementing local international and EU commitments. It sets out the 
strategic direction for biodiversity policy for the next decade on land, 
rivers, lakes and the sea.

number of key themes identified in the CCRA 2012, including; 
infrastructure, business, natural environment and industry. It describes 
the policy context, and action already in place to tackle some of the 
risks in each area. It highlights the constraints of the CCRA analysis 
and provides advice on how to take account of the uncertainty within 
the analysis. 
Gas Generation Strategy (2012) 
2.7.12 
The Gas Generation Strategy sets out the Government’s view on the 
need for gas energy generation and how the UK will address barriers to 
help build investor confidence and encourage the new capacity that the 
government will need over the coming years. It sets out the required 
work to maintain gas supply security and ensure that the best use of 
this natural resource is implemented. 
Suffolk Growth Strategy (2013) 
2.7.13 
The Suffolk Growth Strategy seeks to help develop a ‘coordinated 
economic strategy which sets out how Suffolk will create more, higher 
value, high skill jobs and increase wealth across the county’.  
2.7.14 
The Strategy also analyses strengths and weaknesses of the Suffolk 
economy, places a spotlight on the challenges and opportunities ahead 
and defines how the county, district and borough councils will work 
together with local partners to create the right conditions for business 
growth.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
3.1 
Overview of the Development 
3.1.1 
The proposed Power Generation Plant would be situated on land within 
the former World War Two Eye Airfield, approximately 1.7 km north 
west of Eye village, 1.3 km west of Langton Green and approximately 
1.5 km north east of Yaxley, Mid Suffolk. The approximate site grid 
reference is 613239, 275109. The Power Generation Plant would be 
located on land currently in agricultural use.  
3.1.2 
The Gas Connection would run from the Power Generation Plant 
connecting into Feeder 5 on the gas NTS which runs to the south and 
east of the site. This connection route will be between 200m and 2km in 
length dependant on the final route. Further details of the potential 
routes are provided in Section 3.4. 
3.1.3 
The Electrical Connection would connect the Power Generation Plant 
to a new substation located either within the Power Generation Plant 
site, or adjacent to the 400 kV infrastructure located approximately 
1.5km west of the site, and which runs between the Bramford and 
Norwich Main substations.  
3.1.4 
If the substation is constructed on site, power will be exported to the 
National Grid via a 400 kV line (overhead or underground), to a SEC at 
the 400 kV infrastructure.  
3.1.5 
If the substation is located off site, it would be constructed by National 
Grid Company (NGC), while the connection between the Power 
Generation Plant site will be constructed as part of the project as a 
400kV underground cable or overhead line.  
3.1.6 
Figure 2 shows a potential plant layout and likely maximum site extent 
for the Power Generation Plant, while Figure 3 shows potential Gas 
Connection route corridor options and opportunity area of the Electrical 
Connection.

3.2 
Site and Surroundings 
3.2.1 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is situated within the Eye 
Airfield industrial area and covers an area of approximately 10 ha. The 
Eye Airfield area accommodates several industrial parks, including: 
Brome Industrial Estate (to the north), Eye Airfield Industrial Estate (to 
the north-east), Mid Suffolk Business Park (to the east) and Oaksmere 
Business Park (to the west). The site is situated within a larger 
triangular area directly to the east of the former ‘main runway’ and north 
of the former SW-NE runway.  
3.2.2 
The site is entirely within the jurisdiction of Mid Suffolk District Council. 
The Council area includes Stowmarket Urban District, Gipping Rural 
District, Hartismere Rural District and Thedwastre Rural District. These 
areas comprise a mixture of urban, semi-urban and rural communities. 
3.2.3 
The Power Generation Plant site and immediate surrounding area is 
characterised by the remnants of the airfield, including the runway and 
the access roads. Buildings that once formed part of the airfield have 
been replaced by industrial units accommodating various industrial 
activities including a power generation facility (the 12.7 MW Eye 
Chicken Litter Power Plant) and a gas compressor station. Additionally, 
there are two large wind turbines (Roy Humphrey Group wind farm) 
<200 m to the north west of the proposed development area. Two more 
wind turbines have received planning permission and these will be 
constructed to the south of the site at Baldwin Farm.  
3.2.4 
The proposed area for development is comprised of greenfield 
agricultural land surrounded by a belt of trees to the east. Much of the 
land found within the site is available for industrial development and is 
being promoted as such by Mid Suffolk District Council. 
3.2.5 
The site is accessed from a private road to the south, Potash Lane, 
which in turn connects to Castleton Way, via the former main runway. 
Castleton Way provides connectivity to either from the B1077 to the 
east and the A140 to the west. The A140 is the main road between 
Norwich and Ipswich (each some 30 km away) and provides onward 
connectivity to the A14, about 20 km to the south. The A140 runs 
approximately 360 m north from the site boundary at its closest point. 
The closest point of the B1077 to the site is approximately 460 m east. 
3.2.6 
The road network in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant can be 
seen in Figure 1. 
3.2.7 
The Broads ESA (Environmentally Sensitive Area) is located to the 
north and east of the site. To the north, the ESA is approximately 2.7 
km from the site perimeter, while it lies approximately 1.1 km from the

sites eastern edge. Burgate ancient and semi-natural woodland is 
located approximately 5.5 km west of the site. The Pennings Local 
Nature Reserve is located approximately 2.3 km to the south east.  
3.2.8 
The closest residential receptors include;  
� 
Residential properties located to the east, north of Eye and 
adjacent to the B1077 (� 480 m from the closest point of the site); 
� 
Residential properties located to the south west of the site adjacent 
to Old Norwich road (� 700 m from the closest point of the site); 
� 
Farm located to the north west of the site (approximately 810 m 
from the closest point of the site); and 
� 
Houses and static holiday homes to the north of the site, adjacent 
to the B1077 (� 750 m from the closest point of the site). 
3.2.9 
The land within the Eye Airfield has been designated as a Strategic Site 
for development by Mid Suffolk District Council. As stated earlier in 
Section 2.6, a draft Framework for the future Development of Eye 
Airfield has been produced (the draft EADF). The EADF includes an 
indicative masterplan for the Airfield and has been developed after 
stakeholder engagement at various stages during its production. The 
EADF 
seeks 
to 
encourage 
residential, 
business, 
energy 
production/waste management, ‘common’/open spaces, recreational, 
allotment and agricultural developments. 
3.2.10 
The area indicatively identified for energy generation development 
within the EADF is approximately 10 ha, of which approximately 5 ha 
would be used for the Power Generation Plant. 
3.3 
Description of the Power Generation Plant Options 
3.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide a total output 
of up to 299 MWe (gross capacity) at rated site conditions.  
3.3.2 
The choice of plant and technology have not yet been finalised and are 
still the focus of ongoing technical studies. Plant choice will also be 
driven by the outcome of the EMR (previously discussed in section 2 of 
this Report). Further studies will ensure that the most suitable plant is 
selected for the site taking into consideration local constraints and the 
ultimate operational regime of the plant. However, it is known at this 
stage that the project would either comprise a Combined Cycle Gas 
Turbine (CCGT) plant, a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant or a 
reciprocating gas ignition engine (RGE) plant. Additionally, under 
certain circumstances it may be that two types of technology are used 
at the site at any one time. The ability to utilise CHP to supply local 
users with waste heat from the plant is also being investigated, as

outlined later in this Section of the Report. A description of how each of 
these technologies operate and the key differences between them are 
provided below.  
3.3.3 
Although the choice of plant may vary, the scope and methodology of 
the EIA, as set out in Sections 4 and 5 of this Report will not differ 
significantly between different plant and technology choices. There will 
be some key differences between the plant configuration for each 
technology type (e.g. water usage and stack height) and where these 
will impact on the assessment methodology, this has been drawn out 
below.  
3.3.4 
Additionally, it is noted that no matter which technology choice is 
selected, they are all able to fit within the Power Generation Plant site 
boundary shown in Figures 1 and 2. All of the potential technology 
choices would also fall within identified ‘maximum adverse’ scenarios 
for potential environmental impacts which will be assessed as part of 
the EIA. A range of indicative dimensions of main plant items are 
provided in Table 3.1 below, which may be reduced depending upon 
the outcome of further studies and consultation, and depending upon 
final design and plant choices. . 
CCGT Plant 
3.3.5 
If a CCGT plant is chosen for the Power Generation Plant, the 
configuration of the plant would comprise of a gas turbine(s) (GT) 
fuelled by natural gas, a heat recovery steam generator(s) (HRSG) 
utilising heat from the GT exhaust gases, and a steam turbine plant 
with associated condensing system.  
3.3.6 
Natural gas is burnt in the combustors of each GT, utilising the air that 
is compressed by the compressor section of the GT. The hot gases 
expand through the turbine section of the GT to drive the compressor 
section and to generate electricity. The hot exhaust gases are then 
routed through the HRSG to generate steam, which in turn is used to 
generate electricity via the steam turbine plant. 
3.3.7 
After the useful heat has been extracted from the exhaust gases in the 
HRSG, the flue gas enters the stack where it rises to be released to 
atmosphere at height for dispersion. A bypass stack may be employed 
between the GT and the HRSG to allow for simple cycle (GT only) 
operation where required. 
3.3.8 
Spent steam leaving the steam turbine plant passes to a condenser 
where it is condensed. The resultant condensate is returned to the 
HRSG for reuse as boiler feed water, closing the water/steam cycle.

3.3.9 
The gas turbines would be equipped with standard proven emissions 
control technology, which would limit the production of NOx to ensure 
that the plant meets all relevant guidelines and legislation.  
3.3.10 
Natural gas in the UK (where sulphur content in the gas is generally 
negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the particulate 
or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; consequently flue 
gas cleaning equipment is not required.  
3.3.11 
To achieve the condensing of the spent steam, dry air cooling utilising 
an Air Cooled Condenser (ACC) is proposed. This cooling system 
results in significantly lower water usage by the plant than if cooling 
towers were employed.  
3.3.12 
In utilising an ACC, the spent steam leaving the steam turbine passes 
through ductwork to the top of the ACC, where it is distributed to a 
multiplicity of tubes for condensation. Ambient air is forced past the 
tubes by motor-driven fans and the heat of the condensation process is 
transferred to the air. The use of an ACC means that there is no need 
for cooling towers or a once-through cooling water system, thereby 
minimising the plant’s net water consumption and water abstraction 
requirements.  
3.3.13 
An ACC is typically taller and narrower than an equivalent duty forced 
draught cooling tower, but it bears no risk of visible plume formation 
from the cooling system.  
3.3.14

SCGT Plant  
3.3.15 
In essence, the configuration of a simple cycle gas turbine (SCGT) 
plant consists of the front end of a CCGT plant. SCGT plants usually 
use aero-derivative GTs, primarily because of their suitability to 
frequent starts, high SCGT efficiency and high-availability maintenance 
options.  
3.3.16 
As with CCGT plants, natural gas is burnt in the combustors of each 
GT, utilising the air that is compressed by the compressor section of 
the GT. The hot gases expand through the turbine section of the GT to 
drive the compressor section and to generate electricity. However, the 
hot exhaust gases are then routed directly to the stack, which contains 
a silencer to reduce noise pollution. 
3.3.17 
The stack for an SCGT plant is usually significantly shorter than the 
main stack of a CCGT plant because the flue gases are much hotter 
and therefore do not typically require the same height needed for 
adequate dispersion.  
3.3.18 
The gas turbines would be equipped with standard proven emissions 
control technology, which limits the production of NOx to a maximum of 
50 mg/Nm3 (corrected  to  15%  O2 dry). Whether by water injection or 
dry low emission combustors, these techniques represents BAT for 
limiting emissions of NOx to atmosphere from gas turbines without the 
addition of chemical solutions, such as selective catalytic reduction 
using ammonia. 
3.3.19 
Once again, natural gas in the UK (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; 
consequently flue gas cleaning equipment is not required. 
3.3.20 
Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of SCGT plants are significantly lower than for CCGT 
plants. The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, etc.) 
would be met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan coolers.  
3.3.21 
Insert 2 shows a simple schematic of SCGT operation.

Insert 2 - Schematic of SCGT Operation 
 
Reciprocating Gas Engine Plant 
3.3.22 
The configuration of a large Reciprocating Gas Engine (RGE) plant is 
similar to that of an SCGT plant. It consists of modular reciprocating 
gas engine generator units, typically below 20 MW each, which operate 
using the ignition of gaseous fuels and air in a specific mix which 
causes motion of a piston to generate electricity. New plants generally 
have a high net plant electrical efficiency of over 45%, which is greater 
than any SCGT plant, although lower than a CCGT plant (typical 
efficiency of 55-60%). Full plant output is maintained over a range of 
ambient temperatures and barometric pressures (altitudes). 
3.3.23 
Natural gas is burnt in the cylinders of the multi-cylinder RGEs, utilising 
the air that is first pressurised by the turbo charger(s) of each RGE and 
then compressed by the pistons. Four-stroke, medium-speed, lean-
burn gas engines that utilise either spark ignition or pilot injection to 
initiate combustion are employed. In the case of pilot injection, a small 
quantity of compression ignition fuel (such as diesel) is required. As a 
result of the piston being utilised to compress the combustion air and 
gas fuel mixture, there is a low gas fuel supply pressure requirement.  
3.3.24 
The size of the stacks for an RGE plant is similar to that for a SCGT 
plant even though the exhaust gas flow rate of the RGE plant is lower 
than the equivalent SCGT plant. This is because the flues from several 
engines are combined into a single stack-like structure. The flue gas

temperature is slightly lower but of a similar order to aeroderivative GTs 
and thus stack heights are generally similar to SCGT plants. 
3.3.25 
Gas engines produce a higher amount of NOx than GTs, up to 
500 mg/Nm3 (corrected  to  5%  O2 dry). Therefore, for the PPP there 
may be a requirement to install Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to 
treat the engine exhaust gas to reduce the NOx emissions to required 
levels.  
3.3.26 
Once again, natural gas in the UK (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; 
consequently flue gas cleaning equipment (beyond that of SCR, 
potentially) is not required. 
3.3.27 
Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of RGE plants are significantly lower than for CCGT 
plants. The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, jacket 
cooling, etc.) are met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan 
coolers.  
3.3.28 
Unlike SCGT plants, there is no potential for boosting power output 
using water injection, so the total plant water requirement is negligible. 
Laydown Area 
3.3.29 
A laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction will be incorporated within the redline boundary of the 
Power Generation Plant shown in Figures 1 and 2. It is not proposed

3.3.32 
Maximum Power Generation Plant site dimensions will be in the order 
of 2.4ha, which is enough space to fit in all of the technologies 
considered. 
Construction, Operational and Decommissioning Timescales 
3.3.33 
Construction and commissioning of the PPP will take approximately 12 
to 36 months, depending on the final choice of plant technology 
selected. 
3.3.34 
The main works associated with the construction phase would be the 
removal of hardstanding, excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations, potential piling (if required) and the laying of the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection.  
3.3.35 
The construction of RGE / SCGT plant would most likely involve the 
least site preparation and construction time, as the units are often 
available as complete packaged units which can be delivered to the site 
and installed relatively quickly. The construction period for a CCGT 
plant could be significantly longer (of the order of 36 months) as more 
tailored plant items are required which will require on-site assembly, as 
well as more permanent structures and larger quantities of pipework 
and interconnections.  
3.3.36 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to have an operational 
life of 25 years, after which time it will be decommissioned or re-
powered depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy 
mix at the time. For the purposes of the EIA, it will be assumed that the 
Power Generation Plant will be decommissioned. 
3.3.37 
Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation 
Plant items and restoration of the Power Generation Plant site to a 
similar condition as to when the site was taken over by PPL. It is likely 
that some underground structures, including the Electrical and Gas 
Connections may be left in situ to avoid any adverse environmental 
impacts associated with their removal. Due regard would be paid to all 
best practice guidelines on the decommissioning of projects which are 
relevant at the time. Where possible, items of plant would be re-cycled 
or re-used.  
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS) 
3.3.38 
The PPP will be designed to provide a total output of up to 299 
Megawatts Electrical (MWe) (gross capacity) at rated site conditions. 
Directive 2009 /31/EC on the Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide 
(CO2) requires an amendment to Directive 2001/80/EC (Large

Combustion Plant Directive) and subsequently Directive 2010/75/EU 
(the Industrial Emissions Directive) such that member states are to 
ensure that operators of all combustion plants with an electrical output 
of 300MWe or more have assessed the feasibility of; storage sites, 
transport facilities and economic considerations of the capture of CO2 
produced as a result of the combustion process.  
3.3.39 
As this does not apply to plants which are sized below 300MWe, in the 
context of the PPP it is not necessary to assess the viability of CO2 
capture and this is not considered further in this Report.  
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
3.3.40 
Plants which have a CHP capability supply power to the National Grid, 
but also supply heat to local businesses through a direct connection to 
waste heat / steam produced as part of the combustion process. As 
noted at section 4.6 of NPS EN-1, the UK Government seeks that 
applicants give early consideration to CHP viability. 
3.3.41 
Given that it is possible that the Power Generation Plant would be 
designed to operate as a flexible plant, which could be called upon to 
operate at any time of the day, the heat production available for an off-
taker cannot be defined with any certainty.  
3.3.42 
Notwithstanding these constraints, CHP has not been ruled out and is 
still the subject of active ongoing consultations and investigation to 
confirm its technical and economic potential, in the light of other 
planned development at the Industrial Estate and a further update and 
assessment as necessary will be provided in the DCO application, in 
accordance with Section 4.6 of NPS EN-1 (Consideration of Combined 
Heat and Power (CHP)).  
3.4 
Description of the Gas Connection and Corridor Options 
3.4.1 
The UK National Grid Gas system is split into two parts, the NTS and 
the LTS (Local Transmission System). 
3.4.2 
The NTS represents the infrastructure designed to transmit gas large 
distances around the country, these are generally large diameter 
pipelines (> 24”/600mm) operating at high pressure (~70barg). The 
NTS is the backbone of the UK gas infrastructure and as such does not 
reach all points of mainland Britain; the load driven extremities are 
covered by the LTS. 
3.4.3 
The LTS distributes the gas supply from the NTS to the locations where 
the load requirement is required, these are generally smaller pipelines 
(< 24”/600mm diameter) operating at lower pressure (< 50barg).

3.4.4 
A Gas Connection Feasibility study was undertaken for the PPP in April 
2013. The purpose of the study was to define and evaluate the options 
available for connecting the Power Generation Plant to a suitable 
source of fuel gas, and provide a recommendation on the most 
appropriate option for this connection. 
3.4.5 
Preliminary pipeline calculations were performed, including Maximum 
Operating Pressure of the system, Maximum Incidental Pressure, Pipe 
Nominal Diameter, Design Factor, Wall Thickness, Minimum Building 
Proximity Distance and Area Classification; 
3.4.6 
A Crossing / Risk Register has been prepared for each potential 
corridor routeing. A Level 1 Route Study has been performed for this 
report, which has analysed a specified relevant area of interest for 
archaeological, natural and built environment issues having regard to 
considerations raised in NPS EN-4. 
3.4.7 
Four connection points have been identified as being potentially 
suitable locations to connect into the NTS infrastructure. These options 
connect to Feeder 5, a 600mm high pressure steel pipeline that passes 
from Yelverton to Stowmarket. No suitable connections were identified 
to the LTS.  
3.4.8 
The Location of Feeder 5 and the possible connection location options 
are shown below in Insert 3.

3.4.9 
Discussions with NGC have confirmed that presently there is currently 
enough capacity in Feeder 5 to accommodate the loads associated 
with the development of a 299 MWe plant at Eye.  
3.4.10 
There are five route corridor options that are potentially suitable to 
connect into the four points shown in Insert 3. The routes have been 
selected to include a minimal amount of crossings (water, road and rail) 
over the shortest feasible distance. Preliminary route calculations have 
suggested that a steel pipeline 200 mm nominal outside diameter with 
a standard wall thickness of 6.4 mm would be appropriate for this 
project, the easement on the pipe would be between 10 – 30 m, and 
would be buried to a minimum depth of 1.1 m. 
Gas Connection Corridor Option 1 
3.4.11 
The 1st route corridor option (Route 1) shown in Insert 4 is 
approximately 0.1 km in length including no major crossings of any 
type. 
3.4.12 
The pipeline begins at the Power Generation Plant site heading east 
out of the site directly into the NGC Gas Compressor Station located 
adjacent to the site.  
3.4.13 
This option provides the shortest possible route and potentially has the 
least impact on the area and surrounding environment, but could have 
further technical complications.

Gas Connection Corridor Option 2 
3.4.14 
The 2nd route corridor option (Route 2) shown in Insert 5 is 
approximately 0.6 km in length and contains just 1 minor road crossing. 
3.4.15 
The route begins at the south edge of the Power Generation Plant site, 
immediately crossing the access track that boarders to southern edge 
of the site, and entering the agriculture field to the south. From here, 
the route would pass around the south of the consented wind turbine 
before traversing west, along the northern edge of the field and 
terminating south of the Gas Compressor Station where a new Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) would be situated outside of the NG land 
holding, on the south side of the access track. 
3.4.16 
This route is required in case it is not possible to connect directly into 
the Gas Compressor Station from the west, and is designed to ensure 
a safe working distance from the proposed wind turbines that are likely 
to be constructed to the south of the project site in the near future. 
3.4.17 
There are two minor variations on this route, which are also being 
considered and are shown in Insert 5 below. The first variation (2a) 
passes through the NG land, but then crosses the access track to the 
south, to connect into a new AGI as described above. The second (2b) 
exits the Power Generation Plant site to the south, immediately 
crossing the access track and passing a safe distance between the two 
consented wind turbines to connect into the distribution network at a 
separate connection point along the southern edge of the agricultural 
field.

3.4.18 
The 3rd route corridor option (Route 3) shown in Insert 6 is 
approximately 850 m in length and includes 2 minor road crossings. 
3.4.19 
The route begins at the south west corner of the Power Generation 
Plant site, immediately crossing Potash Lane. The route then follows 
the western edge of Potash Lane to its southern extent, from where the 
it crosses back over the road north of Castleton Way. Heading east for 
a further 150 m, the route enters a agricultural field and would 
terminate at a new AGI. 
3.4.20 
This route is designed to ensure a safe working distance from the 
proposed wind turbines that are likely to be constructed to the south of 
the project site.

The 4th route corridor option (Route 4) shown in Insert 7 is 
approximately 1.5 km in length and includes just 2 minor road 
crossings. 
3.4.22 
The route begins at the south west corner of the Power Generation 
Plant site, immediately crossing Potash Lane. The route would then 
traverse west, along the northern edge of the agricultural field located

west of Potash Lane, crossing a small track and continuing west until it 
meets the A140. At this point the route turns south to follow the eastern 
edge of the A140 until it meets Castleton Way. From here the route 
heads east, along the southern edge of the agricultural field, crossing 
Potash Lane again before entering the field to the north of Castleton 
Way where a new AGI would be situated.

The final route corridor option (Route 5) shown in  
3.4.24 
Insert 8 is approximately 1.6 km in length and includes 2 minor road 
crossings. 
3.4.25 
The route would exit the Power Generation Plant Site from its western 
boundary and head west, immediately crossing Potash Lane. It would 
continue west, to the north of the SpeedDeck Building Systems Limited 
buildings, before heading south approximately 30 m east of the A140. 
Heading south along the western edge of the fields that border the 
A140, the route continues for approximately 650 m before turning east, 
north of Castleton Way. From here the route heads east, along the 
southern edge of the agricultural field, crossing Potash Lane again, 
before entering the field to the north of Castleton Way where a new AGI 
would be situated.

3.4.26 
All of these route corridors are shown together on Figure 3. It is noted 
that Figure 3, and the above plans show large buffers or potential areas 
in which each route may be developed. This is due to the fact that no 
detailed studies have yet been undertaken to assess constraints. 
However, following more detailed studies, the route choices will be 
refined as the project progresses and the options narrowed to a single 
route corridor option.  
3.4.27 
Connection to the NTS at any high pressure pipeline would require two 
above ground facilities to be installed, a Minimum Offtake Connection 
(MOC) facility, which would be owned by NGC, and a PIG Trap Facility 
(PTF) which will be owned by PPL. The two facilities would contain the 
following pieces of equipment. 
The MOC (approximately 30x30m) would contain: 
� 
Remotely Operable Valve (ROV); 
� 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk; 
� 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
PTF (approximately 30x23m) would contain: 
� 
PIG launching facility;

� 
Emergency Control Valve; 
� 
Isolation Valve; 
�

� 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.28 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at a PTF on the Progress 
Power Generation Plant site. This facility would contain the following 
equipment: 
� 
PIG receiving facility; 
� 
Isolation Valve; and 
� 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk.  
3.4.29 
The gas pipeline would be designed, constructed and tested to comply 
with the Institute of Gas Engineers’ (IGE) Recommendations on 
Transmission and Distribution Practice – IGE/TD/1: Edition 5, 2009 - 
Steel Pipelines and Associated Installations for High Pressure Gas 
Transmission (IGE/TD/1). 
3.4.30 
The standard gas pipeline wall thickness would comply with the 
requirements of IGE/TD/1, which defines the minimum safe separation 
distance between a high pressure gas pipeline and normally inhabited 
buildings / major roads / major railways. This minimum safe separation 
distance is known as the Building Proximity Distance (BPD). If normally 
inhabited buildings / major roads / major railways are closer than 1 BPD 
(i.e. the gas pipeline is in an area where additional protection is 
required), thicker wall steel pipe (known as proximity pipe) would be 
used. The exact locations and lengths of where thicker wall steel pipe 
will be used will be confirmed throughout the assessment and detailed 
design stages. 
3.4.31 
The gas pipeline would be buried to a depth of cover which is in 
accordance with recognised industry standards. For example, depths of 
cover would be: 
� 
No less than 1.2 m in agricultural land; 
� 
No less than 2 m under road crossings; and 
� 
No less than 1.7 m under water crossings. 
3.5 
Description of the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area 
3.5.1 
A new connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Power Generation Plant to be exported to the electricity 
transmission network.

3.5.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Power 
Generation Plant site in April 2013. The assessments analysed the 
transmission and distribution grid connection options and determined 
the available thermal and fault level capacity on the electrical network. 
Discussions were also held with the NGC.  
3.5.3 
Following discussions with NGC it is proposed that the most suitable 
point of connection for the PPP is a new substation to be located along 
the line of the existing 400 kV overhead line that runs between 
Bramford and Norwich Main substations.  
3.5.4 
At present, specific route corridor options for an underground cable or 
overhead line that would be suitable to connect into the 400 kV 
overhead line located to the west of the Power Generation Plant site, 
have not yet been identified.  
3.5.5 
An Opportunity Area has been identified to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant site in which it is likely that the electrical connection 
route corridors will be situated, and investigations to identify specific 
routes are ongoing. All potential routes will be selected to include a 
minimal amount of crossings (water, road and rail) over the shortest 
feasible distance to minimise potential environmental impacts, as well 
as visual impacts on local sensitive receptors. Further details of the 
specific routes being considered will be provided to consultees when 
they are available.  
3.5.6 
The Opportunity Area for the Electrical Connection is shown in Figure 3 
and described below.  
3.5.7 
Indicative routes for potential overhead lines have not yet been 
finalised, but would likely fall within the overall footprint of the 
Opportunity Area. If an overhead line is required, it is also likely that the 
tower heights would range between 35 m and 60 m depending on final 
design requirements, each standard span would be approximately 360 
m, and the substation height would be limited to 12.5 m.

Routes for the Electrical Connection, be it underground or overhead, 
will likely pass under or over the area to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant site, that has been identified as the ‘Opportunity Area’ 
(Insert 9).  
3.5.9 
This area is made up primarily of agricultural farm land, with a number 
of small watercourses, ponds, hedgerows and fences. It is dissected 
north to south by the A140, and bordered to the north and south by the

villages of Thrandeston and Yaxley respectively. The area is crossed 
by a number of public rights of way and also contains a number of 
standalone farms and residential properties, all of which will be 
carefully considered in the final route of the connection.

Site Selection / Design Evolution  
3.6.1 
The choice of the Power Generation Plant site for the development of a 
299MWe gas fired power station has been the subject of feasibility 
studies undertaken by PPL over a number of months. Over 600 sites 
have been assessed for their suitability of supporting the development 
of a project of this size. These site selection studies have assessed a 
number of relevant factors, such as those set out in paragraph 4.4.1 of 
NPS EN-1, in considering a suitable location for the development of a 
plant of this size and type.  
3.6.2 
NPS EN-2 also outlines considerations and factors influencing site 
selection by developers for fossil fuel generating stations, although it 
states that these concerns must be considered by the applicant, and 
that: ‘…the Government does not seek to direct applicants to particular 
sites for fossil fuel generating stations.’ 
3.6.3 
Some of the factors included in the selection of the site at Eye are:

� 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure (draft EADF); 
� 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Electrical Connection point;  
� 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Gas Connection point; 
� 
It is in an industrial setting surrounded by other power generation 
plant (wind turbines and Energy From Waste plant), thereby limiting 
potential impacts on landscape and visual amenity of surrounding 
areas; 
� 
It has a well developed road network and site access; and 
� 
There is more than adequate space to develop the Power 
Generation Plant.  
3.6.4 
As stated in Section 3.2 of this Report, the final plant technology choice 
has not yet been determined and is the ongoing subject of more 
detailed engineering and design studies. These studies will ensure that 
the most suitable plant will be chosen for the site, taking into 
consideration design and environmental considerations, amongst 
others.  
3.6.5 
Similarly, the final route of the Gas Connection has not yet been 
determined, and is the subject of ongoing studies. A feasibility study for 
the Gas Connection has already been undertaken which has narrowed 
down the potential connection options to two separate locations on the 
NTS Feeder 5, with a possible five different route corridors to tie in to 
these connection points.  
3.6.6 
The final choice of Gas and Electrical Connection route corridors will be 
selected following further consultation and a more thorough 
assessment of constraints and environmental impacts.  
3.6.7 
A more detailed appraisal of the site selection process and design 
evolution will be set out in the ES.

SCOPE AND STRUCTURE OF THE EIA 
4.1 
Introduction  
4.1.1 
This section describes the proposed scope and structure for the EIA 
that will be undertaken to support the DCO application.  
4.1.2 
The key output of the EIA process is the ES, which sets out the 
predicted 
significant 
environmental 
effects 
of 
the 
proposed 
development. The ES will enable PINS and consultees, and ultimately 
the SoS, to understand the environmental impacts of the proposal. 
4.1.3 
Schedule 4 of the EIA Regulations states that the ES should describe, 
in particular, the environmental effects on: ‘Population, fauna, flora, soil, 
water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including architectural and 
archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between 
the above factors’. The structure proposed in this document seeks to 
address all of these requirements.  
4.1.4 
The EIA will be undertaken in full accordance with the EIA Regulations. 
Impacts 
arising 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning will all be considered, as will cumulative impacts with 
other existing and planned developments in the area. The Gas and 
Electrical Connections will be considered in the EIA. For ease and 
clarity, the Gas and Electrical Connections will be considered in 
separate sections to the Power Generation Plant The Gas Connection 
will likely be included in the DCO application and will be fully assessed 
in the EIA. The Electrical Connection will be fully assessed if it forms 
part of the DCO application and, even if is separately consented, 
indicative information will be included in the ES. In any event, any 
cumulative impacts which may arise from developing the Gas and 
Electrical Connections at the same time as the Power Generation Plant 
will also be assessed.  
4.2 
Overall ES Structure 
4.2.1 
Table 4.1 sets out the proposed structure of the main ES document. A 
number of supporting documents will also be submitted to the SoS as 
part of the DCO application. These are summarised in Table 4.2.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ES IMPACT SECTIONS 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This section provides a description of the proposed methodology that 
will be used when producing the ES. It addresses each separate 
section of the ES in turn and describes the current understanding of the 
baseline conditions and the potential impacts and assessment 
methodology for each discipline that will determine the likely significant 
environmental effects of the PPP. Potential mitigation measures have 
also been identified where appropriate, although these will be set out in 
detail in the ES and will ensure that the project complies with current 
legislation and best practice guidance. Consultees are invited to 
comment on the methodologies within their scoping responses. 
5.1.2 
Each section deals with the Power Generation Plant, then the Gas 
Connection (which will be consented alongside the Power Generation 
Plant) followed by the Electrical Connection. The Electrical Connection 
may be consented separately to the Power Generation Plant and the 
Gas Connection. If this is the case then that Electrical Connection 
would be assessed as required. The below sections should therefore 
be read in this light.  
5.1.3 
The sections described are set out in the following list:  
� 
Air Quality (5.3); 
� 
Noise and Vibration (5.4); 
� 
Ecology (5.5); 
� 
Water Resources (5.6); 
� 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (5.7); 
� 
Landscape and Visual (5.8); 
� 
Waste Management (5.9); 
� 
Traffic, Transport and Access (5.10); 
� 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (5.11); 
� 
Socio-economics (5.12); and 
� 
Cumulative Impacts (5.13).

Significance Criteria 
5.2.1 
The 
significance of environmental 
effects resulting from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the PPP will generally 
be assessed in the ES using a series of matrices. These will be

developed to describe the sensitivity of receptors which have the 
potential to be impacted by the development and the magnitude of any 
impacts that are likely to arise. The magnitude of impact and sensitivity 
of receptor will be cross referenced to give an overall significance of 
effect for any potential impact. Where it is not possible to quantify 
impacts, qualitative assessments will be carried out, based on available 
knowledge and professional judgement.  
5.2.2 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of 
impacts upon different environmental components, the assessments 
will generally follow the structure and use the terminology outlined 
below in Tables 5.1 – 5.3. However, it is noted here that for some 
sections, significance criteria may need to differ depending on the 
conditions encountered at the site. The criteria will therefore be subject 
to further discussion with statutory consultees. Each technical chapter 
of the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria used. 
5.2.3 
Potential mitigation measures described in the ES will include 
embedded mitigation through design/standard control measures (which 
will be used to produce an initial assessment of impact) and further 
specific mitigation which will be required (which will be taken into 
account to produce an assessment of residual impacts).

Air Quality 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.1 
The air quality assessment of the ES will assess baseline conditions 
(air quality in the local and regional area surrounding the plant), stack 
emissions from the plant (quantifying concentrations of emissions) and 
the most appropriate stack height to achieve adequate dispersion of 
these emissions. It will also assess localised air quality impacts caused 
during construction and decommissioning.  
5.3.2 
The main emissions associated with the combustion of natural gas at 
the proposed Power Generation Plant are NOx and CO. Additionally, 
the construction and decommissioning phases of the project have the 
potential to impact on localised air quality, principally through the 
generation of dust and the release of NOx and CO from exhaust fumes 
from increased traffic movements. 
5.3.3 
However, the concentrations of any pollutants released from the plant 
will meet the requirements of the IED. Furthermore, mitigation 
measures such as flue gas abatement (if deemed necessary) and 
damping down of stockpiles in dry and windy conditions will mean that 
any impacts are likely to be sufficiently limited.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.3.4 
This section of the ES will also assess the baseline conditions along 
each of the proposed gas and electrical routes. As there are no 
emissions associated with the operation of gas or Electrical

Connections, there will be no need to access the impacts of these 
elements during operation. However, this section will assess localised 
air quality impacts caused during construction and decommissioning. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.5 
Existing ambient air quality and baseline conditions will be reviewed 
using available air quality monitoring data and the most recent local 
authority publications under their duties under the Environment Act 
1995, including particular consideration of designated Air Quality 
Management Areas, any relevant previous studies undertaken in the 
area, the location of sensitive receptors (including designated 
ecological sites) and other significant sources of emissions. 
5.3.6 
In the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant site, other significant 
sources of emissions are considered to be limited to the thermal power 
station located immediately to the north of the proposed site location. 
Further consultation will be sought with the relevant Local Authority and 
the EA to determine a definitive list of significant emissions sources to 
consider as part of the assessment of air quality. 
5.3.7 
The existing air quality concentrations at sensitive ecological sites will 
be obtained from the Department for Environment Food and Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA) (http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/). The existing acid and 
nutrient nitrogen deposition rates will be obtained from the UK Air 
Pollution Information System (UK APIS) (http://www.apis.ac.uk/). 
5.3.8 
The main ecological receptors that have the potential to be impacted by 
NOx emissions (and ultimately nitrogen deposition) from the Power 
Generation Plant owing to their proximity are considered to be: 
� 
The Broads ESA– located approximately 2.7 km to the north west 
of the closest point of the site and on the south east side of the site, 
at approximately 1.1 km. 
� 
Burgate 
ancient 
and 
semi-natural 
woodland 
– 
located 
approximately 5.5 km west of the site; and 
� 
The Pennings Local Nature Reserve – located approximately 2.3 
km south east of the closest point to the site. 
5.3.9 
The closest residential receptors to the site that may also be potentially 
affected by pollutant dispersion and deposition include:  
� 
Houses located to the east, north of Eye and adjacent to the B1077 
(approximately 480 m from the site);

- 76 - 
 
� 
Houses located to the south west of the site adjacent to Old 
Norwich road (approximately 750 m from the site); 
� 
Farm located to the north west of the site (approximately 810 m 
from the site); and 
� 
Houses and static holiday caravans to the north of the site, 
adjacent to the B1077 (approximately 750 m from the site). 
5.3.10 
The emerging draft EADF indicates that new residential areas may be 
capable of being accommodated within the Airfield complex. As such it 
is expected that if developed, these also have the potential to be 
affected by emissions from the Power Generation Plant. The two 
allocated areas for residential development within the Eye Airfield are 
located 840 m and 900 m to the southeast of the site. boundary. 
Similarly, potential plans to the north of the site include a care home 
that would be located approximately 440 m from the site boundary. 
Gas Connection 
5.3.11 
As for the Power Generation Plant, ambient air quality and baseline 
conditions will be reviewed using available air quality monitoring data 
and the most recent local authority publications under their duties under 
the Environment Act 1995, including particular consideration of 
designated Air Quality Management Areas, any relevant previous 
studies undertaken in the area, the location of sensitive receptors 
(including designated ecological sites) and other significant sources of 
emissions. 
5.3.12 
Given that all proposed Gas Connection route corridors are within close 
proximity to the Power Generation Plant, no other significant sources of 
emissions have been identified and thus all potential sources are 
considered to be the same as for the Power Generation Plant. 
5.3.13 
As there would be no emissions from the Gas connections, there is no 
potential for NOx to impact upon local ecological or residential sites, 
and the only air quality implications will be associate with the potential 
creation of dust during construction and decommissioning. 
Electrical Connections 
5.3.14 
The assessment methodology of baseline conditions for the Gas 
Connection routes would be appropriate to use for the Electrical 
Connections.

Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.15 
The magnitude and risk of emissions of dust during the construction 
and decommissioning phases will be assessed in accordance with 
Guidance on the Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air 
Quality and the Determination of their Significance (IAQM, 2012), as 
will the impact of emissions from the increased number of construction 
vehicles using the methodology prescribed in the Department for 
Transport “Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 
Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality” and the associated DMRB Screening 
Method, developed by the Highways Agency. The significance of the 
potential impacts identified will be determined based on the sensitivity 
of the identified receptors within the potential zones of influence 
outlined in the IAQM Guidance. 
5.3.16 
The air quality assessment for the operational phase of the project will 
follow the EA documents Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f): Air 
Emissions and the EA Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit 
(AQMAU) “Air dispersion modelling report requirements (for detailed air 
dispersion modelling)”. The conversion of NOx to NO2, as applicable for 
the protection of human health under the UK Air Quality Standards 
Regulations 2010, will adopt the approach outlined in the AQMAU 
Guidance Note ‘Conversion Ratios for NOx and NO2’ (2006). 
5.3.17 
The atmospheric emissions from the Power Generation Plant will be 
quantified by obtaining information from relevant plant suppliers. Where 
two or more suppliers are being considered, a realistic worst case 
scenario will be used to ensure flexibility. However, only plant that 
meets national emissions limits will be considered. 
5.3.18 
The atmospheric dispersion modelling will be performed using the 
Cambridge 
Environmental 
Research 
Consultants 
(CERC) 
Air 
Dispersion Modelling Software (ADMS 4.2). An air dispersion model will 
be set up that will consider the affects of terrain and buildings (as 
appropriate to the location of the plant), together with the most recent 
available meteorological data covering a consecutive five year period 
(e.g. 2008 to 2012, inclusive) in accordance with current guidance. 
5.3.19 
To assess a realistic worst case scenario, the plant will be modelled 
running at base load, continuously for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 
for a total of 5 years.  
5.3.20 
The exact study and detailed methodology will also be discussed with 
relevant statutory consultees.

5.3.21 
The modelling assessment will estimate the mass flow rates of NOx 
and CO at sensitive receptors using the emission limits as specified in 
Part 2 of Annex V to the IED. Initial screening runs will be undertaken 
to determine an acceptable stack height suitable for adequate 
dispersion based on predicted maximum short term and long term 
ground level concentrations. Detailed atmospheric dispersion modelling 
will then be undertaken on the basis of the selected stack height. 
5.3.22 
The results of the detailed dispersion modelling will be presented as 
isopleths, and compared with background levels and relevant 
Standards / Guidelines (i.e. the Air Quality Standards Regulations 
2010). Direct comparison will be made between the long-term and 
short-term process contribution from the Power Generation Plant, the 
predicted environmental concentrations of relevant substances (i.e. 
process contribution plus background levels) and the limits and 
objectives within the relevant Air Quality Standards Regulations. Where 
appropriate, the significance of the potential impact will be determined 
using the criteria set out in the ‘Development Control: Planning for Air 
Quality’ (EPUK, 2010) in conjunction with the EA Horizontal Guidance 
Note H1 – Annex (f). The abatement of emissions will be discussed in 
relation to application of Best Available Techniques, in accordance with 
the EA Sector Guidance Note for Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01) and 
the UK position with regards to the on-going review of the EU IPPC 
Reference Document on BAT for Large Combustion Plants. Should 
additional mitigation prove to be necessary, the severity of impact, 
frequency of emission and the resultant environmental risk associated 
with any residual impact will be examined. 
5.3.23 
Changes in air quality levels for nitrogen oxides will be assessed with 
respect to ecology for the European and nationally designated habitat 
sites within 10 km of the Power Generation Plant (including, not 
necessarily limited to, those identified above). The non-statutory habitat 
sites within 2 km of the Power Generation Plant will also be considered. 
An assessment of the increased deposition of both nutrient nitrogen 
and acid due to nitrogen will also be carried out at the statutory (both 
EU and UK) designated sites in accordance with the methodologies 
described in the EA AQMAU AQTAG 06 Technical Guidance on 
detailed modelling approach for an appropriate assessment for 
emissions to air. 
5.3.24 
It is considered that there will not be any noticeable odours associated 
with the operation of the Power Generation Plant at or beyond the 
boundary of the Power Generation Site and therefore it is not 
considered necessary to undertake a detailed assessment of odour.

Gas Connection 
5.3.25 
The operation of the Gas Connection will not produce any emissions. 
As stated above the only implication that this element of the project will 
have on air quality is the potential generation of dust during 
construction and decommissioning. This dust is unlikely to have any 
impact upon any local residential or ecological receptors. 
5.3.26 
Nonetheless, the assessment for this element of the work will follow the 
same methodology as that used for assessing construction impacts for 
the Power Generation Plant. 
Electrical Connection 
5.3.27 
The operation of the Electrical Connection will not produce any 
emissions. As stated above, the only implication that this element of the 
project will have on air quality is the potential generation of dust during 
construction and decommissioning. This dust is unlikely to have any 
impact upon any local residential or ecological receptors. 
5.3.28 
Nonetheless, the assessment for this element of the work will follow the 
same methodology as that used for assessing construction impacts for 
the Power Generation Plant. 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.29 
Embedded mitigation measures that will be employed as part of the 
construction phase of the project will incorporate standard best practice 
working methods and will include; for example, the covering / damping 
down of stockpiles during dry or windy conditions to limit dust 
generation and damping down of any demolition activities which have 
the potential to create large amounts of dust. A Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will also be drafted which will 
set out best practice methods of limiting dust on site during 
construction. 
5.3.30 
During operation, embedded mitigation measures will include 
incorporating a stack of sufficient height to achieve adequate dispersal 
of pollutants and flue gas cleaning equipment will be used to ensure 
that all emissions are within concentrations permitted by legislation and 
guidance.  
5.3.31 
The need or otherwise for further, project specific mitigation measures 
will be addressed during the EIA.

Gas Connection 
5.3.32 
Mitigation to reduce dust during construction and decommissioning of 
the Gas Connections will be the same as those employed during the 
construction of the Power Generation Plant, including the use of 
standard best practice working methods and will include; for example, 
the covering / damping down of stockpiles during dry or windy 
conditions to limit dust generation and damping down of any demolition 
activities which have the potential to create large amounts of dust

Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.4.1 
In accordance with Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1, a noise and vibration 
assessment will be undertaken and reported in the ES. This will 
consider all of the potential noise and vibration impacts caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant on sensitive receptors in and around the vicinity of the site. It will 
be undertaken in accordance with the most relevant national and local 
standards and guidelines. 
Gas Connections 
5.4.2 
Once operational, the Gas Connection will not generate any noise, and 
thus it will only be necessary to consider noise impacts during 
construction and decommissioning. This assessment will consider all 
potential noise and vibration on sensitive receptors along each of the 
proposed route corridors, and will be undertaken in accordance with the 
most relevant national and local standards and guidelines. 
Electrical Connections 
5.4.3 
Assuming that the Electrical Connection be via an underground, buried 
cable, the connection will not generate any noise during operation. 
Consequently, as above, it will only be necessary to consider noise 
impacts during construction and decommissioning. In this case, the 
assessment will consider all potential noise and vibration on sensitive 
receptors along each of the proposed route corridors, and will be

undertaken with reference to the same relevant national and local 
standards and guidelines. 
5.4.4 
In the case that the Electrical Connection is via an Overhead Line, 
there is potential that noise will emanate from the line during operation 
in the form of a low frequency ‘hum’. In which case the noise 
assessment of the Electrical Connection will consider all of the potential 
noise and vibration impacts caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the line on sensitive receptors along the total 
length of the route corridor. It will be undertaken in accordance with the 
most relevant national and local standards and guidelines. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.4.5 
The Power Generation Plant will be sited within part of the former Eye 
Airfield. The area within the Eye Airfield located immediately adjacent 
to the development site is made up primarily of industrial units. To the 
north of the site a thermal power plant is in operation with two wind 
turbines in proximity to the north west of the site and another two wind 
turbines to be built to the south/south east. These developments have 
the potential to produce significant sources of background noise.  
5.4.6 
The closest residential areas to the site, as shown on Insert 10, are 
located approximately 480 m to the east of the site. There are also 
numerous houses located to the south west of the site adjacent to Old 
Norwich road (approximately 750 m from the closest point of the site). 
There is also a farm located to the north west of the site (approximately 
810 m from the closest point of the site) and a cluster of homes to the 
north of the site, adjacent to the B1077 (approximately 820 m from the 
closest point of the site).  
5.4.7 
As indicated earlier, emerging proposals to develop parts of the Eye 
Airfield could see the creation of residential clusters approximately 840

potential plans to the north of the site include a care home which would 
be located approximately 450 m to the closest point of the Power 
Generation Plant.

Each of the Gas Connection route corridors are located within the 
former Eye Airfield, immediately south, west or east of the Power 
Generation plant. As such, the Gas Connection route corridors have 
the same base line conditions to those described above.  
5.4.9 
However, as the Gas Connection route corridors radiate outwards from 
the site, the closest residential areas are somewhat closer than those 
described above, as shown on Insert 11. To the east, the closest 
residential properties are located approximately 450 m from Corridor 1, 
whereas properties to the south west of the Air Field are within 125 m 
of Corridors 3, 4 and 5. The farm to the North West, is located 570 m 
from Corridor 5, and the cluster of properties to the North is located 1 
km from Corridors 1 and 5. 
5.4.10 
The residential properties developed as part of the emerging proposals 
of the Eye Airfield could be sited approximately 800 m and 1 km to the 
southeast of Gas Connection Route Corridors 3, 4, and 5, while the 
plans to the north of the site including a care home could be located 
approximately 1.4 km to the closest point on Gas Connection Route 
Corridor 1.

Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.4.13 
A construction noise and vibration assessment of the Power 
Generation Plant will be undertaken following the guidance in British 
Standard (BS) 5228: 2009. 
5.4.14 
The assessment of construction impacts will be undertaken as a desk 
study and shall involve:  
� 
Identification of construction activities that produce significant noise 
and vibration;  
� 
Identification of sensitive receptors within 100 m of construction 
activities;  
� 
Prediction of noise and vibration using the methodology contained 
within BS5228 2009. 
5.4.15 
The exact construction methodology is unlikely to be defined until the 
construction contractor is appointed, which is likely to be after the DCO 
application is submitted. However, in the absence of this data, an 
outline construction programme will be developed based on knowledge

and experience of other similar developments. Additionally, the typical 
make up of construction equipment at each stage of the project 
programme will be ascertained in the same way. For ground 
improvement works (e.g. piling) the noise assessment will pay due 
regard to the ground conditions at the site. Where uncertainties exist, 
realistic worst case assumptions will be used. 
5.4.16 
The quantification of impacts shall be undertaken by comparison with 
agreed project criteria / limits either from previous schemes and 
relevant guidance / standards such as BS5228, BS6472 & BS7385, or 
local legislative requirements. The desk study shall outline suitable 
measures for the mitigation of construction impacts, and an 
assessment of residual impacts.  
5.4.17 
Operational noise will be assessed using the methodology set out in BS 
4142:1997 ‘Method of Rating Industrial Noise Affecting Mixed 
Residential and Industrial Areas’. This method predicts the likelihood of 
complaints about noise from industrial developments. It uses the 
following criteria to predict the likelihood of complaints: 
� 
The greater the difference the greater the likelihood of complaints; 
� 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints 
are likely; 
� 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance; and 
� 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely. 
5.4.18 
The noise assessment will also be undertaken in accordance with BS 
7445: 2003 ‘Description and measurement of environmental noise’ 
Parts 1 to 3. BSI. BS 7445 defines and prescribes best practice during 
recording and reporting of environmental noise. It is inherently applied 
in all instances when making environmental noise measurements. 
5.4.19 
It is proposed that the study area for the noise assessment of 
operational effects shall be defined as the region within 1 km of the 
Power Generation Plant. All sensitive receptors, such as residential 
properties, hospitals, schools, etc. within the study areas shall be 
identified in the assessment. 
5.4.20 
A Baseline Noise Survey would then be undertaken in the vicinity of the 
proposed site to establish the current baseline noise levels. The 
locations for the Baseline Noise Survey (i.e. locations of the Nearest 
Noise Sensitive Receptors (NNSR)) will be agreed in advance with the 
local Environmental Health Officer (EHO).

5.4.21 
For the purposes of this Report, it is proposed that four NSR locations 
will be assessed, consistent with ESs for similar projects in the UK.  
5.4.22 
The closest NSRs to the Power Generation Plant site, and therefore 
suggested locations for undertaking baseline modelling are the 
residential properties closest to the development. These include:  
� 
A property on the east of the B1077 – approximately 480 m east of 
the site. 
� 
A property adjacent to Old Norwich road – approximately 750 m 
south west of the site. 
� 
Properties / Holiday Park on the west of the B1077 – approximately 
750 m north from the site. 
� 
A property on the west of the A140, adjacent to an auxiliary of this 
road – approximately 800 m west from the site. 
5.4.23 
Noise monitoring will be undertaken during both daytime and night time 
periods.  
5.4.24 
Following baseline noise measurements, a noise model will be 
produced using Cadna software (3-dimensional noise propagation 
software) which will model the measured baseline levels at NSR, 
together with sound power levels of proposed plant (obtained from 
relevant suppliers). Where sound power levels for proposed plant are 
not available, suitable data will be substituted, although a realistic worst 
case scenario would always be considered. The noise model will 
highlight the main noise sources and the associated noise levels at the 
NSR locations.  
5.4.25 
Contour plots will be produced clearly showing noise levels at the site, 
NSR and surrounding areas.  
5.4.26 
If the model shows that there is potential for a significant effect to be 
generated by noise from any of the sensitive receptors, the level of 
noise mitigation that would be required would be specified, and 
measures that could be used to achieve this level of mitigation will be 
incorporated into the model, to provide a ‘with mitigation’ scenario. 
5.4.27 
The ES section would be compiled using the Institute of Acoustics 
(IoA) / Institute for Environmental Management (IEMA) draft document 
“Guidelines for Noise Impact Assessment”. The operation of the Gas 
Connection and any underground Electrical Connection is not 
anticipated to cause any increase in background noise. However, the 
methodology described above for assessing construction impacts for 
the Power Generation Plant will also be applied for the construction 
phase of the Gas and Electrical Connections.

If an overhead line is considered, a further assessment will be carried 
out to assess the impact of potential hum. This method will follow that 
for the operational phase of the Power Generation Plant. 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
Power Generation Plant 
5.4.31 
During construction, potential mitigation measures could include the 
use of quietest possible construction equipment and only undertaking 
construction activities during certain hours. The CEMP will also set out 
best practice methods of limiting noise on site during construction.  
5.4.32 
During operation, mitigation measures could include the use of 
silencers on the loudest plant items, and, if necessary the provision of 
noise screens.

Ecology  
Introduction  
Power Generation Plant 
5.5.1 
This Section of the ES will address the potential impacts of the Power 
Generation Plant on sensitive ecological receptors. It would summarise 
the results of Phase 1 extended habitat surveys and any Phase 2 
protected species surveys. It would also outline any mitigation 
measures considered necessary.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.5.2 
These Sections of the ES will address the potential impacts of the gas 
and Electrical Connections on sensitive ecological receptors. They 
would summarise the results of Phase 1 extended habitat surveys and 
any Phase 2 protected species surveys that have been undertaken 
along the lengths of each proposed route corridor, and would also 
outline any mitigation measures considered necessary.  
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection 
5.5.3 
Currently, the area proposed for development of the Power Generation 
Plant is free of buildings and dense vegetation. Adjacent to the north of 
the proposed Power Generation Plant site, there is a thermal 
generating power station, along with a two wind turbine wind farm 
located to the north west and with two more turbines to be built in the 
south and south east. Immediately to the east of the site a belt of trees 
surround the area separating it from an existing gas compressor facility. 
To the west of the area the landing strip of the former airfield separates 
the development area from an existing industrial site. The Airfield sits 
within semi-natural surroundings, characterised by a mixture of 
industrial buildings, agricultural fields bordered by mixed plantation 
woodland and hedgerow / screen planting.  
5.5.4 
The Gas Connection would run to the south of the Power Generation 
Plant site and connect with Feeder 5. All of the gas pipeline would be 
undergrounded, albeit that there would be some minor above ground 
structures (as described in Section 3.4 of this Report). Any one of the 
five potential route corridors, as described in Section 3.4 of this Report, 
would encounter broadly similar conditions. They would run through the 
Eye Airfield and then across a series of agricultural fields. A Phase I 
Habitat and Ecological Scoping Survey was undertaken at Eye Airfield 
by Parsons Brinckerhoff (Appendix A), building on the Draft Phase I

Habitat and Ecological Scoping Survey carried out by Mid Suffolk 
District Council in October 2011 The purpose of the survey was to:  
� 
Identify the main habitats present at the site;  
� 
Identify the sensitive ecological receptors (e.g. statutory designated 
sites) in the vicinity of the site; 
� 
Assess the potential of the site to support protected species; and  
� 
Provide recommendations for further assessment works (e.g. 
Phase 2 Protected Species Surveys).  
5.5.5 
On the basis of the survey work the report recommends that further 
work in respect of bats, great crested newts, nesting birds and 
wintering birds is undertaken in the form of a Phase II Survey. The 
document suggests that mitigation for these species may be required 
prior to the start of development works. 
5.5.6 
The survey also states that provision for precautionary mitigation before 
and during development works is also recommended to take into 
account the potential presence of badger and BAP species such as 
brown hare. 
5.5.7 
The survey site covered approximately 250 ha of land, including the 
disused airfield and its surrounding areas (industrial and agricultural 
land). Twenty nine statutory designated sites were identified within the 
10 km search radius. Two of these are of international importance and 
seven of national importance. The remainder of the statutory 
designated sites are ancient woodland. Two non-statutory designated 
sites were noted within the 2 km search radius. Records were received 
for a number of protected and notable species within the search area 
including bats, birds, amphibians, invertebrates and plants.  
5.5.8 
The closest of these internationally and nationally designated sites are 
8 km, north-west of the proposed Power Generation Plant site. 
5.5.9 
The Draft Phase I Habitat Survey states that data obtained from Suffolk 
Borough Records Centre (SBRC) include the known records for 24 
species of birds within 3 km of the survey site. There are records for 3 
species listed on Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Countryside Act, 1981: 
Barn Owl, King Fisher and Skylark (a BoCC
5 Red listed species) which 
have been recorded within the survey area.

 Red list – Red list species are those: That are Globally Threatened according to the IUCN criteria; those whose 
population or range has declined rapidly in recent years; and those that have declined historically and have not 
shown a substantial recent recovery.

5.5.10 
According to the survey bird species observed in the area or heard 
include; grey partridge (Red listed), blackbird, great spotted 
woodpecker, green woodpecker, herring gull, lesser black-backed gull 
and starling. 
5.5.11 
The buildings surrounding the Power Generation Plant site are 
suboptimal for nesting birds, although occasional nesting by species 
such as starling and house sparrow cannot be ruled out. It is expected 
that birds will find suitable habitats in mature trees, shrubs, mixed 
species hedgerows, open pasture and rough grassland. The open 
pasture and rough grassland field boundaries are likely to support 
species such as skylark and grey partridge during the breeding season. 
5.5.12 
In order to assess which species are present within the Power 
Generation Plant site and surroundings, further survey work for nesting 
birds at the appropriate time of the year will be carried out as part of the 
EIA.  
5.5.13 
The main habitats of ecological interest for the Power Generation Plant 
site are the hedgerows, scrub and plantation woodland which lie along 
the northern and eastern site boundaries and immediate surrounds. 
These areas provide nesting and foraging habitat for birds, and 
commuting and foraging opportunities for bats. The arable field is 
considered to be of low ecological value, although further survey work 
is necessary to determine the presence of ground nesting birds such as 
skylark. The preliminary assessments for the surrounding ponds 
(Habitat Suitability Index) indicate further survey work is required to 
determine the presence or likely absence of great crested newts. The 
collective habitats on-site are considered sub-optimal for badger and no 
signs were noted during the survey. However, a nearby road kill noted 
in the Phase 1 habitat survey confirmed presence in the wider area.  
5.5.14 
The main habitats of ecological interest for the Gas Connections 
include hedgerows, scattered trees and tree lines. The trees are not 
considered suitable for bat roosting purposes, although may still be of 
some foraging interest. Similarly, the hedgerows and tree lines provide 
feeding opportunity along with potential dispersal routes for bats. The 
vegetation also provides suitable nesting and foraging habitat for birds. 
The arable footprint is considered sub-optimal for badgers and no signs 
were noted during the survey. The wider site surrounds support 
potentially suitable ponds for great crested newts which require further 
detailed survey work. 
Electrical Connections 
5.5.15 
At present, less is known about the specific habitats within the vicinity 
of the Electrical Connection route corridors, as Phase 1 habitat surveys

are currently ongoing. It is likely that the Electrical Connection would be 
undergrounded across an area of agricultural land to the west of the 
Power Generation Plant site, although there is potential that this 
connection could be via an overhead line. 
5.5.16 
Given the close proximity to the Power Generation Plant and Gas 
Connection route corridors, it is expected that the main habitats of 
ecological interest will be similar to those for the Gas Connection. 
However, Phase 1 habitat surveys are currently underway to ensure 
that all habitat types are appropriately considered and Phase 2 habitat 
surveys will be carried out where necessary should specific habitats be 
identified.  
5.5.17 
At present, it is anticipated that Phase 2 surveys for the following 
species will be carried out along the Electrical Connection route 
corridor options. The following list is not definitive, and will be updated 
following the completion of the Phase 1 surveys of this area.

NPS EN-1 requires that ‘Where the development is subject to EIA the 
applicant should ensure that the ES clearly sets out any effects on 
internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological or 
geological conservation importance, on protected species and on 
habitats and other species identified as being of principal importance 
for the conservation of biodiversity’ (paragraph 5.3.3). Furthermore, that 
‘the applicant should show how the project has taken advantage of 
opportunities to conserve and enhance biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests’ (paragraph 5.3.4) and demonstrate that 
‘opportunities will be taken to enhance existing habitats and, where 
practicable, to create new habitats’ (paragraph 5.3.18).  
5.5.19 
NPS EN-1 also requires that lighting effects will be considered on 
sensitive ecological receptors.  
5.5.20 
Based on the results of the extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, there is 
a recommendation to undertake the following Phase 2 protected 
species surveys at the Power Generation Plant site:

- 92 - 
 
Bats 
5.5.21 
Within the extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, the boundaries of the 
Power Generation Plant site and immediate surrounding areas were 
identified as suitable for bat commuting and foraging purposes. It is 
therefore recommended that three activity surveys are undertaken 
across the entire Power Generation Plant site during optimal survey 
period for bats (April to September) to identify which bat species are 
using the site and to investigate how they are using the different 
habitats for roosting, feeding, foraging, commuting and socialising 
wherever possible. All surveys will be undertaken by licensed bat 
workers and experienced bat surveyors equipped with bat detectors 
and recording devices. The surveys will also be undertaken in 
accordance with best practice guidelines (Bat Conservation Trust, 
2012). 
Breeding and wintering birds 
5.5.22 
The vegetated boundaries of the Power Generation Plant site are 
suitable for a wide range of nesting and foraging birds. Although the 
development footprint does not extend into these areas, consideration 
should still be given to the potential impact of the development 
proposals on bird populations. The arable field is also suitable for 
ground nesting birds such as sky lark. Further wintering and breeding 
bird surveys are therefore recommended to inform the EcIA. Breeding 
bird surveys will be undertaken between April – July and wintering bird 
surveys will be undertaken between November and January.  
Great crested newts 
5.5.23 
Preliminary pond surveys (Habitat Suitability Assessment) indicated 
that there are a number of ponds surrounding the Power Generation 
Plant site which are potentially suitable for great crested newts. 
Although the assessment is not precise enough to determine presence 
or absence alone, it does provide an indication that the habitat 
conditions are capable of supporting this species. An additional 4 
surveys are therefore necessary in the spring period to ascertain 
presence or absence. In the instance of great crested newts being 
present, 2 further surveys (also undertaken during the spring) are 
necessary to complete a population estimate. 
Badgers 
5.5.24 
No signs of badger were noted during the survey. The Power 
Generation Plant site is considered to be sub-optimal for badgers due 
to the flat topography and lack of vegetative cover. However, previous 
biological records and evidence of road kill emphasise that badgers are

present in the wider surrounding area. Occasional through passage 
cannot therefore be completely discounted for the site and basic 
mitigation policies are recommended. 
Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) 
5.5.25 
A method statement will be produced for all works that might impact on 
the neighbouring Progress Industrial Estate Sites of Importance for 
Nature Conservation (SINC)Site of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC) to protect the designating features of the SINC from adverse 
affects from the development of the Power Generation Plant.  
5.5.26 
Based on the current Power Generation Plant layout (Figure 2), it is 
considered that there is not a requirement for Phase 2 protected 
species surveys for National Vegetation Classification (NVC), reptiles 
or invertebrates. However if there any changes to the proposed layout 
that resulted in development areas encroaching into areas with the 
potential to support these species, further methodology would be 
provided to and discussed with statutory consultees.  
Gas Connection 
5.5.27 
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Surveys have been undertaken along 
potentially suitable Gas Connection route corridors. The results of the 
Phase 1 surveys have identify the requirement for Phase 2 protected 
Species Surveys for; Bats, Breeding and Overwintering Birds, Great 
Crested Newts, and Badgers. 
5.5.28 
Following the completion of the Phase 2 Protected Species Surveys, 
reports will be produced, detailing the extent to which the species are 
present, the likely impacts that the Gas Connection will have on the 
species and habitats and the potential mitigation measures that could 
be employed to reduce impacts to an acceptable level.  
5.5.29 
Assessment and reporting will follow guidelines as set out in the 
Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) (IEEM, July 2006). 
Electrical Connection 
5.5.30 
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Surveys will be undertaken along potentially 
suitable Electrical Connection route corridors. The corridors will 
encompass a suitable buffer either side of the proposed routes to 
account for small variations in the final route (micrositing) and to 
account for the ‘working width’ (i.e. the area required for vehicle 
movements and laydown of equipment). The surveys will be 
undertaken using the same methodology and aims as for the Power

Generation Plant site and will help to define the final route corridor 
choices.  
5.5.31 
The results of the Phase 1 surveys would identify the requirement for 
Phase 2 protected Species Surveys. As yet, the need, or otherwise for 
specific surveys cannot be determined with any certainty.  
5.5.32 
Following the completion of the Phase 2 Protected Species Surveys, 
reports will be produced, detailing the extent to which the species are 
present, the likely impacts that the PPP will have on species and 
habitats and the potential mitigation measures that could be employed 
to reduce impacts to an acceptable level.  
5.5.33 
Assessment and reporting will follow guidelines as set out in the 
Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) (IEEM, July 2006). 
Appropriate Assessment 
5.5.34 
The proposed Power Generation Plant could have a potential impact on 
a number of designated sites within the surrounding area, including 
those of national and international significance. The extent of this 
impact cannot however be fully assessed at this early stage until further 
details with regards to the proposals are provided. 
5.5.35 
A Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Exercise is, 
however considered likely to be required for the two sites of 
international importance, Redgrave & Lopham Fens (RAMSAR, SSSI, 
NNR) and Waveney & Little Ouse Valley Fens SAC. Both sites are 
located c.4 km to the north-west of the proposed power plant site. 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.5.36 
Embedded mitigation measures to limit impacts on ecology and 
biodiversity could include ensuring that no construction or vegetation 
clearance takes place within breeding bird season or during other 
sensitive ecological seasons. If necessary, further, specific mitigation 
measures will include the consideration for provision of new habitat to 
suitably replace any habitat areas which are permanently lost through 
development of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, or 
Electrical Connection.

Water Resources 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.1 
This section of the ES will describe the potential impacts resulting from 
the development of the Power Generation Plant on local water quality. 
The Section will provide a brief summary of the main issues and risks 
posed to and from flooding. However, these will be assessed in detail 
through a separate Flood Risk Assessment, submitted as a separate 
dedicated document as part of the DCO application. Additionally, 
potential impacts on hydrogeology will be assessed as part of the 
section describing geology, contamination and ground conditions 
(outlined in Section 5.7 of this Scoping Report).  
5.6.2 
The supply of water for construction of the PPP will ultimately be the 
responsibility of the principal construction contractor. In addition, the 
discharge of any effluents during construction, including site drainage, 
will also be the responsibility of the principal construction contractor 
who will be required to reach agreement with the EA, Internal Drainage 
Board (IDB) and the local sewerage undertakers with regards to 
detailed methods of disposal. Standard good working practices should 
ensure that any impacts due to water discharging from the site would 
be insignificant.  
5.6.3 
At present, it is assumed that the Power Generation Plant will utilise air 
cooling, substantially reducing water intake, as described in Section 3.3 
above. During natural gas firing, the only process water required on a 
day-to-day basis would be that for make-up to the HRSG system 
(should CCGT plant be chosen).  
5.6.4 
Small quantities of water (blowdown) will be discharged to avoid the 
build-up of impurities in the HRSG steam/water cycle. The blowdown is 
virtually pure water containing very small quantities of various 
chemicals that are used to prevent corrosion and scaling in the system. 
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.6.5 
Separate sections of the ES will describe the potential impacts resulting 
from the development of the Gas and Electrical Connections on local 
water quality and as above its impact of Flood Risk and Ground Water 
will be assessed in separate sections.

5.6.6 
As there is no requirement for water usage during the operation of the 
Gas and Electrical (buried or overhead) Connections, the only 
consideration of water resources will be during the construction period, 
and will follow the same principles as those described for construction 
of the Power Generation Plant. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.7 
Surface water bodies in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant will 
be identified and described along with their importance. Based on an 
initial, high level assessment, the main water bodies are considered to 
be; 
� 
Three ponds located next to Parke’s Farm approximately 1.5 km 
north east of the Power Generation Plant site boundary; 
� 
Two ponds located north at approximately 2.5 km north of the 
Power Generation Plant site boundary;  
� 
One reservoir located at approximately 770 m east of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary; and 
� 
One pond located at approximately 525 m west of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary. 
� 
One small drain or watercourse approximately 750 m south west of 
the Power Generation Plant site boundary. 
5.6.8 
As part of further baseline assessment, abstraction points and licences 
in the area will be investigated and summarised, and the potential 
impact on these abstractions will be qualified.  
5.6.9 
Historical maps would be studied to identify the course of any former 
watercourses which may have been undergrounded or culverted in the 
past and which could be impacted.  
Gas Connection 
5.6.10 
The proposed Gas Connection route corridors all exit the Power 
Generation Plant site, and cross the middle or south of the Eye Airfield 
Site. Based on the initial investigation, Gas Connection Route Corridors 
3, 4, and 5 will all pass parallel to and within close proximity of this 
watercourse. However, it is not anticipated that any of the proposed 
Gas Connection routes will need to cross this, or any other water 
bodies.

Electrical Connection 
5.6.11 
The proposed Electrical Connection would exit the Power Generation 
Plant site to the west into the Opportunity Area where it would cross the 
A140 and agricultural fields prior to connecting into the 400 kV 
infrastructure.  
5.6.12 
The Opportunity Area contains a number of waterbodies, ponds and 
ditches which will be carefully considered during the process of 
identifying the route for the Electrical Connection.  The design process 
will aim to reduce crossings or interactions with watercourses as much 
as possible. 
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.13 
NPS EN1 recognises the need for EIA to account for the existing status 
of, and impacts of the proposed project on, water quality, water 
resources and physical characteristics of the water environment 
(paragraph 5.15.2). 
5.6.14 
NPS EN1 Paragraph 5.2.7 also states that the ES should describe any 
potential eutrophication impacts. 
5.6.15 
The Water Resources ES chapter would be undertaken using a risk 
based approach to determine the level of potential impacts but will also 
use a Source–Pathway-Receptor model to identify which receptors 
could realistically be impacted by a given action. 
5.6.16 
All aspects of supply, demand and disposal of water and process 
effluents will be addressed for the construction, operational and 
decommissioning phases of the project.  
5.6.17 
Any potential sources of pollution that have the potential to impact on 
surface water bodies will be identified.  
5.6.18 
The disposal of surface water drainage and the process effluents to the 
sewage system will be discussed with a view to maximising the 
opportunities for water recovery and re-use as far as is practicable. 
5.6.19 
Potential discharge locations for site surface waters and process waste 
waters will be identified and a site drainage plan which may incorporate 
a sustainable drainage system (SuDS) will be discussed at a high level. 
5.6.20 
In terms of the Power Generation Plant there are not anticipated to be 
any impacts on the water bodies listed above. The majority of them are 
a significant distance from the site and therefore will not be directly

- 98 - 
 
impacted during construction. It is not anticipated to directly abstract or 
discharge water to or from any of these sources during construction, 
operation or decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant.  
5.6.21 
Where projects are away from, or unlikely to interact with any water 
courses, it is likely that a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report will 
not be required and it may be scoped out. However, if the EA does 
state that a WFD Report is required, this will need to be incorporated. 
An assessment for the WFD Report would involve consideration of the 
WFD Status of surrounding water bodies. The WFD Report would need 
to be approved by the EA and would form an Appendix to the ES. 
Gas Connection 
5.6.22 
The assessment methodology for the Power Generation Plant would be 
appropriate to use for the Gas Connection, and as above, it is not 
anticipated that there will be any impacts on the water body identified 
as the proposed gas routes will run parallel to the water body, and thus 
will not need to cross it. 
5.6.23 
As above, although there is no intention for the Gas Connection to 
cross this water course, as the route will be passing within a short 
distance, it may be considered necessary for a WFD report to be 
produced and agreed with the EA.  
Electrical Connection 
5.6.24 
Assuming that the electrical connection will be in the form of an 
underground cable, all of the proposed electrical connection route 
corridors cross or pass within close proximity to waterbodies. As such, 
assessment of the potential impact will be carried out following the 
same methodology as described above, and if necessary, a WFD 
assessment report will be produced and agreed. 
5.6.25 
If an overhead line is used to export power from the Power Generation 
Plant, there will be no need for any water crossings or interaction with 
water bodies of any kind.  
Potential Mitigation Measures 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.26 
Potential embedded mitigation measures which will be included during 
the construction of the Power Generation Plant to limit impacts on 
water quality include siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from 
watercourses to avoid pollution runoff and adhering to best practice 
working guidelines to avoid spillages near watercourses.

5.6.27 
Additionally, during construction and operation, silt traps and oil 
interceptors would be placed in any drains on site. No untreated 
surface or waste waters would be allowed to drain to drainage ditches 
or watercourses during construction or operation. SuDS would be used 
if found to be required. 
5.6.28 
The British Standard Code of Practice for Earthworks BS 6031:2009 
contains detailed methods that should be considered for the general 
control of drainage on construction sites. Further advice is also 
available in the British Standard Code of Practice for Foundations 
BS 8004: 1986. These will be taken into account.  
5.6.29 
All aqueous process effluents will be discharged via the plant drainage 
systems and will be in accordance with EA limits. The use of biocides 
will be optimised to ensure that the least amount possible is required.  
5.6.30 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored 
will be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single tanks will be within 
bunds sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity and multiple tanks or 
drums will be within bunds sized to contain the greater of 110 per cent 
of the capacity of the largest tank or 25 per cent of the total tanks 
contents.  
5.6.31 
During operation, the EA will set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the site under the Environmental Permit. The need, or 
otherwise for further, specific mitigation measures will be determined 
through the EIA process. 
Gas Connection 
5.6.32 
All proposed mitigation measures identified for the Power Generation 
Plant will be considered for the construction and decommissioning 
periods of the Gas Connection depending on the findings of the impact 
assessment. 
Electrical Connection 
5.6.33 
All proposed mitigation measures identified for the Power Generation 
Plant will also be considered for the construction and decommissioning 
periods of the Electrical Connection depending on the findings of the 
impact assessment. 
5.6.34 
As it is possible that an underground electrical route may need to cross 
a water body, various crossing techniques will also be considered. 
These may include horizontal directional drilling, particularly for larger 
water bodies, or temporary bunding and over-pumping where flows are 
lower.

5.7 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture 
Introduction (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection) 
5.7.1 
This section of the ES will detail the baseline geological and 
hydrogeological conditions of the Power Generation Plant site and 
outline the potential environmental impacts of the proposed Power 
Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connection corridors on these 
resources. It will also detail the baseline conditions in terms of ground 
and ground water contamination and the risks posed to human health 
(particularly future site users). It will also consider any impacts that the 
project may have on the physical geological, soil or agricultural 
resource, through e.g. removal of rare geology, sterilisation of mineral 
assets, removal of good quality agricultural land or disturbance of sites 
designated for their geological importance and significance.  
5.7.2 
The main potential impact from the development of the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection in terms 
of geology and land quality is likely to be the potential sterilisation of 
good quality agricultural land.  
Baseline  
Power Generation Plant 
5.7.3 
It is understood that the area proposed for the Power Generation Plant 
has remained as undeveloped agricultural land throughout its history 
and is currently used as arable agricultural land bordered by scrub and 
a belt of trees.  
5.7.4 
Key past and present developments in the vicinity of the Power 
Generation Plant that could have had an impact on geology and ground 
contamination include: 
� 
Former Eye Airfield runways and fuel storage facilities within the 
disused airfield; 
� 
The existing 12.7 MW Eye Power Plant located immediately to the 
north of the proposed PPP site. 
5.7.5 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial 
geology underlying the Power Generation Plant site is composed of 
Diamicton (lowestoft formation), while the underlying hard rock geology 
is characteristic of peat, sand and gravel and calcerous tufa.

- 101 - 
 
Gas Connection 
5.7.6 
The proposed routes of the Gas Connection all pass through the Eye 
Airfield site and along roads / across agricultural fields what are within 
the former Airfield footprint and would have been subject to the same 
impact on geology and ground contamination as the Power Generation 
Plant site; namely the runway and fuel storage facilities.  
5.7.7 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial and 
hard rock geology underlying the Gas Connection route corridors is the 
same as that underlying the Power Generation Plant. 
Electrical Connection 
5.7.8 
The Electrical Connection, be it buried or overhead, will initially run 
through the Eye Airfield site, and will be subject to the same impact on 
geology and ground contamination as the Power Generation Plant site 
and Gas Connection Corridors.  
5.7.9 
West of the A140, in the Opportunity Area, the connection would pass 
over or under arable agricultural land that it is understood to have 
remained unchanged throughout its history, and is thus considered to 
be ‘Green Field’.  
5.7.10 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial and 
hard rock geology underlying the Opportunity Area is the same as that 
underlying the Power Generation Plant. 
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.7.11 
Assessment will be underpinned by the DEFRA/EA publication 
Contaminated Land Report 11, 2004, “Model Procedures for the 
Management of Land Contamination” and associated subsequent 
guidance. 
5.7.12 
The assessment approach will be undertaken with a clear 
understanding of the following: 
� 
Previous land uses – through a review of historical maps;  
� 
Underlying ground conditions – through a review of BGS maps, and 
a review of previous site investigations (where available) and Coal 
Authority Report if necessary;  
� 
Existing physical baseline conditions through a site walkover 
survey and review of a Landmark Envirocheck Report.

Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
May 2013 
for PPL 
 
- 102 - 
 
5.7.13 
The Landmark Envirocheck Report for the site will identify groundwater 
vulnerability, sites designated for geological importance, details of any 
previous pollution events at the site or surrounding area, details of 
landfills, waste management sites and COMAH sites within the site and 
surrounding area and historical maps.  
5.7.14 
A conceptual site model approach will be used to assess the risks 
posed by contaminants to sensitive receptors using a source, pathway 
receptor model, based on the following: 
� 
Source – potential source of contamination. 
� 
Pathway – means by which contamination can reach and impact 
upon a receptor. 
� 
Receptor – that which may be adversely affected by the presence 
of contamination.  
5.7.15 
Desk studies will identify potential environmental and geotechnical 
liabilities associated with the development of the site, including an 
assessment of potential impacts of previous uses of the site and 
surrounding area. These desk studies are important if any potential 
environmental and geotechnical risks are to be identified, and a 
focussed and cost efficient intrusive investigation is to be designed (if 
required).  
5.7.16 
In undertaking the desk studies, all available information on the sites 
and surrounding areas will be reviewed to establish local ground 
conditions and the environmental settings. Furthermore, consultation 
will be held with the relevant Local Authorities and the EA to obtain any 
other environmental records available for the project sites and to further 
refine the assessment methodology.  
5.7.17 
A site walkover will be undertaken, covering the project site and 
immediate surrounding areas. This will ensure all potential source, 
pathway and receptor linkages for potential contamination issues have 
been identified.  
5.7.18 
Based on the findings of the desk studies, site walkovers and 
preliminary risk assessment, recommendations will be provided for any 
further intrusive investigation work thought to be necessary to satisfy 
current Standards / Guidance and fill any data gaps identified to fully 
inform the assessments of environmental and geotechnical risks / 
liabilities.  
5.7.19 
Using the information obtained suitable remediation strategies would be 
developed that could be implemented to render the site ready for 
development as appropriate.

5.7.20 
These would include estimates of the types and volumes of waste 
material that will need to be removed from the sites prior to 
development.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.7.21 
The assessment methodology of the Power Generation Plant would be 
appropriate for use on both the gas and Electrical Connection route 
corridors and will be followed as described above. 
5.7.22 
Additionally, an assessment will be made of the amount of agricultural 
land, if any, that may become sterilised as a result of the development 
of the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
5.7.23 
Should an overhead Electrical Connection route be considered, the 
same methodology will be used, although it is considered likely that the 
potential impact on Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture would 
be significantly less than for a buried connection. 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
Power Generation Plant 
5.7.24 
Embedded mitigation measures will include adherence to good practice 
guidelines and could involve, for example, 
� 
Any additional soil materials that are to be imported to the sites will 
be required to have certification of their chemical concentrations to 
ensure that contaminative materials are not being introduced to the 
area.  
� 
In order to further limit disturbance, the site access tracks will be 
constructed first to allow movement of vehicles around the site on 
areas of soft-standing.  
� 
Any vegetation, topsoil and subsoil will be removed to expose a 
suitable sub-grade. Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for 
reuse will be stockpiled on impermeable liners.  
� 
Soils which are to be reused onsite will be tested for contamination 
and geotechnical suitability. This will form part of a site waste 
management plan (SWMP) which will be drafted prior to 
construction and will focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of 
waste spoil.  
� 
Surface water, perched waters or groundwater from dewatering 
operations will not be discharged to surface water, foul or surface 
water drains without the appropriate consents from the local water 
or sewage company and / or the EA.

� 
The disposal of this effluent will be the responsibility of the 
contractor. If necessary, this water will be tanked off-site for 
disposal at a suitable facility.  
� 
All foundations will be appropriately specified to resist chemical 
attack from soils or groundwater.  
� 
Foundations will also be designed so as not to present a 
preferential pathway for contaminant migration, if present at the 
Power Generation Plant site.  
5.7.25 
Further, specific mitigation measures could include, for example, 
remediation of the site, removal of contamination hotspots or further 
site characterisation and will be determined during the EIA.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.7.26 
Embedded mitigation measures for the gas and Electrical Connections 
(buried or overhead) are likely to be the same as for the Power 
Generation Plant. 
5.8 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.8.1 
This section of the ES will describe the potential impacts that the Power 
Generation Plant, could have on landscape elements and sensitive 
visual receptors in the surrounding area.  
5.8.2 
This Section will establish the following: 
� 
A clear understanding of the Power Generation Plant and its wider 
landscape setting, identifying its landscape character, resources, 
value and sensitivity to the proposed development; 
� 
An assessment of the composition, character and aesthetic value 
of views from visual receptors including occupiers of residential 
properties and people using amenity landscapes, and the 
sensitivity of views;  
� 
The nature of the different development scenarios and mitigation 
measures; and 
� 
The likely significant direct and indirect effects of the proposal on 
the landscape resource (i.e. landscape elements and character) 
and on visual receptors. 
5.8.3 
The buildings of the Power Generation Plant will be finished in a 
manner which will have regard to the views of community and

stakeholder consultation to minimise the impact with respect to the 
landscape. Attention will be paid at all times to aspects of good design 
that can be incorporated into the project to minimise visual impacts and 
identify reasonable mitigation where possible and appropriate in line 
with NPS EN-1. Consideration will also be given to the potential 
impacts of lighting arising from the Power Generation Plant and 
measures will be put forward to limit the amount of offsite light spill.  
Gas Connection 
5.8.4 
It is not anticipated that the Gas Connection will give rise to any 
significant visual impacts, as it will be undergrounded for the majority of 
its length.  However, a thorough assessment of the AGI will be 
undertaken and reported in a similar format as described above.  
Electrical Connection 
5.8.5 
As for the Gas Connection is not anticipated that a buried Electrical 
Connection would give rise to any significant visual impacts, as it is 
likely that it will be undergrounded for the majority of its length.  
5.8.6 
However, there is potential that an overhead line may be used to export 
the electricity from the Power Generation Plant to the National Grid. If 
this is the case, a full landscape and visual impact assessment will be 
undertaken in line with EN-1 and the additional guidance set out in EN-
5, ensuring that the assessment conforms to all of the ‘Holford Rules’ 
as far as possible. 
5.8.7 
Furthermore, whether the Electrical Connection takes the form of an 
underground cable or an overhead line, some element of above ground 
infrastructure will be required where the connection joins the National 
Grid infrastructure, be it a new substation or SEC. 
5.8.8 
Irrespective of the type of connection, a full visual impact assessment 
of this infrastructure will be carried out following the guide lines set out 
in EN-1 and EN-5 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.8.9 
Land surrounding the Power Generation Plant site is characterised by a 
mixture of industrial units, agricultural land and tree belts. The A140 
runs approximately 360 m north from the site boundary at its closest 
point whilst the closest point of the B1077 to the site is approximately 
460 m to the east. The closest residential receptors to the site include

� 
A property on the east of the B1077 – approximately 480 m east of 
the site. 
� 
A property adjacent to Old Norwich road – approximately 750 m 
south west of the site. 
� 
Properties on the west of the B1077 – approximately 750 m north 
from the site. 
� 
A property on the west of the A140, adjacent to an auxiliary of this 
road – approximately 800 m west from the site. 
5.8.10 
The area immediately surrounding the proposed Power Generation 
Plant is characterised by industrial development, two wind turbines 
(soon to be four) and the existing Eye Power Plant. Surrounding this 
area, the Mid Suffolk Business Park is located to the east with the 
Airfield Industrial Park located to the north and the Brome Industrial 
Estate located north of the latter. It is expected that the development 
will be compatible with these existing surroundings. Residential areas 
and agricultural landholdings compose the area surrounding the 
mentioned industrial areas. It is appreciated that there is the potential 
for the project to have impacts on the landscape character and visual 
amenity of wider surrounding area. As such, a great proportion of the 
assessment will focus on potential impacts to this more rural setting. 
Gas Connection 
5.8.11 
All of the Gas Connection Route Corridor options are located within the 
emerging EADF footprint, and as such, share many of the same 
baseline conditions as the Power Generation Plant. 
5.8.12 
The only notable difference in these conditions are the distances to the 
closest residential receptors, which are presented below for each of the 
proposed Gas Connection AGIs. Each of the AGI locations have been 
numbered 1 to 4, from north to south along Feeder No 5. 
� 
AGI 1: Closest residential properties located 370 m to the northeast 
off the B1077. 
� 
AGI 2 Closest residential properties located 500 m to the northeast 
off the B1077. 
� 
AGI  3: Closest residential properties located 680 m to the 
southeast off Millfield. 
� 
AGI  4: Closest residential properties located 660 m to the 
northwest off Old Norwich Road.

Electrical Connection 
5.8.13 
The Opportunity Area is characterised by a mixture of industrial units, 
agricultural land and tree belts, and any potential routes would 
terminate within open agricultural land. The closest residential 
properties to this area include those located within the Villages of 
Yaxley and Thrandeston, and a number of isolated properties, 
including; The Leys, Boswold Hall, Pimsy Cottage, Whiting, and Malting 
Farm. 
5.8.14 
Should an overhead line Electrical Connection be considered, the 
visual impact would be considerably greater, and it would likely be 
visible from number of viewpoints. 
5.8.15 
As a route corridor through the Opportunity Area has not yet been 
established, it is not possible to state with any certainty where the 
closest receptors may be, however, it is likely that it would be visible to 
residential properties within the Opportunity Area and beyond, and 
likely to include some areas of Eye, Brome, and Wortham. 
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.8.16 
NPS EN-1 states that National Parks, together with the Broads and 
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), have been confirmed 
by the Government as having the highest status of protection in relation 
to landscape and scenic beauty. Where decisions may directly affect 
such areas, paragraph 5.9.9 requires the SoS to have regard to the 
statutory purposes of the potentially affected area/s. The statutory 
duties are provided for in Section 11A(2) of the National Parks and 
Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (National Parks), Section 17A of 
the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 (The Broads) and Section 85 
of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (AONBs). 
5.8.17 
NPS EN-1 confirms that the duty to have regard to the purposes of 
nationally designated areas also applies when considering applications 
for projects outside the boundaries of these areas which may have 
impacts within them. EN-1 confirms ‘That the aim should be to avoid 
compromising the purposes of designation and such projects should be 
designed sensitively given the various siting, operational, and other 
relevant constraints’ (paragraph 5.9.12).  
5.8.18 
Additionally, Paragraph 5.9.13 of EN-1 states that the fact that a 
proposed project is visible from within a designated area should not in 
itself be a reason for refusing consent.

5.8.19 
With respect to the landscape and visual impacts ‘of thermal 
combustion generating stations, the IPC [decision maker] should 
presume that the adverse impacts would be less if a hybrid or direct 
cooling system is used and that developers will use BAT [best available

5.8.23 
Initially, a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan will be generated 
using specialist software. The ZTV will show a maximum theoretical 
visibility of the project across the surrounding area. The ZTV will be 
based solely on topography and proposed height of the plant envelope, 
and any overhead line towers, should an overhead electrical 
connection be pursued No allowance will be made for intervening 
screening vegetation or buildings, although in practice this tends to 
have a substantial mitigating effect.  
5.8.24 
A desk top review of all relevant landscape planning policy will be 
undertaken. Particular attention will be paid to Areas of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty, Areas of High Landscape Value, popular tourist spots 
and viewpoints, and Public Rights of Way.  
5.8.25 
The Power Generation Plant will be discussed in detail including 
dimensions of the larger buildings, the stack heights, and any other 
ancillary infrastructure that may have an impact on the landscape. 
5.8.26 
To  assist  in  the  impact  assessment,  a  site  visit  will  be  made  by  a  
qualified Chartered Landscape Architect, who will assess the study 
area in detail. Additionally, and following engagement with relevant 
stakeholders, a selection of photomontages will be taken from key 
sensitive viewpoints (e.g. residential receptors, designated ecological 
sites, cultural heritage assets, key rights of way).  
5.8.27 
Photomontages would be produced with reference to ‘Photography and 
photomontage in landscape and visual impact assessment Landscape 
Institute Advice Note 01/11’. 
5.8.28 
An appropriate number and choice of viewpoints will be selected for the 
actual assessment. It is proposed that up to nine photomontages would 
be produced to illustrate the development from key views. Suggested 
viewpoint locations for photomontages are: 
� 
View from the B1077 at Victoria Hill, Eye and approximately 800 m 
east of the PGP site 
� 
View towards the site from the public footway running east/west 
along the south of the Airfield.  
� 
View from the northern edge of residential properties along 
Highfield – approximately 800 m south east of the PGP site 
� 
Castleton Way, close to Hartismere School in Eye. 
� 
New Road and north of the junction to the A140 – approximately 
1.0 Km north of Eye Airfield.

site. 
5.8.29 
The photomontages will show a representation of how the proposed 
Power Generation Plant would be viewed within the landscape and will 
be used to inform the assessment of the impact of the development.  
Gas Connection 
5.8.30 
Given that the majority of the Gas Connection will be underground, the 
landscape and visual impact assessment for this element of the work 
will focus solely on the impact of the AGI.  
5.8.31 
This will follow the methodology described above and will be carried out 
in parallel, where possible, using the same view point locations and 
incorporating both elements of the project on photomontages where 
they will be visible in the same view. 
Electrical Connection 
5.8.32 
As for the Gas Connection, if the underground Electrical Connection is 
carried forward, then the LVIA for this element of the work will focus 
solely on the cumulative impact of the substation or sealing end 
compound.  
5.8.33 
If an overhead line is taken forward, the assessment will follow the 
standard LVIA methodology as described above, but will make 
reference to the Holford and Horlock rules where appropriate, 
Potential Mitigation Measures  
Power Generation Plant 
5.8.34 
During construction and decommissioning, embedded mitigation 
measures could include the careful consideration of siting of stockpiles 
and cranes to avoid detrimental impacts on the visual amenity of 
closest receptors. 
5.8.35 
During operation, the main embedded mitigation measures will be the 
careful siting and arrangement of plant. The final architectural design of

the buildings will be carefully considered to provide a high standard of 
visual amenity, given practical and economic constraints.   
5.8.36 
The external structures will be designed such that there will be minimal 
deterioration in the appearance over time.  
5.8.37 
Further, detailed mitigation measures could include the consideration 
for on site or off-site screen planting to screen views of the Power 
Generation Plant.  
5.8.38 
Due regard will be paid to NPS EN-1, EN-2, and EN-5 and the 
guidance they provide on ‘good design’.  
Gas Connection  
5.8.39 
The mitigation for the Gas AGI is anticipated to be the same as that 
described above for the Power Generation Plant. 
Electrical Connection 
5.8.40 
Regardless of if an underground or overhead electrical connection is 
progressed, mitigation will follow principles of good design as described 
in EN-5; for an overhead line this would include: 
� 
avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of highest amenity 
value, by so planning the general route of the line in the first place, 
even if total mileage is somewhat increased in consequence; 
� 
avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest by 
deviation, provided this can be done without using too many angle 
towers, i.e. the bigger structures which are used when lines change 
direction; 
� 
other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp 
changes of direction and thus with fewer angle towers; 
� 
choose tree and hill backgrounds in preference to sky backgrounds 
wherever possible. When a line has to cross a ridge, secure this 
opaque background as long as possible, cross obliquely when a dip 
in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross 
directly, preferably between belts of trees; 
� 
prefer moderately open valleys with woods where the apparent 
height of towers will be reduced, and views of the line will be 
broken by trees; 
� 
where country is flat and sparsely planted, keep the high voltage 
lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging 
routes, distribution poles and other masts, wires and cables, so as 
to avoid a concentration of lines or “wirescape”; and

approach urban areas through industrial zones, where they exist; 
and when pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes 
between the approach line and the substation, carefully assess the 
comparative costs of undergrounding.  
5.9 
Waste Management  
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.9.1 
There are three main phases of the development of the Power 
Generation Plant where solid waste arisings will occur; these are: 
construction, operation and decommissioning.  
5.9.2 
During construction and decommissioning for the Power Generation 
Plant, it is likely that wastes such as concrete, inert builders rubble, 
spoil and scrap metal will be produced.  
5.9.3 
Solid waste from the Power Generation Plant during operation is 
considered to be minimal and will be both non-hazardous and 
hazardous in nature. The wastes produced during the operational 
phase include used air filters, scrap metal, used insulation material, 
general office waste, and other miscellaneous wastes. Small quantities 
of water (blowdown) will be discharged to avoid the build-up of 
impurities in the HRSG steam/water cycle. The blowdown is virtually 
pure water containing very small quantities of various chemical that are 
used to prevent corrosion and scaling in the system. 
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.9.4 
For the Gas and Electrical Connections, waste is only anticipated 
during the construction and decommissioning phases and is likely to bo 
limited to concrete, inert builders rubble, spoil and scrap metal. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.9.5 
Currently the Power Generation Plant site is occupied by previously 
undeveloped agricultural land. The main works associated with the 
development of the Power Generation Plant will be levelling of the site, 
covering in hardstanding and the installation of modest foundations.  
5.9.6 
These activities will involve the generation of waste, some of which will 
need to be safely removed from site.

- 113 - 
 
Gas Connection 
5.9.7 
The possible routes for the Gas Connection will be through the 
agricultural fields and and tracks of the disused Eye Airfield 
5.9.8 
The laying of the Gas Connection will primarily involve the excavation 
of a trench and backfilling with spoil (although drilling techniques may 
be used where the route crosses under roads.  
5.9.9 
These activities will involve the generation of waste, some of which will 
need to be safely removed from site.  
Electrical Connection 
5.9.10 
The possible routes an underground Electrical Connection will be 
through the agricultural fields and and tracks of the disused Eye 
Airfield, continuing west across the A140 and through agricultural fields 
of the Opportunity Area. 
5.9.11 
The laying of the underground Electrical Connection will primarily 
involve the excavation of a trench and backfilling with spoil (although 
drilling techniques may be used where the route crosses under roads 
or watercourses).  
5.9.12 
If an overhead line is installed, the amount of earthworks would be 
reduced, although significant excavations would be required for the 
installation of foundations to support the overhead line towers.  
5.9.13 
These activities will involve the generation of waste, some of which will 
need to be safely removed from site.  
Assessment (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection) 
5.9.14 
The waste management assessment will involve a desk based 
assessment (DBA) including the following elements: 
� 
Identification of relevant legislation, sources of information and 
local strategies and plans; 
� 
Consideration of solid waste arising during the construction, 
operational and decommissioning phase of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections; and  
� 
Demonstrating compliance with the waste hierarchy (e.g. reduce, 
reuse, recycling, recovery and/or disposal) when managing all 
wastes. 
5.9.15 
The assessment of the impacts will include:

- 114 - 
 
� 
Consideration of any relevant consultee responses / requirement; 
� 
An estimation of the likely construction and operational waste 
arisings; 
� 
An assessment of the potential impact of the estimated 
construction and operational waste arisings in the context of 
baseline conditions and local infrastructure capacity; 
� 
Identification and consideration of any best practice measures (to 
minimise or eliminate waste and the adverse effects caused by 
waste) that will be adopted as mitigation. Also looking at where 
reprocessed materials could be used on site; 
� 
An assessment of the significance of projected waste arisings 
following mitigation. Demonstrating how mitigation will reduce the 
impacts/effects of the waste arisings; 
� 
An assessment of the cumulative impacts with other proposed and 
operational schemes; including the EPL poultry litter fuelled 
generating plant and logistics wearhouses of the Mid Suffolk 
Business Park. 
Potential Mitigation Measures (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
5.9.16 
The main embedded mitigation measure which will be employed during 
the construction, operational and decommissioning phases will be to 
minimise the production of waste where practical. Wherever possible, 
waste materials will be re-used or recycled. This will be achieved partly 
through the SWMP. 
5.9.17 
Further, specific mitigation measures, if necessary, will be determined 
through the EIA.  
5.10 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
Introduction 
Power 
Generation 
Plant, 
Gas 
Connection 
and 
Electrical 
Connection 
5.10.1 
The main impacts of the PPP on traffic, transport and access will occur 
during construction. The construction traffic is expected to consist 
mainly of vehicles for the transport of construction personnel to and 
from Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection Route and Electrical 
Connection Route. The construction period (as stated in Section 3.3 of 
this Report) is likely to be between 12 and 36 months depending on the 
final choice of technology.

- 115 - 
 
5.10.2 
There will also be a number of other transport movements during 
construction including civil works traffic, mechanical works traffic and 
heavy/abnormal loads. Total vehicles (heavy goods vehicles, light 
goods vehicles, cars) peak movements will vary depending on the 
phase of construction and the activities which are being undertaken on 
site.  
5.10.3 
The transport of abnormal loads, which may lead to delays and cause 
inconvenience to other road users, would be timed following 
consultation with the relevant authorities to minimise disruption to the 
other road users.  
5.10.4 
Normal operation will naturally result in much fewer traffic movements 
than those associated with construction and will be associated with 
personnel required for operation and maintenance of the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection  As such, 
during operation no significant increase in traffic in the area of the site 
is expected, and no effect on local traffic patterns and infrastructure 
would therefore be anticipated. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection 
5.10.5 
It is likely that access to the Power Generation Plant and Gas 
Connection Route Corridor would be via the A140, entering the site 
from the south, via Castleton Lane and Potash Lane.  
 Electrical Connection 
5.10.6 
It is likely that access to the Electrical Connection Corridor would be via 
the A140, Mellis Road through Yaxley, or Mellis Road through 
Thrandeston. There is also the possibility that a new access road may 
need to be constructed along the route corridor, with main access of 
the A140.  
Assessment (Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical 
Connections) 
5.10.7 
NPS EN 1 states that ‘In relation to transport impacts, following full 
assessment the need for travel plans or other demand management or 
other mitigation should be considered particularly for the construction 
phase (5.13.6), and the decision maker should consider the feasibility 
and cost effectiveness of such measures (paragraph 5.13.8, EN-1)’. 
5.10.8 
The assessment will be undertaken in accordance with the “Guidance 
on Transport Assessment” published by the Department for Transport

and will gauge the likely impact of the proposed PPP on the local road 
network.  
5.10.9 
Comparisons between existing traffic flows and estimates of likely 
traffic flows on potentially affected roads will be made. It will then be 
established whether significant effects are likely. This will take into 
account: the sensitivity of receptors; the resources likely to be affected; 
any potential for disruption to local routes; and, any changes in the 
composition of traffic. If considered necessary, traffic surveys would be 
undertaken which would further quantify the number of vehicle 
movements on the existing road network in the vicinity of the site.  
5.10.10 
The majority of the proposed access routes are ‘main roads’ that do not 
have pavements for pedestrian use. Nonetheless, the traffic 
assessment will also take full account of the potential impact on 
pedestrians, and will ensure that pedestrians and other road users 
(cyclists) are not cut off from amenity areas as a result of the works.  
5.10.11 
The proposed assessment requires consideration of the following: 
access and construction routes and the types of vehicles used; local 
highway and rail networks; existing traffic flows; current traffic 
generation; road traffic accident information; predicted traffic trends; 
local highway improvements and planned works; and, potential 
receptors.  
5.10.12 
Discussions will be held with the Highways Agency, Suffolk County 
Council, and Mid Suffolk District Council to identify any existing issues 
relating to traffic in the area. Information will also be sought on future 
projects in the area that could give rise to a significant cumulative 
impact when considered in conjunction with the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections. 
Potential Mitigation Measures (Power Generation Plant, Gas and 
Electrical Connections) 
5.10.13 
The main potential impacts on traffic movements are likely to be 
associated with the construction phase of the development. During 
construction, opportunities for reducing traffic movements will be 
explored, such as car share schemes, shift working (i.e. not all 
construction traffic arriving at site at once) or the use of minibuses 
through the production of a Travel Plan for the construction and 
operational phases of the PPP.

Cultural Heritage and Archaeology 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.11.1 
This Section of the ES will provide an assessment of the significance of 
the archaeological and cultural heritage assets present at the site of the 
Power Generation Plant and its immediate environs, and the likely 
significant effects that the construction, operation and decommissioning 
of the Power Generation Plant may have on these resources.  
Gas and Electrical Connection 
5.11.2 
Separate Sections of the ES will be produced which describe the likely 
significant effects that the Gas and Electrical Connections may have on 
the archaeological resource present along the connection route 
corridors.  
5.11.3 
The objectives of these assessments are to: 
� 
Describe the survival and extent of any archaeological features that 
may 
be 
disturbed 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection;  
� 
Provide an assessment of the importance of these assets;  
� 
Assess the likely scale of any impacts on the archaeological and 
cultural heritage resource posed by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection;  
� 
Outline suitable mitigation measures to prevent, reduce and where 
possible offset any significant adverse effects; and 
� 
Provide an assessment of any residual effects remaining after 
mitigation.  
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.11.4 
The site of the proposed Power Generation Plant has been developed 
as an industrial estate, following the closure of the WW2 air field and is 
currently occupied by a mixture of modern industrial and older military 
buildings and agricultural land, with some tree belts.  
5.11.5 
The Eye Airfield also accommodates a number of original military 
buildings. In terms of cultural heritage interest, the Airfield itself is of

- 118 - 
 
course a heritage site. The Airfield is bound on the west by the line of a 
former Roman road. Most of the runways still survive, together with a 
lych-gate, 50 hardstandings, two T2-type hangars, a Nissen hut and 
various other buildings. All of these are mentioned within the Historic 
Environment Record (HER). Several listed buildings and conservation 
areas are in the vicinity of the Airfield, including Eye and Thrandeston 
Conservation Areas. Within Eye, there are several Grade I Listed 
buildings included within a cluster of buildings in the vicinity of the 
junction of Castleton Way and Victoria Hill (the B1077). 
5.11.6 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments within 2 km of the Power Generation 
Plant site include:  
� 
St Mary’s Church – approximately 1.3 km north of the site 
boundary;  
� 
Moated site immediately south east of St Mary’s Church 
(approximately 1 km east of the northern tip of the airfield); 
� 
Eye Castle – approximately 2 km from centre of the site; 
� 
Remains of Eye Priory at Abbey Farm (Eye Priory Guest House): 2 
km south east of the site; 
5.11.7 
There are likely to be some large structures associated with the 
development of the Power Generation Plant which may be visible from 
these listed buildings. However, the development of the Power 
Generation Plant would not alter the already industrial make up of the 
site and surrounding area, and it is not anticipated that the project 
would impact on the immediate setting or appreciation of these 
buildings.  
5.11.8 
During construction, the main potential impacts on any archaeological 
and cultural heritage assets, will be the potential disturbance of buried 
archaeological remains, both known and unknown.  
5.11.9 
The presence of previously unknown archaeological assets present on 
the Power Generation Plant site should not be ruled out due to areas of 
undisturbed ground.  
Gas Connection 
5.11.10 
The possible route corridors of the Gas Connection will run under 
agricultural land / adjacent to the runway at Eye Airfield.  
5.11.11 
There remains the potential for the Gas Connection to impact on the 
buried archaeological resource, as it is likely that it will be constructed 
in previously un-developed agricultural land.

Electrical Connection  
5.11.12 
The possible route corridors of the Electrical Connection will run over / 
under agricultural fields and crossing the main A140 road.  
5.11.13 
In the wider vicinity of the proposed project, there are other Scheduled 
Monuments, which may be impacted by the Electrical Connection, 
including: 
� 
Scole Roman Settlement – 4 km north east from the site; 
� 
Barn at Rook Hall – 2.5 km south from the centre of the site; and  
� 
Moated Site at Gate Farm – 4 km south east. 
5.11.14 
Should an overhead electrical connection be considered, further 
consideration to the setting of these heritage sites will be given, 
considering the potential impact from pylons. 
5.11.15 
There remains the potential for the Electrical Connection to impact on 
the buried archaeological resource, as it is likely that it will be 
constructed in previously un-developed agricultural land.  
5.11.16 
There are likely to be large items of plant involved in the construction of 
all aspects of the PPP (e.g. cranes). However, these would be 
temporary structures, and given the distance from sensitive receptors 
(e.g. listed buildings) they are not anticipated to impact on the setting of 
these assets.  
5.11.17 
The main potential impacts during operation are therefore likely to be 
those on the setting of above ground assets resulting from the Power 
Generation Plant and potentially from overhead lines / pylons from the 
Electrical Connection if this is constructed above ground.  
Assessment  
Power Generation Plant  
5.11.18 
NPS EN-1 states that in relation to the setting of heritage assets, the 
decision maker ‘should treat favourably applications that preserve 
those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to, or 
better reveal the significance of, the asset. When considering 
applications that do not do this, the IPC [decision maker] should weigh 
any negative effects against the wider benefits of the application’ 
(paragraph 5.8.18, EN-1).  
5.11.19 
Initially, a DBA will be undertaken, and will include the following 
detailed searches:

� 
The National Heritage List for England contains an archive for the 
historic environment of England and hosts an online search facility; 
� 
Historic Mapping; and 
� 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation.  
5.11.20 
The DBA will be undertaken in accordance with ‘Standard and 
Guidance 
for 
Archaeological 
Assessments’ 
(Institute 
for 
Archaeologists, 2011).  
5.11.21 
It is proposed that initially, searches are limited to 1 km for HER entries.  
5.11.22 
As part of the DBA, a site inspection would be undertaken in order to 
identify any previously unknown archaeological features and their 
condition. During the site inspection a detailed photographic record 
would be maintained.  
5.11.23 
At this stage, no intrusive investigations are proposed for cultural 
heritage or archaeological purposes, although this will be confirmed (or 
otherwise) based on the findings of the DBA, and in consultation with 
the English Heritage and Mid Suffolk District Council. Should intrusive 
investigations be necessary, their scope would be agreed with the 
Planning Archaeologist through a Written Scheme of Investigation 
(WSI). 
5.11.24 
In order to gather baseline setting data, and to undertake an 
assessment of the potential impacts that the development may have on 
the setting of any above ground remains, selected heritage assets will 
be visited. This will follow an initial study making reference to the 
results of desk-based research, and the ZTV including searches of the 
records listed above. Assets will be visited where this initial study 
indicated potential for significant impacts. Both the asset and its 
surrounding area will be visited to identify third locations that might be 
relevant to the asset’s setting. 
5.11.25 
For the purposes of the setting study, the following assets will be 
considered: 
� 
Scheduled Monuments; 
� 
Listed Buildings; 
� 
Registered Parks and Gardens; 
� 
Registered Battlefields;

Any other non-scheduled building which is considered to be 
important in terms of cultural heritage and archaeological 
significance.  
5.11.26 
It is proposed that the search area for these assets will be limited to 5 
km from the centre of the proposed Power Generation Plant, as, based 
on experience of similar developments, significant impacts on setting 
are unlikely to occur beyond 5 km. However, should significant impacts 
be identified at 5 km, then the search area would be expended 
accordingly.  
5.11.27 
NPS EN-1 states in relation to the setting of heritage assets that the 
decision maker ‘should treat favourably applications that preserve 
those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to, or 
better reveal the significance of, the asset. When considering 
applications that do not do this, the IPC [decision maker] should weigh 
any negative effects against the wider benefits of the application’ 
(paragraph 5.8.18, EN-1). 
5.11.28 
The following factors are also considered to be relevant when 
assessing impacts upon setting:  
� 
Visual Dominance;  
� 
Scale;  
� 
Intervisibility; 
� 
Vistas and Sight Lines; 
� 
Movement and Light; and  
� 
Unaltered settings. 
5.11.29 
The DBA will form the baseline data for the Cultural Heritage and 
Archaeology Section of the ES. The ES Section will discuss the nature 
and location of all cultural heritage and archaeological sites within the 
Scheme Area. Further to this, the ES will provide an assessment of the 
significance of any impacts to the cultural heritage and archaeology 
sites. Where necessary, recommendations will be made for a mitigation 
strategy to preserve in-situ any significant archaeological assets. The 
ES will also include a mitigation strategy for any significant impacts to 
listed buildings and other above – ground assets.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.11.30 
It is proposed that the same assessment methodology is used for 
assessing potential impacts of the Gas and Electrical Connections.

Potential Mitigation Measures (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
5.11.31 
Prior to construction the nature and extent of archaeology present at 
the site and surrounding areas should have been established. 
However, should any archaeological remains be found during 
construction, work will be halted and advice sought from the Council 
archaeologist.  
5.11.32 
During operation, there may be an opportunity to provide screen 
planting, should the development give rise to any adverse impacts on 
above ground heritage assets.  
5.12 
Socio-economics 
Introduction (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection)  
5.12.1 
At its peak, the construction workforce is expected to employ between 
150 and 250 personnel depending on the type of technology chosen. 
Whilst subject to procurement rules it is anticipated that as much as 
possible of this workforce will be recruited locally.  
5.12.2 
Operation of the Power Generation Plant would require up to 30 full 
time staff (for CCGT operation) although for other technology choices 
this number would be of the order of 10 to 15. There may be further 
indirect 
jobs 
for 
contracted 
engineering 
staff 
during 
regular 
maintenance shutdowns and regular maintenance of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections.  
5.12.3 
A recent Report by Ernst and Young entitled “Powering the UK – 
Investing for the future of the Energy Sector and the UK” has estimated 
that direct employment in the energy sector “......grew from 83,000 to 
137,000 between 2008 and 2011, with growth of 6% between 2010 and 
2011. The indirect employment benefit is over three times the direct 
benefit bringing the total number of jobs supported by the sector to 
around 655,000”. 
5.12.4 
Local companies may provide further unskilled and semi-skilled 
services to the development during operations and it is anticipated 
that new jobs may be created on the basis of the levels of permanent 
staff in these local service industries. There may also be periodic 
requirements for ground maintenance, ad hoc plant maintenance and 
annual plant maintenance creating additional economic activity.  
5.12.5 
The total capital cost of the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to be 
of the order of £200 million. Up to approximately 35% of this will be

construction, civils and fabrication work which would be open to tender 
from companies in the area (if CCGT technology is chosen). 
5.12.6 
During construction, those workers not from the local area would 
require places to stay, and regular sustenance, delivering knock on 
benefits to local businesses and services.  
5.12.7 
In addition, the PPP would also represent an additional income source 
to the local economy during the operational phase in terms of local 
employment and the use of local services and suppliers.  
5.12.8 
PPL will investigate, with key stakeholders, a method for providing 
benefits to the local community which go beyond the creation of jobs. 
Baseline (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection) 
5.12.9 
The area surrounding the PPP has a long history of agriculture. 
Historically, the Eye Airfield and surrounding Business Park and 
Industrial Parks were areas of land used for agriculture. 
5.12.10 
Mid Suffolk district was formed on the 1st of April 1974. It has a total of 
122 parishes and towns covering an area of 871.1 squared km. 
5.12.11 
The population for 2011 was estimated to be 97,100 ranking 241st out 
of 326 English Districts. 
5.12.12 
82.1 % of the total population are in employment compared to a 76.7% 
estimate for the rest of Great Britain
6.  
5.12.13 
Job Seekers Allowance in Mid Suffolk District amounts to 1,127 people, 
representing 1.9% of the population compared to 3.9% for the rest of 
Great Britain
7.  
5.12.14 
The employment structure of Mid Suffolk District is dominated by the 
services sector, accounting for 68.1% of the total labour force whilst 
construction and manufacturing account for 10.1% and 15.3% 
respectively
8. 
5.12.15 
The ‘Overall Spatial Vision’ of the Core Strategy DPD of Mid town of 
Suffolk District Council states that: ‘By 2021 the East of England will be

realising its economic potential and providing a high quality of life for its 
people, including by meeting their housing needs in sustainable 
inclusive communities. At the same time it will reduce its impact on 
climate change and the environment, including through savings in 
energy and water use and by strengthening its stock of environmental 
assets.’

Assessment 
Methodology 
(Power 
Generation 
Plant, 
Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection)  
5.12.20 
NPS EN-1 states that in relation to socio-economic impacts ‘the 
assessment should consider all relevant socio-economic impacts’ 
(paragraph 5.12.3, EN-1) such as tourism, influxes of workers, and 
cumulative impacts.  
5.12.21 
There is currently no established EIA methodology for the assessment 
of socio-economic impacts. To assess the socio-economic impacts the 
“Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment” (May 1994) 
produced by the Interorganizational Committee on Guidelines and 
Principles for Social Impact Assessment will be used. 
5.12.22 
The socio-economic impact of the PPP will be addressed for the 
construction, operational and decommissioning phases. The socio-
economic make-up of the area surrounding the PPP will be described 
and the likely impacts on this baseline will be assessed.

5.12.23 
The study area will extend to cover the immediate area of Mid Suffolk 
and the wider area of eastern England, in order to assess the likely 
effects that may be experienced within the local community.  
5.12.24 
The methodology for the socio-economic impact assessment will be 
based on the collection of a wide range of data and information from 
published materials, plus consultation with the local authority and key 
stakeholders. Key information to be consulted will include: 
� 
Population characteristics (population dynamics); 
� 
Community and institutional structures (employment, training, skills 
and qualifications, economic investment, business development 
and equal opportunities); 
� 
Individual and family changes (perceptions of risk, attitudes 
towards the project, social well-being); and 
� 
Community resources (security, access to local amenities including 
the canal and Public Rights of Way (PRoWs)). 
Potential Project Enhancements 
5.12.25 
During construction, operation and decommissioning, an effort will be 
made to use local goods and services, wherever possible.  
5.13 
Cumulative Assessment  
5.13.1 
In line with the EIA Regulations, the EIA will take into account other 
existing and planned developments (currently within the planning 
system) in the area of the proposed site, and will consider the 
cumulative impacts associated with these developments in conjunction 
with the PPP. 
5.13.2 
The EIA for the Power Generation Plant will consider the cumulative 
impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections, noting that 
the Electrical Connection may or may not be consented under the 
Planning Act 2008 regime together with the Power Generation Plant 
and Gas Connection. 
5.13.3 
At present, we foresee that the following developments will be 
considered as part of the cumulative assessment:  
� 
The existing and proposed wind farms (Roy Humphrey and Baldwin 
Wind Farm respectively) developed to north of the proposed PPP 
site and to the south east of the proposed site respectively;

� 
The existing Power Plant immediately north of the proposed site for 
the PPP; and 
� 
The Gas Compressor Station located adjacent to the proposed 
PPP site to the east.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Parsons Brinckerhoff was commissioned by Progress Power Limited to undertake a preliminary
ecological study in respect of a proposed new thermal generating station on land at Eye Airfield
Industrial Estate located in Eye, mid-Suffolk (referred to as the ‘Power Generation Plant (PGP).  The
PGP will be designed to provide an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts Electrical (MWe) and
would be fuelled by natural gas.  As such, it will require a new electrical connection to export power
from the PGP to the National Grid (referred to as the ‘Electrical Connection’) and a new gas pipeline
to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the National Gas Transmission Network
(referred to as the ‘Gas Connection’).  The Power Generation Plant (PGP), Gas Connection and
Electrical Connection together are referred to as the Progress Power Project (PPP).  This report deals
only with the PGP and Gas Connection Route corridors (GCRC), with the electrical connection route
corridors considered in a separate report.
The ecological study comprised an Extended Phase 1 Habitat survey, badger survey and great
crested newt (GCN) Habitat Suitability Index assessment (HSI).  The survey area included the
footprint of the proposed Power Generation Plant and an indicative route for the Gas Connection (this
route is subject to further review and will be refined at a later date).
A desk study was undertaken to review records of protected / notable species and habitats within a
defined search area.  The search radius was 10 km from the site boundary for all statutory designated
sites and bat records, 2 km for non-statutory designated sites, and 1 km for all other protected /
notable species.  As the indicative routes proposed for the Gas and Connection will later be refined,
separate desk studies were carried out for the proposed PGP site and the Gas Connections.
Twenty nine statutory designated sites were identified within the 10 km search radius, although only
two of these are of international importance and seven of national importance.  The remainder of the
statutory designated sites are ancient woodland.  Two non-statutory designated sites were noted
within the 2 km search radius.  Records were received for a number of protected and notable species
within the search area including bats, birds, amphibians, invertebrates and plants.
A Phase 1 Habitat Survey was undertaken on 28th March 2013.  This assessed the ecological value of
the PPP site, namely the proposed footprints of the Power Generation Plant and associated Gas
Connections, and recorded any protected habitats and evidence of / potential for any protected or
notable species on site or within the relevant surrounding area.
The survey area comprises an arable landscape, with hedgerows, dense scrub, scattered trees and
hardstanding along the respective arable boundaries, with a small linear plantation to the east.
Industrial areas are located on the far side of these features to the north, east and west, with further
arable land around the remaining aspects.  The A140 road is located to the west of both sites.
A badger survey was also undertaken alongside the Phase 1 Habitat survey on 28th March 2013.  The
survey footprint extended 30 m beyond the proposed PGP site and Gas Connection Route Corridor
boundaries where access and visibility allowed.  The methodology was based on the standard
approach detailed in Surveying Badgers (Harris et al., 1989).  Particular emphasis was placed on
locating badger setts and signs of territorial activity.
No badger setts or signs of badger activity were noted during the survey of the proposed Power
Generation Plant or GCRC.  No evidence of latrines, pathways or snuffle holes was found along the
arable margins or accessible grassland areas beyond the site boundary.  No badger pathways were
similarly discovered although the presence of a nearby roadkill indicates badgers are active in the
wider area.  Occasional through passage cannot therefore be entirely discounted from either site.
A GCN HSI was also carried out at the same time of the Phase 1 Habitat survey to determine the

likelihood of presence within the immediate surrounds of the PGP and Gas Connection Route
Corridors.  Twenty-six ponds within 500 m of the combined footprint of the proposed PGP and
associated Gas Connections were surveyed on 28th March 2013.
The Habitat Suitability Index assessment (HSI) is a tool which enables an assessment of the
likelihood of a water body to support GCN.  It incorporates 10 suitability indices (SI), all of which are
factors thought to affect GCN.  The results of the pond HSI indicate that the PGP site and Gas
Connection Route Corridor holds some potential for GCN.
The terrestrial habitat is considered to be sub-optimal for the species although the surrounding pond
density is considered to be conversely strong.  The occurrence of this species cannot therefore be
discounted without further survey.
Seven ponds / ditches (ponds 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and ditch 14) were considered to score sufficiently high
to warrant further survey.  Four GCN surveys are required to determine presence / likely absence
from those suitable ponds within 250 m of the PGP and Gas Connection Route Corridors.  Two further
surveys will be required in addition to these to complete a population assessment if GCN are found to
be present.
In addition, Phase 2 species surveys are also recommended for breeding birds, wintering birds and
bats in order to determine presence / absence, levels of activity and species diversity.  The results of
the Phase 2 surveys will be required in order to inform the detailed design of the proposals and an
assessment of impacts resulting from the proposed these two elements of the PPP.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
Parsons Brinckerhoff was commissioned by Progress Power Limited to undertake a
preliminary ecological study in respect of a proposed new thermal generating station
on land at Eye Airfield Industrial Estate located in Eye, mid-Suffolk (referred to as the
‘Power Generation Plant).  The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide
an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts Electrical (MWe) and would be fuelled by
natural gas.  As such, it will require a new electrical connection to export power from
the Power Generation Plant to the National Grid (referred to as the ‘Electrical
Connection’) and a new gas pipeline to bring natural gas to the Power Generation
Plant from the National Gas Transmission Network (referred to as the ‘Gas
Connection’).  The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical
Connection together are referred to as the Progress Power Project (PPP).  This report
deals only with the PGP and gas connection route corridors, with the electrical
connection route corridors considered in a separate report.
1.1.2
The ecological study comprised an Extended Phase 1 Habitat survey, badger survey
and great crested newt (GCN) Habitat Suitability Index assessment (HSI).  A previous
survey of the site and wider surrounds was undertaken by Lloydbore Landscape and
Ecology in 20111.  The results and findings of this have been taken into consideration
within this report where appropriate and applicable.
1.1.3
The purpose of the Extended Phase 1 Habitat survey was to document the baseline
ecological conditions, identify any designated sites, and ascertain the likely presence
of protected / notable species that would require further, more detailed (Phase 2)
surveys.  The aim of the badger survey was to determine the presence or likely
absence of badger activity within the immediate surrounds of the PPP site.  Similarly,
the HSI was carried out to assess the likelihood of GCN presence and determine the
need for further survey work.
1.1.4
The survey area included the footprint of the proposed Power Generation Plant and
an indicative route for the Gas Connections.  The Power Generation Plant footprint is
considered unlikely to change whereas the indicative route for the Electrical and Gas
Connections is subject to further review.  The indicative route also only forms part of
the entire connection at this stage, and therefore additional surveys will be
undertaken once the design is later refined.
1.2
Site Context
1.2.1
The proposed Power Generation Plant and associated Gas Connections are both
located approximately 1.5 km  north-west from the centre of Eye village, mid-Suffolk.
The approximate central grid reference of the Power Generation Plant is TM 132 751.
Power Generation Plant
1.2.2
The proposed site for the Power Generation Plant is situated within an arable field.
The immediate surrounds include hedgerows, hardstanding and the former Eye
Airfield runway which bounds the western perimeter.  Industrial areas are located on
the far side of these features to the north, east and west, with further arable land
around the remaining aspects.  The A140 road is located approximately 400 m to the
west of the Power Generation Plant site.

Gas Connection
1.2.3
The indicative route surveyed for Gas Connection follows the former Eye Airfield
runway and extends across arable fields (as detailed within Figure 07).  Eye Airfield
Industrial Estate is located to the north of the route with arable fields to the east, south
and west.  The A140 is located approximately 20 m from the nearest point of the
proposed Gas Connection.  Castleton Way is also located a short distance,
approximately 60 m from the southern end of the Gas Connection.
1.3
Planning and Legislation Context
1.3.1
Relevant wildlife and countryside legislation have been used along with planning
policy guidance and local and national Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP) to inform this
assessment.  Their context and applicability is explained as appropriate in the relevant
sections of the report and additional details are presented in Appendix A.

habitats within a defined search area.  The search radius was 10 km from the site
boundary for all statutory designated sites and bat records, 2 km for non-statutory
designated sites, and 1 km for all other protected / notable species.
2.1.2
As the indicative routes proposed for the Gas Connections will later be refined,
separate desk studies were carried out for the proposed Power Generation Plant site
and the Gas Connection route corridors.  The respective search radii were considered
suitable for the scale and type of the proposed developments.

2.2
Phase 1 Habitat Survey
2.2.1
A Phase 1 Habitat survey was undertaken on 28th March 2013.  This assessed the
ecological value of the proposed footprint of the Power Generation Plant and the
indicative route of the Gas Connections, and recorded any protected habitats and
evidence of / potential for any protected or notable species on site or within the
relevant surrounding area.
2.2.2
The Extended Phase 1 Habitat survey followed standard methodology published by
the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)8.  This methodology is a
standardised technique for rapidly obtaining baseline ecological information over a
large area of land.  All habitat types present on site were recorded on Phase 1 Habitat
Maps and dominant plant species were recorded in accordance with standard
nomenclature9.
2.2.3
In accordance with best practice, the standard survey methodology was extended to
consider and include all protected / notable fauna and habitats suitable to support
them10.  Any incidental records or evidence of species were target noted on a
separate map and each habitat was evaluated for its potential to support protected or
notable species.
2.3
Badger Survey
2.3.1
A badger survey was undertaken on 28th March 2013.  The survey footprint extended
30 m beyond the proposed Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection boundaries
where access and visibility allowed.  The methodology was based on the standard
approach detailed in Surveying Badgers (Harris et al., 198911).  Particular emphasis
was placed on locating badger setts and signs of territorial activity.
2.3.2
The following field signs were sought during the survey:
� 
Setts - comprising either single isolated holes or a series of holes, likely to be
interconnected underground;
� 
Dung pits / latrines - badgers usually deposit faeces in characteristic excavated
pits, concentrations of which (latrines) are typically found along territory range
boundaries;
� 
Paths -  between setts or leading to feeding areas;
� 
Scratching posts - at the base of tree trunks;
� 
Snuffle holes - small scrapes where badgers have searched for invertebrates,
earthworms and plant tubers;
� 
Laying up sites - bundles of grass and other vegetation where badgers may
sleep above ground;
� 
Hairs; and

Paw prints.
2.3.3
Any setts present on site were categorised in accordance with the nationally
recognised sett classification criteria as either main, annexe, subsidiary or outlier.
Summary definitions for these categorisations are presented in Table 2.1 below.
Table 2.1: Sett Categories
Sett Category
Description
Main
A main sett has several entrance holes with high levels of activity,
including large spoil mounds, fresh excavated earth, well marked paths
and usually a fresh latrine present.  There is often evidence of discarded
bedding, which may indicate breeding.
Annexe
Close to a main sett and usually clearly linked to the nearby main sett by
well-worn paths.  Normally active with several holes, although with some
holes displaying less obvious signs of badger activity.
Subsidiary
Generally less than five entrance holes and at least 50 m from a main
sett and without obvious linking paths.  The usage of the holes can be
very variable and they are often much less consistently in use than those
of main or annexe setts.
Outlier
Usually consist of a single or double hole with varying levels of activity.
2.3.4
The level of usage of all badger setts was also classified as A, B or C, where possible
and appropriate.  Details of these categories are presented in Table 2.2.
Table 2.2: Definition of Badger Sett Usage
Level of Usage
Description
Well used (A)
Badger holes generally clear of all vegetation, litter or debris, except
where bedding has been left in the entrance.  They are likely to show
signs of wear at the entrance or new digging.
Partly used (B)
Leaves or twigs in badger entrance holes, which have not been cleared by
regular use, although may be brought into regular use with relatively little
clearance.
Disused (C)
Badger holes show no signs of recent use, often partly or wholly blocked
and may require considerable digging or cleaning to re-open.
2.3.5
There is no established standard or recognised approach for evaluating the nature
conservation importance of badgers and their social groups.  The presence of
badgers within any proposed development therefore requires careful consideration
and there are several factors to address in the nature conservation evaluation
process.  This includes the presence, number and size of active badger setts, which
can provide some indication of badger density and potential number of badger clans,
extent of foraging and availability of suitable habitat for badger dispersal.

Great Crested Newt Habitat Suitability Index Assessment
2.4.1
Twenty-six ponds within 500 m of the combined footprint of the proposed power plant
and associated gas infrastructure were surveyed on 28th March 2013.

2.4.2
The Habitat Suitability Index assessment (HSI) is a tool which enables an assessment
of the likelihood of a water body to support GCN12.  It incorporates 10 suitability
indices (SI), all of which are factors thought to affect GCN, as detailed in Table 2.3
below.

2.4.3
Each variable is assessed separately and then mathematically combined in the
following formula, HSI = (SI1*SI2*SI3*SI4*SI5*SI6*SI7*SI8*SI9*SI10)1/10 to provide the
geometric mean, which is a numerical index between 0 and 1.  A lower score
indicates a less suitable habitat whereas a higher score represents optimal conditions
favourable for GCN as detailed in Table 2.4 below.  There is a positive correlation
between the scores and the resulting incidence of GCN observed in ponds.  However,
whilst the HSI can be used to help inform the likelihood of presence or absence it is
not sufficiently precise to allow conclusion that a higher score confirms presence and
likewise a lower score absence. HSI is therefore used as a guide to help determine
the need for further GCN surveys.

Survey Limitations
2.5.1
A number of botanical species could have been missed during the Phase 1 Habitat
survey as this was undertaken outside the main flowering season.  However, the
conditions and time of year were conversely suitable for mapping broad habitat

categories and therefore this limitation is not considered to negatively affect the
overall integrity of the survey.
2.5.2
Access constraints also limited the extent of land outside of the site boundary which
could be included within the survey.  Most notably, this affected the Phase 1 Habitat
survey of land beyond the eastern perimeter of the proposed Power Generation Plant
site, and 14 ponds within the HSI survey.  However, any gaps in the survey
information were compensated for using available desktop information to help make
informed decisions.  Although this is not a direct substitute for field surveys, this is not
considered to be a significant limitation due to the availability and quality of aerial
photographs and OS maps in order to inform the need for GCN surveys.

3.2
Phase 1 Habitat Survey
Power Generation Plant
3.2.1
Ten habitats were identified during the Phase 1 Habitat survey of the proposed Power
Generation Plant footprint.  Further details of each habitat is provided below and
presented on a map within Appendix D. Alpha-numeric codes below cross-refer to the
JNCC Phase 1 Habitat survey habitat classifications.
Plantation Woodland – A.1.2
3.2.2
The eastern surrounds of the site features a small linear plantation on the far side of a
narrow ride.  The stand is dominated by sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) with
occasional blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and elder (Sambucus nigra) along the
nearside edge.  The plantation affords nesting and foraging habitat for birds, and
potential foraging and dispersal opportunities for bats.
Dense Scrub – A.2.1
3.2.3
The eastern borders and immediate surrounds support dense stands of bramble
(Rubus fruticosus agg.).  A linear strip of bramble runs along the perimeter, with a
dense unmanaged stand located nearby beyond the north-eastern corner.  Both
areas are dominated with bramble, with occasional dog rose (Rosa canina) also
present.
3.2.4
Small strips of bramble were also found along the dog-legged northern boundary.  An
adjacent site, which was not accessible for means of survey, also supports the
following species around the respective site perimeter: cherry (Prunus spp.), dogwood
(Cornus sanguinea), elder, field maple (Acer campestre), hazel and Scot’s pine
(Pinus sylvestris).
3.2.5
The scrub affords valuable nesting and foraging opportunities for birds, and may also
be of value to commuting and foraging bats.  The habitat is also likely to provide
dispersal, foraging and shelter resources to invertebrates and small mammals.
Poor Semi-improved Grassland – B.6
3.2.6
The eastern surrounds of the site supports a small ride which runs north-south on the
far-side of the bramble dominated boundary.  The sward is short and regularly
disturbed by horse traffic.  Species along the ride include annual meadow grass (Poa
annua), cock’s foot (Dactylis glomerata), common daisy (Belis perennis) and
perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne).  Bryophytes were also frequent within the
sward although these were not identified at the time of survey.  The surrounding scrub
and plantation on either side of the ride provides a sheltered corridor suitable for
foraging bats and invertebrates.
Tall Ruderal – C.3
3.2.7
The northernmost part of the site features a large area of tall ruderal vegetation.
Species include common nettle (Urtica dioica), dock (Rumex spp.), hogweed
(Heracleum sphondylium), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and thistle (Cirsium spp.),
with occasional grasses in-between.  The habitat offers foraging opportunities to
invertebrates and seed eating birds.

Spoil Heap – I.2.2
3.2.8
The south-eastern corner of the site features a large spoil heap which is sparsely
covered with grasses and tall ruderal vegetation.  The habitat is considered to be of
little biodiversity interest due to the present level of vegetation cover.
Arable – J.1.1
3.2.9
The site is located within one large arable field recently planted with perennial rye-
grass.  The narrow margins of the field support a short sward with the following
species: annual meadow-grass, cock’s foot, common daisy, cranesbill and false oat-
grass (Arrhenatherum elatius).  The field is of little biodiversity interest although may
offer suitable habitat for skylark and brown hare.
Amenity Grassland – J.2
3.2.10
The northern surrounds of the site feature a short managed sward.  These areas are
located off-site, within and surrounding the western frontage of the adjacent site.
Species within the sward includes annual meadow grass, common daisy, dandelion
(Taraxacum agg.), perennial rye-grass and ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata).
Areas of amenity grassland are considered to be of little biodiversity interest due to
the short height and limited diversity of the sward.
Species-Poor Hedge with Trees – J.2.3.2
3.2.11
The doglegged northern boundary features a hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna)
dominated hedgerow with ash and sycamore standards.  An adjoining hedgerow,
which connects to the western end of this, is formed from beech (Fagus sylvatica)
with sycamore standards.  These two hedgerows form part of the adjacent site
perimeter.
3.2.12
A third hedge is located off-site beyond the south-eastern corner.  The hedge runs
east-west and is dominated by blackthorn with sycamore standards.  The hedgerows
afford nesting and foraging habitat for birds, and potential commuting and foraging
opportunities for bats.  The respective field layers are sparsely vegetated and
therefore of little biodiversity interest.
Earthbank – J.2.8
3.2.13
The northern and southern surrounds of the site support earthbanks which have been
installed to restrict vehicular access across the former Airfield site.  The earthbanks
are vegetated with a mixture of grasses and tall ruderal vegetation including cock’s
foot, common nettle, perennial rye-grass and thistle.  The habitat is considered to be
of limited biodiversity interest, although may afford dispersal opportunities to
invertebrates and small mammals across the hardstanding areas.
Hardstanding – No reference code
3.2.14
The southern and western surrounds of the site feature the former hardstanding
runway for Eye Airfield.  This habitat is not considered to support any biodiversity
interest.

Gas Connections
3.2.15
Eight habitats were identified during the Phase 1 Habitat survey of the indicative route
surveyed for the Gas Connection Route Corridor.  Further details of each habitat is
provided below and presented on a map within Appendix C.
Plantation Woodland – A.1.2
3.2.16
The middle of the indicative route runs parallel to a small shelter belt plantation.
Species within the stand include ash, poplar spp., silver birch and sycamore.  A
number of semi-mature ash and sycamore trees along the field edge have also been
pollarded.  The plantation affords nesting and foraging habitat for birds, and potential
foraging and dispersal opportunities for bats.  The trees are not of sufficient size or
stature or with suitable structural damage to otherwise afford bat roosting opportunity.
Scattered Trees – A.3.1
3.2.17
The indicative route follows a tree line with scattered scrub underneath to the west of
the former runway.  Species within these areas include ash, dog rose, elder and
Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra var. italica).  The trees offer opportunities to bats,
birds and invertebrates, although none are considered of suitable structure for
roosting bats.
3.2.18
The margins of the A140 support semi-mature English oak and sycamore, affording
some level of visual screening.  The immediate southern surrounds of the indicative
route also support a small number of scattered ash trees.  The trees provide suitable
nesting and foraging habitat for birds and foraging opportunities for bats although
none of these were considered suitable for roosting bats.
Arable – J.1.1
3.2.19
The indicative route cuts through and closely borders several arable fields.  Species
within the respective arable margins include annual meadow grass, cock’s foot, dock,
false oat grass and ribwort plantain.  The arable margins alongside the former runway
also support scattered bramble, goat willow (Salix caprea) and elder.
3.2.20
The arable habitat is considered to be of no biodiversity interest due to the lack of
vegetative cover and the level of traffic running through the site.  The associated
disturbance is likely to discourage brown hare and skylark from using areas which
immediately border the former runway.  The scattered scrub conversely affords
limited opportunity to nesting and foraging birds although is also likely to be impacted
by the level of disturbance.
Species-Rich Hedge with Trees – J.2.3.1
3.2.21
The indicative route runs along a short hedgerow to the west of the former runway
beneath the adjacent factory.  Species within the hedge include ash, dogwood, elder,
hawthorn, oak and sycamore.  The hedge ends approximately halfway along the
factory premises and is replaced with a tree line and scattered scrub.  The hedge
affords nesting and foraging habitat for birds, and commuting and foraging
opportunities for bats.  The hedges may also provide refuge and foraging resources
for invertebrates and small mammals.

- 38 -
3.2.22
Species-rich hedgerows are a Suffolk BAP priority habitat.  However, the hedgerow is
not considered to be of sufficient length or value to qualify as an important hedgerow
in accordance with the criteria provided in Appendix C.
Species-Poor Hedge with Trees – J.2.3.2
3.2.23
The western edge of the indicative route cuts through a tree line near to the A140.
Although this is no longer a hedge, it is likely to have been planted as such in the
past.  Species within this habitat include English oak and sycamore.  The trees are
likely to provide nesting and foraging opportunities for birds and potential commuting
and foraging habitat for bats.
Species-Poor Intact Hedge – J.2.1.2
3.2.24
The southern end of the route features a coppiced poplar hedge, with annual meadow
grass, cock’s foot, dock and false oat-grass underneath.  The habitat provides limited
foraging and nesting opportunities for birds.
Earthbank – J.2.8
3.2.25
The north of the indicative route cuts through an earthbank which was previously
installed to restrict vehicular access on-site.  The bank is sparsely vegetated with
grasses and tall ruderal vegetation and is therefore considered to be of little
biodiversity interest.
Buildings and Hardstanding – J.3.6
3.2.26
The indicative routes run along the former runway for Eye Airfield and beside an
adjacent factory.  This habitat is not considered to support any biodiversity interest.
3.3
Badger Survey
Power Generation Plant
3.3.1
No badger setts or signs of badger activity were noted on-site or within the immediate
surrounds (30 m).  The northern and eastern site perimeter supported several
potential ‘pushes’ through the corresponding fence and scrub boundaries, although
closer inspection revealed no evidence of badger hairs.  Furthermore, no evidence of
latrines, pathways or snuffle holes were noted along the arable margins or accessible
grassland areas beyond the site boundary.
3.3.2
No badger pathways were similarly found in-between the site and a grassland area
further afield, which is comparatively more suitable for foraging purposes.  The
absence of pathways or territorial markers (i.e. latrines) does not of course account
for occasional through passage, although it does indicate that any pathway is not in
regular use and therefore of particular importance to a local clan.
3.3.3
No signs were found along the southern and western boundaries, although due to the
width of the hardstanding runway, it should be noted that any dispersal routes would
not otherwise be easily discernible.  The edges of the runway however support no
evidence to indicate regular through passage.
3.3.4
After the survey finished, a dead badger was noted approximately 1.5 km south-west
of the site along the roadside of the A140.  The wider surrounds of the site are
therefore known to support badgers.

Gas Connection
3.3.5
No badger setts or other signs of activity were found during the survey.  No ‘push
throughs’, latrines, snuffle holes or badger tracks were noted along the hedgerow to
the west of the site.  The ground was relatively soft at the time of survey and therefore
evidence of other species such as fox and hedgehog was easily recognisable.  The
absence of badger prints therefore indicates no recent through passage along the
western site boundary.
3.3.6
The remaining aspects showed no signs of activity along the former Eye Airfield
runway.  Any pathways which lead across hardstanding areas could have been
overlooked, although no markers were found along the edges and / or corners to
indicate this was the case.  The site is therefore not considered to support regular
badger activity.
3.3.7
A dead badger was discovered along the A140 roadside after the survey
approximately 1 km south-west of the site.  Presence is therefore known within the
wider site surrounds.
3.4

There are 14 ponds / ditches within a 500 m radius of the site, three of which are
located within 250 m.  The results of the HSI indicate most of the ponds / ditches are
either ‘Below Average’ or ‘Average’, with only three ponds / ditches scoring as ‘Good’.
A summary of the HSI categories for all ponds / ditches within a 250 m and 500 m
radius of the site is provided in Table 3.6 below.

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1
Statutory and Non-Statutory Designated Sites
4.1.1
The proposed Power Generation Plant could have a potential impact on a number of
designated sites within the surrounding area, including those of national and
international significance.  The extent of this impact cannot however be fully assessed
at this early stage until further details with regards to the proposals are provided.
4.1.2
A Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Exercise is, however considered
likely to be required for the two sites of international importance, Redgrave & Lopham
Fens (RAMSAR, SSSI, NNR) and Waveney & Little Ouse Valley Fens SAC.  Both
sites are located c.8 km to the north-west of the proposed power plant site.
4.2
UK and Local BAP Habitats
4.2.1
There are no UK BAP habitats on-site or within the immediate surrounds.  The site
supports a small length of species-rich hedgerow, a Suffolk BAP priority habitat
bordering the proposed Gas Connection Route Corridor.  However, this is not
considered to be of sufficient length or value to be classified as an important
hedgerow in accordance with the criteria provided in Appendix B. Further assessment
of likely impacts will be required once detailed proposals are available.
4.3
Protected Species and / or Species of Conservation Importance
4.3.1
The results of the desk-study and Phase 1 Habitat survey highlighted the potential
presence of several protected / notable species either on-site or within the immediate
environs.  This includes badgers, bats, birds, brown hare, GCN and hedgehogs.  All
of these species, excluding badgers which have already been surveyed for and brown
hare and hedgehog which are considered to be widespread in the surrounding area,
could place ecological constraints on the development proposals.
4.3.2
Detailed targeted Phase 2 surveys have therefore been recommended to confirm the
presence / likely absence, distributions and abundances of each species (please see
Table 4.1 for a summary).  This information should subsequently be used to inform
the detailed site layout / design and impact assessment, and detail avoidance or
mitigation measures required.
Badgers
4.3.3
The PPP site is considered to be largely unsuitable for the purpose of sett
construction as the topography is flat with little vegetative cover.  The soils are also
formed from seasonally wet clay, creating a risk of flooding for any sett present.
Conversely, the wider surrounds of the PPP site are considered more suitable, with
woodland cover to the east, south-east and south-west.  The topography is still fairly
flat within these areas although there is sufficient variation to be otherwise considered
suitable.
4.3.4
No signs of badgers were noted during the survey and the SBRC held no records
within 1 km of the site.  However, a dead badger was noted south of the PPP site
alongside the A140 roadside.  Badgers are therefore known to be present within the
wider surrounds of the PPP site.  The absence of signs on-site indicates there is no
regular through passage, although occasional dispersal cannot be entirely
discounted.  General mitigation recommendations to account for this low level of risk
are detailed below:
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey:

� 
Any temporarily exposed pipe must be capped so that badgers cannot gain
entry;
� 
Chemicals on-site must be stored and locked in a bunded metal container,
inaccessible to badgers; and
� 
All site excavations and trenches must either be covered overnight or have a
basic ramp fitted to enable any animals that fall within to easily find means of
escape.
Bats
4.3.5
SBRC hold a large number of bat records for the surrounding area, with eight different
species identified within the 10 km search radius.  The records also detail roosts for
brown long-eared, common pipistrelle, Natterer’s and soprano pipistrelle.
4.3.6
The habitats on-site are not considered suitable for roosting.  There are a number of
scattered trees present, although these are not deemed to be structurally suitable to
afford roosting opportunities.  Similarly, the nearby plantation off-site is not of
sufficient age or stature to support suitable features for bats.
4.3.7
The vegetated boundaries of the PPP site are likely to provide commuting and
foraging potential for bats.  Although the green infrastructure which connects the PPP
site to the wider surrounds is considered to be fairly poor, there remains opportunity
for some passage and feeding activity on-site.  Therefore, further survey work is
required in order to determine the level of activity on-site.
4.3.8
In accordance with best practice, three activity surveys are recommended over the
course of spring, summer and autumn.
Birds
4.3.9
The SBRC hold only a small number of records surrounding either site, although this
is not likely reflect the true species assemblage of the area.  The SBRC held one
record of a Schedule 1 species within the search area, although the site itself does
not support suitable marsh or riparian habitats for green sandpiper.  The remainder of
the species highlighted within the records are considered either likely or probable to
occur on-site.
4.3.10
The site supports a number of habitats such as hedgerows, scrub, scattered trees,
and arable fields, all of which are likely to be of value to nesting birds.  Further survey
work is therefore considered necessary in order to accumulate further information for
assessment and mitigation design.  Basic mitigation recommendations have been
listed below:
� 
Any vegetation clearance works should not be undertaken within the nesting bird
season (generally accepted to be March – August inclusive although annual
fluctuations in weather conditions can change this); and
� 
Any suitable habitats to be lost should be replaced within the site with native and
locally appropriate species.
Dormouse
4.3.11
The PPP site lies within the geographic range of dormice and strong populations are
known to exist within Suffolk.  However, there are no records of dormouse within the
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey:
Progress Power Project

- 46 -
search radius. The PPP site is furthermore considered to be unsuitable due to the
limited availability and connectivity of suitable scrub or hedgerow habitat.  The
surrounding road and industrial infrastructure also forms a major dispersal barrier.  As
a result, the PPP site is not considered to be sufficiently well connected to the wider
area to support this species.  Dormice are therefore considered absent from the PPP
site.
Hedgehog
4.3.12
The SBRC held no recent records of hedgehogs, although footprints were found
along the arable margin of the indicative route surveyed for the proposed GCRCs.
This species is therefore likely to be present across the margins of the whole PPP
site, as the perimeter habitats are considered suitable for both shelter and foraging.
Basic mitigation is therefore recommended for this species below:
� 
Any vegetation clearance works should be carried out in a careful manner with
caution exercised as to the potential presence of hedgehogs.
Herpetofauna
4.3.13
The results of the pond HSI indicate that the PGP and GCRCs holds some potential
for GCN.  The terrestrial habitats are considered to be sub-optimal for the species due
to the lack of vegetative cover and structure which would otherwise provide
opportunity for feeding, shelter and refuge.  The pond density in the surrounding area
is, however relatively high, and therefore the occurrence of this species cannot be
discounted without further survey.
4.3.14
It is also unclear at this early stage whether the A140 represents a potential migratory
barrier.  Although the daytime traffic load for this single carriageway road is high, this
considerably drops over night when amphibians are active.  The A140 is therefore
likely to hamper rather than prohibit dispersal altogether.
4.3.15
Three ponds were identified within 250 m of the proposed Power Generation Plant
site, and eight within 250 m of the GCRCs.  However, three of these (pond 17 and
ditches 23 and 24) are considered to be ‘Below Average’ and are not recommended
for further survey.  Seven remaining ponds / ditches (ponds 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 13, and ditch
14) were considered to score sufficiently high to warrant further survey.
4.3.16
The SBRC hold one record of a common toad within 1 km of the PGP site and
GCRCs, although no records of GCN or reptiles.  The absence of reptile records is
unlikely to accurately portray the true distribution of these within the surrounding area,
although the habitats on-site are considered to be largely unsuitable for this species
group.  No further survey or mitigation is therefore considered necessary for reptiles.
4.3.17
Four GCN surveys are required to determine presence / likely absence from those
suitable ponds within 250 m of the PGP site and GCRCs.  Two further surveys will be
required in addition to these to complete a population assessment if GCN are found to
be present.
Invertebrates
4.3.18
There is one invertebrate species record within the search radius, B.(Thoracombus)
ruderarius.
This species of bee is not considered likely to occur on-site as it is
associated with tall grasslands that are only cut or grazed intermittently, and tusscoky

grassland and scrub.  There are no habitats on-site which are considered of particular
value to warrant further invertebrate survey.
Otters
4.3.19
SBRC held no records of otters, although the species is likely to be present within the
wider site surrounds along the River Waveney.  The nearby fishing pond on the far
side of the A140 is also likely to attract otters to the local area.  The likelihood of
presence on-site however is considered to be extremely low as the PGP site and
GCRCs do not support sufficient dispersal routes or vegetative cover for sheltering /
refuge purposes.  The species is therefore considered absent from the PGP site and
GCRCs.
Plants
4.3.20
There are seven notable plant species records within 1 km of the PGP site and
GCRCs.  A number of these are associated with habitats that are found on-site such
as hedgerows and field margins, although none were noted during the Phase 1
Habitat survey.  Spreading hedge parsley is an endangered plant which prefers heavy
calcareous clay loams and the margins of fields sown with winter cereals.  The
likelihood of this occurring on-site is therefore considered to be extremely low and no
signs were noted during the survey.  No further botanical survey or mitigation is
therefore considered necessary.
Water Voles
4.3.21
There are no records of water voles within the search radius, and the PGP site and
GCRCs do not support any suitable habitat for this species.  The nearby ditches off-
site are also considered unsuitable due to a shallow water depth and short length.
Water voles are therefore considered absent from the PGP site and GCRCs.
White-clawed Crayfish
4.3.22
SBRC hold no records of white-clawed crayfish within 1 km of the PGP site and
GCRCs.  Furthermore, no suitable habitat for this species is present on-site and
therefore this species is considered absent from the site and immediate environs.
Non-native Invasive Plant Species
4.3.23
No non-native invasive plant species were noted within the survey footprint of the
PGP site and GCRCs .  There is one record of Japanese knotweed within 1 km of the
PGP site and GCRCs although the accompanying grid reference is not sufficiently
precise to detail the exact location of this in relation to the PGP site and GCRCs.
Non-native invasive plant species are considered likely to be absent from the PGP
site and GCRCs.  No further survey or mitigation is therefore deemed necessary.
4.4
Recommended Surveys
4.4.1
The following Phase 2 species surveys detailed within Table 4.2 are recommended as
a result of the Phase 1 Habitat survey findings.  It is recommended generally, that the
information provided in this report and the subsequent Phase 2 species survey
reports be used to inform the detailed design, with the aim of minimising impacts on
the ecological receptors identified as far as possible.

4.4.2
Due to significant changes to the indicative Gas Connection and Electrical Connection
after the Phase 1 Habitat Survey was undertaken, further Phase 1 Habitat Survey
work is required to collect baseline ecological information for the revised footprint of
both connections.  Furthermore, due to scale of the changes and the original design
of the desk study, it is recommended that this is also updated in respect of the
amendments as specified within Table 4.1.
4.4.3
Further Phase 2 species survey work may also be required for the revised
connections depending on the results of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey.

SUMMARY OF LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE FOR NOTABLE AND
PROTECTED SPECIES AND HABITATS IN THE UK 2010
Introduction
The following Appendix sets out details of legislation within the UK and how this
legislation applies to particular species groups.  The key pieces of international and
national legislation are described after which specific legislation pertaining to species
or species groups are described in turn.
International and national legislation
EC Habitats Directive
In 1992 the then European Community adopted Council Directive 92/43/EEC
on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, known as
the Habitats Directive.  The main aim of the EC Habitats Directive is to promote
the maintenance of biodiversity by requiring member states to introduce
protection for these habitats and species of European importance.  The
mechanism for protection is through designation of Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs), both for habitats and for certain species listed within
Annex II.  There are a number of species listed within Annex II of the Habitats
Directive that are present within the UK; these include four lower plant species,
nine higher plant species, six species of molluscs, six species of arthropods,
eight species of fish, two species of amphibian, and nine species of mammal.
The Bern Convention
The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats
(the Bern Convention) came into force in 1982.  The principal aims of the
Convention are to ensure conservation and protection of wild plant and animal
species and their natural habitats (listed in Appendices I and II of the
Convention), to increase cooperation between contracting parties, and to
regulate the exploitation of those species (including migratory species) listed in
Appendix 3.  To this end the Convention imposes legal obligations on
contracting parties, protecting over 500 wild plant species and more than 1000
wild animal species.
Bonn Convention
The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
(Bonn Convention or CMS) was adopted in Bonn, Germany in 1979 and came
into force in 1985.  Contracting Parties work together to conserve migratory
species and their habitats by providing strict protection for endangered
migratory species (listed in Appendix 1 of the Convention), concluding
multilateral agreements for the conservation and management of migratory
species which require or would benefit from international cooperation (listed in
Appendix 2 of the Convention), and by undertaking co-operative research
activities.
Convention on Biological Diversity
The Convention on Biological Diversity (Biodiversity Convention or CBD) was
adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and entered into force in
December 1993.  It was the first treaty to provide a legal framework for
biodiversity conservation.  Contracting Parties are required to create and
enforce national strategies and action plans to conserve, protect and enhance
biological diversity.

Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the principle
mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in Great Britain.  However it
does not extend to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.
This legislation is the means by which the Convention on the Conservation of
European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the 'Bern Convention') and the
European Union Directives on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) and
Natural Habitats and Wild Fauna and Flora (92/43/FFC) are implemented in
Great Britain.
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, as amended
In the UK the Council Directive 92/43/EEC has been transposed into national
laws by means of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) Regulations 1994
(as amended), and the Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1995 (as amended).  The
Regulations came into force on 30 October 1994, and have been amended
several times.  Subsequently the Conservation of Habitats and Species
Regulations 2010 was created which consolidates all the various amendments
made to the 1994 Regulations in respect of England and Wales and is
commonly known as the 'the Habitats Regulations'.  In Scotland the Habitats
Directive is transposed through a combination of the Habitats Regulations 2010
(in relation to reserved matters) and the 1994 Regulations.  The Conservation
(Natural Habitats, &c) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1995 (as amended)
transpose the Habitats Directive in relation to Northern Ireland.
The Regulations contain five Parts and four Schedules, and provide for the
designation and protection of 'European sites', the protection of 'European
protected species', and the adaptation of planning and other controls for the
protection of European Sites.
Other Legislation
Deer Act 1991
The Deer Act 1991 protects deer from poaching, taking or killing of certain deer
in close season, taking or killing deer at night, and the use of prohibited
weapons for the trapping or killing of deer.
Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996
The Act protects wild mammals from malicious or intentional harm.
Species and Habitat Specific Legislation
Plants
Wild plants are protected under Section 13 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act
1981 (as amended).  It prohibits the unauthorised intentional uprooting of any
wild plant species and forbids any picking, uprooting or destruction of plants
listed on Schedule 8 of which there are over 150.
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 have nine plants
listed within Annex IV these are; shore dock, (Rumex rupestris), killamey fern
(Trichomanes speciosum), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), lady’s slipper
(Cypripedium calceolus), creeping marshwort (Apium repens), slender naiad
(Najas flexilis), fen orchid (Liparis loeselii), floating-leaved water plantain
(Luronium natans), and yellow marsh saxifrage (Saxifraga hirculus).   It  is  an

offence to deliberately pick, collect cut, uproot or destroy any protected plant, or
keep, transport, sell, or exchange, any live or dead such plant species, this
applies to all stages of its life cycle.
Invasive Species
Schedule 9, Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended)
prohibits the introduction into the wild of any species that is not ordinarily
resident in and is not a regular visitor to Great Britain in a wild state, or any
species of the 69 plants listed on Schedule 9.
The frequently encountered invasive species within proposed development
sites include Japanese knotweed (Fallopia
japonica); Giant hogweed
(Heracleum mantegazzianum); Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera);
Floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides); New Zealand pygmyweed
(Crassula helmsii); Rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum); and certain
hybrids of the above, some species may be native yet are listed for
conservation purposes.
Plant or soil material contaminated by Japanese knotweed that is to be
discarded is considered to be a ‘controlled waste’ under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990 (EPA 1990).  It is an offence to deposit, treat, keep, or
dispose of controlled waste without a licence.  Furthermore knotweed that has
been cut down and removed must be received by an authorised person to be
disposed of correctly.  A licence can be obtained from the Environment Agency
(EA).  The release or planting of a listed species in the wild can be permitted
under a licence granted by the relevant statutory body.
Fungi
There are five species of fungi protected under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  These include the sandy stilt puffball
(Battarrea phalloides), royal bolete (Boletus regius), and the hedgehog fungus
(Hericium erinaceus).  It is an offence to pick, uproot, trade in, or possess for
the purpose of trade, any species listed under schedule 8.
Invertebrates
A number of invertebrates such as stag beetles (Lucanus cervus), silver
studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus) or white letter hairstreak (Stymondia w-
album) are fully protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act
(1981, as amended).  This legislation makes it illegal to intentionally kill, injure,
or take a protected invertebrate, or to damage, destroy, or obstruct access to
any structure or place used for shelter or protection by such a species; and
disturb any protected species occupying such a structure or place.
Three invertebrates are listed under Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats
and Species Regulations 2010, the large blue butterfly (Maculinea arion),
fisher’s estuarine moth (Gortyna borelii lunata), and lesser whirlpool ram’s-horn
snail (Anisus vorticulus).  It is an offence deliberately to kill, capture, or disturb a
listed species, or to damage or destroy the breeding site or resting place of
such an animal.
Amphibians
There are four widespread amphibian species, common frog (Rana temporaria),
common toad (Bufo bufo), palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus), and smooth newt
(Lissotriton vulgaris).  All of the four widespread species receive partial protection

under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended) making it
an offence to offer them for sale or trade.
Great Crested Newts, Natterjack Toads and Pool Frogs
Great crested newts (Triturus cristatus) (GCN) and natterjack toads (Epidalea
calamita) are fully protected under Schedule 5 (in respect of section 9(4)(b) and
(c) and (5) only) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended) and
the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.  Reintroduced
populations of ‘native’ pool frogs (Pelophylax lessonae), currently restricted to
one site in Norfolk, also receive the same protection.  It is illegal to possess a
protected species (alive or dead), deliberately capture, injure or kill, to
intentionally or recklessly disturb, or to deliberately take or destroy the eggs of
these protected species.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or intentionally or
recklessly obstruct access to a breeding or resting place used by these
protected species’.  All life stages of each species’ are afforded the same level
of protection.
In order to undertake any activity which would otherwise result in any of the
above offences being committed, it may be necessary to obtain a European
Protected Species (EPS) licence from the relevant statutory body (Natural
England (NE), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) or Scottish natural
Heritage (SNH)).  It is possible to undertake surveys which would otherwise
involve unlawful acts, such as disturbance, by obtaining a survey license which
provides authorisation for scientific and educational purposes
Reptiles
The four common reptile species, adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix
natrix), common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) and slow worm (Anguis fragilis), are
protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as
amended) against deliberate and/or intentional killing, injuring and trade.
If common reptile species are found to be present or considered potentially
present within a proposed development site.  To ensure that no subsequent
offence will be committed a precautionary method of working (written by a
suitably qualified ecologist) and submitted to the relevant authority may be
required to enable works to proceed with limited risks of offences being caused.
Birds
All birds, their nests and eggs are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act
(1981, as amended).  It is an offence to intentionally kill, injure, or take any wild
bird, or take or destroy an egg of any wild bird.  It is also an offence to damage
or destroy the nest of any wild bird (whilst being built, or in use).  Therefore,
clearance of vegetation within the site boundary, or immediately adjacent to the
site during the nesting season could result in an offence occurring under the
Act.  The bird breeding season can be taken to run between the 1 February and
31 August and is subject to geographical and seasonal factors.  There are 79
species of birds listed under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act
1981 (as amended).  It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb any
wild bird listed on Schedule 1 while it is nest building, or at a nest containing
eggs or young, or disturb the dependent young of such a bird.
Barn Owls
Barn  owls  (Tyto alba) are listed as ‘Amber’ status under the Birds of
Conservation Concern (BoCC) and are categorised as a species of European
Conservation Concern.  The Barn Owl is given the highest level of legal

protection possible under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
It is therefore illegal to kill, injure or take a barn owl, or to take or destroy its
eggs.  It is also illegal to intentionally or recklessly take, damage, or destroy the
nest of any wild bird while it is in use or being built, release or allow the escape
of a barn owl into the wild or possess any bird (dead or alive) or part of bird
without a licence which is obtainable through the country agencies (EN, SNH,
and CCW).
Mammals
All wild mammals are protected under the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996
from certain cruel acts; and for connected purposes.  It is an offence to mutilate,
kick, beat, nail, or otherwise inflict unnecessary suffering on any wild mammal.
Badgers
Badgers (Meles meles) are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act
(1992) and the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended).  As such it is
an offence to wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, or possess a dead
badger or any part of a badger.  Under the Act their setts are also protected
against obstruction, destruction, or damage in any part.
Sett interference includes damaging or destroying a sett, obstructing access to
a sett, and disturbing a badger whilst it is occupying a sett.  The Act defines a
badger sett as ‘any structure or place, which displays signs indicating the
current use by a badger’ and Natural England takes this definition to include
seasonally used setts.
Work that may disturb badgers or their setts is illegal without a development
licence from the relevant statutory body (NE, CCW, SNH).  As a precautionary
principle, a buffer distance between a badger sett and the works will be
determined, based upon guidance from an appropriately experienced ecologist.
This buffer distance should be based upon the size and activity levels at the
sett, the topography between the sett and the works and the nature of the
works.
Bats
All native UK bat species are fully protected by UK law under Schedule 5 (in
respect of section 9(4)(b) and (c) and (5) only) and Schedule 6 of the Wildlife
and Countryside Act (1981, as amended), and under Schedule 2 of the
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.  It is illegal to
deliberately capture, injure or kill a bat or to intentionally or recklessly disturb
bats.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or intentionally or recklessly obstruct
access to a breeding or resting place used by a bat.
Any activity that would result in a contravention of the above legislation would
likely require an EPS licence from the relevant statutory body (NE, CCW or
SNH).  Works or mitigation activities involving interference with bats or bat
shelters must be carried out by a licensed bat worker.
Dormice
Dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) are protected under Schedule 5 (in respect
of section 9(4)(b) and (c) and (5) only) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act
(1981, as amended) and are listed in Schedule 2 of the Conservation of
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.  Under the current legislation it is
illegal to intentionally or deliberately kill, injure or capture dormice, deliberately

disturb dormice (whether in a nest or not); or to damage, or destroy dormouse
breeding sites or resting places.
Any activity that would result in a contravention of the above legislation would
likely require an EPS licence from the relevant statutory body (NE, CCW or
SNH).
Otters
The otter (Lutra lutra) is fully protected under Schedule 5 (in respect of section
9(4)(b) and (c) and (5) only) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as
amended) and are listed under Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and
Species Regulations 2010.  It is therefore illegal to deliberately capture, injure
or kill an otter, possess an otter (dead or alive), or any other part of an otter, or
intentionally or recklessly disturb otters.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a holt or other resting place used
by an otter.
Any activity that would result in a contravention of the above legislation would
likely require an EPS licence from the relevant statutory body (NE, CCW or
SNH).
Water voles
Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife
and Countryside Act (1981, as amended).  It is an offence to possess, control
or sell water voles or to intentionally kill, injure or take water voles.  It is also an
offence to intentionally or recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to a
place that water voles use for shelter or protection or disturb water voles whilst
using such a place.
A licence is required for catching/handling water voles, or for field surveys that
are intrusive or disturbing where the surveyor suspects’ water voles are
present.  A licence can be obtained by applying to the relevant statutory body
(NE, SNH, and CCW,).  Please note that the legislation does not permit
licences to be issued in relation to development of land.
Hedgerows
The Hedgerows Regulations (1997) make provision for the protection of
important hedgerows in England and Wales.  The regulations affect hedgerows
which are 20m or more in length, or connected at both ends to another
hedgerow of any length.
They relate to hedgerows which are on, or adjoining land used for the following
purposes:  agriculture or forestry; the breeding or keeping of horses, ponies or
donkeys; common land; village greens; Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(which include all terrestrial SACs, NNRs, and SPAs) and Local Nature
Reserves.  They do not include hedges that is attached to, or marking the
boundaries of a private house.
It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly remove or cause or permit another
person to remove a hedgerow or intentionally or recklessly remove, or cause or
permit another person to remove, a hedgerow which is the subject of a
hedgerow retention notice.

Tree Preservation Order (TPO)
Part VIII of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Town and
Country Planning (Trees) Regulations (1999) allows tree preservation orders
(TPO) to be made by a Local Planning Authority in respect of trees or
woodlands.  This prohibits the cutting down, uprooting, topping, lopping, wilful
damage, or wilful destruction of a preserved tree.  Any tree is eligible for
protection, regardless of age, species or size, no trees are automatically
protected.
Tree Felling
Up to 5m³ of standing timber can be felled per quarter without requirement for a
felling licence provided that no more than 2m³ is sold.  There are a number of
exemptions, refer to the Forestry Authority Website.
General Guidance on European Protected Species Licence Applications
Should a European Protected Species (EPS) be found on a development site,
and where best practice guidance either cannot be followed or is not applicable
an EPS licence will be required.  The licence permits operations that otherwise
would be unlawful and fall outside the Good Practice Guidance, an application
for such a licence should be made to the relevant statutory body (NE, CCW or
SNH) before any works can proceed.  It is also possible to obtain a general
licence that may cover an area rather than applying in each individual case for
a separate specific/individual licence
Should the survey information be considered insufficient or the statutory body is
not satisfied with the application, the licence application may be refused.  This
could potentially result in significant delays to a project, if not considered in
time; however, early consideration of the potential presence of EPS on a site
and an assessment of suitable mitigation measures to derogate such
possibilities early in a project will negate this potential delay.

CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFYING IMPORTANT HEDGEROWS
Subject to regulation 8 (4), hedgerows are important for the purposes of the Hedgerow
Regulations (1997) if:
� 
They have been in existence for 30 years of more; and
� 
They satisfy at least one of the criteria set out in Part II of Schedule 1 to the
Regulations.
The criteria set out in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Hedgerows Regulations (1997) are
as follows:
1. The hedgerow marks a boundary, or part of a boundary, of a pre-1820 parish or
township.
2. The hedgerow incorporates an archaeological feature which is included in the
schedule monuments under section 1 of the Ancient Monuments and
Archaeological Areas Act 1979 or recorded in a Sites and Monuments Record.
3. The hedgerow is situated wholly or partly within an archaeological site included
or recorded as mentioned above or on land adjacent to and associated with
such a site and is associated with any monument or feature on that site.
4. The hedgerow marks the boundary of a pre-1600 estate or manor or is visibly
related to any building or feature of such an estate or manor.
5. The hedgerow is an integral part of a field system pre-dating the Inclosure Acts
or is part of, or visibly related to, any building or feature associated with such a
system.
i. The hedgerow contains floral or faunal species that are protected under the
Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) as amended, categorised as ‘endangered,’
‘extinct,’ ‘rare,’ or ‘vulnerable’ in Britain or bird species that are categorised as a
declining breeder.
ii. The hedgerow includes one of the following:
a) At least seven woody species listed in Schedule 3 of the Regulations
b) At least six woody species and has at least three of the associated features
specified below.
c) At least six woody species including Black Poplar, Large-leaved Lime, Small-
leaved Lime or Wild Service Tree.
d) At least five woody species and has at least four of the associated features
below.
e) In counties of northern England the number of woody species required to meet
this criterion is reduced by one.
6. The hedgerow is adjacent to a bridleway or footpath, a road used as a public
path or a byway open to all traffic and includes at least four woody species and
has at least two of the features;
� 
A bank or wall which supports the hedgerow at least one half of its length.
� 
A ditch along at least one half of the length of the hedgerow.
� 
Gaps which in aggregate do not exceed 10% of the length of the hedgerow.
� 
At least an average of one standard tree per 50m of hedgerow.  A standard
tree, in the case of a single stemmed tree, is defined as one with a diameter of
at least 20cm measured at a point 1.3m above natural ground level, or for a
