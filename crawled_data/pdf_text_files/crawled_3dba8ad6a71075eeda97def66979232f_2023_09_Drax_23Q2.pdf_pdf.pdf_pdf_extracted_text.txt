1.  Introduction
Map right: all operating and planned wind farms in the 
UK. Circles represent individual wind farms, their size 
is proportional to the peak power capacity, and does 
not represent the physical area or visual footprint.
It has been a mixed quarter for wind power. On the one hand, the UK’s wind 
fleet reached 29 GW of installed capacity, becoming the largest capacity of 
any type of power station. Britain joins the ranks of only five countries with 
wind capacity in the top spot, so this marks an important milestone on the 
route to net zero. On the other hand, Vattenfall caused shockwaves through 
the industry by suspending its 1.4 GW project off the coast of Norfolk due to 
escalating costs. This raises questions over the future of other offshore  
farms which committed to sell their output for just £37.50 per MWh  
back in 2022, as the recent increase in material and labour costs  
affect the whole sector.
In good news for the environment, electricity 
production from fossil fuels fell to its lowest 
level since the COVID pandemic brought the 
nation to a standstill. Carbon emissions also 
hit a 3-year low, falling below 150 g/kWh in 
May for only the second month in history.  
In good news for consumers, power prices 
have fallen by 40% over the past year, 
averaging below £80/MWh in May –  
the lowest in two years. April 10th saw 
negative power prices for most of the  
day due to an abundance of wind and  
solar generation. It was the first day  
where the daily-average price was  
less than £0 in nearly three years.
It is not just power prices that have  
come down, the price of carbon  
emissions has also fallen by a third  
over the last three months. Whereas  
in the past the UK carbon price moved  
in sync with the European price, the  
link between the two has now broken, 
implying that traders believe the UK’s targets 
will be significantly easier to achieve than 
those set by the EU, and making power exports 
from Britain to the continent more attractive.

Britain’s installed capacity of power stations over the past two decades
After more than a century of fossil fuel infrastructure 
dominating our electricity system, Britain has now installed 
more wind capacity than any other type of power station. 
In June, the nation’s fleet of wind farms reached 27.9 GW of 
capacity1, overtaking combined cycle gas power stations 
for the first time. This makes Britain only the fifth country 
in the world to have built more wind farms than any other 
form of power station.
Gas had been Britain’s largest source of power capacity 
for the last 10 years, and before that coal reigned supreme 
since the Victorian era. Coal was the country’s largest 
capacity until 2011, but the last twelve years have seen 
almost the entire fleet of power stations retire, with 
capacity falling from 28 down to just 2 GW. Dozens of  
gas-fired power stations were built during the 1990s as 
part of the ‘Dash for gas’. 
Their capacity plateaued at 30 GW in 2010, enough to power 
half the country on the coldest winter days. Since then gas 
has been in slow decline, as the oldest stations reached the 
end of their working life and more stations retired than new 
ones were built. In fact, no new large-scale fossil-fuelled 
power stations have been built in Britain since 2016 (with 
Carrington gas station in the Northwest the last to be built).
Britain’s wind farms have seen the opposite story, as 
capacity tripled over the last ten years. Today’s capacity  
is split equally between onshore (14.1 GW) and offshore 
(13.8 GW) farms. England and its seas host half of this 
capacity, with three-eighths in Scotland and one-eighth 
in Wales. Taken all together, around £60 billion has been 
invested over the past 20 years to build these farms2 
(close to £1,000 for every person in the country), mostly  
by pension funds and other large institutional investors.
1 
That is 27.9 GW of wind in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), and 28.9 GW in the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland). Both values overtook the capacity of natural gas power stations  
(27.7 GW in Britain and 28.7 GW in the UK).

£60 billion in today’s money, calculated from the annual average capital cost of wind turbines back to 2005 multiplied by the capacity built in each year. This is split between onshore and offshore capacity  
(approx. £21 billion for onshore and £39 billion for offshore).

The rate of building new farms has gone through peaks 
and troughs over the years, but has consistently averaged 
around 2 GW per year since 2009. New installations faltered 
in 2020 as the effects of the de-facto onshore wind ban 
took hold, and the pandemic halted construction work. 
Project completions then crashed in 2021 with just 0.36 GW 
installed, the lowest in fifteen years. Last year saw a return 
to form though, with large projects at Hornsea Two, 
Moray East and Triton Knoll all coming online.
Looking ahead, Britain’s wind capacity will continue 
growing at pace. 6.7 GW of wind farms are currently under 
construction. Scotland’s largest offshore farm, Seagreen, 
is nearing completion with other large projects underway 
off the coast of East Anglia and on Dogger Bank. Beyond 
this, the UK has a staggering 98 GW of offshore wind in 
planning, a pipeline that is the second largest in the world 
(behind only China), ahead of the United States and all 
European countries.
This milestone puts Britain at the vanguard of the 
transition to renewables. The UK joins Denmark, Spain, 
Ireland and Finland as only the fifth country in the world 
to have built more wind than any other type of capacity. 
Six countries – Australia, Japan, Germany, Belgium, 
Luxembourg and the Netherlands – all have more solar 
PV than any other capacity, and several countries across 
Europe and the Americas have hydro as their largest 
capacity. Solar PV and wind now make up three-quarters 
of all new power capacity installed worldwide, so we 
should expect more countries to join the UK’s ranks in  
the coming years.

Vattenfall have suspended development of their 1.4 GW Norfolk Boreas wind 
farm, in a major blow for the offshore wind industry. They cited inflation driving 
up costs by 40% within a year. Just one year ago, Vattenfall was awarded a 
record-low Contract for Difference (CfD) for the wind farm at £37.35 /MWh, 
which is £51.10 /MWh in today’s money. After more than a decade of being in 
development, the project is now halted – although not cancelled – at a cost of 
£415m to Vattenfall. The project was due to use 100 of Siemens Gamesa’s massive 
14 MW turbines (with rotors nearly a quarter of a kilometre in diameter). Norfolk 
Boreas is part of a wind farm cluster developed by Vattenfall, which leased seabed 
rights from the Crown Estate in 2010. The adjacent 2.8 GW Norfolk Vanguard 
wind farm is still being developed, having received approval in February 2022.
3.  Offshore wind held up by the inflation storm
Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) measures of inflation 
over the last five years. Data from the ONS CPI and PPI indices
Why did this happen?
Vattenfall won a CfD auction at a strike price of £37.35 /MWh in 2012 money, 
meaning they would receive this price (plus inflation) for all electricity produced 
over the first 15 years of operation. At the time of bidding, Vattenfall must have 
deemed the project viable, but is likely to have suffered the “Winner’s Curse”, 
bidding lower to undercut the competition, but regretting having won the auction. 
Since the auction, the global financial situation has worsened, supply chain issues 
have intensified, and financing costs have increased, meaning that expected 
losses from continuing the project would likely exceed the cost of pausing it. 
In normal times, such cost escalation shouldn’t matter as CfDs account for 
inflation. However, CfDs are adjusted using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
indicator, which does not reflect cost inflation that project developers bear. 
Inflation rates across different parts of the economy differed sharply over the 
last few years. Whereas CPI tracks inflation in consumer goods and services 
(housing, food, etc.), the Producer Price Index (PPI) is a better measure, tracking 
price changes in raw materials, machinery and labour. Between July 2022 
and July 2023, consumer goods inflation peaked at 11.1%, while producer cost 
inflation peaked at 22.7%, more than twice the rate. The PPI is already easing off 
and commodity prices are coming down, although they are still at a higher level.
Drax Electric Insights Quarterly – Q2 2023

What can be done?
There are several options available to policy makers. International examples 
include NYSERDA in New York, which has added a commodity inflation adjustment 
after the auction. The indexation basis between auction and the operation of the 
wind farm could be based on PPI, to better reflect costs to producers.
Denmark has a cap on the total lifetime payments of a generator in either 
direction of the CfD, allowing new Danish wind farms to operate on a merchant 
basis. Germany and the Netherlands have a 1 sided CfD, so wind farms receive 
either the strike price or the market price (whichever is higher), but these cost 
more to the consumer than the UK’s CfD design.
There are examples where the government has (re-)negotiated a CfD with the 
generator: (1) Hinkley Point C has a negotiated CfD from the outset, which 
was argued being in the national interest. (2) The CfD for the Neart na Gaoithe 
wind farm was delayed following consenting issues. In essence, the wind farm 
received a higher CfD strike price from an earlier auction, but later moved to use 
bigger (and lower cost) turbines.
Considering that Norfolk Boreas is not (yet) cancelled, a CfD extension is a likely 
route forward. Any increase in CfD strike prices would have to be granted to the 
other wind farms from CfD Allocation Round 4 as well, which would make this 
politically difficult. A one-off ‘commodity price adjustment’ might be more feasible. 
Some voices in the industry are concerned that the CfD cap price for the next 
auction round (£44 /MWh in 2012 money, £60.20 /MWh in today’s money) may be 
too low for wind farms to be viable, meaning offshore wind may not even feature in 
the next auction round. Delays or cancellations of offshore wind farms at this scale 
would seriously jeopardise the UK’s goal to reach 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030. 
Norfolk Boreas (and the rest of CfD Allocation round 4) has commissioning dates for 
2026/2027, so even a delay of a couple of years risks overrunning the 2030 deadline.
Increasing project costs can often be offset with design changes to the wind farm, 
such as using bigger and more cost-effective turbines (e.g. as seen at Dogger Bank). 
While Vattenfall is likely to have discussed using bigger wind turbines at Norfolk 
Boreas, these did not materialise before the decision to halt the project. Wind 
turbine manufacturers are not making any money on current projects and are 
therefore reluctant to increase turbine size before recouping the money spent 
on developing the current generation. Norfolk Boreas’ supplier, Siemens Energy 
warned of €4.5 bn losses for its wind division, just weeks after Vattenfall’s decision.
It is not just Vattenfall. The offshore wind industry both in the UK and worldwide 
is affected by these cost increases. However, all other UK wind farms are still 
planned to go ahead, having passed their 12 month Milestone Delivery Date 
successfully. This includes four more projects, totalling 5.6 GW, which were also 
awarded the same strike price as Norfolk Boreas. Three of these are adjacent to 
existing wind farms which might be able to leverage O&M cost savings, and carry 
less site development risk (e.g. soil conditions are better understood).

Electricity generation from fossil fuels fell to its lowest 
levels since the COVID-19 lockdown. Fossil fuels produced 
22.2 TWh of electricity over the last three months, just 
over a third of total electricity demand. This is 9% below 
the previous non-lockdown low, which was recorded at 
the start of this year. Electricity generation from fossil 
fuels also registered its largest year-on-year fall outside of 
COVID times. Output from gas power stations fell by 23% 
compared to Quarter 2 of 2022, and output from coal fell 
by three-quarters to its lowest levels on record.
This fall could have been much larger, but three factors 
propped up our need to burn gas. Nuclear output was a 
fifth lower than last year due to ongoing maintenance 
and refuelling. Half of the country’s 10 reactor units 
are currently offline. Biomass generation also declined 
by a fifth as unprecedented wood pellet prices made 
many units unprofitable to run. Even Briain’s wind farms 
produced 16% less output than the same quarter last year 
due to lower wind speeds. If these three technologies had 
maintained their output at last year’s levels, fossil fuel 
production would have been a further 6 TWh lower.
Despite these factors, fossil fuel generation still 
continued to decline. Demand for electricity maintained 
its downward trend – falling 3.2% over the last 12 months. 
However, the key driver for declining fossil fuel use was 
the reversal of fortunes on the continent, leading to a 
reversal of flows across the interconnectors. With gas 
stores replenished and some of France’s nuclear fleet 
coming back online, Britain’s neighbouring countries were 
less short on power. Since last year, Britain has changed 
from exporting 1.7 GW to importing 3.4 GW – a swing of 
over 5 GW, equivalent to one-and-a-half Hinkley Point C’s.
Carbon emissions from electricity production fell to 
below 10 million tonnes of CO2 over the quarter for only 
the second time ever (the previous being during COVID 
lockdown). The carbon intensity of generation fell by a 
fifth from Q2 last year to 155 g per kWh.
With the country now down to just one coal power plant, 
the end of coal is in sight. The roll out of wind and solar, 
and whether a nuclear renaissance emerges will play a 
large role in determining whether and how fast natural  
gas generation continues to decline in the coming years.

For sixteen years, the UK was part of the EU Emissions Trading System, but had 
to leave after Brexit and set up its own UK ETS. In both schemes, fossil-fuelled 
power stations and other large sources of carbon dioxide must surrender one 
permit for every tonne of CO2 they emit. Generators have to buy all their permits, 
but industrial companies get many of their permits for free to help them stay 
competitive internationally. Since any unused permits can be sold to other 
companies, the scheme gives an ‘opportunity cost’ to emitting CO2 equal to  
the permit price per tonne. 
This can be seen in the way that British electricity prices follow the combined 
price of gas (adjusted for power station efficiency) and cost of CO2 emitted, 
which is the price of permits plus the carbon price support (a tax set at  
£18/tonne since 2015).
For an electricity system with a mix of fossil-fuelled power stations, the easiest 
way to reduce emissions towards a target is to burn less (high-carbon) coal and 
more (lower-carbon) gas, and the price of an emissions permit should settle 
at the level where just enough coal-powered stations become uncompetitive 
against their gas-burning competitors. If the price of gas rises, the price of 
permits needs to increase to discourage coal burning, whereas if the price of 
coal rises, the price of permits can fall. 
The UK’s carbon price has plunged by 40% in recent months, and it now trades 
at its biggest ever discount to Europe. This means it now costs less for power 
stations and large industries to burn coal, gas and oil. While this provides some 
respite to high energy prices, it poses a risk to the UK’s net zero ambitions.

Britain now burns so little coal (0.2% of production last quarter) that this 
mechanism cannot work directly. If emissions are too high, reductions must 
come either from reducing the absolute amount of fossil-fuelled electricity 
generation (which implies adding renewable capacity, increasing imports or 
reducing electricity demand) or from industrial emitters such as iron or cement 
plants. The price of permits should therefore reflect the cost (per tonne of 
emissions avoided) of these actions, and specifically the most expensive actions 
needed to meet the target.
There’s a degree of slack in the system, as permits can be “banked” until the 
following year if emissions are lower than expected in a given year (e.g. due to  
a mild winter). Also, as 2024 permits will be issued shortly before those for 2023 
must be surrendered, it is possible to “borrow” from the future in the event of a 
(temporary) increase above the number of permits available in 2023.
In practice, fewer permits have been needed than were made available, adding 
to the slack in the system. This means that permit prices largely depend on 
expectations of how much action will be needed to meet future emissions targets, 
and what those actions will cost. The tougher a scheme’s target for reducing 
emissions, the higher its price is likely to be. There have also been suggestions 
that the UK scheme will be linked to the (much larger) EU ETS, allowing British 
emissions to be offset by EU certificates and vice versa. This ought to give the 
two schemes the same price; if people believe that they might do so in future, 
this should drive their prices closer together than if there was no prospect of that 
happening. From the market’s creation until March 2023, the UK ETS remained 
within ±15% of the EU ETS price for 90% of the time. Prices in the EU are set by the 
same underlying forces as in the UK, but coal-gas switching is still relevant, and 
the emissions targets are different compared to “business as usual” levels.
Prices in the UK ETS, which were 7% below those in Europe as recently as March, 
have now fallen to 30% below. The UK government has announced that it will 
increase the emissions that will be allowed between 2024 and 2027, compared 
to earlier expectations. Overall, the allowed emissions from 2021 to 2030 are 
described as “at the top of the net zero consistent range”, in part because the 
“new” certificates are ones that the government had allowed itself to issue in 
the scheme’s first years, but had not been sold due to lack of demand for them. 
Nevertheless, the announcement has been seen as loosening the commitment 
to reduce emissions, and prices have fallen.

What will this imply for the electricity sector? The last coal-fired station is 
about to close anyway, so we can’t see much gas to coal switching, but the 
lower marginal cost of gas-fired stations will slightly reduce electricity prices.  
A £10/tonne reduction in the price of carbon dioxide would, if passed on, lead 
to electricity prices falling between £3 and £4/MWh at the frequent times when 
gas-fired stations are at the price-setting margin.
Lower electricity prices in Great Britain will make it less attractive to export 
power to us, implying that our generation will sometimes have to rise to replace 
imports, or even export power to the continent. UK emissions would rise when 
this happens, but emissions in Europe would fall; they don’t count in the UK’s 
official statistics, but the planet notices them. Renewable generators that are 
already installed will run whenever they can, but a lower price makes it slightly 
less attractive to build new ones.
The decision is perhaps more important as a signal (alongside some others sent 
recently) about the level of government commitment to bearing the costs of 
decarbonisation. Some of those costs turn into financial benefits – electric 
vehicles typically cost less than petrol ones over their lifetime, and energy bills 
(or government subsidies on them) would have been lower last winter if energy 
efficiency policies hadn’t been cut back after 2012. But the up-front costs of 
many low-carbon measures should not be ignored, and political support for 
continued action will depend on helping people to meet them.

After last quarter’s role reversal, gas overtook wind again to be the largest 
source of electricity produced. This was in part driven by low wind speeds, 
meaning wind farms produced one-sixth less electricity than they did last year, 
despite capacity growing by 10%.
Nuclear, biomass, hydro and gas power stations all produced around one-fifth 
less electricity than during the same quarter last year. Various reasons were at 
play: retirements and outages for refuelling for nuclear, high fuel prices kept 
biomass plants offline, low rainfall reduced hydro output, and less gas was 
needed as imports from Europe surged. Solar was the only technology to go 
against this downwards trend. In June, National Grid updated its estimate of 
installed solar PV capacity for the first time in 4 years.
Coal power stations registered their lowest ever output over a quarter. At just 
under 0.1 TWh, this was equivalent to the consumption of a medium-sized 
town or city such as Blackpool or Worcester. May came very close to being the 
first ‘zero coal’ month in nearly 3 years. One coal power station operated for 
a single hour to cover for an unexpected outage in a nuclear plant. Over the 
month, coal generation averaged less than 1 MW.

It was a relatively quiet three months, with only solar PV and imports breaking 
records over the last quarter. Solar PV crept towards 10 GW peak output on 
April 20th, and later in June it produced nearly 3.5 GW averaged over the day, 
breaking a record which stood since 2018.
Electricity imports also reached new highs, supplying more than one-third of the 
country’s demand in the early hours of May 7th, and more than a quarter of the 
whole day’s electricity on May 20th. 
The tables below look over the past fourteen years (2009 to 2023) and report the 
record output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages over a 
day, a month and a calendar year. Cells highlighted in blue are records that were 
broken in the second quarter of 2023. Each number links to the date it occurred 
on the Electric Insights website, so these records can be explored visually.

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants. 
The operation of battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not publicly available.
