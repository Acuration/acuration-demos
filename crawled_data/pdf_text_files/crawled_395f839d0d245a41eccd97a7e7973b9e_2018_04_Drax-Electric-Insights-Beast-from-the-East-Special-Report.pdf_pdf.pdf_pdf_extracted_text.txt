 
Energy System Impacts 
 
March 1st was the coldest spring day on 
record, averaging –3.8°C.  The six days 
from 
February 
26th 
to 
March 
3rd 
(highlighted in blue) were the coldest 
Britain has been since Christmas 2010. 
 
This pushed electricity demand up 10%, 
as people used more electric heating to 
keep warm.  The evening peak demand 
on March 1st was the highest in three 
years, and so was not stretching the 
system to its limits. 
 
Electricity prices rose to five times the 
average for the quarter.  They peaked at 
£990 per MWh for half an hour, and also 
fell to –£150 per MWh as the market 
became volatile. 
 
Coal generation surged for the weeks 
surrounding the cold spell.  Not because 
more output from conventional plants 
was needed, but rising gas prices made it 
more economical to burn than gas.  Total 
generation from fossil fuels remained 
around 20–25 GW. 
 
Biomass 
and 
hydro 
ran 
solidly 
throughout the cold spell.  Wind output 
was particularly high when it was most 
needed, ranging from 11.8 to 13.8 GW 
during March 1st.  Whilst wind certainly 
helped, the lights would not have gone 
off without it, as up to 19 GW of spare 
gas capacity was available if needed. 
 
Britain’s links to other countries were not 
so helpful.  We exported to France 
through much of the cold spell.  French 
electricity demand is more impacted by 
temperature than British, as more French 
homes use electric heating.

The Beast from the East: 
 
Looking in more detail at the UK’s links to 
other countries:  
 Britain had been largely importing 
from France all year, but then 
exported solidly through the 27th 
and 28th of February, when power 
prices were higher in France. 
 Prices 
remained 
lower 
in 
the 
Netherlands, so Britain continued 
importing from them. 
 Britain and Ireland traded power 
back and forth to help balance their 
systems.  On March 3rd the East-
West link between North Wales and 
Dublin 
was 
taken 
offline 
for 
(unrelated) maintenance.
