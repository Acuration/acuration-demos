(the "Company") 
Director Disclosure s. 430(2B) of the Companies Act 
The following information is provided in accordance with section 430(2B) of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The Company announced today that Andy Koss, Chief Executive, Generation, Drax 
Group, stepped down from the Board on 7 April 2020. Andy will continue to be 
employed until 30 June 2020 (the “Termination Date”) as special adviser to the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company in order to provide support on a programme of works 
and to ensure an orderly transition.  
As Andy’s employment will be terminated on the grounds of redundancy, he will 
automatically be treated as a good leaver under the rules of the Annual Bonus Plan, 
Deferred Share Plan (“DSP”) and Performance Share Plan ("PSP"), as set out in the 
Remuneration Policy.  
The following remuneration arrangements will apply and are in line with the provisions 
of the Remuneration Policy: 
• Salary of £80,371.15, pension payments of £16,074.23 and contractual benefits 
(being car allowance and continued coverage under the Company’s private 
medical and insured benefits plans) valued at £3,707.78 for the period from 8 
April 2020 up to the Termination Date; 
• In accordance with the relevant provisions of his service agreement, payment in 
lieu of the remainder of his 12 months' notice period which has not elapsed as at 
the Termination Date, in respect of salary, pension payments and contractual 
benefits (excluding private medical cover which will be dealt with separately) 
(the "PILON payment").  The PILON payment will be of £334,122.48, 
comprising £268,860.65 in respect of salary, £53,772.13 in respect of pension 
contributions and £11,489.70 in respect of contractual benefits (being car 
allowance and insured benefits) for the period from 1 July 2020 to 7 April 2021. 
In accordance with the terms of the service agreement, the PILON payment will 
be made in instalments, with an initial payment of 50% of the PILON payment 
within 30 days of the Termination Date, a second instalment of 25% to be paid 
within six months of the Termination Date and a third instalment of 25% to be 
paid within nine months of the Termination Date. The amount of the PILON 
payment will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate cash equivalent of 
the remuneration or consideration (of whatever type) payable to or received by 
Andy in respect of any alternative employment or engagements for any 
unexpired period of the 12 months’ notice period;

active employment, Andy will be eligible for a pro rata annual bonus in respect 
of 2020, to be determined in accordance with the Annual Bonus Plan and

accordance with the Remuneration Policy in effect at the time that the amount of 
the bonus is determined, be deferred as an award under the DSP and will vest in 
accordance with the rules of the DSP and applicable Remuneration Policy; 
• Pro-rata vesting of PSP awards to the extent that any such awards vest, subject to

Policy and the PSP rules;  
• DSP awards will vest in full on the normal vesting date in accordance with the 
Rules of the DSP and applicable Remuneration Policy;
