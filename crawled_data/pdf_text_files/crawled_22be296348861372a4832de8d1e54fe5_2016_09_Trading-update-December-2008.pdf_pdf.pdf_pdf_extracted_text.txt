Trading Update 
 
Prior to entering its close period on 3 January 2009, Drax announces the following trading update. 
 
Trading Performance and Outlook 
Since issuing our Interim Management Statement on 23 October 2008 we have continued to trade 
in line with expectations for the current year.  
 
Commodity prices have been highly volatile in the period since the announcement of our Interim 
Management Statement, and for 2009 and beyond we have experienced a contraction in dark 
green spreads, although spreads remain healthy. We will continue to actively manage our working 
capital position to optimise cash flow next year. 
 
Positions under Contract for 2008, 2009 and 2010 
We continue to follow our stated trading strategy of making steady forward power sales with 
corresponding purchases of CO2 emissions allowances and solid fuel purchases. Our aim is to 
deliver market level or better dark green spreads across all traded market periods and, as part of 
this strategy, we retain power to be sold into the prompt (within season) power markets.  
 
As at 12 December 2008, the positions under contract for 2008, 2009 and 2010 were as follows:

(2) Including structured contracts 
 
Fixed price power sales include approximately 5.0TWh supplied to Centrica in the period 1 January 
2008 to 12 December 2008 under the ﬁve-and-a-quarter year baseload contract with Centrica 
which commenced on 1 October 2007.  
 
Fixed margin and structured power sales include approximately 0.3TWh in 2008 and 5.3TWh in 
each of 2009 and 2010 in connection with this Centrica contract. Under this contract the Group will 
supply power on terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices, 
and delivering matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting to approximately 4.8 million tonnes 
per annum. The contract provides the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green spreads which were 
agreed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006. 
 
  
 
 
Based on prevailing market conditions, we expect our fuel costs for 2009, excluding the cost of 
purchasing CO2 emissions allowances, to be at a similar level to those for the current year. 
 
We will provide the next update on the Group’s positions under contract in our 2008 Preliminary 
Results Statement which is expected to be issued on 3 March 2009.  
 
Closing Cash Position Guidance and Distributions 
In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, we expect that the closing cash position as at 31 
December 2008 will be in the range £125m to £130m.   
 
In accordance with our distribution policy for 2008 and 2009, as communicated on 23 October, we 
expect to distribute all excess cash from operations to shareholders.
