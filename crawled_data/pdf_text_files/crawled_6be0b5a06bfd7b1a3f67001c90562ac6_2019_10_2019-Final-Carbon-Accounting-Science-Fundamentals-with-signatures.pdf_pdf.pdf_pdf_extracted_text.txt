Science Fundamentals of Forest Biomass Carbon Accounting 
 
Policy makers are increasingly considering the use of forest biomass energy to meet 
national, regional and state energy and carbon emissions objectives. As they do so, it is 
imperative that their policy decisions be informed by current peer-reviewed science on 
the carbon impacts of woody biomass as an energy source. Some studies on the 
subject offer views with stringent assumptions that may be confusing to decision-
makers. 
 
Peer-reviewed literature examining the net emissions from the wide spectrum of forest-
based activities reveals a number of important fundamentals policy makers should 
consider when characterizing the carbon impacts of the increased use of forest biomass 
for energy.1 While these fundamentals do not address all of the issues policy makers 
confront, they help clarify those most directly affecting the potential role forest biomass 
energy can play in energy and climate policy.  
 
As experts in forest science, we recommend the following four science fundamentals to 
policy makers and others seeking to develop a science-based approach to biomass 
energy production. 
 
Fundamental 1:  The carbon benefits of sustainable forest biomass energy are 
well established. 
 
The long-term benefits of forest biomass energy are well-established in science 
literature. As stated in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, "In the long term, a sustainable forest management 
strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing 
an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will generate 
the largest sustained mitigation benefit.2"  Most debates regarding the carbon 
benefits of forest biomass energy are about the timing of the benefits rather than 
whether they exist. 
 
Fundamental 2:  Measuring the carbon benefits of forest biomass energy must 
consider cumulative carbon emissions over the long term. 
 
The most effective carbon mitigation measures are those which reduce carbon 
accumulation in the atmosphere over time.  Forest biomass energy yields 
significant net decreases in overall carbon accumulation in the atmosphere over 
time compared to fossil fuels.  Comparisons between forest biomass emissions

and fossil fuel emissions at the time of combustion and for short periods thereafter 
do not account for long term carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and can 
significantly distort or ignore comparative carbon impacts over time. 
 
Fundamental 3:  An accurate comparison of forest biomass energy carbon 
impacts with those of other energy sources requires the use of consistent 
timeframes in the comparison. 
 
The most common timeframe for measuring the impacts of greenhouse gases is 
100 years, as illustrated by the widespread use of 100-year global warming 
potentials.3  This timeframe provides a more accurate accounting of cumulative 
emissions than shorter intervals.  Measuring the net cumulative carbon emissions 
from forest biomass energy over a 100 year timeframe, as is done for fossil fuels, 
more accurately captures and more appropriately demonstrates the cumulative 
carbon benefits of biomass energy compared to fossil fuels. 
 
Fundamental 4.  Economic factors influence the carbon impacts of forest 
biomass energy. 
 
Research demonstrates that demand for wood helps keep land in forest and 
incentivizes investments in new and more productive forests, all of which have 
significant carbon benefits. This is particularly true when landowner investments 
are made in anticipation of future market demand.  Likewise wood markets 
significantly influence both the availability of wood and the kind of wood used for 
biomass energy.  For example, large trees better suited for higher value markets 
are typically not used for energy.  The consideration of landowner response to the 
marketplace is essential to fully accounting for the long-term carbon impacts of 
using forest biomass for energy.4  Failing to consider the effects of markets and 
investment on carbon impacts can distort the characterization of carbon impacts 
from forest biomass energy. 
 
Research on the use of forest biomass as an energy source to mitigate GHG emissions 
dates back to the late 1980’s. Changes in technology, forest conditions, and markets 
and global economics will influence forest biomass utilization now and in the future. A 
commitment to continuing research on forest biomass utilization is necessary to quantify 
the risks and benefits associated with its use, encourage dialogue and debate, drive 
innovation and investment in new technologies and inform policy.
