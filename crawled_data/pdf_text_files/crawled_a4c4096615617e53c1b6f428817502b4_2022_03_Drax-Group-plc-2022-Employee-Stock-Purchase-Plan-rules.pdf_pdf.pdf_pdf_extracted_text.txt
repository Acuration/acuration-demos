2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
The Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan includes two components: a 
Code Section 423 Component (the “423 Component”) in Part A and a non-Code Section 423 
Component (the “Non-423 Component”) in Part B. It is intended for the 423 Component to 
constitute an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Code, 
and the 423 Component shall be interpreted in accordance with that intent. Under the Non-423 
Component, which does not qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of 
Section 423(b) of the Code, options will be granted pursuant to rules, procedures or sub-plans 
adopted by the Committee designed to comply with applicable laws or achieve tax and other 
objectives. Except as otherwise provided herein or by the Committee, the Non-423 Component 
will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component.  Definitions used in

SECTION 3 Administration of the Plan. 
(a) Administrative Powers and Responsibilities.  The Plan shall be administered by the 
Committee.  The Committee shall have full power and authority, subject to the provisions of the 
Plan, to promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary for the proper 
administration of the Plan, to interpret the provisions and supervise the administration of the 
Plan, and to take all action in connection therewith or in relation thereto as it deems necessary or 
advisable.  Any decision reduced to writing and signed by all of the members of the Committee 
(including electronic signatures) shall be fully effective as if it had been made at a meeting duly 
held.  The Committee’s determinations under the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the 
Board, shall be final and binding on all persons.  The Company or any one or more Participating 
Companies shall pay all expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan.  No member of the 
Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in 
good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Committee shall be fully indemnified 
by the Company with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation.  The Committee 
may adopt such rules, guidelines and forms as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan.  
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Committee may designate persons other than 
members of the Committee to carry out its responsibilities and may prescribe such conditions 
and limitations as it may deem appropriate.  All decisions, interpretations and other actions of the 
Committee shall be final and binding on all Participants and all persons deriving their rights from 
a Participant.  No member of the Committee shall be liable for any action that he has taken or has 
failed to take in good faith with respect to the Plan.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
the Plan, the Board may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, resolve to 
administer the Plan.  In such event, the Board shall have all of the authority and responsibility 
granted to the Committee herein.   
(b) International Administration.  The Committee may establish sub-plans (which need 
not qualify under Section 423 of the Code) and initiate separate Offerings through such sub-plans 
for the purpose of (i) facilitating participation in the Plan by non-U.S. employees in compliance 
with foreign laws and regulations without affecting the qualification of the remainder of the Plan 
under Section 423 of the Code or (ii) qualifying the Plan for preferred tax treatment under 
foreign tax laws (which sub-plans, at the Committee’s discretion, may provide for allocations of 
the authorized Shares reserved for issue under the Plan as set forth in Section 14(a)).  Except as 
otherwise set forth in the sub-plan, the rules, guidelines and forms of such sub-plans (or the 
Offerings thereunder) may take precedence over other provisions of the Plan, with the exception 
of Section 4(a)(i), Section 5(b), Section 8(b) and Section 14(a), but unless otherwise superseded 
by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-
plan. Alternatively and in order to comply with the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, the Committee 
shall have the power, in its discretion, to grant options in an Offering to citizens or residents of a 
non-U.S. jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or 
resident aliens) that provide terms which are less favorable than the terms of options granted

under the same Offering to employees resident in the United States, subject to compliance with 
Section 423 of the Code.  
SECTION 4 Enrollment and Participation. 
(a) Offering Periods.  While the Plan is in effect, subject to any applicable restrictions 
imposed by legislation, regulation or any code or guidance on share dealing with which the 
Company seeks to comply (“Dealing Restrictions”), the Committee may from time to time grant 
options to purchase Shares pursuant to the Plan to Eligible Employees during a specified 
Offering Period.  Each such Offering shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and 
conditions as the Committee shall determine, subject to compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the Plan (which may be incorporated by reference) and the requirements of Section 
423 of the Code, including the requirement that all Eligible Employees have the same rights and 
privileges.  The Committee shall specify prior to the commencement of each Offering (i) the 
period during which the Offering shall be effective, which may not exceed twenty-seven (27) 
months from the Offering Date and may include one or more successive Purchase Periods within 
the Offering, (ii) the Purchase Dates and Purchase Price for Shares which may be purchased 
pursuant to the Offering, and (iii) if applicable, any limits on the number of Shares purchasable 
by a Participant, or by all Participants in the aggregate, during any Offering Period or, if 
applicable, Purchase Period, in each case consistent with the limitations of the Plan. The 
Committee shall have the discretion to provide for the automatic termination of an Offering 
following any Purchase Date on which the Fair Market Value of a Share is equal to or less than 
the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Offering Date, and for the Participants in the terminated 
Offering to be automatically re-enrolled in a new Offering that commences immediately after 
such Purchase Date.  The terms and conditions of each Offering need not be identical, and shall 
be deemed incorporated by reference and made a part of the Plan.   
(b) Enrollment.  Any individual who, on the day preceding the first day of an Offering 
Period, qualifies as an Eligible Employee may elect to become a Participant in the Plan for such 
Offering Period by completing the enrollment process prescribed and communicated for this 
purpose from time to time by the Company to Eligible Employees. 
(c) Duration of Participation.  Once enrolled in the Plan, a Participant shall continue to 
participate in the Plan until he or she ceases to be an Eligible Employee or withdraws from the 
Plan under Section 6(a).  A Participant who withdrew from the Plan under Section 6(a) may 
again become a Participant, if he or she then is an Eligible Employee, by following the procedure 
described in Subsection (b) above.  A Participant whose employee contributions were 
discontinued automatically under Section 9(b) shall automatically resume participation at the 
beginning of the earliest Offering Period ending in the next calendar year, if he or she then is an 
Eligible Employee.  When a Participant reaches the end of an Offering Period but his or her 
participation is to continue, then such Participant shall automatically be re-enrolled for the 
Offering Period that commences immediately after the end of the prior Offering Period.

SECTION 5 Employee Contributions. 
(a) Frequency of Payroll Deductions.  A Participant may purchase Shares under the Plan 
solely by means of payroll deductions; provided, however, that to the extent provided in the 
terms and conditions of an Offering, a Participant may also make contributions through payment 
by cash or check prior to one or more Purchase Dates during the Offering.  Payroll deductions, 
subject to the provisions of Subsection (b) below or as otherwise provided under the terms and 
conditions of an Offering, shall occur on each payday during participation in the Plan. 
(b) Amount of Payroll Deductions.  An Eligible Employee shall designate during the 
enrollment process the portion or amount of his or her Compensation that he or she elects to have 
withheld for the purchase of Shares.  Such portion or amount shall be not less than one percent 
(1%) of the Eligible Employee’s Compensation nor more than such percentage or amount of 
Compensation specified as the limit in the terms and conditions of the applicable Offering. 
(c) Changing Withholding Rate.  Unless otherwise provided under the terms and 
conditions of an Offering, a Participant may not increase the rate of payroll withholding during 
the Offering Period, but may discontinue or decrease the rate of payroll withholding during the 
Offering Period to a whole percentage of his or her Compensation in accordance with such 
procedures and subject to such limitations as the Company may establish for all Participants.  A 
Participant may also increase or decrease the rate of payroll withholding effective on 
commencement of a new Offering Period by submitting an authorization to change the payroll 
deduction rate pursuant to the process prescribed by the Company from time to time.  The new 
withholding rate shall be a whole percentage of the Eligible Employee’s Compensation 
consistent with Subsection (b) above. 
(d) Discontinuing Payroll Deductions.  If a Participant wishes to discontinue employee 
contributions entirely, he or she may do so by withdrawing from the Plan pursuant to Section 
6(a).  In addition, employee contributions may be discontinued automatically pursuant to Section 
9(b). 
SECTION 6 Withdrawal from the Plan. 
(a) Withdrawal.  A Participant may elect to withdraw from the Plan by giving notice 
pursuant to the process prescribed and communicated by the Company from time to time.  Such 
withdrawal may be elected at any time before the last day of an Offering Period, except as 
otherwise provided in the Offering.  In addition, if payment by cash or check is permitted under 
the terms and conditions of an Offering, Participants may be deemed to withdraw from the Plan 
by declining or failing to remit timely payment to the Company for the Shares.  As soon as 
reasonably practicable thereafter, payroll deductions shall cease and the entire amount credited to 
the Participant’s Plan Account shall be refunded to him or her in cash, without interest.  No 
partial withdrawals shall be permitted.

General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022

2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
(b) Re-enrollment After Withdrawal.  A former Participant who has withdrawn from the 
Plan shall not be a Participant until he or she re-enrolls in the Plan under Section 4(b).  Re-
enrollment may be effective only at the commencement of an Offering Period. 
SECTION 7 Change in Employment Status. 
(a) Termination of Employment.  Termination of employment as an Eligible Employee 
for any reason, including death, shall be treated as an automatic withdrawal from the Plan under 
Section 6(a).  A transfer from one Participating Company to another shall not be treated as a 
termination of employment; provided, however, that if a Participant transfers from an Offering 
under the 423 Component to an Offering under the Non-423 Component, the exercise of the 
Participant’s option will be qualified under the 423 Component only to the extent that such 
exercise complies with Section 423 of the Code. If a Participant transfers from an Offering under 
the Non-423 Component to an Offering under the 423 Component, the exercise of the 
Participant’s option will remain non-qualified under the Non-423 Component.   
(b) Leave of Absence.  For purposes of the Plan, employment shall not be deemed to 
terminate when the Participant goes on a military leave, a sick leave or another bona fide leave of 
absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing.  Employment, however, shall be 
deemed to terminate three (3) months after the Participant goes on a leave, unless a contract or 
statute guarantees his or her right to return to work.  Employment shall be deemed to terminate in 
any event when the approved leave ends, unless the Participant immediately returns to work. 
(c) Death.  In the event of the Participant’s death, the amount credited to his or her Plan 
Account shall be paid to the Participant’s estate. 
SECTION 8 Plan Accounts and Purchase of Shares. 
(a) Plan Accounts.  The Company or a Group Member shall maintain a Plan Account on 
its books in the name of each Participant.  Whenever an amount is deducted from the 
Participant’s Compensation under the Plan, such amount shall be credited to the Participant’s 
Plan Account.  Amounts credited to Plan Accounts shall not be trust funds and may be 
commingled with the general assets of the Company or Group Member and applied to general 
corporate purposes.  No interest shall be credited to Plan Accounts. 
(b) Purchase Price.  The Purchase Price for each Share purchased during an Offering 
Period shall be the lesser of: 
(i) 
eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the 
Purchase Date; or 
(ii) 
eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the 
Offering Date; 
provided that the Purchase Price for each Share purchased shall be no less than the 
nominal value of a Share.

General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
The Committee may specify an alternate Purchase Price amount or formula in the terms 
and conditions of an Offering, but in no event may such amount or formula result in a Purchase 
Price less than that calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding formula. 
(c) Number of Shares Purchased.  As of each Purchase Date, each Participant shall be 
deemed to have elected to purchase the number of Shares calculated in accordance with this 
Subsection (c), unless the Participant has previously elected to withdraw from the Plan in 
accordance with Section 6(a).  The amount then in the Participant’s Plan Account shall be 
divided by the Purchase Price, and the number of Shares that results shall be purchased from the 
Company with the funds in the Participant’s Plan Account.  Unless provided otherwise by the 
Committee prior to commencement of an Offering, the maximum number of Shares which may 
be purchased by an individual Participant during such Offering is equal to the number of  Shares 
given by (i) dividing twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars (U.S. $25,000) (or such other amount as 
may be set out in Section 423(b)(8) of the Code from time to time) by the Fair Market Value of a 
Share on the Offering Date and (ii) multiplying the outcome of the step at (i) by the length of the 
Offering Period in months divided by twelve.  The foregoing notwithstanding, no Participant 
shall purchase more than such number of Shares as may be determined by the Committee with 
respect to the Offering Period, or Purchase Period, if applicable, nor more than the numbers of 
Shares set forth in Sections 9(b) and 14(a).  For each Offering Period and, if applicable, Purchase 
Period, the Committee shall have the authority to establish additional limits on the number of 
Shares purchasable by all Participants in the aggregate. 
(d) Available Shares Insufficient.  In the event that the aggregate number of Shares that 
all Participants elect to purchase during an Offering Period exceeds the maximum number of 
Shares remaining available for issuance under Section 14(a), or which may be purchased 
pursuant to any additional aggregate limits imposed by the Committee, then the number of 
Shares to which each Participant is entitled shall be determined by multiplying the number of 
Shares available for issuance by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares that 
such Participant has elected to purchase and the denominator of which is the number of Shares 
that all Participants have elected to purchase.  
(e) Issuance of Shares.  Shares purchased by a Participant under the Plan shall be issued 
to him or her as soon as reasonably practicable after the applicable Purchase Date, except that the 
Company may determine that such Shares shall be held for each Participant’s benefit by a broker 
designated by the Company or by a designated agent of the Company. The Company may 
require that Shares be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time, and/or 
may establish procedures to permit tracking of dispositions of Shares. Shares may be registered 
in the name of the Participant or jointly in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse as 
joint tenants with right of survivorship or as community property. 
(f) Unused Cash Balances.  An amount remaining in the Participant’s Plan Account that 
represents the Purchase Price for any fractional Share shall be carried over in the Participant’s 
Plan Account to the next Offering Period or refunded to the Participant in cash at the end of the 
Offering Period, without interest, if his or her participation is not continued.  Any amount

Employee). 
(c) Ten Percent in Ten Year Limit.  An option to purchase Shares may not be granted if

committed to be issued in the preceding ten (10)-year period under: 
(i)

employee trust have purchased, or determined that they will purchase, in order to satisfy 
an option to purchase Shares under the Plan or under any other part or subplan of, or any 
schedule to, the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  or the exercise of 
an option or the vesting of other rights of an employee under any Employees’ Share 
Scheme operated by the Group; and

number of Shares which does not cause the limit to be exceeded.  If more than one option to

of descent and distribution.  If a Participant in any manner attempts to transfer, assign or 
otherwise encumber his or her rights or interest under the Plan, other than by the laws of descent 
and distribution, then such act shall be treated as an election by the Participant to withdraw from 
the Plan under Section 6(a).

between the Eligible Employee and their employer will be separate from, and not affected by, the 
Plan; (c) an Eligible Employee has no right to be granted an option to purchase Shares and the

Purchase Price in a particular way) is no indication that the Participant will be granted any 
subsequent options to purchase Shares (or that the calculations of the Purchase Price will be 
made in the same or a similar way); (d) the Plan does not entitle any Participant to the exercise of 
any discretion in their favor; (e) the benefit to an Eligible Employee of participation in the Plan 
(including, in particular but not by way of limitation, any options to purchase Shares held by 
them) shall not form any part of their remuneration or count as their remuneration for any 
purpose and shall not be pensionable; (f) if an Eligible Employee ceases to be in employment 
with the Group for any reason, they shall not be entitled to compensation for the loss or

way of damages for unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, breach of contract or otherwise or

share dividend or bonus issue, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, amalgamation, 
consolidation, split-up, spin-off, reorganization, combination, exchange of Shares, the issuance 
of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities, or any other change in 
corporate structure or in the event of any extraordinary distribution (whether in the form of cash, 
Shares, other securities or other property). For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of a Capital Reorganization, the number 
of Shares subject to an option, the description of the Shares, the Purchase Price or any one or 
more of these shall be adjusted in such manner as the Board shall determine.  No adjustment

event of a Corporate Reorganization in which the Plan is not assumed by the successor 
corporation or its parent corporation or an equivalent option is not substituted by the successor 
corporation or its parent corporation pursuant to or in consequence of the applicable Corporate 
Reorganization event, the Offering Period then in progress shall terminate immediately prior to 
the effective time of such Corporate Reorganization and either Shares shall be purchased 
pursuant to Section 8 or, if so determined by the Board or Committee, all amounts in all Plan 
Accounts shall be refunded pursuant to Section 15 without any purchase of Shares.  For the

with the limitations of the Plan. The Committee shall have the discretion to provide for the 
Rules of the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
automatic termination of an Offering following any Purchase Date on which the Fair Market 
Value of a Share is equal to or less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Offering Date, 
and for the Participants in the terminated Offering to be automatically re-enrolled in a new 
Offering that commences immediately after such Purchase Date.  The terms and conditions of 
each Offering need not be identical, and shall be deemed incorporated by reference and made a 
part of the Plan.   
(b) Enrollment.  Any individual who, on the day preceding the first day of an Offering 
Period, qualifies as an Eligible Employee may elect to become a Participant in the Plan for such 
Offering Period by completing the enrollment process prescribed and communicated for this 
purpose from time to time by the Company to Eligible Employees. 
(c) Duration of Participation.  Once enrolled in the Plan, a Participant shall continue to 
participate in the Plan until he or she ceases to be an Eligible Employee or withdraws from the 
Plan under Section 6(a).  A Participant who withdrew from the Plan under Section 6(a) may 
again become a Participant, if he or she then is an Eligible Employee, by following the procedure 
described in Subsection (b) above.  A Participant whose employee contributions were 
discontinued automatically under Section 9(a) shall automatically resume participation at the 
beginning of the earliest Offering Period ending in the next calendar year, if he or she then is an 
Eligible Employee.  When a Participant reaches the end of an Offering Period but his or her 
participation is to continue, then such Participant shall automatically be re-enrolled for the 
Offering Period that commences immediately after the end of the prior Offering Period. 
SECTION 5 Employee Contributions. 
(a) Frequency of Payroll Deductions.  A Participant may purchase Shares under the Plan 
solely by means of payroll deductions; provided, however, that to the extent provided in the 
terms and conditions of an Offering, a Participant may also make contributions through payment 
by cash or check prior to one or more Purchase Dates during the Offering.  Payroll deductions, 
subject to the provisions of Subsection (b) below or as otherwise provided under the terms and 
conditions of an Offering, shall occur on each payday during participation in the Plan. 
(b) Amount of Payroll Deductions.  An Eligible Employee shall designate during the 
enrollment process the portion or amount of his or her Compensation that he or she elects to have 
withheld for the purchase of Shares.  Such portion or amount shall be not less than one percent 
(1%) of the Eligible Employee’s Compensation nor more than such percentage or amount of 
Compensation specified as the limit in the terms and conditions of the applicable Offering and in 
all respects shall be made on an after-tax basis. 
(c) Changing Withholding Rate.  Unless otherwise provided under the terms and 
conditions of an Offering, a Participant may not increase the rate of payroll withholding during 
the Offering Period, but may discontinue or decrease the rate of payroll withholding during the 
Offering Period to a whole percentage of his or her Compensation in accordance with such 
procedures and subject to such limitations as the Company may establish for all Participants.  A 
Participant may also increase or decrease the rate of payroll withholding effective on 
commencement of a new Offering Period by submitting an authorization to change the payroll

General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
deduction rate pursuant to the process prescribed by the Company from time to time.  The new 
withholding rate shall be a whole percentage of the Eligible Employee’s Compensation 
consistent with Subsection (b) above. 
(d) Discontinuing Payroll Deductions.  If a Participant wishes to discontinue employee 
contributions entirely, he or she may do so by withdrawing from the Plan pursuant to Section 
6(a).  In addition, employee contributions may be discontinued automatically pursuant to Section 
9(b). 
SECTION 6 Withdrawal from the Plan. 
(a) Withdrawal.  A Participant may elect to withdraw from the Plan by giving notice 
pursuant to the process prescribed and communicated by the Company from time to time.  Such 
withdrawal may be elected at any time before the last day of an Offering Period, except as 
otherwise provided in the Offering.  In addition, if payment by cash or check is permitted under 
the terms and conditions of an Offering, Participants may be deemed to withdraw from the Plan 
by declining or failing to remit timely payment to the Company for the Shares.  As soon as 
reasonably practicable thereafter, payroll deductions shall cease and the entire amount credited to 
the Participant’s Plan Account shall be refunded to him or her in cash, without interest.  No 
partial withdrawals shall be permitted.  
(b) Re-enrollment After Withdrawal.  A former Participant who has withdrawn from the 
Plan shall not be a Participant until he or she re-enrolls in the Plan under Section 4(b).  Re-
enrollment may be effective only at the commencement of an Offering Period. 
SECTION 7 Change in Employment Status. 
(a) Termination of Employment.  Termination of employment as an Eligible Employee 
for any reason, including death, shall be treated as an automatic withdrawal from the Plan under 
Section 6(a).  A transfer from one Participating Company to another shall not be treated as a 
termination of employment. 
(b) Leave of Absence.  For purposes of the Plan, employment shall not be deemed to 
terminate when the Participant goes on a military leave, a sick leave or another bona fide leave of 
absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing.  Employment, however, shall be 
deemed to terminate three (3) months after the Participant goes on a leave, unless a contract or 
statute guarantees his or her right to return to work.  Employment shall be deemed to terminate in 
any event when the approved leave ends, unless the Participant immediately returns to work. 
(c) Death.  In the event of the Participant’s death, the amount credited to his or her Plan 
Account shall be paid to the Participant’s estate. 
(d) Date of Termination.  For purposes of the Plan, the date of termination of 
employment (regardless of whether the termination is lawful or unlawful, with or without cause, 
and whether it is the Eligible Employee or the Participating Company that initiates the 
termination), is the later of: (i) if and only to the extent required to comply with the minimum 
Rules of the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
standards of the ESL, the last day of the applicable minimum statutory notice period applicable 
to the Participant pursuant to the ESL, if any; and (ii) the date that is designated by the 
Participant’s employer, as the last day of the Participant’s employment with the Participant’s 
employer provided that in the case of termination of employment by resignation by the 
Participant, such date shall not be earlier than the date notice of resignation was given; and, in 
the case of either (i) or (ii), without regard to any applicable period of reasonable notice or 
contractual notice to which the Participant may claim to be entitled under common law, civil law 
or pursuant to contract in respect of a period which follows the last day that the Participant 
actually and actively provides services to the Participant’s employer as specified in the notice of 
termination provided by the Participant’s employer. For the avoidance of any doubt, the parties 
intend to displace any presumption that the Participant is entitled to reasonable notice of 
termination under common law or civil law in connection with the Plan. 
SECTION 8 Plan Accounts and Purchase of Shares. 
(a) Plan Accounts.  The Company or a Group Member shall maintain a Plan Account on 
its books in the name of each Participant.  Whenever an amount is deducted from the 
Participant’s Compensation under the Plan, such amount shall be credited to the Participant’s 
Plan Account.  Amounts credited to Plan Accounts shall not be trust funds and may be 
commingled with the general assets of the Company or Group Member and applied to general 
corporate purposes.  No interest shall be credited to Plan Accounts. 
(b) Purchase Price.  The Purchase Price for each Share purchased during an Offering 
Period shall be the lesser of: 
(i) 
eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the 
Purchase Date; or 
(ii) 
eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the 
Offering Date; 
provided that the Purchase Price for each Share purchased shall be no less than the 
nominal value of a Share. 
The Committee may specify an alternate Purchase Price amount or formula in the terms 
and conditions of an Offering, but in no event may such amount or formula result in a Purchase 
Price less than that calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding formula. 
(c) Number of Shares Purchased.  As of each Purchase Date, each Participant shall be 
deemed to have elected to purchase the number of Shares calculated in accordance with this 
Subsection (c), unless the Participant has previously elected to withdraw from the Plan in 
accordance with Section 6(a).  The amount then in the Participant’s Plan Account shall be 
divided by the Purchase Price, and the number of Shares that results shall be purchased from the 
Company with the funds in the Participant’s Plan Account.  Unless provided otherwise by the 
Committee prior to commencement of an Offering, the maximum number of Shares which may 
be purchased by an individual Participant during such Offering is equal to the number of  Shares 
Rules of the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
given by (i) dividing the equivalent in Canadian dollars (using such exchange rate as determined 
by the Board) of twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars (U.S. $25,000) (or the equivalent in Canadian 
dollars (using such exchange rate as determined by the Board) of such other amount as may be 
set out in Section 423(b)(8) of the Code from time to time) by the Fair Market Value of a Share 
on the Offering Date and (ii) multiplying the outcome of the step at (i) by the length of the 
Offering Period in months divided by twelve.  The foregoing notwithstanding, no Participant 
shall purchase more than such number of Shares as may be determined by the Committee with 
respect to the Offering Period, or Purchase Period, if applicable, nor more than the numbers of 
Shares set forth in Sections 9(a) and 14(a).  For each Offering Period and, if applicable, Purchase 
Period, the Committee shall have the authority to establish additional limits on the number of 
Shares purchasable by all Participants in the aggregate. 
(d) Available Shares Insufficient.  In the event that the aggregate number of Shares that 
all Participants elect to purchase during an Offering Period exceeds the maximum number of 
Shares remaining available for issuance under Section 14(a), or which may be purchased 
pursuant to any additional aggregate limits imposed by the Committee, then the number of 
Shares to which each Participant is entitled shall be determined by multiplying the number of 
Shares available for issuance by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares that 
such Participant has elected to purchase and the denominator of which is the number of Shares 
that all Participants have elected to purchase.  
(e) Issuance of Shares.  Shares purchased by a Participant under the Plan shall be issued 
to him or her as soon as reasonably practicable after the applicable Purchase Date, except that the 
Company may determine that such Shares shall be held for each Participant’s benefit by a broker 
designated by the Company or by a designated agent of the Company. The Company may 
require that Shares be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time, and/or 
may establish procedures to permit tracking of dispositions of Shares. Shares may be registered 
in the name of the Participant or jointly in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse as 
joint tenants with right of survivorship or as community property.  
(f) Unused Cash Balances.  An amount remaining in the Participant’s Plan Account that 
represents the Purchase Price for any fractional Share shall be carried over in the Participant’s 
Plan Account to the next Offering Period or refunded to the Participant in cash at the end of the 
Offering Period, without interest, if his or her participation is not continued.  Any amount 
remaining in the Participant’s Plan Account that represents the Purchase Price for whole shares 
that could not be purchased by reason of Subsection (c) or (d) above, Section 9(b) [or 
Section 14(a)] shall be refunded to the Participant in cash, without interest. 
(g) Shareholder Approval. The Plan shall be submitted to the shareholders of the 
Company for their approval within twelve (12) months before or after the date the Plan is 
adopted by the Board. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, no Shares shall be 
purchased under the Plan unless and until the Board and the Company’s shareholders have 
approved the adoption of the Plan. 
(h) Withholding.  To the extent required by applicable federal, state, foreign or local law, 
a Participant must make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment of any 
Rules of the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
withholding or similar tax obligations that arise in connection with the Plan.  Unless the 
Participant discharges any liability that may arise himself or herself, the Company or any Group 
Member or former Group Member (as the case may be) may deduct or cause to be deducted from 
any amounts payable to a Participant   such amount, or make such other arrangements as it may 
determine appropriate, for example to sell or withhold Shares, to meet any liability to taxes or 
social security contributions in respect of such Participant’s options.  
SECTION 9 Limitations on Shares Ownership. 
(a) Dollar Limit.  Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, no Participant shall 
accrue the right to purchase Shares at a rate which exceeds the equivalent in Canadian dollars 
(using such exchange rate as determined by the Board) of twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars 
(U.S. $25,000) of Fair Market Value of such Shares per calendar year (under the Plan and all 
other employee stock purchase plans of the Company or any parent or Related Entity of the 
Company), determined by such method as the Board determines which may be based, as far as 
the Board determines practicable, on the provisions of Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and 
applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.   
For purposes of this Subsection (a), the Fair Market Value of a Share shall be determined 
as of the beginning of the Offering Period in which such Shares is purchased.  Employee stock 
purchase plans not described in Section 423 of the Code shall be disregarded.  If a Participant is 
precluded by this Subsection (a) from purchasing additional Shares under the Plan, then his or 
her employee contributions shall automatically be discontinued and shall resume at the beginning 
of the earliest Offering Period ending in the next calendar year (if he or she then is an Eligible 
Employee). 
(b) Ten Percent in Ten Year Limit.  An option to purchase Shares may not be granted if 
the result of granting the option would be that the aggregate number of Shares issued or 
committed to be issued in the preceding ten (10)-year period under: 
(i) 
options to purchase Shares under the Plan; or 
(ii) 
options or awards granted under any other part or subplan of, or any 
schedule to, the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any Employees’ 
Share Scheme (whether or not discretionary) operated by the Group; 
would exceed 10 percent (10%) of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at that 
time. 
For the purpose of the limit in this Section 9(b): 
(i) 
for as long as required by The Investment Association guidelines treasury, 
Shares shall be included in the limit as if they were new issue Shares; 
(ii) 
there shall be disregarded any Shares where the right to acquire the Shares 
has lapsed or been renounced;

General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
(iii) 
there shall be disregarded any existing Shares which the trustees of any 
employee trust have purchased, or determined that they will purchase, in order to satisfy 
an option to purchase Shares under the Plan or under any other part or subplan of, or any 
schedule to, the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the exercise of 
an option or the vesting of other rights of an employee under any Employees’ Share 
Scheme operated by the Group; and 
(iv) 
any Shares issued or issuable in relation to an option to purchase Shares 
under the Plan or under any other part or subplan of, or any schedule to, the Drax Group 
plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or on the exercise of an option or the vesting of 
other rights of an employee under any Employees’ Share Scheme operated by the Group, 
shall be taken into account once only (when the option is granted or the right awarded) 
and shall not fall out of account when the option is exercised or other rights vest. 
If the granting of an option to purchase Shares under the Plan would cause the limit in 
this Section 9(b) to be exceeded, such option shall take effect as an option over the maximum 
number of Shares which does not cause the limit to be exceeded.  If more than one option to 
purchase Shares is granted on the same date, the number of Shares which would otherwise be 
subject to each option to purchase Shares shall be reduced pro rata. 
SECTION 10 Rights Not Transferable. 
The rights of any Participant under the Plan, or any Participant’s interest in any Shares or 
moneys to which he or she may be entitled under the Plan, shall not be transferable by voluntary 
or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, or in any other manner other than by the laws 
of descent and distribution.  If a Participant in any manner attempts to transfer, assign or 
otherwise encumber his or her rights or interest under the Plan, other than by the laws of descent 
and distribution, then such act shall be treated as an election by the Participant to withdraw from 
the Plan under Section 6(a). 
SECTION 11 No Rights as An Employee. 
Nothing in the Plan or in any right granted under the Plan shall confer upon the 
Participant any right to continue in the employ of a Participating Company for any period of 
specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Participating 
Companies or of the Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate 
his or her employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause.  In addition, (a) the 
Plan shall not form part of any contract of employment between any Group Member and an 
Eligible Employee; (b) the rights and obligations arising from the employment relationship 
between the Eligible Employee and their employer will be separate from, and not affected by, the 
Plan; (c) an Eligible Employee has no right to be granted an option to purchase Shares and the 
receipt of an option to purchase Shares in one year or Offering Period (and the calculation of the 
Purchase Price in a particular way) is no indication that the Participant will be granted any 
subsequent options to purchase Shares (or that the calculations of the Purchase Price will be 
made in the same or a similar way); (d) the Plan does not entitle any Participant to the exercise of 
any discretion in their favor; (e) the benefit to an Eligible Employee of participation in the Plan 
Rules of the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
(including, in particular but not by way of limitation, any options to purchase Shares held by 
them) shall not form any part of their remuneration or count as their remuneration for any 
purpose and shall not be pensionable; (f) if an Eligible Employee ceases to be in employment 
with the Group for any reason, they shall not be entitled to compensation for the loss or 
diminution in value of any right or benefit or prospective right or benefit under the Plan 
(including, in particular but not by way of limitation, any options to purchase Shares held by 
them which lapse by reason of their ceasing to be employment with the Group) whether by way 
of damages for unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, breach of contract or otherwise or anything 
analogous thereto in any jurisdiction; and (g) this Section 11 applies during an Eligible 
Employee’s employment and after the termination of an Eligible Employee’s employment, 
whether or not the termination is lawful. 
SECTION 12 No Rights as A Shareholder. 
A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares that he or 
she may have a right to purchase under the Plan until such Shares have been purchased on the 
applicable Purchase Date.  All Shares issued or transferred under the Plan shall, as to voting, 
dividend, transfer and other rights, including those arising on a liquidation of the Company, rank 
equally in all respects and as one class with the shares of the same class in issue at the date of 
issue or transfer save as regards any rights attaching to such Shares by reference to a record date 
prior to the date of such issue or transfer. 
SECTION 13 Securities Law Requirements. 
Shares shall not be issued under the Plan unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares 
comply with (or are exempt from) all applicable requirements of law, including (without 
limitation) the applicable Securities Acts of  the provinces and territories in Canada,  the 
regulations made thereunder and the blanket rulings and orders issued by the securities 
regulatory authority in each applicable jurisdiction, and the regulations of any stock exchange or 
other securities market on which the Company’s securities may then be traded. 
SECTION 14 Shares Offered Under the Plan. 
(a) Authorized Shares.  The maximum aggregate number of Shares available for 
purchase under both Part A and Part B of the Plan is 20,000,000 Shares.  The aggregate number 
of Shares available for purchase under the Plan shall at all times be subject to adjustment 
pursuant to Section 14(b). 
(b) Antidilution Adjustments.  The aggregate number of Shares offered under the Plan, 
the individual and aggregate Participant share limitations described in Section 8(c) and the price 
of Shares that any Participant has elected to purchase may be adjusted proportionately by the 
Committee in the event of any change in the number of issued Shares (or issuance of shares other 
than Shares) by reason of any forward or reverse share split, subdivision or consolidation, or 
share dividend or bonus issue, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, amalgamation, 
consolidation, split-up, spin-off, reorganization, combination, exchange of Shares, the issuance 
of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities, or any other change in 
Rules of the Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of Drax Group plc to be held on 27 April 2022 
 
 
DRAX GROUP PLC 
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 
corporate structure or in the event of any extraordinary distribution (whether in the form of cash, 
Shares, other securities or other property). For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of a Capital Reorganization, the number 
of Shares subject to an option, the description of the Shares, the Purchase Price or any one or 
more of these shall be adjusted in such manner as the Board shall determine.  No adjustment 
shall be made to the Purchase Price which would result in the Shares subject to an option being 
issued at a price per Share lower than the nominal value of a Share. 
(c) Corporate Reorganizations.  Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, in the 
event of a Corporate Reorganization in which the Plan is not assumed by the successor 
corporation or its parent corporation or an equivalent option is not substituted by the successor 
corporation or its parent corporation pursuant to or in consequence of the applicable Corporate 
Reorganization event, the Offering Period then in progress shall terminate immediately prior to 
the effective time of such Corporate Reorganization and either Shares shall be purchased 
pursuant to Section 8 or, if so determined by the Board or Committee, all amounts in all Plan 
Accounts shall be refunded pursuant to Section 15 without any purchase of Shares.  For the 
purposes of the preceding sentence, the “effective time” of an event specified in paragraph (iii) 
of the definition of Corporate Reorganization shall be the time when the person making the offer 
has obtained Control and the offer becomes wholly unconditional in all respects, where 
paragraph (iv) of that definition applies, the “effective time” shall be the date when the person 
serves a notice under Section 979 of the Companies Act 2006 of the United Kingdom and where 
paragraph (v) of that definition applies, the “effective time” shall be the date that the compromise 
or arrangement is sanctioned by the court.  The Plan shall in no event be construed to restrict in 
any way the Company’s right to undertake a dissolution, liquidation, merger, consolidation or 
other reorganization. 
SECTION 15 Amendment or Discontinuance. 
(a) Amendments Generally.  The Board or Committee shall have the right to amend 
(subject to Sections 15(b) and 15(c) below), suspend or terminate the Plan at any time and 
without notice and no options to purchase Shares may be granted after the tenth (10th) 
anniversary of shareholder approval of the Plan. Upon any such amendment, suspension or 
termination of the Plan during an Offering Period, the Board or Committee may in its discretion 
determine that the applicable Offering shall immediately terminate and that all amounts in the 
Plan Accounts shall be carried forward into a payroll deduction account for each Participant 
under a successor plan, if any, or promptly refunded to each Participant.  Except as provided in 
Section 14, any increase in the aggregate number of Shares to be issued under the Plan shall be 
subject to approval by a vote of the shareholders of the Company.  In addition, any other 
amendment of the Plan shall be subject to approval by a vote of the shareholders of the Company 
to the extent required by an applicable law or regulation. The Plan shall continue until the earlier 
to occur of (a) termination of the Plan pursuant to this Section 15 or (b) issuance of all of the 
Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan. 
(b) Limitations on Amendments.  Without the prior approval of the Company in general 
meeting, an amendment may not be made for the benefit of existing or future Participants to the 
Plan relating to:

of the Plan; or 
(y) 
an amendment which is of a minor nature and is necessary or desirable in 
order to take account of a change of legislation or to obtain or maintain favorable tax, 
exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants in the Plan, the Company or 
some other Group Member. 
(c) Existing Entitlements.  An amendment may not materially adversely affect the rights 
of an existing Participant except: 
(i) 
where the amendment is made to take account of any matter or 
circumstance which the Board reasonably considers is a legal or regulatory requirement 
which the Board reasonably considers is relevant and requires an amendment to be made 
in order for any Group Member to comply with such requirement; or 
(ii) 
where the Participant affected by the change has been notified of such 
amendment and the majority of Participants holding options under the Plan have 
approved the amendment.

SCHEDULE A: Employees of Related Undertakings 
The Committee may determine under Section 3(b) of the Non-423 Component (“Part B”) of the 
Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, without limiting the scope of its powers 
under that Section 3(b),  to establish one or more sub-plans in order to permit the grant of options 
to purchase Shares by employees who are not or may not be employees of the Company or a 
Related Entity but are employees of a subsidiary (as defined in section 1159 of the Companies 
Act 2006 of the United Kingdom), a subsidiary undertaking, associated undertaking or related 
undertaking or entity (in each case as determined by the Committee) of the Company (a 
“Related Undertaking”).   
In determining whether an employer is a subsidiary undertaking, associated undertaking or 
related undertaking or entity of the Company, the Committee may have regard to whether an 
employer is described as such in the financial statements of Drax Group plc or any Group 
Member and/or to legislation or regulations of the United Kingdom or elsewhere.   Where a sub-
plan is established to permit the grant of options to purchase Shares by employees of a Related 
Undertaking, without limiting the scope of Section 3(b) of Part B, the Committee may include 
within the subplan such provisions as it considers necessary or desirable to take account of the 
fact that the individuals eligible to take part in the subplan are employees of a Related 
Undertaking, including amendments to the definitions of Participating Company and Related 
Entity. 
Words and expressions defined in Part B shall have the same meaning in this Schedule A, except 
where the context otherwise requires.

SCHEDULE B: Cash awards 
The Committee may determine under Section 3(b) of the Non-423 Component (“Part B”) of the 
Drax Group plc 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, without limiting the scope of its powers 
under that Section 3(b), to establish one or more sub-plans in order to permit the grant of cash 
based awards for employees to whom it is not practicable or permitted to grant options to 
purchase Shares.  The Committee may determine that relevant employees’ contributions will not 
be used to purchase Shares but will instead be deemed to have been notionally used to purchase 
notional Shares.     
Where a sub-plan is established to permit the grant of cash based awards, without limiting the 
scope of Section 3(b) of Part B, the Committee may include within the subplan such provisions 
as it considers necessary or desirable to reflect that an employee would be paid a cash sum 
equivalent or substantially equivalent (as determined by the Committee) to the gain (as
