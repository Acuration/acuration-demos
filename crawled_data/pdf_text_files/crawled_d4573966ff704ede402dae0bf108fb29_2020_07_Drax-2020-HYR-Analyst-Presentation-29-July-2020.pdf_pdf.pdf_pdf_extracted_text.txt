Why BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)?
A key part of the path to net zero
25
BECCS required to achieve UK net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (UK Committee on Climate Change) 
-
UK is committed by law to net zero by 2050
-
~90Mt of negative emissions p.a. required to offset residual UK emissions in 2050
-
BECCS most scalable negative emissions technology – Drax could deliver ~16 million tonnes p.a.
National Grid Future Energy Scenarios (FES)
-
UK cannot achieve Net Zero in any scenario without negative emissions from BECCS
-
BECCS in the 2020s can help power system go carbon negative as early as 2033
-
All FES feature at least one Drax-size unit by 2027
BECCS is the most cost-effective way to deliver negative emissions globally
-
UK has ~80,000Mt of CO2 storage accessible offshore
-
Humber region is largest area of carbon intensity – opportunity for economies of scale
Supporting UK Government green recovery
-
Support job retention and creation in Humber region and North of England
The UK can become a global leader in BECCS
-
Drax is a pioneer in large-scale renewable power from sustainably sourced biomass
Globally there is an abundance of sustainable biomass available to support BECCS
