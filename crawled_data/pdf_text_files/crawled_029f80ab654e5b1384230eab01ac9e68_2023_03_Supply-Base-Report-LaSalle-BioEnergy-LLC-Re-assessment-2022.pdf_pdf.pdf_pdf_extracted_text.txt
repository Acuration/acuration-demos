Description of countries included in the Supply Base
Country:United States
Area/Region: Lasalle Bioenergy typically procures fiber from Mississippi, Louisiana, and portions of 
Alabama.  Under the consolidated Supply Base, which includes all Drax plants in the southern US, all of 
Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, 
and portions of Texas, Florida, and Oklahoma are also technically in scope.
Exclusions: No
1.
1.1                   General description
Drax fiber procurement catchment includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and portions of Texas (59 counties), Florida (28 
counties), and Oklahoma (32 counties). See map of supply area below. The Company owns and operates 
five primary pellet plants: Amite Bioenergy Gloster, MS; Morehouse Bioenergy near Beekman, LA, LaSalle 
Bioenergy in Urania, LA; Alabama Pellets in Aliceville, and Demopolis, AL. Drax also owns and operates 
two satellite plants: Arkansas Bioenergy Leola, Arkansas Bioenergy Russellville. Each primary plant 
typically draws feedstock from within a 70-mile radius but maintains the ability to procure out to a 100-mile 
radius to obtain primary feedstock in response to market pressures and weather events. However, 
secondary feedstocks produced by forest product manufactures could be procured from as far away as 
200 miles and tertiary material (residuals from secondary manufacturing of lumber) could be procured 
anywhere within the supply are depicted on map below. Each satellite plant will obtain feedstock from the 
secondary material produced by the forest products manufacturer that is adjacent to the facility. 
A map of Drax’s sourcing area forms part of Drax’s contract with suppliers
DBI purchases the majority of its in-woods fiber indirectly from private landowners via a fiber supplier 
network, with negligible amounts originating from public ownership. About half of the in-woods fiber 
originates from institutionally owned private forests while the other half is derived from family-owned private 
forests.
LaSalle BioEnergy
Facility is designed to consume just over 1 million green metric tons of green and dry biomass material per 
annum. The sourced material is comprised of mainly southern yellow pine with a potential small quantity of 
mixed southern hardwoods. The pellet and furnace feedstock arrives in the form of low grade roundwood, 
thinnings, tops, logging and mill residues. According to the USDA Forest Service Timber Products Output 
Reports, consumption by other forest industry participants within 100 miles of LBE’s fiber catchment in 
2015 was estimated to be in excess of 14 million metric tonnes per annum which puts into perspective the 
ability of the catchment to supply the forest products industry. Pulp and chip mills in the region also have an 
average capacity of around 1 million green short tons per facility per year, with some consuming well over 2 
million green tons per year. Sawmills are slightly smaller, consuming on average around 300,000 green 
short tons per year.
Currently similar macroeconomic trends have followed previous years as sawmilling capacity shifts from the 
Canadian Pacific and US PNW  to the US South as a result of resource availability. There have been 
continuing changes in the number and type of other wood using industries operating in LBE’s catchment as 
sawmill production expansion has been announced. The lumber market suffered in the onset of the COVID 
-19 worldwide pandemic, but has slightly recovered as a result of an increased home remodeling activity. 
LaSalle Lumber, LLC, a partnership between Tolko Industries, Ltd and Hunt Forest Products, LLC began 
production at their state of the art sawmill in early 2019 and have reached nameplate capacity. LaSalle 
Lumber is co-located with LaSalle Bioenergy and receives 100% of their residual materials.
Regional markets for pulpwood have also contracted in the past year as Georgia Pacific-Crossett ceased 
pulp and paperboard production in Q4 2019, representing a 24% decrease in hardwood pulpwood demand. 
In May of 2020, Graphic Packing International announced the closure of Paper Machine #1 in its West 
Monroe manufacturing facility. It is not known what market impacts this closure are yet. 
In-woods chipping capacity also remains available in the catchment area due to supressed boiler fuel 
markets related to low natural gas costs. Some suppliers and landowners prefer in-woods chipping 
operations over conventional harvests because the enable better utilization of forest residuals and brushy 
hardwood competition which can improve forest vigour, and reduce future site preparation costs.
Land Use and Ownership patterns 
Forestry followed by crop agriculture are the dominant land uses in the LBE catchment. Planted pine 
forests and other timberlands make up much of the forestland. Some sizeable areas of predominantly 
unmanaged forest are present along the larger rivers. Most of the forests in these areas have been 
harvested and regenerated multiple times over the last two centuries. The forests in LBE’s catchment are a 
mosaic of ownerships, acreages and management regimes/intensities.
Over half of the forestlands surrounding LBE are privately owned by corporate forest landowners (i.e. 
REITs & TIMOs). These forests are often managed more intensively because they must produce 
shareholder returns. The second largest ownership, comprising slightly over a third of the landbase, is in 
non-corporate private ownership. These landowners typically manage their timberlands to achieve more 
diverse objectives. As the average tract size of these holdings is less than 100 acres, timber revenue 
generally represents just a portion of their total income but is still important to owning and maintaining their 
properties. The remaining of acreage in LBE’s fiber basket is in public ownership (i.e. federal and state 
governments), but it is the predictable management regimes of corporate owners, augmented by 
management on family forest lands, which provide a steady flow of pulpwood for LBE and the surrounding 
markets. 
 
 
 
While forest coverage has stayed steady in these areas during the past 40-50 years, the forests have 
become Increasingly productive in that time. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data shows that growth per 
acre per year has doubled in the US South since the 1950’s, and it continues to increase as healthy 
markets provide incentives for owners to invest in forest management. Put simply, landowners’ access to 
markets helps to ensure that their forests remain as working forests.
Local decline of the US pulp and paper industry has resulted in the closure or curtailment of large pulp mills 
in or adjacent to the catchment that previously consumed over 3 million tonnes of feedstock collectively 
each year. The catchment also historically supported several paper mills. The emergence of a wood pellet 
market has benefited forest owners and contractors in the area by offsetting a portion of the lost demand 
from the closed mills.
The overall market downturn, subsequent housing market crash of 2008 and the slow recovery in 
residential construction resulted in reduced levels of demand for sawtimber. This produced an increase in 
stocks of larger-diameter trees, with a corresponding reduction in felling and replanting. These market 
dynamics have had long-term consequences for the structure of the forest. One outcome of the changing 
structure has been the opening of the LaSalle Lumber, LLC sawmill facility, to utilize some of the local 
oversupply of logs.
Looking to the future, further increases in pine forest productivity can be achieved through simple measures 
such as planting with improved seedlings and implementing diligent forest establishment practices. We will 
seek to engage with and support this process through the sharing of information and supporting sensible 
partnerships that promote forest certification through direct landowner contact. In areas with strong markets 
for forest products, we should expect forests to stay as working forests, whereas other areas may cycle out 
of forestry into row crops or pastureland, and other agricultural areas may cycle back into forestry. Urban 
expansion remains the biggest threat to the forest area. Private ownership is expected to remain the main 
form of forest ownership, but there may be fragmentation as land is split into smaller parcels as it is passed 
down through generations, thereby creating challenges to implement consistent good forest management 
practices.
 
 
Forestry and Land Management Practices
There is a mature and well-developed forest sector in this geography. Described as a “wood basket to the 
world”, the US South has grown, harvested and sold many hundreds of millions of cubic meters per year for 
many decades, while seeing both its forest inventories and productivity levels increase. In the US South 
and in LBE’s catchment, annual growth exceeds annual drain by a considerable margin. Seventy-six 
percent of the acres surrounding LBE are heavily forested and defined as timberland. Sixty percent of the 
timberland base is dedicated to pine production (USDA Forest Service, 2012).
The main reasons for this include a productive land base that benefits from long growing seasons, sufficient 
precipitation, and healthy soils, as well as the longstanding engagement of experts and professionals from 
across industry, academia, and public agencies which help advance sound forest management practices. 
Species selection is another principal factor, as most landowners grow trees that are indigenous to the 
area, which creates environmental and economic benefits, such as maintenance of habitats for local flora 
and fauna, as well as establishing a resilient native growing stock with improved pest and disease 
resistance. Federal and state governments also provide effective oversight to ensure that forest activities 
comply with relevant laws and regulations and minimise environmental harm. Moreover, each state 
employs long-established “Best Management Practices”, with programs to promote logger training and 
audits that demonstrate high compliance rates.
Though the region also possesses a vigorous and productive hardwood sector, LBE primarily uses 
Southern Yellow Pine (SYP).  SYP is a term used to describe an abundant and highly productive group of 
native pine species, of which loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) is the most prevalent in this region.  Production and 
sale of sawlogs remains the main economic driver for landowners, with SYP rotation lengths typically 
ranging from 20-40 years. The shorter rotations are for the most productive trees on the best sites, while 
the longer rotations typically apply to trees grown on lower quality sites.
Thinning is an important forest management strategy for growing sawlog-quality SYP. Stands are typically 
thinned at 12 years old and again at 18 years old to promote faster growth of the remaining trees. Thinning 
also allows more light, moisture and nutrients to reach the forest floor, which increases the vitality of the 
forest, improves wildlife habitat, and in turn offers recreational benefits. Forest thinnings make up a 
considerable proportion of the feedstocks for LBE.
Rotation harvest of SYP is typically conducted through clearcutting. SYP is not tolerant of shade, so the 
next rotation of young trees requires abundant access to light to grow well. DBI accepts material from final 
rotation harvests, although the material received is limited to residuals and roundwood that are not sold into 
higher paying markets. The vast majority of material from rotation harvests are completed for and sold into 
sawlog markets.
The next rotation may be re-established through natural regeneration, or the planting of seedlings, or a 
combination of both. Reforestation often involves some ground preparation to control competing vegetation.
 
Looking to the future, further increases in pine forest productivity can be achieved through simple measures 
such as planting with improved seedlings and implementing diligent forest establishment practices. We will 
seek to engage with and support this process through the sharing of information and supporting sensible 
partnerships that promote forest certification through direct landowner contact. In areas with strong markets 
for forest products, we should expect forests to stay as working forests, whereas other areas may cycle out 
of forestry into row crops or husbandry, and other agricultural areas may cycle back into forestry. Urban 
expansion remains the biggest threat to the forest area. Private ownership is expected to remain the main 
form of forest ownership, but there may be fragmentation as land is split into smaller parcels as it is passed 
down through generations, thereby creating challenges to implement good forest management practices.
Presence of CITES or IUCN species
There is no Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (“CITES”) 
listed species in the catchment that are threatened or otherwise impacted by forest management activities.
There aresix species on the IUCN Red List that occur within the states DBI sources from. Quercus 
oglethorpensis (oglethorpe oak), Fraxinus profunda (pumpkin ash), Fraxinus caroliniana (carolina ash), 
maple-leaved oak (Quercus acerifolia), Quercus boyntonii, and Pinus palustris (longleaf pine).  Longleaf 
pine is the only species which may be materially impacted by DBI’s sourcing, with the others species 
occurring in wetlands or extreme remote locations where southern yellow pine, DBI’s primary feedstock, is 
not found. Longleaf pine is far less common than it once was, and efforts are underway to promote longleaf 
pine coverage in the region. The intent of listing species to the Red List is not to promote prohibition of its 
use but rather to heighten priority setting for conservation of the species 
(http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/RedListGuidelines.pdf). Critical to the recovery of the species is 
continued access to markets for longleaf pine. If landowners do not expect to be able to sell this wood, then 
they will not plant the tree in the first place.  This position is captured in a statement from a USDA 
researcher and supported by the conservation group the Longleaf Alliance: 
“Strong markets for forest products provide incentives for private landowners to keep their lands in forest 
cover (Wear 2013). This is particularly important across the longleaf range where recent forecasts of 
human population and income growth point toward increasing pressure in some locations to convert forest 
land to other uses (Wear 2013). Strong markets also enable landowners to invest in the management 
practices required to establish longleaf pine forests and implement practices such as prescribed fire and 
thinning which are crucial restoration activities.”
Forestland Descriptions
LBE is located near the southern tip of an extensive pine forest situated between the Mississippi River and 
the Red River’s alluvial plains. These rivers act as a natural geographic barrier for LBE’s supply basin. 
Despite the presence of two large watersheds in the area, 60% of the acreage within the shed is 
established as site suitable pine forest and over half of the inventory is pine pulpwood.
State forestry websites feature detailed descriptions of forests and include noteworthy facts about each 
state’s forests. FIA data is also publicly available, and provide many important parameters, including 
changes over time, in the states that supply LBE. Summaries of forest coverage near LaSalle (Urania, LA) 
are shown in the tables below.
SBP Feedstock Product Groups & Supplier Make-Up
All Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary feedstock used by LBE is SBP-compliant. 
LBE’s supplier base is made up of timber dealers, logger-dealers and managers of corporately owned 
timberland providing primary feedstocks in addition to wood manufacturing suppliers who provide 
secondary and tertiary feedstocks. Specific supplier list and volumes by feedstock types is maintained and 
stringently reviewed by external auditor.

2.3
Actions taken to promote certification amongst feedstock supplier
Drax implements Sustainable Forest Management programs, many of which require participant companies 
to promote certified forest management amongst feedstock suppliers. This includes extensive reporting and 
contractually required training, as well as other components that are necessary for the certifications. Drax’s 
sustainability and procurement staff are trained to assist suppliers and landowners in achieving these 
certifications through direct and/or collaborative efforts.  
Drax continually monitors the amount of certified fiber that it purchases and will pursue opportunities to 
increase the area of certified forests within its catchments.  
In 2018 DBI published a document which is shared with suppliers and landowners - “The Southern Working 
Forest – a Guide to Sustainable Management”. Chapter 2 of this document outlines the benefits of 
certification, and contact details are provided for those who want to explore further.

Describe the harvesting type which best describes how your material is sourced: Mix of the above
Explanation: Low-grade roundwood is sourced from both thinnings and final regeneration harvests
Was the forest in the Supply Base managed for a purpose other than for energy markets? Yes - 
Majority
Explanation: Forests in this region are managed for sawtimber productions as well as recreation and wildlife 
management objectives. 
For the forests in the Supply Base, is there an intention to retain, restock or encourage natural 
regeneration within 5 years of felling? Yes - Majority
Explanation: Forest management certified lands have a requirement to replant and/or achieve successful 
natural regeneration within a defined time span. For example SFI lands must be planted with in 2 years of 
felling. Private non-certified lands in this pine dominated region are also generally restocked by planting with 
seedlings but will naturally regenerate to pine or a mixed pine hardwood forest as long as they are not 
cleared for conversion purposes. DBI only sources from forest areas that are intended to remain actively 
growing forests. In addition, the risk of conversion to non-forest is low in this region (see SBE for details).
Was the feedstock used in the biomass removed from a forest as part of a pest/disease control 
measure or a salvage operation? Yes - Minority
Explanation: Much of the wood comes from thinning and regeneration harvest of healthy forests, however, 
removal of diseased and damaged trees is a good practice and Drax Biomass will source this type of 
material for feedstock. Even thinning of relatively healthy forests includes the targeted removal of diseased 
individuals and reduces density to help improve stand health.

Specific risk description:
FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment identify some areas within Drax’s larger supply area as a 
specified risk for conversion, however the majority of the sourcing area is not at risk. The FSC National 
Risk Assessment conducted found that there were limited areas of conversion risk in Drax’s sourcing area 
which were associated with expansion of commercial and residential areas, driven largely by population 
growth (see map below). In their review FSC considered all of the WWF ecoregions, along with the 
concerns cited for conversion, but ultimately focused their finding of conversion on areas these areas of 
urban and residential interface. Drax has therefore accepted that there is a specified risk in some portions 
of its sourcing area. 
4.2
Justification
The majority of supply comes from private lands, and although there are some larger holdings which are 
certified, there are many smaller forests that are not. It was therefore deemed prudent to evaluate the entire 
area without exclusions. The supply area for all pellet mills is included in one assessment, as the applicable 
legal requirements across the supply base are sufficiently similar, and the forest practices are also 
sufficiently similar.
This review and analysis was completed by comparing the existence, effectiveness and applicability of 
statutes/regulations, established forestry best management practices and recognized research from 
reputable sources to determine compliance and risk rating in relation to Criteria 1 & 2 of the SBP Standard 
1.
4.3
Results of risk assessment and Supplier Verification Programme
The Risk Assessment concluded that most aspects are “Low Risk” in the catchment area for the feedstock 
being used. This is predominantly due to sufficient and effective legal requirements in this geography, 
supported by a mature forest industry with well-established practices, including Best Management 
Practices promoted by states and the use of trained loggers support by industry.
This sound framework is supplemented by DBI’s procurement procedures and third-party audits for 
FSC® Chain of Custody (CoC), PEFC™ CoC, and SFI® CoC and Certified Fiber Sourcing. The Fiber 
Sourcing Standard is held by a large number of operators in our catchment, meaning the vast majority of 
harvests will fall under the auspices of this procurement standard. In addition, the growth management and 
harvesting of SYP is less complex than for other forest types, and typically has fewer environmental 
sensitivities.
For indicators 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 and 2.4.1, there is a determination of “Specified Risk”. This follows 
analysis of information included in the recently concluded US FSC® Controlled Wood National Risk 
Assessment. This identified specified risks listed above and described in detailed in Annex 1. 
Mitigation measures discussed in detail in section 7 below, along with diligent procurement processes that 
have been developed, implemented, and monitored over the past 5 years reduce these specified risks to a 
"low risk" designation.
Risk assessment did not find any assignment of “unspecified risk” therefore no supplier verification program 
is required at this time.
4.4
Conclusion
There is “low risk” for most indicators of the SBP Standard 1 based on the evidence provided of sound 
forestry practices, existing effective legislation and diligent procurement processes that guide industry and 
landowners on the sustainable management of forests. For the four indicators where “specified risk” has 
been concluded, mitigating actions derived from multi-stakeholder processes will be implemented and 
monitored for effectiveness.
Forest inventories are steadily increasing, and carbon stocks remain stable in Amite Bioenergy's 
catchment. Local communities benefit from the economic impact resulting from Amite Bioenergy's 
operations.
In conclusion, with diligent procurement processes and implementation of mitigation measures where 
required, the raw material supply and resulting production of pellets meets the requirements for “SBP-
compliant” pellets.
DBI is constantly engaged with stakeholders to ensure any changes are evaluated. 
5 Supply Base Evaluation process
DBI utilized both internal and external resources to complete the Supply Base Evaluation (SBE). The SBE 
was produced by DBI employees with experience in forest certification and sustainability. A highly qualified 
consultant with external auditing expertise helped collect and collate initial supporting evidence and 
stakeholder responses. Other DBI employees, particularly those on the procurement team and those 
associated with company systems, also contributed to the SBE.
Evidence collected as part of achieving and maintaining pre-existing certification programs was used in the 
SBE. Remaining shortfalls were completed by using reputable sources of information provided by public 
agencies, conservation and forestry organizations from within the region.
Contractual requirements with feedstock suppliers provided the baseline by which compliance with SBP 
indicators is achieved, supported by recognized good governance and the effective rule of law at State and 
Federal level.
DBI operates a supplier internal audit process in which suppliers are reviewed on a periodic basis 
depending on a risk level (i.e. certified vs non-certified). The external auditor has a view of the sampling 
rates and results of those reviews.
6 Stakeholder consultation 
DBI's most recent stakeholder consultation was conducted in 2022 for the purpose of expanding the supply 
area of legacy DBI plants (Amite, Morehouse, LaSalle, ARBE Leola, and ARBE Russellville) to 
accommodate a consolidated supply base which recognized the addition of the the two legacy Pinnacle 
Renewable Energy Plants which were acquired in 2021 (AL Pellets Aliceville and AL Pellets 
Demopolis).  This stakeholder consultation also satisfies the requirement to consult in conjunction with 
recertification assessment. Past stakeholder consultations included a consultation to bring in the two 
satellite plants in Arkansas (AR Bioenergy Russellville and Leola) in 2021 and consultations for their 
various range expansions and the addition of LaSalle Bioenergy in 2015, 2018 and 2019.
To properly identify interested stakeholders, DBI staff solicited a wide range of potential stakeholders for 
the initial consultation. Invitations were sent out to 249 contacts representing a cross-section of interests 
and expertise, including local, state and federal agencies, local forest industry participants, research 
institutions, forestry/landowner associations, NGOs, indigenous peoples and others. 
Stakeholders were provided Annex 1 of the SBR (SBE) to review and provide comment on.   DBI received 
1 direct response from 1 participant that responded with a welcoming supportive letter. 
The certifying body held a follow-up consultation immediately after conclusion of DBI’s initial consultation. 
Results of consultations appear in the certifying body’s public audit reports for each biomass producer.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 
specified risks (defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National Risk 
Assessment).  As specified by the mandatory Control Measure, Drax 
implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative dialogue 
at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-
assessment-us-nra.
Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for 
primary and secondary feedstock sourcing. 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of 
roundwood and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), 
and Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as 
the dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and 
a well-developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and 
other flowering plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS 
are not at significant risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented 
organizations with the mandate and means to implement conservation-
forestry practices.
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily 
southern yellow pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is 
estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-woods chip material which may 
contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment 
that Drax has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo 
ecosystems in the production of wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of 
sourcing fiber in a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock 
controls, embedded in Drax’s internal processes, are subject to 
monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC HCV maps 
into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires 
comprehensive forest cover type and species information be provided 
during source set-up which allows stands to be assessed for the potential 
of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood systems.  If a risk is identified, 
then Drax has an opportunity provide educational mitigation materials 
and to identify management requirements which will protect the integrity 
of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method 
and/or the subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of 
these high conservation value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy). 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to 
secondary and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following 
mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply 
base.  That percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary 
suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish 
level.  Education and outreach will be the main method of mitigation for 
residual suppliers who’s sourcing area intersects FSC identified risk 
areas.  The desired outcome of these communications is engaging 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of Native Longleaf 
Pine systems.  
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of 
educational materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance 
conference.  The areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by 
FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials are 
distributed to suppliers that touch identified specified risk 
areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused 
on encouraging proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply 
area. Plans are to distribute additional educational materials the Longleaf 
Alliance has already developed and investigate other opportunities for 
engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives including landowner 
workshops.  
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  As Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual 
suppliers who process hardwoods and are proximate to LSBH areas. The 
areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and 
integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, developed in 
partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have 
been developed to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in 
conservation of this forest system. Drax also actively supports Forest 
Stewards Guild workshops and learning exchanges focused on improving 
the management of bottomland hardwoods and helps fund the 
development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  FSC identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s 
sourcing area which are only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These 
areas are under Federal Critical Habitat protections.  FSC has identified 
education and outreach as a mitigation option for the DGF. Drax has only 
four suppliers having this risk within their potential sourcing area.  Drax 
provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the suppliers 
which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk 
areas.  Educational materials are informed by the best available science 
and adapted as new information and/or approaches become available. 
The desired outcome of these communications is engaging landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of DGF populations. 
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and 
Mesophytic Cove Sites as specified risks within the wider supply 
area.  The Central Appalachian CBA and the Mesophytic Cove specified 
risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a 
very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool employed 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs and cove sites in hopes of increasing 
conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The Southern Appalachian 
CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama Pellet 
Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach 
materials mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this 
specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax 
recognizes the Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  This specified risk comprises a small region 
in the Drax residual sourcing area. Although 100% of the risk area 
mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level 
mitigation is deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine 
habitats.  Both have widespread protections or conservation measures in 
place, and thus pose a very low risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is 
protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is subject to a widespread and 
increasingly effective landscape conservation movement.  To further 
support these positive factors Drax has selected Education and outreach 
are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as 
specified risk within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk 
area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Many of the 
biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by the Longleaf 
Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems 
(particularly the Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and 
unique steephead ravines.” Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional 
Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, 
GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive factors Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation 
tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for 
the risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the 
wider supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal 
land at the extreme edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose 
a very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.  As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the 
wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the 
sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and 
tertiary suppliers is considered. This salamander is known to exist only in 
a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several counties of the Drax 
residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit small 
streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are 
protected by BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a 
very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.   As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-
compliance with this requirement to “low”.

materials mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this 
specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax 
recognizes the Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  This specified risk comprises a small region 
in the Drax residual sourcing area. Although 100% of the risk area 
mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level 
mitigation is deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine 
habitats.  Both have widespread protections or conservation measures in 
place, and thus pose a very low risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is 
protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is subject to a widespread and 
increasingly effective landscape conservation movement.  To further

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 
specified risks (defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National Risk 
Assessment).  As specified by the mandatory Control Measure, Drax 
implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative dialogue 
at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-
assessment-us-nra.
Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for 
primary and secondary feedstock sourcing. 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of 
roundwood and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), 
and Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as 
the dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and 
a well-developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and 
other flowering plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS 
are not at significant risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented 
organizations with the mandate and means to implement conservation-
forestry practices.
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily 
southern yellow pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is 
estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-woods chip material which may 
contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment 
that Drax has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo 
ecosystems in the production of wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of 
sourcing fiber in a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock 
controls, embedded in Drax’s internal processes, are subject to 
monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC HCV maps 
into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires 
comprehensive forest cover type and species information be provided 
during source set-up which allows stands to be assessed for the potential 
of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood systems.  If a risk is identified, 
then Drax has an opportunity provide educational mitigation materials 
and to identify management requirements which will protect the integrity 
of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method 
and/or the subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of 
these high conservation value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy). 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to 
secondary and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following 
mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply 
base.  That percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary 
suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish 
level.  Education and outreach will be the main method of mitigation for 
residual suppliers who’s sourcing area intersects FSC identified risk 
areas.  The desired outcome of these communications is engaging 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of Native Longleaf 
Pine systems.  
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of 
educational materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance 
conference.  The areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by 
FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials are 
distributed to suppliers that touch identified specified risk 
areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused 
on encouraging proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply 
area. Plans are to distribute additional educational materials the Longleaf 
Alliance has already developed and investigate other opportunities for 
engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives including landowner 
workshops.  
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  As Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual 
suppliers who process hardwoods and are proximate to LSBH areas. The 
areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and 
integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, developed in 
partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have 
been developed to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in 
conservation of this forest system. Drax also actively supports Forest 
Stewards Guild workshops and learning exchanges focused on improving 
the management of bottomland hardwoods and helps fund the 
development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  FSC identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s 
sourcing area which are only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These 
areas are under Federal Critical Habitat protections.  FSC has identified 
education and outreach as a mitigation option for the DGF. Drax has only 
four suppliers having this risk within their potential sourcing area.  Drax 
provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the suppliers 
which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk 
areas.  Educational materials are informed by the best available science 
and adapted as new information and/or approaches become available. 
The desired outcome of these communications is engaging landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of DGF populations. 
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and 
Mesophytic Cove Sites as specified risks within the wider supply 
area.  The Central Appalachian CBA and the Mesophytic Cove specified 
risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a 
very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool employed 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs and cove sites in hopes of increasing 
conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The Southern Appalachian 
CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama Pellet 
Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach 
materials mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this 
specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax 
recognizes the Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  This specified risk comprises a small region 
in the Drax residual sourcing area. Although 100% of the risk area 
mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level 
mitigation is deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine 
habitats.  Both have widespread protections or conservation measures in 
place, and thus pose a very low risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is 
protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is subject to a widespread and 
increasingly effective landscape conservation movement.  To further 
support these positive factors Drax has selected Education and outreach 
are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as 
specified risk within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk 
area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Many of the 
biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by the Longleaf 
Pine conservation efforts previously described.

(particularly the Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and 
unique steephead ravines.” Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional 
Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, 
GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive factors Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation 
tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for 
the risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the 
wider supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal 
land at the extreme edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose 
a very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.  As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the 
wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the 
sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and 
tertiary suppliers is considered. This salamander is known to exist only in 
a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several counties of the Drax 
residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit small 
streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are 
protected by BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a 
very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.   As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
 The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-
compliance with this requirement to “low”.

Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax 
recognizes the Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  This specified risk comprises a small region 
in the Drax residual sourcing area. Although 100% of the risk area 
mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level 
mitigation is deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine 
habitats.  Both have widespread protections or conservation measures in 
place, and thus pose a very low risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is 
protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is subject to a widespread and

Specified risk indicator:
2.1.3 The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures 
for verifying that feedstock is not sourced from forests converted to 
production plantation forest or non-forest lands after January 2008.
Specific risk description:
FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment identify some areas 
within Drax’s larger supply area as a specified risk for conversion, however 
the majority of the sourcing area is not at risk. The FSC National Risk 
Assessment conducted found that there were limited areas of conversion 
risk in Drax’s sourcing area which were associated with expansion of 
commercial and residential areas, driven largely by population growth (see 
map below). In their review FSC considered all of the WWF ecoregions, 
along with the concerns cited for conversion, but ultimately focused their 
finding of conversion on areas these areas of urban and residential 
interface. Drax has therefore accepted that there is a specified risk in 
some portions of its sourcing area. 
Mitigation measure:
To mitigate the potential for conversion risk in some (FSC identified) 
counties at the perimeter of its sourcing area, Drax applies FSC 
CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy and FSC CENTRAL THEME 
Education & Outreach to mitigate conversion risk.  All supply contracts 
specify that wood from conversion sources is unacceptable and all 
suppliers that have the potential to source from FSC identified conversion 
risk areas are provided with educational materials.  The desired outcome 
of the educational material is to help support and encouraging 
landowners in their efforts to keep their forests as forests.
For reference the following excerpt from FSC US Controlled Wood 
Regional Meeting Report is provided: ATLANTA 4/8/19 48: 
“The following is offered as an option that could be scaled for any level of 
mitigation: Using materials as described below, communicate to 
audiences (also described below) the social benefits of keeping forests 
as forests, and the value-enhancing alternatives to conversion and 
opportunities for the maintenance of forests (e.g., tax-relief programs, 
succession planning). The desired outcome of these communications is 
engaging landowners within the specified risk area and the 
Organization’s supply area in the maintenance of forests.
Audiences: Communications are directed toward audiences where there 
is a proven or reasonable expectation of effectiveness in achieving the 
above defined desired outcome. Depending upon the Organization’s 
location in the supply chain, communications may be directly with 
landowners, foresters, or loggers, or through intermediaries such as 
community members, forest managers, suppliers, forestry associations or 
landowner associations, or through collaboration with 
organizations/individuals already working for maintenance of forests. 
INTENT: The intent of this mitigation option is to implement education 
and outreach-related actions that will result in maintenance of forests, 
and thereby mitigate the risk of sourcing materials from sites in the 
specified risk area where the forest is being converted to non-forest use. 
“
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-
compliance with this requirement to “low”.
7.2
Monitoring and outcomes
For in-woods (primary) sourcing Drax has developed a robust procurement program policy which includes 
programmatic monitoring of  all in-woods fiber supply.  In this way Drax effectively mitigates risks 
associated with Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, Native Longleaf Pine ecosystems, and 
conversion.  Drax has integrated the FSC HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment 
process and actively screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows stands to be assessed 
for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has 
an opportunity provide educational mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will 
protect the integrity of the system.  Drax also reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting 
method and/or the subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these specified 
risks.  Operational BMP checks serve as evidence of this montoring and dialogue with suppliers indicates 
that they do have a better understanding of the specified risks in their operational area.
For residual suppliers Drax has developed informational materials for distribution to suppliers and is now 
monitoring their understanding and use of the materials.  Dialogue with suppliers indicates that they do 
have a better understanding of the specified risks in their operational area and that they are aware of no 
issues pertaining to the protection of these ecosystems or critical biodiversity areas/species.  These 
informational materials continue to serve as a valuable communication tool.
Informational materials on the following risks have been developed and distributed: 
Native Longleaf Pine Systems
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods
Dusky Gopher Frog 
Critical Habitat
Southern Appalachian CBA
Central Appalachian CBA & Mesophytic Cove Sites
Cheoah Bald Salamander & Patch Nose Salamander
Conversion
Drax has also partnered with the Longleaf Alliance and the Forest Stewards Guild to expand the reach of 
its educational and outreach and promote improved management of the longleaf and bottomland hardwood 
ecosystems throughout the southern US.   In addition, due to the recent acquisition of two pellet plants in 
Alabama a new conservation effort has been initiated with the American Forest Foundation which focuses 
primarily on the Southern Appalachian region in Alabama and Tennessee.  Details on these efforts are 
provided below:
Longleaf Alliance 
Drax has supported the Longleaf Alliance through an annual Corporate Sponsorship and support of 
educational workshops.  In 2021 Drax donated additional support to the creation of a Western Technical 
Assistant TA Position that would work directly with Landowners in MS, LA and AL.
Within the last year Drax, along with corporate sponsors and conservation partners, have helped the 
Longleaf Alliance reach nearly 50,000 members of the general public, deliver over 5,000 technical 
education workshops, apply targeted restoration for declining and at-risk species (i.e. gopher tortoise, 
gopher frog, and E. indigo snake), facilitate understory burns on thousands of acres in FL, GA, SC, and AL, 
and establish over 12,000 acres of new longleaf forests.
The Forest Stewards Guild
The Forest Stewards Guild has initiated an effort focused on improving bottomland hardwood in the lower 
Mississippi Alluvial Plain.  This effort involves both the synthesis of technical information as well as the 
dissemination of this information to landowners in the region, with an ultimate goal of improving bottomland 
hardwood forests management and the value that they provide to wildlife.
Drax helped sponsor, and participated in,  an initial the second bottomland hardwood learning exchange, 
held in Baton Rouge LA,.  Covid-19 has not allowed the number of learning exchanges and workshops 
originally planned, so Drax instead donated money to help fund the development of individual resource 
management plans.  Fortunately, this year the Guild is making plans for workshops to be held in Arkansas, 
Mississippi, South Carolina, and North Carolina.  Drax, along with other Corporate Sponsors support, has 
also contributed to the development of educational information, with their latest effort being the 
development of Climate Adaptive Strategies for Bottomland Forests.

In 2022 Drax began work with the American Forest Foundation to provide direct support for conservation 
initiatives relevant to Northern Arkansas and south-central Tennessee.  This conservation initiative aims to 
mitigate the concern over unique habitat and species found in the Central Appalachian CBA as well as 
other species and habitat needs identified collaboratively with the USFWS and regional conservation 
partners.  This initiative is in its initial stages, Drax will track and report progress annually as information 
becomes available.

indicators
 
Indicator
1.1.1
The BP Supply Base is defined and mapped.
Finding
Drax fiber procurement catchment includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and 
portions of Texas (59 counties), Florida (28 counties), and Oklahoma (32 counties). 
See map of supply area below. The Company owns and operates five primary pellet 
plants: Amite Bioenergy Gloster, MS; Morehouse Bioenergy near Beekman, LA, 
LaSalle Bioenergy in Urania, LA; Alabama Pellets in Aliceville, and Demopolis, AL. 
Drax also owns and operates two satellite plants: Arkansas Bioenergy Leola, 
Arkansas Bioenergy Russellville. Each primary plant typically draws feedstock from 
within a 70-mile radius but maintains the ability to procure out to a 100-mile radius to 
obtain primary feedstock in response to market pressures and weather events. 
However, secondary feedstocks produced by forest product manufactures could be 
procured from as far away as 200 miles and tertiary material (residuals from 
secondary manufacturing of lumber) could be procured anywhere within the supply 
are depicted on map below. Each satellite plant will obtain feedstock from the 
secondary material produced by the forest products manufacturer that is adjacent to 
the facility.

Feedstock can be traced back to the defined Supply Base.
Finding
A map of Drax’s sourcing area forms part of Drax’s contract with suppliers.
·         Binding contractual requirements stipulate that suppliers disclose the source’s 
origination information (lat/long) to establish a gate pass before loads of roundwood 
or in-woods chips enter mill sites. 
·         Robust transaction accounting system captures sustainability characteristics 
about the source upon establishment and assigns relational information to each load 
registered upon delivery. 
o    Transaction accounting system captures location, type of cut and species groups 
and other information. 
o    Control points are established, and training is completed to ensure only sources 
of known origin enter mill sites.
o    Monitoring by procurement and sustainability staff verify accuracy of records and 
locations of tracts.
·         Drax holds verified SFI®, PEFC™ and FSC® CoC Certificates substantiating 
that all feedstock is assessed for risk via a Due Diligence System (DDS).
·         Majority of feedstock inputs are from primary sources with a growing 
proportion from secondary sources.
·         Suppliers of secondary and tertiary feedstocks have contractual requirements 
to confirm that their feedstock originates within Drax’s defined catchment. This is 
checked through internal procedures at Drax, including logical haul radius regular 
communication with secondary and tertiary suppliers, and internal audit
Means of
Verification
·         Transactional accounting system hold details of volumes, species, and 
locations.
·         Professional fiber procurement and sustainability personnel
·         Third party audits of sustainability program evidence the presence of a 
functioning supply chain management system that complies with the legal 
requirements to track and trace raw material. 
·         Administrative processes and fiduciary responsibilities to tax law have been 
defined and implemented. These require business to identify and capture the district 
of origin of fiber that enable states to assign and collect severance taxes. 
·         See Preamble citations, including Worldwide Governance Indicators
·         Forest Property Taxation Systems in the United States: Each jurisdiction has 
its own version of record retention and/or payment periods for timber purchases.

• Majority of feedstock inputs at LaSalle Bioenergy, Morehouse Bioenergy, and Amite 
Bioenergy are from primary sources with a growing proportion from secondary 
sources. 
• The feedstock input for AL Pellets Aliceville and AL Pellets Demopolis, as well as 
the two Arkansas satellite plants is entirely from manufacturing residuals (SBP 
secondary feedstock).  The Arkansas satellite plants utilize fiber directly from the 
product manufacturer that is co-located with each respective plant.
• Suppliers of secondary and tertiary feedstocks have contractual requirements to 
confirm that their feedstock originates within Drax’s defined catchment.  This is 
checked through internal procedures at Drax, including logical haul radius and

The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures to ensure that 
legality of ownership and land use can be demonstrated for the Supply Base.
Finding
• FSC US National Risk Assessment has determined there is a “low risk” of illegally 
harvested wood through examination of 21 indicators including ownership and land 
use.
• The World Bank has awarded the US a Global Governance Index rating that is in 
the 89th percentile for rule of law.
• Annual review of the DDS is completed to substantiate and reverify the “low risk” 
determination.
• Per the preamble, the  Worldwide Governance Indicators provides assurance that 
the rule of law is effective in this geography. This further assures performance of 
suppliers of secondary and tertiary feedstocks.
Means of
Verification
• Property law is well established and policed through effective courts (see Global 
Governance index).  Drax has implemented DDS presenting the laws utilized in the 
US and each state sourced from to showcase the rule of law and public agency 
governance. 
• Risk assessments listed in preamble, which range from company to landscape 
level, have captured the existence and effectiveness of statutory, contractual, 
 
property, and civil law in the defined supply base. 
• Land use challenges are absent and legal processes are present to establish and 
challenge land ownership in the wood procurement region.
• Preamble citations including  Worldwide Governance Indicators
• Drax has implemented a procedure to ensure a defined response of preferred 
actions to handle identified non-compliant material in relation to compliance with the 
Timber Standard and EUTR.
• Drax has written contracts for all suppliers.
• Suppliers are required to abide by all laws and regulations in a Fiber Purchase 
Agreement.
• Monitoring, as well as internal and external audit, act as checks for completeness 
and accuracy of records. 
• Stakeholder Consultation
• Transactional accounting system records
• Drax conducted a comprehensive stakeholder consultation to capture feedback 
regarding legality issues in the procurement regions. 

One stakeholder voiced their concern about the level of law enforcement and 
effectiveness of existing legal controls as they relate to logging. However, 
Drax continues to support FSC assessment of “low-risk,” and through 
continued monitoring of their catchment finds that the level of enforcement is 
effective, and that timber trespass is not systemic in procurement region.

·         According to the UCR, property crime offenses declined by 2.6 percent in 2015 
compared with 2014, and by 20.2 percent when compared with the 2006 data
·         Since 2008, several other states have also acted to strengthen timber theft 
laws by expanding enforcement and/or increasing penalties (for example, Missouri, 
Louisiana, and Arkansas). In Louisiana, the rate of occurrence of timber theft is 
reportedly less than in past years due to changes in the law that imposed higher 
penalties.

direct their conservation efforts. To inform management and conservation initiatives 
Drax has chosen EPA ecoregion III and IV classifications, which provide more 
detailed ecological information relevant to forest management than the WWF 
ecoregions.  The issues identified in these WWF ecoregions have been considered 
by FSC National Risk Assessment, a multi-stakeholder review, and have been 
incorporated, as appropriate, into their specified HCV risks. Drax has reviewed the 
WWF ecoregions and crosschecked them with the identified risks in the FSC NRA as 
well and the proprietary HCV mapping tools developed in partnership with Nature

Finding
·         The FSC US National Risk assessment has identified ten “specified risks” 
within Drax’s sourcing area that pertain to species and ecological communities. They 
include Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, 
Dusky Gopher Frog, Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central

effort to identify “specified risks” related to forest sourcing and has therefore 
accepted these risks as such.
·         Drax also recognizes that there are additional species and natural community 
types which FSC did not elevate to the level of “Specified Risks” but which still 
warrant protection. Drax has thoroughly assessed and reviewed these species and 
community types (see Indicator 2.1.1 for a detail review of sources checked and 
HCVs identified). 
·         The existing mechanisms in place to protect these additional species and 
natural community was reviewed by Drax and is detailed in Means of Verification 
below. Following this review Drax concurs with the FSC US NRA and has selected 
no additional “specified risks”, other than those listed above which would require 
additional mitigations outside of standard operating procedures.

·         The forest products industry participates directly in the development of the 
State Wildlife Action Plans as well as efforts to protect and identify species and 
communities of concern. For example, Drax purchases a data license from 
NatureServe annually. NatureServe then provides Drax with shapefiles for all known 
species and communities of concern. This data is integrated into Drax’s mapping 
system which is used to screen all harvests where Drax is receiving fiber directly 
from the woods. The use of NatureServe data, and the protection of species and 
communities deemed globally critically imperilled (G1) or globally imperilled (G2), is 
required by all participants of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Drax sources 
from landowners certified to the SFI Forest Management Standard and from sawmills 
that are certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard, both of which require 
consideration of G1, G2, and T&E species. Drax is also certified to the SFI FS 
Standard. 
 
 
·         In addition to State Wildlife Action Plans and Natural Heritage Data, the federal 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and federal Clean Water Act are very strong 
regulatory mechanisms which are in place to reduce the risk of further biodiversity 
loss. These regulations bring with them significant civil and criminal penalties (i.e. up 
to 1 year imprisonment for ESA violation and $54,000/day for CWA violation). The 
ESA prohibits not only direct “take” but can also deem habitat alteration as a “taking”. 
The ESA can restrict forest management on both private and public lands. Habitat 
Conservation Agreements (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements are among the tools provided to a landowner who wishes 
to actively manage their forest in areas where threatened or endangered species, 
highly sensitive to forest alteration, exist. The red-cockaded woodpecker, and the 
Louisiana pine snake are two species currently being managed with these 
mechanisms in Drax’s sourcing area. For some species Critical Habitat has been 
designated, a further assurance that federally listed species are protected (i.e. 
gopher frog in Drax sourcing area).  
·         Clean Water Act protections are extremely relevant to the protection of 
biodiversity. States have been granted the authority to develop programs to address 
nonpoint source pollution from forestry operations. These state “Best Management 
Programs” have been recognized by the USFWS in recent listing rules as a means of 
ensuring species protection. For example, the Pearl darter listing rule described 
positive effects of BMPs as follows: “Nonpoint source pollution is a localized threat to 
the pearl darter within the drainage and is more prevalent in areas where certified 
best management practices (BMPs) are not utilized. The use of certified BMPs during 
land-altering activities can greatly reduce impacts to water quality. Certified BMPs, 
currently implemented by the forestry industry (e.g., Sustainable Forestry Initiative, 
Forest Stewardship Council, and American Tree Farm System), are helping to 
minimize or eliminate non-point source pollution during the course of forestry 
activities. The Mississippi Forestry Commission (2016, entire) reports certified BMP 
implementation rates to be high in Mississippi for forestry activities, primarily due to 
the efforts of State forestry agencies and forest certification programs (Schilling and 
Wigley 2015, pp 3–7)” (82 Fed Reg 43889).
In the southeastern US, the Southern Group of State Foresters has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 southern states. 
According to a 2018 report summarizing rates of BMP implementation, all states in 
the region were in conformance with the framework. Furthermore, 67 state-wide 
monitoring surveys had been conducted since its initial development in 1997 and 23 
surveys were conducted in the last six years. Combining all BMP categories in all 
states and using only the most recent state survey data reported, average overall 
BMP implementation for the region was 93.6%, up from 92% in 2012. 
(https://www.southernforests.org/resources/publications/SGSF%20Water%20BMP%
20Report%20FINAL.pdf/view).
BMP implementation rates in the states that Drax sources from are as follows:
MS- Overall 95%

·         As described above, a structured BMP program has been in place in the 
southern US for over two decades. In this same time period the forest industry has 
embraced SFI (est. 1994) which has championed BMP implementation through its 
trained logger requirements as well as the protection of biodiversity.  See research by 
Dwivedi et al. on increased BMP implementation within the supply area of SFI FS 
mills - http://sficonference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Puneet-Dwivedi.pdfee). 
Furthermore, the State Wildlife Action Planning Process is now in its 15th year and 
Forest Action Plans have been in place since 2010. These industry-wide initiatives in 
place for protection of biological diversity can be considered standard practice as well 
as an industry expectation. Drax, as a responsible member of the industry, has 
developed a program to verify the implementation of BMPs and the protection of 
known species of concern for its own in-woods sourcing. Drax’s individual actions to 
verify BMP usage and protection of species of concern when sourcing directly from 
the forest simultaneously meet the industry expectations for environmental protection 
and may also be considered a mitigation, by SBP definition, to control the risk of 
sourcing material not in compliance with this indicator.

Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for primary and 
secondary feedstock sourcing.  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant 
risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations 
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal 
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC 
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That 
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops.  
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  FSC 
identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s sourcing area which are 
only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These areas are under Federal Critical 
Habitat protections.  FSC has identified education and outreach as a mitigation 
option for the DGF. Drax has only four suppliers having this risk within their potential 
sourcing area.  Drax provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the 
suppliers which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk 
areas.  Educational materials are informed by the best available science and adapted 
as new information and/or approaches become available. The desired outcome of 
these communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in 
conservation of DGF populations.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply 
area.  This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation 
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.”

Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the

risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes 
of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal land at the extreme 
 
edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.  As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax 
supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of 
the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. This 
salamander is known to exist only in a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several 
counties of the Drax residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit 
small streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are protected by 
BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.   As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This

Indicator
2.1.3
The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures for verifying that 
feedstock is not sourced from forests converted to production plantation forest or non-
forest lands after January 2008.
Finding
·         FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment identify some areas within 
Drax’s larger supply area as a specified risk for conversion, however the majority of 
the sourcing area is not at risk.  
The limited risk of conversion is substantiated by the following findings:
·         FIA data indicates stable and/or increasing forest inventory and forest area in 
Drax’s sourcing area.  
·         Absence of SBP defined "production plantation forests" in wood procurement 
region. 
·         Historical evidence that healthy markets keep forests as forests.
·         Review of WWF Ecoregions, and associated concerns about conversion, 
indicate that these are not significant. 
·         Recent analysis of Drax catchment area analysis (2019 and 2020) using FIA 
data, market data, and remote sensing tools has not revealed conversion to be a risk. 
·         CWA provides protections against conversion of wetland forests
Means of
Verification
Finding of limited Specified Risk in sourcing area:
·         The FSC National Risk Assessment conducted found that there were limited 
areas of conversion risk in Drax’s sourcing area which were associated with 
expansion of commercial and residential areas, driven largely by population growth 
(see map below). In their review FSC considered all of the WWF ecoregions, along 
with the concerns cited for conversion, but ultimately focused their finding of 
conversion on areas these areas of urban and residential interface. Drax has 
therefore accepted that there is a specified risk in some portions of its sourcing 
area.  A review of mitigation measures is included in the Comment or Mitigation 
Measure section below.
Sources substantiating the low risk of conversion for most of the supply area:
·         SBP defines "production plantation forests" as “Forests of exotic species that 
have been planted or seeded by human intervention and that are under intensive 
stand management, are fast growing, and subject to short rotations (e.g. Poplar, 
Acacia or Eucalyptus plantations)”. The threat of conversion to production plantation 
in Drax’s sourcing area is low for two primary reasons:
o    The planted pine forests in the area where Drax sources from is composed 
primarily of loblolly pine which is a species native to this region (see figure below).
 
o    The forests are not intensively managed on short rotations but rather managed 
for sawtimber. Under good growing conditions, pine forests planted with improved 
genetics (through standard breeding), and whose density is managed through 
thinning and early competition control, can achieve sawtimber size in as little as 25 
years. Forisk Consulting conducted a survey of southern silviculture in 2016 and 
2018 which included assessment of practices on 6.9 and 9.7 million acres, 
respectively. This survey found that the average clearcut age for pine in the Gulf 
South was 36 years old (see table below), indicating that the region is neither 
managed to a high intensity nor is it managed for short fiber rotations.    
·         A 2017 analysis by Forest2Market concurs with this outcome stating, “The 
biggest threat to forests is urbanization, not the forest products industry”. In fact, they 
found that markets for timber products encourage landowners to keep forest as 
forests and not convert them to other, more lucrative, landuses. In their retrospective 
examiniation they found that increases in demand encouraged landowners to invest 
in forests, with forest acres increasing as removals increased (see figure below). 
https://www.forest2market.com/hubfs/2016_Website/Documents/20170726_Forest2
Market_Historical_Perspective_US_South.pdf
 
 
·         The American Forest Foundation states that “Markets encourage landowners 
to invest in forests, helping keep forests as forests. Strong markets signal that buying 
forestland, retaining forestland, or investing in forest management, is a good use of 
an individual or family’s hard earned income. 
https://www.forestfoundation.org/markets-for-family-forest-wood-products
 
·         Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data show a stable forest inventory 
indicating that conversion of forestland to non-forestland is a low risk in our 
catchment area. See figures below which were generated through recent analysis of 
FIA data (2019/2020). 
Morehouse bioenergy primary catchment area:
LaSalle Bioenergy primary catchment area:
Arkansas Bioenergy – Leola
Arkansas Bioenergy – Russellville
AL Pellets Aliceville
Field audit two years post-harvest has identified no concerns with regeneration on 
sites from which primary fiber was sourced.
·        Drax is exploring remote sensing tools to evaluate regeneration and forest 
loss/gain at regional level. Global Forest Change 
https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest was reviewed 
and Drax catchment areas all appear as actively growing forests with harvests losses 
offset by gains and maintenance of forest extent. The same Hanson data was used 
in a catchment area analysis conducted by Interfor. Drax is also exploring the use of 
satellite imagery (i.e. Landsat 5) and Lidar to test the ability of remote sensing tools 
to identify forest loss as well as regeneration. 
·         Section 404 of the CWA addresses the discharge of dredge and fill into 
waterways. There is an exemption for on-going silviculture practices, however, the 
Recapture Provision does not allow conversion of wetland forest to upland. See 
exemption to the CWA section 404 (f), Recapture Provision “Recapture Provision. 
Section 404(f) exemptions DO NOT APPLY where any discharge of dredged and/or 
fill material into “waters of the US”, including wetlands, IF 1] the activity would convert 
an area of waters of the into a new use (e.g. wetland to upland, wetland to open 
water, etc.).
o    According to a report commissioned by the American Hardwood Council in 2017 
titled Assessment of Lawful Harvesting and Sustainability of US Hardwood Exports, 
“Available data suggest that CWA404 violations are aggressively prosecuted by the 
regulatory agencies. According to the Corps of Engineers, about 6,000 alleged 
violations of the Clean Water Act that falls under the Corps' jurisdiction are processed 
in district offices each year. Of these, over 60 percent relate to Section 404 permitting 
(although only a very small number involve silvicultural activities in wetlands).  See 
overview at:
o    http://www.usace.army.mil/cw/cecwo/reg/oceover.htm.” Link to report: 
https://www.americanhardwood.org/index.php/en/latest/news/seneca-creek-study
·         Regarding WWF’s ecoregions, many of which have been labelled 
“critical/endangered” citing conversion as a concern, it is important to remember that 
these ecoregions were created by WWF for the purpose of prioritizing conservation 
initiatives. Upon closer examination it was determined that landscape level forest 
conversion was not the specific driver for conservation need.  Instead, very specific 
issues are identified.  For example:
o    The primary concern in the NA0523-Piney Woods forests ecoregion is 
maintenance of the sandhill pine forest communities, where long-leaf pine (Pinus 
palustris) shares dominance with shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and loblolly pine 
(Pinus taeda) and pine densities are low. This community type can be likened to the 
“open forest” type that is a high priority in State Wildlife Action Plans (see Criteria 
2.1.2) and as a Specified Risk in FSC’s HCV 3 designation, i.e. Native Longleaf Pine 
Systems (NLPS), which Drax recognizes as a Specified Risk for indicators 2.1.2, 
2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.4.1. 
o    Another WWF ecosystem in the region is NA0409-Mississippi Lowland Forests. 
The protection focus in this ecosystem is bottomland hardwood forests. Past 
conversion, mainly into cultivation, degraded these forests and reduced them to a 
point where “there is very little to conserve”. Again, FSC has recognized the primary 
threat to the system, but categorized it as a more specific HCV3 risk, “ Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods”, which Drax also recognizes as a Specified 
Risk in the supply area for indicators 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.4.1. 
o    The NA0412-Ozark Mountains Forests, with its well-developed-oak hickory 
forests, are recognized for the distinctness of their freshwater communities. The 
remaining blocks of habitat are the Boston Mountains and the Ouachita Mountains 
themselves, with no significant intact habitats existing in the lowlands. The biggest 
threat is development of the mountains to support second homes and resorts but 
conversion to pine and fire suppression is also mentioned as risk. FSC initially 
considered the Ozark Mountain region as a specified risk, citing the threat to aquatic 
species as a key driver. However, based on review of forestry BMP implementation 
data, this area was removed from the list of Specified Risks. Drax also considers its 
fiber sourcing practices to have a low risk of endangering the recognized biological 
distinctness of this ecoregion and sources less than 5% of fiber from this area.  AR 
BMP implementation data is available here: 
https://www.aad.arkansas.gov/Websites/aad/files/Content/5944993/Bioassessment_
of_Silviculture_Best_Management_Practices_in_Arkansas_.pdf
 
o    The East Central Texas Forests ecoregion is one of WWF’s smallest ecoregions 
within the Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests biome. The ecoregion is 
characterized by open forests of oak and hickory with an herbaceous component 
dominated by bluestem. Common oaks species are post oak, scarlet, and blackjack 
oak, all species that are generally undesirable timber species due to their growth 
forms. The primary threat is from conversion of forests for ranching and farming. 
Based on the species mix (naturally stunted oaks and hickories), the characteristic 
sparse tree cover, and the identified threat being conversion to agriculture, Drax does 
not consider there to be a specified risk related to this criterion. 
Less than 1% of Drax’s fiber is received from eastern Texas.

Mitigation 
Measure
To mitigate the potential for conversion risk in some (FSC identified) counties at the 
perimeter of its sourcing area, Drax applies FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement 
Policy and FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach to mitigate conversion 
risk.  All supply contracts specify that wood from conversion sources is unacceptable 
and all suppliers that have the potential to source from FSC identified conversion risk 
areas are provided with educational materials.  The desired outcome of the 
educational material is to help support and encouraging landowners in their efforts to 
keep their forests as forests.
For reference the following excerpt from FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting 
Report is provided: ATLANTA 4/8/19 48: 
“The following is offered as an option that could be scaled for any level of mitigation: 
Using materials as described below, communicate to audiences (also described 
below) the social benefits of keeping forests as forests, and the value-enhancing 
 
alternatives to conversion and opportunities for the maintenance of forests (e.g., tax-
relief programs, succession planning). The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners within the specified risk area and the 
Organization’s supply area in the maintenance of forests.
Audiences: Communications are directed toward audiences where there is a proven 
or reasonable expectation of effectiveness in achieving the above defined desired 
outcome. Depending upon the Organization’s location in the supply chain, 
communications may be directly with landowners, foresters, or loggers, or through 
intermediaries such as community members, forest managers, suppliers, forestry 
associations or landowner associations, or through collaboration with 
organizations/individuals already working for maintenance of forests. 
INTENT: The intent of this mitigation option is to implement education and outreach-
related actions that will result in maintenance of forests, and thereby mitigate the risk 
of sourcing materials from sites in the specified risk area where the forest is being 
converted to non-forest use. “
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-compliance 
with this requirement to “low”.

·         All states in Drax’s sourcing area utilize a current use valuation on forestland 
that is much lower than fair market value. As described on the Taxfoundation.org 
website, if owners of forested land had to pay a percentage of the land’s fair market 
value, their payments would be much higher because potential buyers considering 
other uses for the land would drive up the fair market value. This fair market value 
system would then increase pressure on landowners to make profitable use of their 
land or sell it to someone who would. Details on the taxes imposed on timberland for 
all 50 states can be found at: https://taxfoundation.org/states-use-gentle-hand-taxing-

·         Federal lands are managed through the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) process assures that proper management occurs on federal lands. The 
NEPA process requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their 
proposed actions prior to making decisions.
Habitat Conservation Agreements (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements are among the tools provided to a landowner who wishes 
to actively manage their forest in areas where threatened or endangered species, 
highly sensitive to forest alteration, exist. The red-cockaded woodpecker, and the 
Louisiana pine snake are two species currently being managed with these 
mechanisms in Drax’s sourcing area. For some species Critical Habitat has been 
designated, a further assurance that federally listed species are protected (i.e. 
gopher frog in Drax sourcing area).  
·         Many lands are also placed under conservation easements which require 
structured management plans. See link to the National Conservation Easement

·         State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs) are administered by the state wildlife 
agencies in cooperation with a diverse stakeholder group representing other state 
agencies, federal agencies, private conservation organizations, and industry

address protection. Federal dollars, available to states with active SWAPs allow 
states to actively seek out areas to protect through purchase and/or conservation 
easement. Link to all State Wildlife Action Plans: https://www.fishwildlife.org/afwa-

·         States have developed Pesticide General Permits (PGP) to meet the CWA 
requirements. A Pesticide Discharge Management Plan is a requirement of the PGP 
when applications meet certain criteria. In all cases proper documentation and 
 
recordkeeping of herbicide applications is a requirement and herbicides must be 
applied by certified applicators. This permit applies to private entities applying forest 
pesticides (i.e. herbicides) and provides an additional level of assurance that 
chemical use is carefully planned to minimize harm to the environment. 
·         Available information on known location of HCVs is reviewed for all fiber 
received directly from in-woods operations per company sustainability policy. This 
provides additional assurance that impact to species or habitats of concern are 
avoided during sourcing.
·         External audit, internal audit, and programmatic monitoring all provide checks 
on the effectiveness of internal and external planning processes.

·         A Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) study was installed in the 1980’s to 
evaluate the effects of harvest related compaction and various levels of biomass 
removal on forest soils and productivity. Study sites in Mississippi, Louisiana, and 
Texas provide interesting data on the Gulf coastal plains of the southern United 
States. Results thus far have found that compaction from forestry equipment has not 
caused long-term negative effects on productivity. In fact, growth on coarse sandy 
soils showed positive gains after trafficking. This may be due to the increase in water 
holding capacity of the soil. They also found that on productive sites even extreme 
experimental levels of biomass removal did not affect future productivity, however, 
removal of additional organic matter from low-fertility sites may have an impact. They 
have suggested that response to harvesting and biomass removal is very site-
specific and cautioned against blanket specifications imposed to protect productivity.

·         A literature review conducted by NCASI in 2014 provides a comprehensive 
review of the impact forest harvesting has on soil properties and subsequent tree 
growth. This review highlights the complexities involved “Heavy machinery for 
yarding felled trees or logs can create visible patterns of soil disturbance. Within 
harvested areas, trees planted on skid trails and landings are subjected to the most 
disturbed soil in the mosaic of soil conditions. Altered soil properties, however, do not 
always result in poorer tree growth (Greacen and Sands 1980; Miller, Scott, and 
Hazard 1996; Miller et al. 1989; Powers and Fiddler 1997). At some locations, the 
favorable influence of disturbance on other growth-determining factors can counter 
the generalization that soil compaction reduces subsequent tree and stand growth.

·         A study by Richter et al. found that forests increased the carbon in the top 
mineral soils of previously cropped land demonstrating that forests are important to 
rebuilding soils on previously cropped lands. Much of the southeastern US has been 
cleared for agriculture at some point and most of the managed pine forests are found 
on previously cropped soils. The choice to maintain land in forest or convert from 
agriculture to forestry is influenced by the availability of markets for forest products. 
In this sense, the biomass market, which utilizes low-value fiber, can be considered 
to help incentivise landowners to manage forests important to building and 
maintaining soil which will help rebuild soil carbon and, potentially, help reduce the 
chances of conversion into cropland which causes significant soil C losses.

·         Several studies have investigated the response of soil carbon to harvesting 
and biomass removal. In most instances there is little, if any, change in mineral soil 
carbon. Changes in surface carbon are variable, with harvest often increasing carbon 
in the top organic layer initially, likewise, different (experimental) residual biomass 
removal levels being reflecting in the carbon content of surface soil layers. These 
findings point out that there are several variables at play, including climate and 
decomposition rates.

·         The FSC US National Risk assessment has identified 7 specified risks within 
Drax’s sourcing area that pertain to ecological communities. They include Native 
Longleaf Pine Systems, Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, Southern 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, 
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area, Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity 
Area, and Mesophytic Cove Sites. This designation gives rise to mitigations as stated 
in 2.1.2 and in the Mitigation/Comments section of this indicator. Drax has integrated 
the shapefiles from the FSC NRA into its GIS mapping system and the data sits 
behind the Rapid Risk Assessment tool. 
·         Federal and state agencies along with non-governmental conservation 
organizations have identified key ecosystems and habitats which should be protected 
from development and damaging resource extraction. The Protected Area Database 
(PAD-US) is America’s official national inventory of US terrestrial and marine 
protected areas (List of National Geospatial Data Assets) that are dedicated to the 
preservation of biological diversity and other natural, recreation and cultural areas. 
Identification of these areas ensures their consideration in forest management 
activities on state and federal lands as well as private lands (through conservation 
easement plans). Drax has integrated the shapefiles from PAD-US into its GIS 
mapping system and the data sits behind the Rapid Risk Assessment tool. 
·         Comprehensive wildlife action plans have been established for each state, 
further identifying key ecosystems which occur on both public and private 
land.  Arkansas has provided shapefiles for key biodiversity management areas 
outlined in their State Wildlife Action Plan. Drax has integrated the shapefiles into its

was conducted, findings of which are described in Indicator 2.1.1 of this document. 
All key ecosystems and biodiversity areas identified have been reviewed to assess 
relevance to Drax’s sourcing. Most of these areas are under federal and state 
management (and identified in PAD-US). FSC and WWF have identified larger 
“critical biodiversity areas” and “critical/endangered” ecoregions which have been 
considered relevant to Drax sourcing. The WWF ecoregions risks relevant to Drax 
are addressed by the FSC Specified Risk areas which Drax has 
accepted.  Therefore, discussion will focus on FSC NRA’s treatment of these risks 
(see Indicator 2.1.3 for review of WWF ecoregion risks).  
 
·         FSC NRA: The following resources were reviewed to determine the relevance 
of Specified Risks identified in the FSC NRA:
o    FSC US Controlled Wood Risk Assessment
o    Static maps of areas with specified risks
o    Static map of all HCV1 Critical Biodiversity Areas
FSC Risks that Drax have identified in the supply base are seven key ecosystems: 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Southern 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, 
Mesophytic Cove, Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area ,Cape Fear Arch 
Critical Biodiversity Area, Mitigation for these Specified Risks include monitoring, 
internal audit, education Further details of the Specified Risk and the Mitigations 
developed for them are listed below. Note that Drax, as a responsible member of the 
industry, has developed a program to verify the implementation of BMPs and the 
protection of known species of concern, for its own in-woods sourcing. Drax’s 
individual actions to verify BMP usage and protection of species of concern when 
sourcing directly from the forest simultaneously meets the industry expectations for 
environmental protection and, according to the SBP definitions, may be considered a 
mitigation to control the risk of non-compliance with this indicator.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 specified 
risks.  This Control Measures is defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National 
Risk Assessment (Appendix B of this document).  As specified by the mandatory 
Control Measure, Drax implements mitigation actions identified during the 
collaborative dialogue at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the 
Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-assessment-us-
nra.
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant 
risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations 
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal 
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC 
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That 
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops.  
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply 
area.  This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation 
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
 
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.” 
Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi 
Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the 
mitigation tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e.,

Finding
·         The FSC US National Risk assessment has identified ten “specified risks” 
within Drax’s sourcing area that pertain to species and ecological communities. They 
include Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, 
Dusky Gopher Frog, Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area, 
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area, Cheoah Bald Salamander, Patch Nose 
Salamander, and Mesophytic Cove Sites. Drax recognizes this multi-stakeholder 
effort to identify “specified risks” related to forest sourcing and has therefore 
accepted these risks as such.
·         Drax recognizes that there are additional species and natural communities, not 
elevated to FSC “specified risk” classification, which must be considered when 
reviewing the robustness of regional biodiversity protections. A review of the existing 
mechanisms in place to protect these additional species and natural community was 
conducted by Drax and is detailed in Means of Verification section below. 

State wildlife and forestry agencies have state level action plans in place to 
guide conservation of biodiversity. 

Every state Drax sources from has an established Natural Heritage program 
responsible for collecting data on species occurrence within the state. These 
species records feed up into the NatureServe system. Natural Heritage and 
Nature Serve data is used by the forest industry to guide protection of 
species and natural communities of concern. 

There are established “best practices” which are utilized to maintain and 
improve wildlife habitat in the southern US. These techniques are promoted 
by state wildlife and forestry agencies, forestry and wildlife extension 
programs, federal cost share programs, and forest certification standards 
(I.e. SFI and ATFS). 
 
Means of
Verification
·         State agencies have a number of controls in place to identify and protect 
species and natural communities. These state agencies work in concert with the 
Natural Heritage Programs in their respective states (a part of the NatureServe 
network) to continuously monitor and inventory natural diversity in the states. Both 
State Wildlife Actions Plans as well as state Forest Action Plans are required for 
states to receive Federal Funding. These plans, drafted through multi-stakeholder 
participation, identify key wildlife and forestry concerns within the state and provide 
detailed plans on how to approach them. Natural Heritage data, as well as State 
Wildlife Action Plans, are available for private use.


Established best practices are promoted by state agencies, forest 
certification standards, and in forest plans required for federal cost 
share.  Some examples of best practices include, but are not limited to, 
protection of:
o
Stand level diversity through retention of Streamside Management 
Zones (SMZs), snags, coarse and fine woody debris/brush piles, 
irregular stand boundaries, development and enhancement of forest 
“edges”, protection of nesting trees, protection of isolated wetlands 
and springs etc.
o
Landscape level diversity by promoting a mosaic of stand ages and 
types, considering the timing and juxtaposition of harvests for 
hardwood management

The forest products industry participates directly in the development of the 
State Wildlife Action Plans, and state efforts to protect and identify species 
and communities of concern. For example, Drax purchases a data license 
from NatureServe annually. NatureServe then provides Drax with shapefiles 
for all known species and communities of concern. This data is integrated 
into Drax’s mapping system which is used to screen all harvests where Drax 
is receiving fiber directly from the woods. The use of NatureServe data, and 
the protection of species and communities deemed globally critically 
imperilled (G1) or globally imperilled (G2), is required by all participants of 
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Drax sources from landowners 
certified to the SFI Forest Management Standard and from sawmills that are 
certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard (note Drax is certified to this 
Standard as well). The map below illustrates the influence of the SFI Fiber 
Sourcing Program on the protection of biological diversity during sourcing.
 
·         In addition to State Wildlife Action Plans and Natural Heritage Data, the federal 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Federal Clean Water Act are very strong 
regulatory mechanisms which are in place to reduce the risk of further biodiversity 
loss. These regulations bring with them significant civil and criminal penalties (i.e. up 
to 1 year imprisonment for ESA violation and $54,000/day for CWA violation). 
o    The ESA prohibits not only direct “take” but can also deem habitat alteration as a 
“taking”. The ESA can restrict forest management on both private and public lands. 
Habitat Conservation Agreements (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements are among the tools provided to a landowner who wishes 
to actively manage their forest in areas where threatened or endangered species, 
highly sensitive to forest alteration, exist. The red-cockaded woodpecker, and the 
Louisiana pine snake are two species currently being managed with these 
mechanisms in Drax’s sourcing area. For some species Critical Habitat has been 
designated, a further assurance that federally listed species are protected (i.e. 
gopher frog in Drax sourcing area).  
o    Clean Water Act protections are extremely relevant to the protection of 
biodiversity. States have been granted the authority to develop programs to address 
nonpoint source pollution from forestry operations. These state “Best Management 
Programs” have been recognized by the USFWS in recent listing rules as a means of 
ensuring species protection. For example, the Pearl darter listing rule described 
positive effects of BMPs as follows: “Nonpoint source pollution is a localized threat to 
the pearl darter within the drainage and is more prevalent in areas where certified 
best management practices (BMPs) are not utilized. The use of certified BMPs during 
land-altering activities can greatly reduce impacts to water quality. Certified BMPs, 
currently implemented by the forestry industry (e.g., Sustainable Forestry Initiative, 
Forest Stewardship Council, and American Tree Farm System), are helping to 
minimize or eliminate non-point source pollution during forestry activities. The 
Mississippi Forestry Commission (2016, entire) reports certified BMP implementation 
rates to be high in Mississippi for forestry activities, primarily due to the efforts of 
State forestry agencies and forest certification programs (Schilling and Wigley 2015, 
pp 3–7)” (82 Fed Reg 43889).
§  In the southeastern US, the Southern Group of State Foresters has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 states. According to 
a 2018 report summarizing rates of BMP implementation, all states in the region were 
in conformance with the framework. Furthermore, 67 state-wide monitoring surveys 
have been conducted since its initial development in 1997 and 23 surveys were 
conducted in the last six years. Combining all BMP categories in all states and using 
only the most recent state survey data reported, average overall BMP 
implementation for the region was 93.6%, up from 92% in 2012. 
(https://www.southernforests.org/resources/publications/SGSF%20Water%20BMP%
20Report%20FINAL.pdf/view).
-       BMP implementation rates in the states that Drax sources from are as follows:
-       MS- Overall 95%
-       Mississippi 2019 BMP Implementation Survey
-       LA- Overall 89% (according to 2015 survey data reported in SGSF report, 2009

§  As described above, a structured BMP program has been in place in the southern 
US for over two decades. In this same time period, the forest industry has embraced 
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (est. 1994) which has championed BMP 
implementation through its trained logger requirements as well as the protection of 
biodiversity, requiring protection of G1 and G2 species (many of which are not 
federally listed). Furthermore, the State Wildlife Action Planning Process is now in its 
15th year (State Wildlife Action Plans in place since 2005, Forest Action Plans in 
place since 2010). These industry-wide protections in place for protection of 
biological diversity can be considered standard practice as well as an industry 
expectation. Drax contractually requires implementation of BMPs and has a program 
to verify implementation of BMPs as well as biodiversity protections.
 
·         In addition to the Endangered Species Act and Federal Clean Water Act, there 
are other international treaties and conventions to which the US is a 
signatory.  These include the Convention on Nature Protection and Wild Life 
Preservation in the Western Hemisphere (Washington, DC, 1940), Convention on 
Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar, Iran, 
2 Feb 1971), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES) (Washington DC, 1973), International Plant Protection 
Convention (IPPC) (1979 Revised Text) (Rome, Italy, 1979), Convention on the 
Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn, Germany, 23 Jun 1979). 
These high-level treaties provide biodiversity protections and direct conservation 
efforts (i.e. identification of Ramsar sites detailed in Indicator 2.1.1).

Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for primary and 
secondary feedstock sourcing.  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant 
risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations 
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal 
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC 
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That 
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops.  
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  FSC 
identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s sourcing area which are 
only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These areas are under Federal Critical 
Habitat protections.  FSC has identified education and outreach as a mitigation 
option for the DGF. Drax has only four suppliers having this risk within their potential 
sourcing area.  Drax provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the 
suppliers which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk 
areas.  Educational materials are informed by the best available science and adapted 
as new information and/or approaches become available. The desired outcome of 
these communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in 
conservation of DGF populations.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply 
area.  This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation 
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.” 
Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi 
Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the 
mitigation tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes 
of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal land at the extreme 
edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.  As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax 
supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of 
the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. This 
salamander is known to exist only in a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several 
counties of the Drax residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit 
small streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are protected by 
BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.   As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
 
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-compliance 
with this requirement to “low”.

·         Best Management Practices for forestry are established in each jurisdiction 
and contain guidance encouraging retention of slash for erosion control and forest 
productivity (high level of BMP implementation). See below for a few examples:
o    Louisiana – “Where accelerated erosion is likely, use methods which leave 
logging debris and other natural forest litter scattered over the site.” 
http://www.ldaf.state.la.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BMP.pdf
o    Arkansas - Waterbars are recommended for stabilizing inactive roads, firelines, 
and trails. Logging slash may also be effective. When harvesting is completed, 
disperse water from landings and skid trails using water bars, logging slash, or 
vegetative cover” 
http://www.aad.arkansas.gov/Websites/aad/files/Content/5944986/BMPs.pdf
o    Mississippi – “SLASH DISPERSAL Slash is the debris such as unmerchantable 
limbs and tree tops created in the process of a normal logging operation. Slash 
dispersal is probably the most immediate solution for prevention of soil movement on 
an active logging site. Wherever possible slash should be scattered back over 
exposed soil on skid trails and evenly dispersed across logging sets. Slash has also 
been used successfully to build water bars on skid trails.”

The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures to verify that 
negative impacts on ground water, surface water and water downstream from forest 
management are minimised (CPET S5b).
Finding
·         The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary federal law in the United States 
governing water pollution. Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, 
physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The CWA provisions that are 
most significant to forestry are section 319 addressing non-point pollution and section 
404 addressing discharge of dredge and fill into waterways and wetlands. States 
have developed Best Management Programs (BMPs) to meet the CWA. EPA has 
recently reviewed state oversight and effectiveness of BMP programs and found 
them to be successful in controlling non-point pollution. The EPA has direct oversight 
over section dredge and fill violations (section 404). 
·         Forest certification makes BMP compliance mandatory for program 
participants (SFI, ATFS, FSC). Drax sources a significant proportion of fiber from 
certified lands and is certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing program that requires all 
loggers delivering fiber to the pellet plant to be trained and comply with all BMPs. 
·         SFI partners with state forestry commissions to conduct logger training on 
BMP's. Trained loggers help ensure that water quality is maintained and protected on 
certified and non-certified lands.
·         SFI’s State Implementation Committees (SICs) regularly review and 
investigate public BMP complaints received via their inconsistent practices procedure 
and alert consuming mills of bad performers.
·         Many studies have been conducted on BMP effectiveness to reduce non-point 
pollution from Forestry operations 
 
Means of
Verification
·         States use CWA section 319 funds to implement Best Management 
Practices for forestry established in each jurisdiction and monitored to achieve 
compliance to the federal Clean Water Act. Forestry is considered a non-point source 
of pollution under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA). Under the CWA states are 
directed to develop programs to minimize and avoid non-point source pollution. 
States have developed Best Management Practice, or “BMP” programs to achieve 
this. BMP programs are generally administered by the state forestry commission in 
partnership with the state department of environmental quality (which generally acts 
as the enforcement agency). States are allowed to develop independent approaches, 
but in the south, the Southern Group of State Foresters (SGSF) has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 states. 
 
According to a 2018 SGSF report, which summarized rates of BMP implementation, 
all states in Drax’s region were in conformance with the framework. Combining all 
BMP categories in all states and using only the most recent state survey data 
reported, average overall BMP implementation for the region was 93.6%, up from 
92% 
in2012.(https://www.southernforests.org/resources/publications/SGSF%20Water%20
BMP%20Report%20FINAL.pdf/view).
BMP implementation rates in the states that Drax sources from are as follows:
MS- Overall 95%
Mississippi 2019 BMP Implementation Survey

·         A structured BMP program has been in place in the southern US for over two 
decades, with 67 state-wide monitoring surveys conducted since 1997. The 
Sustainable Forestry Initiative (established 1994) has championed BMP 
implementation, making compliance mandatory for continued certification. Logger 
training curriculums are developed and administered jointly by SFI Implementation 
Committees, state forestry commissions, and state forestry associations. See links to 
state BMP training programs below.

·         SFI State Implementation Committees have active Inconsistent Practices 
Committees that deal with reported BMP violations. This SIC involvement is 
extremely effective because mills certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard can 
immediately stop purchasing fiber from an offending supplier until the issue is 
remedied. This direct action taken by receiving mills generally addresses the problem 
so there is not a need to elevate to the regulatory agency.  In 2019 MS had 13 issues 
investigated through the Inconsistent Practices Committee, LA had 6 and AR had 13. 
No issues were elevated to the regulatory agency (Department of Environmental 
Quality: MDEQ, LDEQ, ADEQ respectively). 
·         The EPA has a framework for imposing penalties.  See the following link 
related to section 404: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-
07/documents/2001_sec_404_penalty_policy.pdf
Drax, and other wood using facilities certified to the SFI Standard, ensure a 
significant proportion of the forest landscape is implementing BMPs to protect water 
quality. Drax contractually requires the implementation of state BMPs and has a 
program to verify BMP implementation. A study conducted by Dwivedi et al. in 2018 
found that BMP implementation rate was 2% higher in sites located within 65 miles of 
mills certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing standard 
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389934118300807)
 
·         A literature review by Cristan et al. in 2016 reviewed the effectiveness of 
forestry BMPs in the United States – “The literature indicates that forestry BMPs 
protect water quality when constructed correctly and in adequate numbers. Forestry 
BMP effectiveness studies allow state forestry BMP programs to evaluate progress in 
reducing non-point source pollution and achieving water quality goals established 
under the Clean Water Act (CWA).” The following link provides a good description of 
how forestry is regulated under the CWA:

·         Technical Bulletin 966 (September 2009) issued by the National Council for Air 
and Stream Improvement (NCASI) reported high levels of compliance with water 
quality laws and BMP requirements across the U.S https://www.ncasi.org/wp-
content/uploads/2019/02/tb966.pdf
In 2016 the EPA was forced to re-evaluate the efficacy of state BMP programs in a 
response to a lawsuit challenging BMP effectiveness at controlling sedimentation and 
runoff from forest roads. Following an evaluation of state BMP programs, the EPA 
decided it was still not necessary to regulate discharges from forest roads under the 
CWA Section 402 (NPDES) point source regulatory provisions. The EPA found that 
state BMP programs adequately addressed forest roads and that monitoring efforts 
were highly effective, therefore there was no need to enforcing a new federal 
regulatory program. https://www.epa.gov/npdes/forest-roads

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 specified 
risks.  This Control Measures is defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National 
Risk Assessment (Appendix B of this document).  As specified by the mandatory 
Control Measure, Drax implements mitigation actions identified during the 
collaborative dialogue at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the 
Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-assessment-us-
nra.
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant 
risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations 
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal 
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC 
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That 
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops.  
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply 
area.  This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation 
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.”

Finding
·         FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment does not identify conversion 
to non-forest as a risk in Drax’s sourcing area.
·         SBP highlights wetlands and peatlands as sources of high carbon stock that 
should not be either drained or converted. Wetlands are defined by SBP as “Land 
that is covered with or saturated by water, permanently or for a significant part of the 
year”.  Peatlands are specific type of wetland ecosystem where continuous soil 
saturation leads to anaerobic conditions where organic matter is accumulated faster 
than it can be decomposed. 
o    Wetlands with high peat concentration are not a feature of concern on the 
landscape from which Drax sources.   
o    Wetlands with shorter periods of saturation can and do support a component of 
SYP. However, the risk of sourcing from areas which have been “drained or 
converted as of January 2008” is negligible due to CWA restrictions.
·         With the exception of a few protected areas, forests of the southern US have 
all been harvested at least once, often multiple times, reducing the risk of 
encountering high carbon forests.

exemption to the CWA section 404 (f), Recapture Provision “Recapture Provision. 
Section 404(f) exemptions DO NOT APPLY where any discharge of dredged and/or 
fill material into “waters of the US”, including wetlands, IF 1] the activity would convert

Finding
 
·         The US and the US South has a 60 plus year history of both increasing 
production of forest products and an increasing forest inventory resulting in 
increasing carbon stocks (USDA Forest Service).

·         Southern Forest Futures reports that: after accounting for harvests, forest 
growth, land use, and climate change, the total carbon pool represented by the 
South’s forests is forecasted to increase slightly from 2010 to 2020/2030 and then 
decline, primarily due to urban encroachment.

·         A study by Richter et al. found that forests increased the carbon in the top 
mineral soils of previously cropped land - Richter, D., Markewitz, D., Trumbore, S. et 
al. Rapid accumulation and turnover of soil carbon in a re-establishing forest. Nature 
400, 56–58 (1999). Forests are important to rebuilding soils on previously cropped 
lands. Much of the southeastern US has been cleared for agriculture at some point 
and most of the managed pine forests are found on previously cropped soils. The 
choice to maintain land in forest or convert from agriculture to forestry is influenced 
by the availability of markets for forest products. In this sense, the biomass market, 
which utilizes low-value fiber, can be considered to help incentivise landowners to 
manage forests important to building and maintaining soil which will help rebuild soil 
carbon and, potentially, help reduce the chances of conversion into cropland which 
causes significant soil C losses.

·         Several studies have investigated the response of soil carbon to harvesting 
and biomass removal. In most instances there is little, if any, change in mineral soil 
carbon. Changes in surface carbon are variable, with harvest often increasing carbon 
in the top organic layer initially, and differing (experimental) levels of residual 
biomass removal levels being reflected  in changing carbon content of surface soil 
layers. These findings also demonstrate that there are several variables at play 
including climate and decomposition rates. See Indicator 2.2.2 for list of applicable 
references.
