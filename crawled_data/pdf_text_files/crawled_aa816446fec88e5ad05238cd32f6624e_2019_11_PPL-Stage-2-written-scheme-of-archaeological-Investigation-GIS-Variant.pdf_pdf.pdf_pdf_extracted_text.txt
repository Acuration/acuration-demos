INTRODUCTION 
 
Project Background 
1.1
1.1.1 
Progress Power Ltd (hereafter the client) has submitted an application 
for a Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Planning Inspectorate 
(PINS) under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 to construct and 
operate a thermal generating station on land at Eye Airfield Industrial 
Estate, Suffolk.  
1.1.2 
In 2013 Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) compiled an archaeological desk-
based assessment (DBA) for the Project Site. Following this, and in 
accordance with a brief issued by the County Archaeologist at Suffolk 
County Council Archaeology Service (SCCAS), a programme of 
geophysical survey was undertaken for the Project Site. This was 
conducted by the “Bartlett-Clark Consultancy” between October 2013 
and March 2014. The DBA highlighted the potential for archaeological 
remains to be present within the Project Site, and of particular interest 
are metalwork scatters which are thought to be indicative of an Anglo-
Saxon cemetery. Subsequently, PB was invited to submit a Written 
Scheme of Investigation (WSI) for the required pre-determination 
archaeological evaluation. 
1.1.3 
In order to secure archaeological interests the County Archaeologist 
has 
requested 
an 
appropriate 
scheme 
of 
post-determination 
archaeological evaluation. This recommendation is in line with 
paragraphs 128 and 129 of the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF 2012) and is to comprise a 3.5% sample evaluation of the 
Project Site. This phase of work will be referred to as the Stage 2 
evaluation. Stage 1 will be undertaken pre-determination and will 
comprise a 1% evaluation of the electrical connection corridor within 
the Project Site. Should the results of Stages 1 and Stages 2 reveal 
significant archaeological remains then a programme of mitigation 
(Stage 3) will be the determined by the County Archaeologist in 
consultation with the Consultant. This document represents the method 
statement for Stage 2 of the evaluation fieldwork. Stages 1 and 3 will 
be subject to separate Written Schemes of Investigation (WSI). 
 
Stage 2 Post-determination Investigation 
1.2
1.2.1 
This will comprise a programme of sample evaluation trenching which 
will target the positive results of the geophysical survey as appropriate. 
It will be undertaken in order to determine the extent, depth, function, 
chronology and relative significance of any archaeological deposits 
present within the project Site.

1.2.2 
This Stage 2 WSI has been written to comply with instructions issued 
by SCCAS County Archaeologist and with reference to professional 
standards and guidelines provided by the IfA Standard and Guidance 
for Archaeological Field Evaluation (revised 2009), and English 
Heritage’s The Management of Archaeological Projects (1991). It also 
takes into consideration the guidance of the SCC Trenched 
Archaeological 
Evaluation 
Requirements 
(2011) 
and 
SCCAS 
Archaeological Archives in Suffolk: Guidelines for preparation and 
deposition (2014). 
 
Archaeological and Historical Summary 
1.3
1.3.1 
The archaeological and historical background to the site is presented in 
the Desk-based Assessment that was compiled by PB in 2013. In 
summary the archaeology within the area of the proposed development 
includes a range of heritage assets dating from the Neolithic Period 
onwards. A number of findspots include a Neolithic flint, Romano-
British pottery scatters, a medieval lead token or seal and a medieval 
pottery scatter. Additional heritage assets include a Roman road (HER 
No BRM 011), which has been identified as Margary’s 3d. This runs in 
a north-west/south-east direction from Coddenham in the south to the 
Roman site of Scole to the north, which is a Scheduled Monument. 
1.3.2 
There is significant evidence for Anglo-Saxon activity within the Project 
Site, as demonstrated by a collection of metalwork (MSF27037) that 
may be indicative of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. 
1.3.3 
A number of medieval moated sites and greens have been recorded 
within the general area of the proposed development site, and one of 
the most notable is Broome Common (HER NoTDE 016), which lies 
just to the north of the proposed Power Generation Plant. There is 
potential for further green-edge settlements within the proposed site of 
the Power Generation Plant and its immediate environs relating to this 
Common. Moated sites have been identified at Malting Farm and Home 
Farm to the north-west of the Power Generation Plant, along with many 
in the surrounding area. These farms also contain Grade II Listed 
Buildings dating to the Post-medieval Period. Goswold Hall (sixteenth-
century) and its associated dovecote (eighteenth-century) are also 
Grade II Listed Buildings located to the west of the Power Generation 
Plant. 
1.3.4 
Within the proposed footprint of the Power Generation Plant itself, field 
boundaries have been identified from historic mapping, which may pre-
date the Roman period.  
1.3.5 
The WWII Airfield at Eye (HER No EYE 072) is also situated within the 
site of the proposed Power Generation Plant.

1.3.6 
The geophysical survey conducted by the “Bartlett-Clark Consultancy 
between October 2013 and March 2014 and reported in, “Proposed 
Gas and Electrical Connection Routes near Eye Airfield, Suffolk – 
Report on Archaeological Geophysical Survey 2013-14’”, detected 
considerable and varied magnetic activity throughout the survey area, 
but much of it was clearly of recent origin, or relates to historic field 
boundaries or land drains. The main areas of archaeological concern 
indicated by the survey are in the north-western and south-eastern 
corners of the evaluation area.   There is also a complex group of 
magnetic disturbances in field 14, but these could in part be of recent 
origin.  Findings could include remains of a structure in field 4 to the 
north-west, perhaps with traces of enclosures or a field system nearby 
in fields 4 and 13 (although comparison with nineteenth century maps 
could show whether these results can be accounted for by historic 
rather than archaeological features).  The findings (in field 17) to the 
south-east are in an area of disturbed ground near the airfield, and it is 
therefore difficult to determine whether or not they are genuine on the 
basis of the survey evidence alone, (see Bartlett ADH 2013 for field 
number locations). Field 19 was under a beet crop in 2013, and was 
included in the additional areas surveyed in March 2014.  There are 
some recent disturbances, but much of the field is less heavily 
disturbed than are fields 16 and 17 to the west and south. Findings are 
limited to two distinct linear markings which are likely to be former field 
boundaries pre-dating the construction of the airfield. 
1.3.7 
In addition to the results of the DBA and geophysical survey a gold coin 
was recorded recently by the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), less 
than 100m north of the proposed AIS compound corridor on the west 
side of the A140, and c.190m to the east of HER no. YAX 029 (possible 
Anglo-Saxon cemetery).  This is a rare Early-medieval gold coin, 
probably a contemporary ninth-century AD Anglo-Frisian copy of a 
Carolingian solidus of Louis the Pious (814-840 AD).  Ten other finds 
were recorded in May (2014) with the coin from similar find spots, and 
seem to be in the same field, including Roman glass vessel fragment, 
Roman grey ware sherds, Roman box flue, Ipswich ware, handmade 
early Anglo-Saxon and medieval coarse ware.  This material could be 
the result of manuring but it could also indicate substantial and 
significant occupation in this area (not been defined by the geophysical 
survey), that could easily extend southwards into the Project Site 
(SCCAS 2014).

1.4.1 
PB Archaeology and Heritage (A&H) are based in the PB Manchester 
office but work across the entire UK. All of the team members have at 
least nine years experience in desk-based and field archaeology. The 
Team lead and Principal Consultant have over twenty-seven years of

experience. The team has the expertise relevant to undertake all 
aspects of field and desk-based projects, and to monitor and to project 
manage. All members belong to the IfA. 
1.4.2 
In this instance the fieldwork will be sub-contracted to an IfA registered 
organisation (Oxford Archaeology East) and will be monitored on behalf 
of the client by PB. 
 
Archive Deposition 
1.5
1.5.1 
This section should be read in conjunction with the Archaeological 
Archives in Suffolk: Guidelines for preparation and deposition (2014) 
which states that an archaeological archive consists of all written, 
drawn, photographic and digital records and artefacts/ecofacts related 
to and generated by the project fieldwork. The guidelines present the 
SCCAS archiving requirements in detail. The results of the metal-
detector survey and archaeological evaluation will form the basis of a 
full archive to professional standards, in accordance with current 
English Heritage guidelines (The Management of Archaeological 
Projects, 2nd edition, 1991) and the SCCAs guidance cited above. The 
project archive represents the collation and indexing of all the data and 
material gathered during the course of the project. The deposition of a 
properly ordered and indexed project archive in an appropriate 
repository is considered an essential and integral element of all 
archaeological projects by the Institute for Archaeologists (IfA) in that 
organisation’s code of conduct.  
1.5.2 
The Historic Environment Record (HER) officer will be contacted for an 
HER number at the start of the fieldwork. The Archaeological 
Collections Officer will also be contacted in advance of deposition of 
the archive to provide costs and arrangements for accessions. 
Generally, the archive will be in a form that permits comprehensive and 
further interpretation of the site, and the SCCAS digital metadata entry 
spreadsheet will be completed. 
1.5.3 
In addition, the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) online 
database 
project 
Online

of 
Archaeological 
Investigations (OASIS) will be completed (following approval of the 
evaluation report) as part of the archiving phase of the project. 
 
Aims and Objectives 
1.6
1.6.1 
The main aim of the investigation will be to establish the significance of 
any buried remains of archaeological interest within the area of the 
Project Site. The results of the evaluation will provide information as to 
whether mitigation (Stage 3) is required prior to the main development 
programme.

1.6.2 
The objectives may be summarised as follows: 
 
to establish the presence of further Anglo-Saxon remains within the 
Project Site; 
 
to establish the nature and origin of the anomalies identified during 
the course of the geophysical survey; 
 
to compile a detailed record of any buried archaeological remains 
that are found to survive in-situ; 
 
to undertake any post-excavation works required and create an 
appropriate site archive; 
 
to produce a written report that will assess the significance of the 
data generated by the above fieldwork programme within a local 
and regional context;   
 
to facilitate the implementation of a strategy that will take account 
of the archaeological resource of the site in the final design 
proposals, and satisfy the requirements of the stakeholders.

METHOD STATEMENT 
 
Consultation 
2.1
2.1.1 
Experience has shown the importance of a close working relationship 
between the consultant archaeologist and client's contractor on 
development projects. Such a relationship will help to ensure the timely 
and successful completion of the project in an efficient and cost-
effective manor, achieving high technical and academic standards, 
whilst meeting all the requirements of the County Archaeologist’s brief 
and fulfilling all the developers archaeological obligations. 
 
Approach 
2.2
2.2.1 
The archaeological impact of the proposed project works will be 
mitigated by a flexible response that will be appropriate to the nature of 
the archaeological resource observed during the initial stage of 
investigation. The sample evaluation trenching will target the positive 
results of the geophysical survey (2013 to 2014) and sample the 
negative areas throughout the remainder of the Project Site (Figures 1a 
– 1c). The co-axial field boundaries within the site of the proposed 
electrical connection compound will not be subject to trenching, and 
neither will the extreme south-eastern end of the Project Site (below 
Eye Airfield) due to the moderate potential for unexploded ordnance to 
be present.

Evaluation Trenching 
2.3
2.3.1 
A 3.5% sample of the Project Site equates to 95 archaeological 
trenches. It is proposed that the evaluation will comprise the excavation 
of 98 trenches across the Project Site as five evaluation trenches will 
have been excavated as part of the Stage 1 investigation. All of the 
trenches will be excavated to a length of 30m, and to a maximum width 
of 1.8m, although the trenches will be stepped out should deep 
stratigraphy be encountered. The trenches will be positioned in the 
agreed locations as shown on Figures 1a – 1c, although pending any 
on-site restrictions such as modern service trenches. Should the 
working area be subject to change following review of the technical 
design proposals then the position and number of trenches could be 
subject to change. 
Trenches 11, 15, 18, 34, 41, 44, 50, 53, 58, 59, 64, 66, 69, 71, 81, 89, 
and 95 
2.3.2 
These trenches will be located over the known position of geophysical 
anomalies such as field boundaries and strong (ferrous) magnetic 
anomalies. 
Remaining Trenches 
2.3.3 
The remainder of the trenches will be targeted to test the negative 
results of the geophysical survey. 
 
General Fieldwork Methodology 
2.4
2.4.1 
This section should be read in conjunction with the SCC Requirements 
for a Trenched Archaeological Evaluation (2011). Excavation of the 
uppermost levels of modern overburden/demolition material will be 
undertaken by a machine fitted with a toothless ditching bucket to the 
top of the first significant archaeological level. The work will be 
supervised closely by a suitably experienced archaeologist. Thereafter, 
all deposits will be cleaned manually to define their extent, nature, form 
and, where possible, date. Spoil from the excavation will be stored in a 
sequential manner adjacent to the trench, and will be backfilled upon 
completion of the archaeological works. Once significant archaeological 
deposits have been exposed, further excavation will be carried out by 
manual techniques, proceeding in a stratigraphical manner. Pits and 
postholes will, in general terms, be subject to a 50% by volume 
controlled stratigraphic excavation, thereby providing a full vertical 
section for examination and recording. The remainder of the feature, 
should it prove necessary to be removed in entirety, will then be 
excavated quickly keeping only that dating evidence which is securely 
derived from the feature in question.

For Progress Power Ltd 
 
- 11 - 
2.4.2 
Linear cut features, such as ditches and gullies, will be subject to a 
maximum of 20% by volume controlled stratigraphic excavation, with 
the excavation concentrating on any terminals and intersections with 
other features which would provide important stratigraphic information. 
As with pits and postholes, should it prove necessary to remove the 
remainder of the feature to expose underlying features and/or deposits, 
it will be excavated quickly. 
2.4.3 
Extensive linear deposits or homogeneous spreads of material will be 
sample excavated by hand to a maximum of 50% by volume. If 
features/deposits are revealed which need to be removed and which 
are suitable for machine excavation, such as large-scale post-medieval 
dump deposits, then they would be sample excavated to confirm their 
homogeneity before being removed by machine. Any such use of a 
mechanical excavator will be agreed in advance with the County 
Archaeologist. 
2.4.4 
If horizontal deposits, e.g buried soils/dark earth spreads, are 
encountered, machining will stop at the upper interface. Systematic 
sampling (hand sampling in 1m² squares) will be required, to establish 
the nature of the deposit and to make an informed decision concerning 
further excavation and/or machine removal. Provision should be 
provided for column sampling and assessment. 
2.4.5 
All information identified in the course of the site works will be recorded 
stratigraphically, using a system, adapted from that used by the Centre 
for Archaeology of English Heritage (CfA), with sufficient pictorial 
record (plans, sections and both black and white and colour 
photographs) to identify and illustrate individual features. Primary 
records will be available for inspection at all times. 
Context Recording 
2.4.6 
The features will be recorded using pro-forma sheets which are in 
accordance with those used by CfA. Similar object record and 
photographic record pro-formas will be used. All written recording of 
survey data, contexts, photographs, artefacts and ecofacts will be 
cross-referenceable from pro-forma record sheets using sequential 
numbering. The contextual details will be incorporated into a Harris 
matrix.  
Photography 
2.4.7 
A full and detailed photographic record of individual contexts will be 
maintained and similarly general views from standard view points of the 
overall site at all stages of the excavation will be generated.

- 12 - 
Photography will be undertaken using high-resolution digital cameras. 
Photograph records will be maintained on index pro-forma sheets. 
Planning 
2.4.8 
Archaeological planning will be undertaken using a combination of 
manually-drafted drawings and instrument survey, and the data will be 
digitally incorporated into a CAD system. All information will be tied in 
to Ordnance Datum. The precise location of each evaluation trench, 
and the outline of all archaeological features encountered, will be 
surveyed by EDM tacheometry using a total station linked to a pen 
computer data logger. This process will generate scaled plans within 
AutoCAD software, which will then be subject to manual survey 
enhancement. The drawings will be generated at accuracy appropriate 
for 1:20 scale, but can be output at any scale required. 
2.4.9 
All excavated sections across individual features will be drawn using 
manual techniques, and for the most part will be generated at a scale of 
1:10. Assuming there is no requirement for shoring, the sections of the 
trenches will similarly be manually drafted, although a Total Station has 
proved to be a cost effective tool for drawing very long sections. 
Finds  
2.4.10 
Finds recovery and sampling programmes will be in accordance with 
best practice (current IfA guidelines) and subject to expert advice. 
Finds storage during fieldwork and any site archive preparation will 
follow professional guidelines (UKIC).  
2.4.11 
 Neither artefacts nor ecofacts will be collected systematically during the 
mechanical excavation of the overburden unless significant deposits 
are encountered. Other finds recovered during the removal of 
overburden will be retained only if of significance to the dating and/or 
interpretation of the site. It is not anticipated that ecofacts (eg 
unmodified animal bone) will be collected during this procedure. 
2.4.12 
Otherwise artefacts and ecofacts will be collected and handled as per 
specification. All material will be collected and identified by stratigraphic 
unit. Hand collection by stratigraphic unit will be the principal method of 
collection. Objects deemed to be of potential significance to the 
understanding, interpretation and dating of individual features, or of the 
site as a whole, will be recorded as individual items, and their location 
plotted in 3-D.  
2.4.13 
Finds will be processed and administered at regular intervals (on a 
daily basis) and removed from the site. All finds will be treated in 
accordance with IFA and UKIC Guidelines. In general this will mean

- 13 - 
that (where appropriate or safe to do so) finds are washed, dried, 
marked, bagged and packed in stable conditions. All finds warranting 
conservation will be treated accordingly.  
2.4.14 
All waterlogged finds will be treated as appropriate. In the case of large 
deposits of waterlogged environmental material (eg unmodified wood), 
advice will be sought with the English Heritage specialist consultant 
with regard to an appropriate sampling strategy. 
2.4.15 
Any gold and silver artefacts recovered during the course of the 
excavation will be removed to a safe place and reported to the local 
Coroner according to the procedures relating to the Treasure Act, 1996. 
Environmental Sampling 
2.4.16 
A programme of palaeo-environmental sampling will be carried out 
during the evaluation in accordance with the guidelines provided by 
English Heritage (2011). Advice on the appropriateness of the 
proposed strategies will be sought from Dr Zoe Outram the English 
Heritage Regional Adviser for Archaeological Science (East of 
England). The sampling should aim to determine the potential of the 
site both for biological remains (eg plants, small vertebrates) and small-
sized artefacts (eg smithing debris) that are not reliably represented by 
hand-collected assemblages. The number and range of samples 
collected needs to represent the range and feature types encountered. 
2.4.17 
The contexts will be sampled as appropriate, subject to palaeo-
environmental survival, and an assessment of the samples will be 
undertaken as part of the assessment stage of the MAP2 programme. 
In the event of substantial cultivation horizons being encountered, 
particularly those constituting a ‘dark earth’, monolith, in addition to 
bulk, samples will be taken, which will be assessed for pollen and plant 
macrofossils.  
2.4.18 
Bulk (40 litres) samples (or 100% from small features) will be taken 
from all sealed pit fills, and particularly from any discrete fills within 
single pits, which may provide evidence for a change in function. 
Similar sample quantities will be taken from all other feature-types 
encountered. Attention will also be paid to the identification of insects, 
particularly within waterlogged deposits, and a sampling strategy shall 
be devised accordingly. It is proposed that the floatation of suitable 
samples be undertaken off site following completion of the fieldwork.  
2.4.19 
Bone recovered from stratified deposits will be subject to assessment, 
and analysis will be limited to material that can provide metrical, ageing 
or sex information. Attention will be paid to the collection of small

- 14 - 
animal bones from stratified contexts, and to the retrieval of fish bones 
and molluscs from rubbish pits.   
2.4.20 
Suggested questions (SCC County Archaeologist) to be addressed in 
terms of plant remains are: 
 
range of preservation types (charred, mineral-replaced, 
waterlogged), and their quality; 
 
concentrations of macro-fossils, to inform the size of bulk samples 
on any future excavation; 
 
differences in remains from dated and undated features – thus the 
degree of likely association /disassociation, and 
 
variation between feature types and areas of site. 
2.4.21 
Samples need to be (first) taken in order to assess palaeo-
environmental survival. In the event that waterlogged organic features 
are encountered these should be sampled as it is possible to date them 
for C14 regardless of actual content (SCC County Archaeologist). 
Burials 
2.4.22 
Given the potential for an Anglo-Saxon cemetery within the Project 
Site, it is possible that human remains could be present. If found they 
will, if possible, be left in-situ, covered and protected. The remains will 
then be subject to a formal appraisal by an appropriate specialist in 
skeletal remains, which will inform the County Archaeologist as to 
whether the remains merit further study. If removal is necessary, then 
the relevant Department of Cultural Affairs permission will be sought, 
and the removal of such remains will be carried out with due care and 
sensitivity, as required by current legislation.  
2.4.23 
In the event that grave cuts are encountered then the following 
additional aims will apply during evaluation: 
 
to identify the density and also depth of burials (and to define any 
variation in depth); 
 
to define the degree of preservation of burials and 
bioarchaeological potential; 
 
to assess the risk of contamination from disease and viruses from 
burial and coffins. Any burial, however, should remain in-situ during 
evaluation. 
2.4.24 
A specialist in human skeletal remains should assess any burials, 
should they be encountered, in-situ.provision should be made for 
absolute dating if required (radiocarbon and OSL techniques).

2.4.25 
All human remains will be recorded using skeleton recording forms. 
The grave cut and/or coffin and contents will be recorded in plan at 
1:20. Significant details of any grave goods, should they be discovered, 
will be planned at 1:10. Photography will be used to provide a further 
detailed record of the skeleton. 
 
Monitoring and Notice 
2.5
2.5.1 
Monitoring visits will be required by the County Archaeologist. The 
County Archaeologist or his representative will be given at least two 
weeks prior notice of the commencement of fieldwork. No backfilling of 
trenches will be carried out without the approval of the County 
Archaeologist. 
2.5.2 
Post-Excavation and Report Production 
2.5.3 
A report detailing the findings obtained from the Stage 2 evaluation will 
be prepared upon completion of the fieldwork. In the first instance it will 
be issued to the PB Principal Consultant to review and subsequently as 
an unbound hard copy to the SCC County Archaeologist for approval.  
Assessments will be carried out by suitably qualified specialists with 
local / regional expertise. The report will include: 
 
non-technical summary; 
 
introductory statement; 
 
aims and purpose of the archaeological investigation; 
 
method statement; 
 
a full, phased stratigraphic discussion of the archaeological 
features; 
 
an interpretive discussion of the results, placing them in a local and 
regional context; 
 
the results of assessment of artefacts and ecofacts carried out by 
suitable specialists;

a copy of the OASIS form. 
2.5.4 
The SCC HER will require both hard and digital copies of the report. 
The report will be uploaded onto OASIS following approval from SCC. 
Publication and Dissemination 
2.5.5 
The results of the archaeological investigation will be disseminated 
commensurate with their significance. In the event of limited 
archaeological remains being exposed, dissemination will comprise 
presentation in a final grey literature report, which will be deposited with 
the SCCAS HER. The discovery of remains of greater significance will 
be published in the proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology 
and History and / or integrated with the results of the pre-determination 
investigations. 
 
Other Matters 
2.6
2.6.1 
The client is asked to provide PB and the archaeological sub-contractor 
with information relating to the position of live services on the site. The 
on-site archaeological contractor will use a cable detecting tool in 
advance of any excavation. 
2.6.2 
Normal working hours are between 8.30 am and 4.30 pm, Monday to 
Friday, though adjustments to hours may be made to maximise daylight 
working time in winter and to meet travel requirements. It is not normal 
practice for staff to be asked to work weekends or bank holidays and 
should the client require such time to be worked during the course of a 
project a contract variation to cover additional costs will be necessary. 
 
Health and Safety 
2.7
2.7.1 
PB provides a Risk Assessment Method Statement (RAMS) for all 
projects and maintains a Safety Policy. PB will liaise with the client and 
main contractor to ensure all health and safety regulations are met. A 
RAMS and the sub-contractors own risk assessment will be completed 
in advance of all on-site works. All site staff should hold CSCS cards. 
2.7.2 
A copy of the UXO report will be made available to the archaeological 
sub-contractor, and the relevant areas avoided. 
 
Resources and Programming 
2.8
2.8.1 
The programme of work will take place post-determination of the 
Application. No closer date is available at this time.

2.8.2 
The archaeological investigation will be undertaken after due 
consideration by and consultation with the County Archaeologist for 
Suffolk County Council. 
2.8.3 
The archaeological fieldwork will be sub-contracted to Oxford 
Archaeology East (OAE) based in Cambridge. A list of CVs for site staff 
and project management will be issued to the County Archaeologist 
prior to the commencement of site works. It is anticipated that all 
specialist assessments (Finds and Environmental) will also be 
undertaken in-house by OAE. If appropriate the list of specialist 
contributors will also be sent to the County Archaeologist for prior 
approval.
