1.  Headlines
This quarter’s Electric Insights features two special reports on Britain’s 
power system moving towards zero fossil fuels, and how this makes electric 
vehicles cleaner than ever.
Last quarter saw major press coverage about ‘zero coal’ as Britain went for 
a fortnight without any coal power stations operating. The bigger challenge 
is getting all the way to zero carbon electricity and moving away from all 
unabated fossil fuels. Article 2 looks at the progress Britain’s power system is 
making, and how the last quarter saw the ﬁrst full day with a carbon intensity 
below the Committee on Climate Change’s critical target of 100 g/kWh, and 
the ﬁrst ever excursion below a 10% share of fossil fuels.
Back in 2017 we looked at electric cars getting greener due to changes in 
the power system. A lot has changed in the last two years, more models are 
available and electric vans and taxis have taken off. Article 3 looks at how 
these new models perform in environmental terms, and whether Britain’s 
electricity is clean enough to repay the carbon emissions released in making 
their huge batteries.
This quarter, the Electric Insights website was upgraded to show the split 
between onshore and offshore wind. The UK has over 2,000 turbines installed 
out at sea, making it the world’s leader in offshore wind. Article 4 shows how 
the country’s wind industry has developed over the last 20 years, revealing 
that onshore wind is still the largest source of wind power. 
Article 5 looks at the power system’s statistics over the last quarter. Wholesale 
prices have fallen dramatically since the start of the year. Nuclear power fell 
to its lowest output in over a decade. And for the ﬁrst time, coal has fallen to 
last place in the generation mix, producing less electricity than hydropower. 
Article 6 looks at the record highs and lows in the power system, 24 of which 
were broken over the last three months. In June, electricity demand fell to its 
lowest levels in 25 years.

Electricity generation is decarbonising faster in Britain than anywhere else 
in the world.1 Changes to the way we produce power over the last six years 
have reduced carbon emissions by 100 million tonnes per year.2 The carbon 
savings made in Britain’s power sector are equivalent to having taken every 
single car and van off our roads.3
This puts Britain at the forefront of the wider trend towards clean electricity. 
Coal generation is collapsing in Germany, having fallen 20% in the last year 
due to rising carbon prices. Renewables have beaten fossil fuels as the largest 
source of generation in Europe. A third of America’s coal power stations have 
retired over the last decade as they switch to cleaner natural gas.
Britain’s coal power stations made international headlines in May for sitting 
completely idle for two full weeks. But coal is only part of the story. The second 
quarter of 2019 saw three major milestones that signal Britain’s progress 
towards a clean power system:
1. The carbon content of electricity hit to an all-time low, falling below  
100 g/kWh across a whole day for the ﬁrst time;
2. Renewables hit an all-time high, supplying more than half of Britain’s 
electricity over a full day; and
3. For the ﬁrst time ever, less than a tenth of electricity was produced from 
fossil fuels.
2.  Britain’s power system is closer than ever to
being fossil-free

In the 12 months to July 2019 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation totalled 60.5 million tonnes. In the 12 months to July 2013 these emissions were 160.2 million tonnes. Both ﬁgures include emissions 
from imported electricity, and from producing and transporting biomass. See Electric Insights and our peer-reviewed methodology paper for details of the calculation.

In 2017 the UK’s cars emitted 70 million tonnes of CO2 and light-duty vehicles emitted 19 million tonnes. Source: BEIS Final greenhouse gas emissions statistics.
4 Note, the record for lowest daily-average carbon emissions was smashed at the time of going to press, falling from the 97 g/kWh hit in Quarter 2 to just 73 g/kWh.
Going below 100 grams
100 grams of CO2 per kWh is an important number. Two years 
ago the Committee on Climate Change recommended it as 
the target for 2030 that would mean our electricity system 
is in line with the national commitment to decarbonise.
Britain’s electricity has dipped below 100 grams for single 
hours at a time, but until now it had never done so for a full 
day. June 30th was a sunny Sunday with a good breeze that 
brought a 33°C heatwave to an end. Electricity demand was 
among the lowest seen all year while wind output was at 
a three-month high. The carbon intensity of electricity sat 
below 100 g/kWh for half of the day, falling to a minimum 
of just 73 g/kWh in the mid-afternoon. Carbon emissions 
averaged over the day were 97 g/kWh, beating the previous 
record of 104 g/kWh set a year ago.

Going above 50% renewables
June 30th was a record-breaker in a second way. Wind, 
solar, biomass and hydro supplied 55% of electricity 
demand over the day – smashing the previous daily record 
of 49% set last summer. For the ﬁrst day in the national 
grid’s history, more electricity came from renewables 
than all other sources. 
That day, Britain’s wind farms produced twice as much 
electricity as all fossil fuels combined. A quarter of the 
country’s electricity demand was met by onshore wind 
farms, and 15% from offshore.5
Despite several reactors being ofﬂine for maintenance, 
nuclear power provided nearly a ﬁfth of electricity;  
again, more than was supplied by all fossil fuels.
 5 Electric Insights now provides data on the split between onshore and offshore wind farms. Typically, around 2/3 of the country’s wind power comes from its onshore wind farms.

Heading towards fossil-free electricity
The rise of renewable energy has been a major factor in 
decarbonising Britain’s electricity, complemented by the 
incredible fall in coal generation. Every single coal plant  
in Britain has sat idle for at least two days a week since 
the start of spring.
It has been three years since Britain’s ﬁrst zero-coal hour.  
A year later came the ﬁrst full day, and earlier this year we 
saw the longest coal-free run in history, lasting 18 days.  
This summer could see the ﬁrst full month of no coal 
output if this trend continues.

Attention must now shift from ‘zero coal’ to ‘fossil free’. 
Unabated natural gas (without carbon capture and storage) 
needs to be removed from the grid mix by 2050 to tackle 
the climate crisis and ensure the UK hits net-zero emissions 
across the whole economy. 
At the start of this decade, Britain’s power system had 
never operated with less than half of electricity coming 
from fossil fuels. As renewables were rolled out across the 
country the share of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically. By 
2014, the grid was able to operate with less than one-third 
from fossil fuels, and by 2016 it had gone below one-ﬁfth.
On May 26th, the share of fossil fuels in Britain’s electricity 
fell below 10% for the ﬁrst time ever. This record could 
have gone further though. During the afternoon, 600 MW 
of wind power was shed – enough to power half a million 
homes. National Grid had to turn off a tenth of Scotland’s 
wind farms to keep the system stable and secure.
This wind power had to be replaced by gas, biomass and 
hydro plants elsewhere in the country, as these could be 
fully controlled at short notice and were located closer to 
demand centres. This turn-down coincides with ten straight 
hours where power prices were zero or negative, going down 
to a minimum of –£71/MWh in the afternoon. National Grid’s 
bill for balancing the system that day alone came to £6.6m.
If the power system could have coped with all the renewable 
energy being generated, fossil fuels would have been 
pushed down to just 8% of the generation mix.
This highlights the challenges that National Grid face in their 
ambition to run a zero carbon power system by 2025 – and 
the tangible beneﬁts that could already be realised today. 
If the trend of the last decade continues, Britain could be 
on course for its ﬁrst ‘fossil-free’ hour as early as 2023. This 
will only be possible if the technical issues around voltage 
and inertia at times of high wind output can be tackled  
with new low-carbon technologies.
Other countries are grappling with questions about 
whether renewables can be relied on to replace coal and 
gas. Britain is proof that renewables can achieve things 
that weren’t imaginable just a decade ago.
Zero carbon electricity is “the job that can’t wait”. 
Britain only has a few more years to wait before the ﬁrst 
“fossil-free” hours become a reality.

3.  How clean is my electric car?
Electric vehicles are fast becoming mainstream. There are now well over 
200,000 on Britain's roads, and this number is growing by 30% per year.  
1 in 40 cars sold in Britain is now electric, around one-third of which are pure 
battery models, and two-thirds are plug-in hybrids.1
This radical shift is just beginning though. Britain’s electric vehicle ﬂeet is 
expected to expand ten-fold over the next ﬁve to ten years. In more optimistic 
scenarios, half of all vehicles on the road could be electric just ﬁfteen years  
from now.2
While many see EVs as the cleanest way to drive, they are still the subject 
of much speculation. Recent criticisms range from a UK government report 
saying they won’t end air pollution3 to a string of studies (often debunked) 
claiming they emit more CO2 than diesel equivalents.4
The arguments are simple: how can it be cleaner to swap a petrol car for 
electric if it is recharged using electricity from dirty coal or gas? Secondly, 
how can electric vehicles ‘repay’ the energy needed for mining lithium and to 
assemble the huge batteries that power them? 
We review academic studies of battery manufacture and use data from 
Electric Insights to answer these questions. More details on this analysis are 
given at the end of the article. 
On average Britain’s EVs emit just one quarter the CO2 of conventional petrol 
and diesel vehicles. If the carbon emitted in making their battery is included, 
this rises to only half the CO2 of a conventional vehicle. Electric vehicles 
bought today could be emitting just a tenth that of a petrol car in ﬁve years’ 
time, as the electricity system is widely expected to continue moving towards 
low-carbon sources.
Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as 
burning through one full tank of petrol.5 Electric vehicles typically have a 
battery capacity ranging from 30 kWh for small city hatchbacks up to 100 kWh 
for top-end model – manufacturing the latter emits as much carbon as 
three round-the-world ﬂights. More CO2 is emitted in building the battery for 
premium EV model than from the recharging it over a 15-year lifetime.6
However, the most efﬁcient EV models could need just two to three years of 
driving to save the amount of carbon emitted in producing their batteries. 
Smaller EVs with modest battery sizes are better for the environment; whereas 
the largest luxury EV models could need three times longer to pay back their 
carbon cost.

A 40 litre tank of petrol (costing around £50 to ﬁll up) and holds around 380–390 kWh of chemical energy, which will release 90–100 kg of CO2 when burnt. Estimates for the CO2 embodied in lithium-ion battery 
manufacture centre around 75–125 kg per kWh.
6 Assuming a 100 kWh lithium-ion battery and electricity consumption of 185–225 Wh/km (representative of the Tesla Model S and Model X), charging efﬁciency of 96%, grid electricity with a carbon intensity of 204 g/kWh 
(Britain’s average for the 12 months to June 2019), transmission and distribution losses of 7.5% (giving 219 g/kWh delivered to the plug), a vehicle lifetime of 150,000 km and carbon emissions from battery manufacture of 
75–125 kgCO2 per kWh.

Hatchbacks
Small hatchbacks are the best-selling type of electric vehicles, led by the Nissan 
Leaf. They are also the cleanest to drive as they are small and light. Electric 
models currently emit around 33 grams of CO2 per km driven, which is one quarter 
that of the most popular conventional vehicle, a 2019 Ford Fiesta. These electric 
models typically come with a 30-45 kWh battery, which pushes their lifetime 
emissions up around 60 g/km. This is still less than half the emissions of a petrol 
or diesel car. With the projected changes to the grid mix, this will fall to less than 
one-third of a standard car in just ﬁve years’ time.
Luxury Cars
Luxury saloons and SUV models include the iconic Tesla Models S and X, and 
the new Jaguar i-Pace. These are much larger and need more energy to move, 
meaning they have higher emissions than hatchbacks, at 44-54 g/km. This is still 
just a quarter of the emissions from a comparable conventional car (a top of the 
range Mercedes S-Class). The lifetime emissions of these luxury EVs are notably 
higher though, pushed up by the enormous 90-100 kWh batteries they use to 
provide a driving range of over 250 miles. These batteries are responsible for 
more CO2 emissions than driving the car over its entire lifetime; however, the 
lifetime emissions are still around 40% lower than a conventional luxury saloon.

Vans
Electric vans are quickly taking off, with over 8,000 sold in Britain to date. Their 
performance is comparable to small hatchbacks, and they also currently emit 
around a quarter of the CO2 of the most popular conventional van, with around 
40 g/km. With their 30–40 kWh battery pack included, this rises to just below 
half the CO2 of a small Ford Transit.

Time to 'recover' battery CO2 for a typical driver
Average value
Range across model specs
Payback time
A typical driver ﬁlling their car up once a month and driving around 7,500 miles 
per year will produce one and a half tonnes of CO2 per year in a modern petrol 
or diesel hatchback. An electric vehicle doing the same mileage would take  
4 years to produce this amount.
With a conventional vehicle, there is no scope for reducing emissions over its 
lifetime, as petrol and diesel fuels cannot become carbon-free. On the contrary, 
National Grid expect the carbon content of Britain’s electricity to continue 
falling, so that an electric vehicle bought now will be emitting half as much 
CO2 in 2025 as it does today.
It is inconceivable that an electric vehicle in the UK could be more polluting 
than its conventional equivalent. This would require electricity to have a 
carbon intensity of around 850–950 g/kWh, values not seen since the 1960s.7
Electric vehicles can be thought of as having an upfront ‘carbon cost’ for 
manufacturing the battery, which can then be ‘repaid’ through lower emissions 
as they are driven. With Britain’s current grid electricity (producing 205 g/kWh), 
smaller electric cars and vans will take between 2 and 4 years to have saved the 
amount of CO2 than was emitted in making their batteries. For the larger luxury 
models, it will take more like 5–6 years of driving to pay back that carbon.
With each passing year as the electricity mix gets cleaner, this payback time 
will continue to fall, and the environmental credentials of electric vehicles will 
keep growing stronger.
How far an electric vehicle must drive to become cleaner than a conventional equivalent 8
7 
This includes the ‘carbon cost’ of manufacturing the battery. If just the emissions from driving are considered, electric vehicles would need to be charged with electricity containing 900-1000 g/kWh to emit more CO2 
than petrol or diesel equivalents. 
8 Each electric vehicle model was matched to an approximate equivalent. The average and range across all model variants (both diesel and petrol) was considered, and all vehicles used emissions measured under the 
WLTP test. Where WLTP test data were not available, emissions were estimated from the NEDC test cycle using CO2MPAS. The comparisons are: Nissan Leaf vs Nissan Micra. Renault Zoe vs Renault Clio. VW e-Golf vs  
VW Golf. VW e-Up vs VW Up. Hyundai Kona vs Hyundai Tuscon. BMW i3 vs Smart fortwo. Tesla Model S vs Mercedes S-Class. Tesla Model X vs Range Rover Evoque. Jaguar i-Pace vs Jaguar F-Pace. Nissan e-NV200 vs

About this study
The fuel economy and climate impact of vehicles are measured by the 
government through the amount of CO2 they release for every kilometre driven. 
The UK’s most popular car, the Ford Fiesta, emits around 120 g/km in its cleanest 
models and 160 g/km in the sportier versions.9 Electric vehicles don’t emit any 
CO2 while driving, but the power system does when producing the electricity 
needed to recharge them.
Britain’s power system has changed dramatically over the last ﬁve years, with 
carbon emissions halving and the share of coal generation falling from 36% to 
just 3%. One kWh of electricity in Britain is now contains 204 grams10 of CO2, 
less than the carbon released from burning one kWh of petrol. An electric 
vehicle can drive up to four times further on 1 kWh than a petrol or diesel car 
could, because electric motors are so much more efﬁcient. 
The charts above look at three categories of vehicle – small hatchbacks,  
luxury saloons and SUVs, and small commercial vans. Each chart shows how 
the carbon emissions from an electric vehicle have fallen over the past decade, 
and how they are expected to continue falling in the years to come. The charts 
consider changes to the electricity generation mix used for recharging,11 and a 
gradual reduction in emissions from battery manufacture as the electricity mix 
changes in other countries.12
The range in direct emissions from recharging (the dark blue bands) covers 
the main EV models currently on sale in each segment, and variants on each 
model available. The top of each band (highest emissions) shows the least 
efﬁcient EV model, the bottom of each band (lowest emissions) shows the 
most efﬁcient. In the forecast, these bands also include the range of emissions 
factors for electricity production coming from National Grid’s scenarios.
There is a larger range in the estimated whole-lifecycle emissions (the lighter 
blue bands) due to the additional uncertainty in the emissions caused by 
manufacturing 1 kWh of battery capacity, and the range of battery sizes seen 
across EV models. 
Studies have estimated a wide range of emissions, depending on the type of 
battery type, its design, where it is manufactured and how old the study is. 
Current estimates range from 40 up to 200 kg of CO2 emitted per kWh of 
battery capacity.13 We take the average across eight studies and assume 
75–125 kgCO2 per kWh. The true value may be less than this, as end-of-life 
batteries could be recycled,14 or could be repurposed as second-life residential 
or grid storage batteries. It will also reduce in future as the electricity used to 
make batteries is decarbonised, or as more factories switch to 100% renewable 
energy (as has the US Tesla Gigafactory).
9 All values in this report are based on the new WLTP testing method, which aims to represent real-world driving.

agreement targets.

4.  The role of onshore and offshore wind
The UK is the world’s leader in offshore wind, with more capacity installed 
than any other country. However, three-ﬁfths of our wind energy still comes 
from the country’s 900+ onshore wind farms.
The Electric Insights website now shows the split between onshore and offshore 
wind, although the feature is still experimental as the data feed from Elexon  
(who run the electricity market) is intermittent. This new data shows that  
even with the world-leading rise of offshore wind farms, the UK’s onshore wind 
farms are still very much pulling their weight. From 2015 until present, onshore 
wind farms have consistently supplied 55–65% of the country’s wind power.
The UK has over 900 onshore wind farms ranging from 1 up 
to 322 MW in capacity. Together these have nearly 8,000 
individual wind turbines and a capacity of almost 13 GW, 
enough to supply around 10 million homes.
In contrast, there are only 40 offshore wind farms, ranging 
from a single 7 MW turbine in Fife up to the world’s largest 
– the 659 MW Walney Extension off the coast of Cumbria. 
Although there are only 2,000 turbines offshore, they are 
much larger than their onshore neighbours, so the total 
capacity is 8.5 GW, enough to power 6 million houses. For  
a sense of scale, Britain’s offshore wind capacity overtook 
the functioning capacity of the country’s 15 nuclear 
reactors earlier this year.1
Half of the UK’s wind capacity is in England, most of which 
is offshore. Despite having only 8% of the UK’s population 
Scotland has one-third of its wind capacity. Wales and 
Northern Ireland have 4% of the population and a sixth of 
the wind capacity.

Although the nameplate capacity of Britain’s nuclear reactors is 9.5 GW, many of the older reactors have been de-rated as they approach the end of their lives. The national ﬂeet has not produced more than 8 GW 
at any point in the last twelve months.

5.  Capacity and production statistics
This quarter saw new lows for both nuclear and coal 
power plants, and wholesale prices return to 2017 levels.
Nuclear power hit its lowest output levels in over a decade, 
falling by one-ﬁfth on last year to supply just 3.7 GW in mid-
June. Several plants were ofﬂine for their annual summer 
maintenance, but Sizewell B suffered an unexpected 
ammonia leak, and Hunterston B was unable to come back 
online after further cracks were discovered in its reactor 
core. A third of the country’s nuclear ﬂeet remained ofﬂine 
for the entire three months of Q2.
Coal supplied the smallest share of any generating 
technology, behind even run-of-river hydro plants, which 
rarely supply more than one percent of Britain’s electricity.1
Wind output was one-ﬁfth higher than this quarter last 
year, boosted by the offshore ﬂeet. Similarly, imports 
and exports were both up on last year as the new link to 
Belgium continues to push up import dependency.
Wholesale power prices fell back to below £40/MWh for  
the ﬁrst time in two years as gas prices fell by a third. 
Ofgem reacted by lowering the cap on retail power bills by 
£75 per year for a typical household.

About 60% of Britain’s hydro plants are connected to the national grid and reported on here, another 800 MW is ‘embedded’ and thus invisible to us.
2 
Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of waste-to-energy plants.  
These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.
3 
We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market operator. Britain’s storage capacity is made up of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage,  
0.6 GW of lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of ﬂywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.

6. Power system records
The last three months have seen another 24 records broken by Britain’s 
power system. We saw the ﬁrst ever day with a carbon intensity below 100 g/
kWh, the share of fossil fuels fell below 10% for the ﬁrst time ever, and demand 
for electricity fell to its lowest level in 25 years.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2019) and report the 
record output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages 
over a day, a month and a calendar year.1 Cells highlighted in blue are records 
that were broken in the second quarter of 2019. Each number links to the date 
it occurred on the Electric Insights website, allowing these records to be 
explored visually.
As reported in Article 2, renewables supplied more than half of electricity for a 
whole day for the ﬁrst time, providing 55.3% of Britain’s electricity on June 30th.  
This beat the previous record of 49.4% set last autumn. Peak output from 
renewables also edged up from 22.4 to 22.7 GW, boosted by a new record for 
solar panel output.

Nuclear output fell to its lowest levels in a decade. Monthly average output 
fell to 4.4 GW in June, down from a previous low of 5.2 GW set back in 2014. 
Both instantaneous and daily-average output fell below 4 GW for the ﬁrst time 
since records began.
Coal also had its worst ever month, averaging just 28 MW output in May, from 
over 10,000 MW installed. This is a fall of three-quarters on the previous lows 
seen last summer. Coal supplied just 0.1% of Britain’s electricity during May.

Fossil fuels supplied less than 10% of Britain’s electricity for the ﬁrst time ever, 
falling to a 9.5% share in the afternoon of May 26th. The lowest ever one-day 
average share of fossil fuels also fell by nearly four percentage points to 15.4% 
on the same day.

Imports and exports continued to break previous records after the Nemo 
link to Belgium opened. Britain got closer to having imported a ﬁfth of its 
electricity demand overnight on May 18th.
Britain had its ﬁrst ever day with a carbon intensity below 100 g/kWh.  
June 30th averaged 97 g/kWh, down from the previous record of 104 g/kWh 
set last summer. June also saw the lowest monthly demand for 25 years,  
at 29.4 GW. The lowest value seen in recent times was 29.6 GW back in 
August 2017.
