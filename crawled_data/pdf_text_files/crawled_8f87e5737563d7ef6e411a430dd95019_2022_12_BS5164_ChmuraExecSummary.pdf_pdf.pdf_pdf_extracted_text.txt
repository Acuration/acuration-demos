Introduction
Drax is the global leader in the production, generation, and supply of renewable 
power from sustainably sourced biomass materials, and a pioneer in carbon removal 
technology. Its purpose is to enable a zero-carbon and lower-cost energy future. 
Drax’s global portfolio of operations includes wood pellet production, power 
generation and carbon removal.
To meet the growing global demand for 
bioenergy as the world tackles the climate crisis 
and strives to meet net zero, Drax is transforming 
into a truly international business. Drax now 
has 17 operational and in-development pellet 
production sites across North America, including 
7 pellet plants in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas 
and Louisiana. 
Drax wood pellet plants in the U.S. purchase 
64% of wood fiber on average from within their 
respective states.
Drax is committed to be a positive force in every 
region that it operates. To estimate the economic 
and fiscal impact of its operations across the 
U.S. Southeast, Drax commissioned Chmura 
Economics & Analytics (Chmura) – a trusted 
provider of economic data and analysis – to 
conduct a study. Chmura conducted this study  
in 2022 and concluded as follows:
Overall, operations of Drax facilities generates  
significant economic impact in Alabama, Mississippi,  
Arkansas, and Louisiana. 
Using 2023 as a benchmark, operations of all Drax facilities are 
estimated to have annual economic impacts of $1.036 billion in total 
spending, and $434.9 million value added to GDP in the four states.
Between 2013 and 2022, Drax invested $884.1mn in the  
four states, developing wood pellet plants, a port facility,  
and a corporate office.
In total, the capital expenditure for all Drax facilities is estimated  
to have cumulative impacts of $368.5 million in spending, and 
$184.7 million in GDP in the four states from 2013 to 2022.
2023-2030: The cumulative economic impact of Drax facilities  
is estimated to be $8.3bn in total spending and $3.4bn in GDP  
to the four states.

Arkansas data shows a lower economic impact 
than the other three states as construction on 
the facility only finished in 2022 and at this time 
there is no data backing up the economic impact. 
This explains the disparity between the spending 
and GDP figures of Arkansas and the other  
three states.

Impact of two hypothetical plants 
Drax is considering future expansion in the 
United States and asked Chmura to estimate 
impacts of future growth. If Drax were to 
establish additional pellet plants in or near these 
four Southeastern states, it is expected that 
there would be similar state and local economic 
benefits. The precise economic impact of 
additional facilities would vary, as both the 
project scale and the economic condition of  
the host regions would need to be considered.
To further illustrate the potential impact of 
further Drax expansions, Chmura considered  
two expansion scenarios (Figure 1.1). If Drax 
were to develop a new pellet plant with an 
annual output of 300,000 metric tonnes of wood 
pellet product, this plant would generate annual 
economic impacts of $114.4 million in spending 
and $45.4 million GDP. In the second scenario,  
if the new plant has an annual production 
capacity of 500,000 metric tonnes of wood 
pellet product, it is estimated that the plant 
would generate annual economic impacts of 
$190.7 million in spending and $75.7 million  
GDP in the state it is located.

Forestry impact from Drax operations
State and local forestry industries will benefit 
from the operations of Drax’s wood pellet 
manufacturing plants. The main input in wood 
pellet production is wood fiber, which is a by-
product of both sustainable forest management 
and the manufacture of solid wood products. 
•  Data from Drax show that wood pellet plants 
purchase 64% of wood fiber within their 
respective states, on average. 
•  The projection for 2023 is that $76.1 million  
in wood fiber will be purchased from the 
forestry sector in Alabama, Mississippi, 
Arkansas, and Louisiana.

Criteria and analysis
Chmura Methodology
For the port facility, corporate headquarters, 
and pellet manufacturing plants, the economic 
impact typically comes from two sources: 
Fig 2.1: Impact Analysis Framework
Ripple effects also include benefits to regional 
businesses where employees of the industrial 
pellet industry spend their income—termed 
induced impact. 
Direct impacts are estimated by Chmura with 
information provided by Drax, while the indirect 
and induced impacts are estimated using 
IMPLAN modelling software. 
Chmura analysed the impact for each facility 
at the county/parish and state levels and also 
provided the aggregate impact of all Drax 
facilities. In addition to the IMPLAN model 
estimate, Chmura took a more rigorous approach 
to provide a detailed estimate of the indirect 
impacts for the forestry and transportation 
sectors. Chmura’s approach utilized data from 
Drax related to each manufacturing plant’s fiber 
sources and modes of transportation (truck, rail, 
or barge) to estimate the benefits to regional  
and state forestry and transportation industries. 
Since Drax acquired and developed the facilities 
over many years, Chmura used the following 
criteria to evaluate the economic impact for  
each facility: 
•  For capital expenditure, Chmura analysed  
its impact for the actual year it occurred. 
•  Chmura analysed the operational impact 
of facility operations for 2023, since the 
construction of one facility in Alabama will not 
be completed until 2022. As a result, 2023 will 
be the first full year that all Drax facilities are 
operating. Analysing the operational impact 
starting in 2023 allowed Chmura to aggregate 
the operational impact of all Drax facilities. 
The economic impact in future years should 
be similar to 2023, provided there are no 
expansions or new construction. 
Finally, this study estimates the fiscal benefit 
of all Drax facilities to the state and local 
governments. Both capital expenditure and 
ongoing operations can generate tax revenue. 
Since each state has its own tax regulations 
concerning the facilities, Chmura conducted 
research on applicable tax laws and estimated 
the revenue Drax contributes to local and  
state governments.

Direct impact:
Capital Expenditure
Ongoing Operations
Source: Chmura 
•  One-time economic impact of capital 
expenditure. Over the years, Drax has invested 
hundreds of millions of dollars to construct, 
renovate, and improve its facilities. These 
capital expenditures generate significant 
economic impacts in their localities. 
•  Economic impact of ongoing operations.  
This is the sustained economic impact that  
will recur each year. Drax employs workers  
that contribute to local and state economies  
in the Southeast. 
The two components outlined above constitute 
the direct economic impact of Drax’s facilities 
in the Southeastern United States. The total 
economic impact also includes economic 
ripple effects from the direct impact. Ripple 
effects, categorized as indirect and induced, 
measure secondary benefits generated by the 
facilities. For example, to produce industrial 
pellets for export, a manufacturing plant will 
purchase biomass materials from regional 
logging industries. These facilities also utilize 
transportation such as trucks, barges, or railroads 
to ship biomass materials to the manufacturing 
facilities and finished pellets to the port. The 
benefits to regional logging and transportation 
businesses comprise the indirect impact.
