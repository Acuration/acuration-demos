1.  Headlines
This quarter we discuss two technologies with very different fortunes. 
Offshore wind has been dealt a significant boost after government reaffirmed 
its commitment to an upgraded target of 40 gigawatts (GW) installed by 
the end of this decade. Our first article examines the announcement, and 
the claim that this would make “the UK to wind as Saudi Arabia is to oil”. 
Our second article looks at the challenge of trying to balance the electricity 
system with such a lot of renewables.
The story could not be more different for Britain’s nuclear fleet. Output fell to just 
8% of electricity supplied, quite possibly its lowest share in four decades. Most of 
the country’s reactors were offline for maintenance, but even so, National Grid 
had to pay Sizewell B to reduce its output to maintain system stability.
Our fourth article provides an update to the low-carbon electricity league 
table, first produced three years ago. Over the last decade, we find the UK has 
decarbonised its power system faster than any other major country. Many 
other countries are also reducing the environmental impact of their electricity 
production, and not necessarily those you would naturally expect.
Focusing on the last quarter, fossil fuels grew to supply 42% of Britain’s 
electricity – their largest share for the time of year since 2016, and the first 
year-on-year growth in a decade. Three gas power stations were mothballed 1 
though after their owner went into administration, as ‘the recent challenges 
facing the UK power market’ meant the were no longer profitable. If they remain 
closed, this would reduce Britain’s gas power station capacity by 8% (2.2 GW).
This happened despite power prices recovering from recent lows in Quarter 2,  
returning to their 2019 levels. September saw a large price spike due to 
very low margins (the amount of capacity declaring itself available being 
uncomfortably close to forecast demand).

Two stations (Sutton Bridge and Severn Power Station) have gone into a long-term dormant preservation state. A third station (Baglan Bay) was described in news reports as being unaffected, but has declared itself 
unavailable to the power market for the rest of this year, implying that it may follow suit.

2.  The Saudi Arabia of wind power?
On October 6th, the Prime Minister reaffirmed strong commitments to 
offshore wind. While this could cement the UK’s world leading position,  
it alone does not make us “the Saudi Arabia of wind power” as was  
widely reported.
There were four key takeaways from the PM’s speech:
There’s a mix of new and existing information in there.  
The 40 GW target was part of the 2019 Conservative election 
manifesto, and industry has been working towards the 
target for a while. Regardless, reaffirmation from the top is 
welcomed. The new target is pushing close to the upper bound 
of National Grid’s most ambitious scenario for deployment, 
and requires us to install three times more capacity per year 
throughout the 2020s than was achieved in the 2010s.
The rest is new information. The 1 GW target for floating 
offshore wind is the first sign of a clear ambition from 
government on this burgeoning technology and has been 
welcomed by industry. Floating wind turbines could 
significantly expand the UK’s offshore wind generation, 
with the IEA estimating that more than half of the UK’s 
offshore wind resource exists at depths of more than  
120 metres, and a fifth at depths more than 800 metres.
The £160m for upgrading local infrastructure is key to 
scaling up the offshore wind industry allowing larger 
turbines to be constructed and deployed at a faster rate. 
The final announcement has the potential to align UK 
renewables deployment with a net zero consistent pathway 
for the first time, but we await further clarity.

So, what could 40 GW of offshore wind actually do for the UK? Newer turbines 
will sport larger blades and taller towers, and so will offer higher capacity 
factors than today’s machines. BEIS assume a capacity factor of 47% for new 
offshore wind farms being built today, up from 40% historically.1 This could 
potentially rise to 57% for new turbines built in 2030, if improvements in blade 
diameter, hub height, turbine design and siting are all realised.
This would mean that by 2030, the UK’s 40 GW of offshore wind would have 
an average capacity factor of 49%, and could produce 170 terrawatt-hours 
(TWh) of electricity per year. That is equal to three-fifths of Britain’s total 
electricity demand, and is easily enough to make good of the PM’s claim to 
have “every household in the UK powered by offshore wind”. By 2030, the 
nation’s 26+ million households are expected to consume in the region of  
100–120 TWh per year, including new demands from electric heating and 
vehicle charging.
But, is that really enough to make us the ‘Saudi Arabia of wind’? Not by itself. 
Saudi oil fields produce around 10 million barrels a day, or around a tenth of 
the world’s oil demand. This translates to 6,000 TWh per year, meaning it 
takes just ten days to produce 170 TWh.
If the UK wanted comparable energy dominance to Saudi Arabia it would 
need to build over 1,400 GW of offshore wind. While that is a massive leap 
from current plans, it lies within the theoretical potential of the UK’s 300,000 
square miles of waters. The IEA report that the best sites could hold up to 
1,900 GW of capacity, giving a technical potential of 9,000 TWh per year – 
enough to power the whole of Europe three times over.
The UK has favourable circumstances for offshore wind deployment – with 
shallow waters, high wind speeds and significant deep offshore infrastructure 
expertise. While exploiting the whole of this resource is of course a long 
way off, it must be remembered that Saudi Arabia had nearly a century of oil 
field development to get to where it is today, whereas the UK’s offshore wind 
industry only took off ten years ago. Where it could be in another 90 years 
leaves ample room for imagination.

We model the 2030 situation by combining annual generation by technology from National Grid’s ‘Leading the Way’ scenario with hourly capacity factors for the future wind and solar fleets from Renewables.ninja.  
By 2030, National Grid expects that onshore wind and solar PV capacity will also have grown by 75%, and together will produce 60 TWh per year (compared to 170 TWh from offshore wind). While this will make balancing 
harder, they expect nuclear output will have fallen by one third due to the ageing fleet, which will make balancing easier. The actual situation in 2030 will be complicated further by changing demand patterns due to 
uptake of electric heating and vehicles. 
3.  How to handle 40 GW of wind?
Headline annual figures mask the huge variation in wind output that will be 
experienced in future. Day-to-day management of Britain’s power system will 
be very different with double our current wind capacity. The charts below show 
the daily generation mix over the course of a year, both as it happened in 2019, 
and how it would look with 2030’s generation mix.
National Grid ESO is comfortable managing the current levels of fluctuation in 
electricity supply and demand. The darker blue area in the top chart shows the amount 
of demand left over to be met after renewables and nuclear, which typically ranges 
from 10 to 30 GW throughout the year. Fast forward just 10 years to a country with 
40 GW of offshore wind and the situation is very different. This range expands all the 
way from 30 GW down to minus 30 GW, meaning nuclear and renewables producing 
substantially more than total national demand. This situation of ‘over-production’ has 
been faced by Denmark for many years, and more recently by Scotland, but these are 
small countries with interconnections to much larger neighbours.
The bumpy ride shown in these charts is the daily average of demand and output – 
the hourly variation is even stronger, but this could more easily be accommodated 
by battery storage, pumped hydro and electric vehicles. The variations seen over 
multiple days of high or low winds will test the system further though.

scenario for 2030 might look like 1 (with 40 GW of offshore wind), highlighting days with excess generation.

The charts below show the situation in more detail, zooming in on three 
specific weeks which would challenge the limits of system operation. On the 
left is a particularly windy and sunny week, where intermittent renewables and 
nuclear produce 55% more than demand. In the middle is a calm week, where 
a third of electricity demand has to come from other sources. On the right, 
nuclear, wind and solar provide almost the entire demand averaged over the 
week, but their share ranges from just 30% of demand to over 200% in specific 
hours. Synchronous generators (in darker blue) must flex up and down by over 
30 GW in the space of just 8 hours.
Taken across the whole of 2030, 34 TWh of electricity needs to be generated 
from non-renewable sources to satisfy the residual electricity demand. At other 
times, there is 37 TWh of excess electricity production that can be used for other 
applications. So, what could be done to balance out this surplus and shortfall? 
Britain could export its excess wind to neighbouring countries. Interconnection 
capacity is expected to expand rapidly over the coming decade, perhaps tripling 
to over 15 GW if all potential projects are built. That said, weather patterns 
are much larger than the British Isles, so if it is windy here, it is typically windy 
across most of Northern Europe. In the hours when Britain’s wind farms operate 
at over 80% capacity factor, those in France, Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium 
are typically in the range of 50–85%. When British farms deliver under 20% 
capacity factors, the neighbouring countries’ farms average just 6–20%. 
Storage is another option, but it would need to have very long duration to cope 
with entire weeks of excess or shortfall (shown above). Britain’s pumped hydro 
stations offer about 8–24 hours of storage, while battery storage systems can 
handle only 1–4 hours. With several days of surplus or shortfall, we find a total 
of 28 TWh of storage would be needed to capture all of that excess. This is 
around 1,000 times the current electricity storage capacity available in Britain, 
but it is comparable to the total natural gas storage the UK has in the form of 
underground salt caverns.

Perhaps some of these wind farms should produce something other than 
electricity. Electrolysers can be used to turn electricity and water into 
hydrogen. The excess electricity production in 2030 could be used to make 
670 million kg of hydrogen. That would be enough to fill 133 million fuel tanks 
in fuel cell vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai, or to heat nearly 2 million homes.
Some could make hydrogen directly out at sea by using their electricity to 
split water. Especially as farms move further from shore, grid connections 
can contribute up to one-third of the total cost. Hydrogen could potentially 
be hauled to shore at lower cost, piggy backing off the existing oil and 
gas pipelines, which will see limited use as the North Sea fields start to 
wind down. Hydrogen production from just 4 GW of offshore farms could 
potentially feed one million homes with zero carbon heat – or supply the high-
temperature heat needed for to decarbonise British industry. 
The large-scale adoption of hydrogen will require changes by energy users, 
not to mention a nationwide transmission and distribution system. The cost 
of electrolysers will affect its economics, particularly given that they won’t be 
able to run full-time. Offshore plants can only run when it is windy, while grid-
connected electrolysers will need to turn down as the price of electricity rises 
on low-wind days. But these are challenges that might be overcome. Simply 
plugging massive numbers of wind farms into the existing grid and hoping for 
the best is much less likely to be a successful approach.

Britain’s nuclear power production fell to what is perhaps its lowest level in 
40 years. The country’s reactor fleet have typically produced 6–8 GW over 
the past decade, but on August 23rd output fell to just 2.49 GW – less than the 
combined capacity of the original Magnox fleet built in the 1960s. 
The chart below shows the nuclear output during 2020 compared to the 
range seen over the past decade. The low of 2.49 GW happened on a Sunday 
afternoon when demand was low, yet nuclear still fell to just 8% of electricity 
production – it’s lowest since records began. 
4.  Nuclear outages cause output to slump
Over the past decade the country’s last four Magnox reactors (at Oldbury 
and Wylfa) have shut down. The remaining fleet of 15 reactors is moving 
towards the end of their working lives, with most aged 30 to 45 years old. 
There are many reasons why nuclear output would be dwindling: outages for 
maintenance and repair are a key factor, but system stability and the ongoing 
coronavirus response also play a part.
Dungeness B has been on a long shutdown since late 2018, and is expected to 
restart at the end of this year after two years of maintenance. The country’s 
oldest reactors, Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B, are both on planned 
outages for inspection, after hundreds of cracks were found in their graphite 
cores. At the same time, Sizewell B plus one reactor at Hartlepool A, Heysham 
A and Torness were all offline for various reasons, leaving only one station 
(Heysham B) operating close to full capacity.

The chart below shows the reactor outages seen over 2020. On August 23rd, 
close to three quarters of our nuclear reactor fleet was out of action.
Nuclear power output can also be limited by grid requirements. National 
Grid issues instructions to turn generators off or on to maintain system 
stability. One of their concerns comes when the system becomes low on 
‘system inertia’, meaning that the frequency of the electricity supplied can 
change rapidly if a generator is suddenly lost. This poses a threat to keeping 
system frequency close to 50 Hz, and can force emergency measures such as 
disconnecting consumers, as happened during the blackout of August 2019.
Sizewell B is Britain’s largest generating unit, and so represents the largest 
‘loss of infeed’ risk. If it suddenly disconnected, up to 1,320 MW of capacity 
would be lost.2 Normally it is perfectly safe for the rest of the system to 
accommodate this loss, but with COVID restrictions expected to keep 
electricity demand lower than usual, fewer conventional power stations 
(coal, gas or biomass) would be available to counter such a failure. National 
Grid sought the permission to turn Sizewell B down to half its normal output, 
meaning the largest potential loss was instead the French interconnector at 
1,000 MW. Sizewell lowered its output between May and September, and was 
paid £73 million by National Grid in compensation. This in turn wrought havoc 
with wholesale electricity prices, as by the time we got to the end of August, 
lockdowns had eased around the country and demand was back to within 1% of 
historical levels. On September 15th, National Grid ESO had to issue a capacity 
market notice because not enough generation was expected to be available 
to meet demand, even though Sizewell B was still being paid to remain offline.
The current COVID situation provides a petri-dish for looking at the future 
of our energy system, and it shows that having more flexible and price-
responsive units will be essential to balancing out the increasing volatility of 
both electricity supply and demand.

Once Hinkley Point C opens, it will become the largest generator in the country, raising the loss of infeed risk to 1,630 MW, making the job of balancing the power system more challenging.

A lot can change in a decade. Around the world, coal is being pushed out 
of major power systems by renewables, but who has been successful at 
decarbonising their electricity? We rank the world’s 30 largest electricity 
systems by the carbon content of their generation mix, and explore the 
changes that occurred over the last ten years. We find that the UK has 
decarbonised its electricity system at almost twice the pace of any other 
major economy by growing renewables six-fold and slashing the use of coal.
There is a huge variation in how much carbon is emitted 
when generating one kWh of electricity around the world.  
It ranges from just 13 grams of CO2 in Norway up to  
880 grams in South Africa. The cleanest countries at the 
top of the league table – Scandinavia, France, Brazil and 
Canada – all have large hydropower resources or a sizeable 
share of nuclear power.
Not everywhere has the same natural resources or historic 
infrastructure, so it matters how fast emissions are falling. 
The chart above shows the change in emissions intensity 
between 2010 and 2019.
Of the thirty largest electricity consumers (all over 100 TWh 
per year), the UK has decarbonised faster than anywhere 
else over the last decade. The UK’s carbon intensity fell 
from 450 to 195 g/kWh, a drop of 58%. British households 
are emitting three quarters of a tonne of CO2 less per year 
just from changes in the power system alone.1 
This is double the reduction seen in the other major 
economies. Great progress has also been made in the USA, 
Germany, Australia and China, where carbon intensities 
have fallen by 120–150 g/kWh over the past decade.

A typical house consuming 2,900 kWh per year would save 777 kgCO2 per year. Houses with electric heating would typically save more than a tonne (1,125 kg) of CO2 per year, based on average consumption of

These are not the places that many would associate with world-leading 
shifts towards clean energy – as the soundbites of China building a coal power 
station every week, or ”Trump digs coal” live long in the memory. But, these 
countries embody the two big macro trends going on in electricity generation: 
the shrinking role for coal, and growing share of renewables.
The chart below highlights the changes seen in these two areas. The 
countries which have done most to clean up their electricity generation sit 
in the top left. Across the five highlighted countries, their electricity mix has 
shifted from around two-thirds to one-half coming from coal over this period 
(a 15 percentage points fall), and their share of renewables doubled from an 
eighth to a quarter (12 percentage points gain). The UK stands out in front, 
with coal falling from 30% to just 2%, and renewables increase from 8% to 42%.
It is crucial that the coming decade sees most countries follow this path. It is 
five years since the Paris Agreement was adopted by almost 200 countries, 
and while much has improved since then, global carbon emissions have 
continued to rise. Power systems provide one of the cheapest and most 
effective ways to reverse this trend, and the UK offers the world an example 
of how fast the transition can be made.

6.  Capacity and production statistics
Outages and the ongoing COVID response have taken their toll on Britain’s 
nuclear output, which fell by almost a fifth from the same three months of 
last year. Lower power prices in Britain also meant we imported a quarter 
less electricity from abroad compared to this time last year. Exports were 
also up by a third, redressing somewhat the record-breaking trade deficit 
seen last year.
The gap left by falling nuclear and imports was filled by offshore wind and 
natural gas. Offshore wind output and installed capacity both grew by a sixth 
over the past year, with a further 1.5 GW of new capacity coming online. Gas 
output was up slightly on this time last year, giving rise to the first year-on-
year increase in the fossil-fuelled share of electricity generation since 2010.

Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of waste-to-energy plants.  
These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market operator. Britain’s storage capacity is made up of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage,  
0.6 GW of lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of flywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.

7.  Power system records
Last quarter saw 11 power system records broken out of the 200+ we follow, 
compared to 38 in the second quarter of 2020. While it was relatively quiet, 
it was a period of contrasting extremes. Natural gas and wind power reached 
all-time highs, while nuclear power fell to the lowest levels on record.
Gas power stations broke the record they set only in June by supplying over 
72% of electricity demand in the early hours of August 27th. Just a week earlier 
it was Britain’s renewables were doing the exact same thing, coincidentally by 
also supplying over 72% of demand for the first time. 
Around the same time, Britain’s wind farms supplied more than 60% of the 
country’s electricity for the first time, and more than half of electricity 
demand over an entire day. Nuclear output fell to a series of new lows,  
with the lowest instantaneous, daily and monthly averaged output since 
records began.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2020) and report the 
record output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages 
over a day, a month and a calendar year.1 Cells highlighted in blue are records 
that were broken in the third quarter of 2020. Each number links to the date 
it occurred on the Electric Insights website, allowing these records to be 
explored visually.

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants. 
The operation of battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not publicly available.
