Interim Management Statement 
 
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 January 2013

Trading Performance and Positions Under Contract for 2013, 2014 and 2015 
Trading conditions in the markets in which we operate have been good so far this year. We 
have strengthened our contracted position, including additional power sales of 3.3TWh for 
2014 compared to the position reported in our preliminary results announcement in February.

Notes to Positions Under Contract: 
(1) Fixed price power sales include approximately 0.8TWh supplied to Centrica in the period 1 January 2013 to 1 
May 2013 under the five year 300MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
 
(2) Fixed margin and structured power sales include approximately 1.8TWh in 2013, 2.6TWh in 2014 and 
1.9TWh in 2015 in connection with the above contract. Under this contract the Group will supply power on 
terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices, and delivering matching CO2 
emissions allowances amounting in aggregate to approximately 2.4 million tonnes in each of 2013 and 2014 
and 1.8 million tonnes in 2015. The contract provides the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green spreads 
agreed in October 2009. 
 
We will next update the market on the Group’s positions under contract on 30 July 2013, 
when we announce our half year results for the six months ending 30 June 2013.    
 
Biomass Transformation 
First Unit Conversion 
We have made encouraging progress with our project to transform Drax into an electricity 
generator fuelled predominantly by sustainable biomass. As anticipated, at the beginning of 
April our first converted unit was brought safely into service burning biomass in place of coal. 
The unit is currently going through a phased commissioning process. We have been pleased 
with the results so far, which have met our expectations, and we remain confident that 
performance will be in line with the operational guidance previously provided. 
 
 
 
U.S. Pellet Plants 
We are also pleased to report that we have now concluded the contractual arrangements for 
the two U.S. Gulf Coast based pellet plants previously announced. Capital costs are in line 
with our plans and construction is expected to begin in the summer as anticipated. We 
continue to target winter 2014/15 for the commencement of commercial operations in these 
facilities, with full capacity reached approximately six months later. 
 
Financing 
On 24 April 2013 we announced that we had agreed a £75 million amortising loan facility 
maturing in June 2018 with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury 
issued under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaces £50 million of the £100 
million amortising loan facility agreed with the UK Green Investment Bank, which was signed 
in December 2012. 
 
The new loan facility enhances the financing structure executed last year by providing 
additional liquidity to the Group, securing HM Treasury support for our plans and ensuring a 
smoother profile of debt maturities across the structure. Furthermore, the all-in cost of the 
new facility is very competitive. 
 
Other Matters 
Other than as described above, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any 
material change in the underlying financial position of the Group during the period, and our 
expectations for the full year remain unchanged.
