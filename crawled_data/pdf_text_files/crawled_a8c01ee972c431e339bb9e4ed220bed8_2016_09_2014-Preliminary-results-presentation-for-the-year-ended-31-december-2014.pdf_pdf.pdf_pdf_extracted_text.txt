Drax Power – Markets and Trading 
Market developments 
Commodity outlook challenging 
•
Falling oil prices 
•
Mild winter across Europe 
- Weak gas market, high gas storage 
- Weak power markets 
•
International coal remains weak 
•
Lower 2014/15 ROC prices  
- Recycle fee pressure

Drax Power – Fuel 
Coal 
Change in coal profile 
•
Decrease in UK coal 
•
Increase in international (low nitrogen) coal 
Biomass 
Good progress with near-term biomass volumes 
•
> 6Mt contracted for 2015/16 ROC year 
•
Disruption in EU demand continues to assist with  
near-term volumes 
Lower volumes contracted from 2016/17 
•
Biomass unit load factors dependent on successful 
commissioning at new third party pellet plants 
•
Early CfD would underpin acceleration 
Biomass cost management 
•
Priority on securing long-term contracts with                 
fixed price formulae 
- Rolling hedges for oil, fx and freight (forecast volumes)

Drax Power – Fuel: Forestry Economics 
 
Drax Group plc 
Drax biomass sourced from established 
commercial forests 
•
Primary economic driver is sawlog 
- Cost too high for use in biomass generation 
•
Biomass generation uses low grade wood 
- Forest sourced thinnings, branches, tops  
and other low grade wood 
- Sawdust and chips 
•
Demand for pulpwood is in decline  
in many regions, especially US South 
•
Growing wood pellet sector is complementary to 
other forest products 
•
Pellet demand helps underpin forestry 
economics 
Large dimension  
e.g. Large sawlog 
Small dimension  
e.g. Pulpwood 
(Low grade wood) 
Branches and tops 
(Low grade wood) 
Stumpage = value of standing timber                          
c.2.2 short tons of low grade wood = 1 metric tonne of pellets

Drax fuel supply 
•
All wood pellets manufactured from low

•
Major carbon savings > 80% vs. coal in 2014 
•
Sourced from sustainably managed forests 
- No depletion of carbon stock 
•
> 80% from North America in 2014 
- Well established commercial forestry industry 
•
Focus on US South 
- Positive growth:drain ratio(3) in key US  
South regions 
- > 100Mt surplus growth over removal in 2012

Benefits of Biomass Conversion 
 
 
Carbon Savings 
•
12Mt pa CO2 is equivalent to removing 3.3m cars 
from the roads or 1,750 new onshore wind turbines(1) 
•
Subsidy cost £50-60/t CO2 from conversion compared 
to £200/t offshore wind(2) 
Dependable electricity 
•
Performance standards of coal – but low carbon 
•
Reliable – not dependent on wind or sun 
•
Flexible – vary output to meet changes in demand  
•
Responsive – synchronised to network needs 
No hidden costs  
•
No need for back up power 
•
No need for new grid connections 
•
No need for additional system stability measures 
 
Differences in Cost:  
Biomass and Offshore Wind in 2020 
System costs for 3 Drax units would be £3bn less 
than equivalent offshore wind generation in 2020

API2/4/6 
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on 
board (“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered 
FOB to Newcastle, Australia. 
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE 
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges). 
BM 
BALANCING MECHANISM 
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the 
system minute by minute. 
CESP 
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME 
CESP was created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It required gas and 
electricity suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers 
in specific low income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 2009.  The CESP 
obligation period ran from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.

OPTED-IN / OPTED-OUT 
An opted-in plant is a power station that has elected to comply with the LCPD emissions standards. 
Opted-out plant has not elected to comply and is therefore only permitted to run for 20,000 hours and 
must in any event close by the end of 2015.

The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of 
the electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable 
energy sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation 
dependant on date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.

•
Lower oil prices filtering through to lower gas 
contracts with an oil-indexation element 
LNG prices under pressure  
•
Spread between Asia and Europe narrowing 
•
Europe has become more competitive, resulting in
