CHAIR’S STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
In 2018 we made good progress with 
the strategy we first announced in 
December 2016.
The strategy is to focus on our flexible, 
low carbon and renewable generation, 
combined with a customer-focused 
approach to energy supply. The Group 
aims to deliver higher quality earnings, 
a reduction in commodity exposure and 
opportunities for growth aligned with the 
country’s ambitious low carbon energy 
needs. I expect the Group to be at the 
centre of this change and to work in 
partnership with Government to help 
the UK meet its energy objectives.
In December 2018 we completed the 
acquisition of a portfolio of pumped 
storage, hydro and gas generation assets 
from ScottishPower, following shareholder 
approval at the General Meeting held on 
21 December 2018. These assets are highly 
complementary to our strategy, and will 
form a very important part of our portfolio. 
Operationally, the Power Generation 
business managed a major unplanned 
generator outage in early 2018, as well as 
an unrelated outage in December 2017 
due to a fire at our rail unloading facility. 
Both outages restricted biomass 
generation in early 2018. We have learned 
important lessons from these events 
as we continuously strive for improved 
safety and operational performance. 
INVESTMENT CASE
1  Critical to 
decarbonisation of the 
UK’s energy system 
and a major source of 
flexible, low carbon and 
renewable power from a 
nationwide portfolio of 
generation technologies
2  Underlying growth in 
the core business and 
attractive investment 
opportunities
3  Increasing earnings 
visibility, reducing 
commodity exposure
4  Strong financial position 
and clear capital 
allocation plan
Notwithstanding these events we 
continued to provide a significant 
amount of the UK’s renewable power and 
completed the conversion of a fourth 
unit from coal to biomass – on schedule 
and budget.
We have continued to develop options 
for gas generation at four sites around the 
UK as well as the option for coal-to-gas 
repowering at Drax Power Station. These 
options could provide new sources of 
flexible generation and support the UK’s 
decarbonisation targets while delivering 
attractive returns to our shareholders, 
subject to the right long-term support 
mechanism being in place.
Good quality, sustainable, low cost 
biomass is central to our business and, 
in Pellet Production, we successfully 
commissioned our third pellet plant – 
LaSalle Bioenergy – ahead of schedule 
and on budget. We also relocated our US 
administration to Monroe, Louisiana to 
bring increased focus and efficiency to our 
business. Although pellet quality improved 
in 2018 it was below the level we targeted 
and we are focused on delivering further 
improvements during 2019.
In B2B Energy Supply we have increased 
customer meters and margin, although the 
market for many of our customers remains 
challenging. This has contributed to 
an increase in bad debt provisioning.
Our flexible, low carbon 
and renewable approach 
is delivering high quality 
earnings and further 
opportunities for growth.”

RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 of £250 million 
grew by 9% compared to 2017 (£229 million). 
This reflects high levels of renewable 
power generation from sustainable 
biomass as well as Adjusted EBITDA 
growth in our Pellet Production business.
At the 2018 half year results we confirmed 
an interim dividend of £22 million 
(5.6 pence per share) representing 40% 
of the full year expected dividend of 
£56 million (14.1 pence per share) 
(2017: £50 million, 12.3 pence per share). 
Accordingly, the Board proposes to pay 
a final dividend in respect of 2018 of 
£34 million, equivalent to 8.5 pence 
per share. This represents a 12% increase 
on 2017 and is consistent with our policy 
to pay a dividend which is sustainable 
and expected to grow as the strategy 
delivers an increasing proportion of 
stable earnings and cash flows. 
The Group has a clear capital allocation 
policy which it has applied throughout 
2018. In determining the rate of growth 
in dividends from one year to the next the 
Board will take account of contracted cash 
flows, the less predictable cash flows from 
the Group’s commodity based business 
and future investment opportunities. 
If there is a build-up of capital, the Board 
will consider the most appropriate 
mechanism to return this to shareholders.
Reflecting this approach to capital 
allocation, in February 2018 the Group 
announced a £50 million share buy-back 
programme, which was successfully 
completed in January 2019.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In January 2018 Will Gardiner, who was 
previously Group Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), became Group Chief Executive 
Officer, succeeding Dorothy Thompson 
CBE. His appointment followed a thorough 
review of internal and external candidates 
and was a natural progression after 
two years working alongside Dorothy 
developing a strategy which I am 
confident will continue to create 
significant benefits for all stakeholders.
We are also delighted to welcome Andy 
Skelton to the Board as CFO from January 
2019. Andy is a highly experienced CFO 
having previously served as CFO at Fidessa. 
I extend my thanks to Den Jones who did 
an excellent job as Interim CFO, supporting 
the delivery of the strategy and the 
acquisition of the ScottishPower assets. 
Den will remain with the Group until May 
2019 to support the integration process.
Drax remains committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. The 
Board and its committees play an active 
role in guiding the Company and leading its 
strategy. We greatly value the contribution 
made by our Non-Executive Directors and 
during a time of transition their role 
remains especially important.
During 2018, as part of our structured 
succession planning, we welcomed two 
new Non-Executive Directors to the Board. 
Nicola Hodson has valuable experience in 
technology, business transformation and 
energy. Vanessa Simms has over 20 years’ 
experience in senior finance roles, with 
a particular focus on implementing 
strategic change. 
David Lindsell will step down at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in April 2019. David 
has served for ten years and remained on 
the Board during 2018 to assist with the 
onboarding of the new CFO and Chair 
of the Audit Committee. Tony Thorne will 
step down in June 2019 and Tim Cobbold 
will step down in September 2019, each 
having served nine years. Nicola will 
succeed Tony as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and Vanessa will succeed 
David as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
David Nussbaum will take over as our 
Senior Independent Director.
I would like to thank each of David Lindsell, 
Tony and Tim for their very significant 
contributions to the Board and, for David 
and Tony, their invaluable leadership  
of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees respectively.
SUSTAINABILITY
A key part of our approach to corporate 
governance is sustainability. This remains 
at the heart of the Group and part of 
its culture. It covers both biomass 
sustainability and, more broadly, long-term 
sustainability – achieving a positive 
economic, social and environmental 
impact and considering long, medium 
and short-term factors in our stewardship 
of the business.
We measure our performance as part 
of our Group Scorecard, which covers a 
range of matters that we see as crucial to 
the longevity of the Group. We therefore 
use the Scorecard as a key element of our 
Bonus and Long Term Incentive plans.
OUR PEOPLE
Our people – employees and contractors 
– remain a key asset of the business and 
we are all focused on creating a diverse 
and inclusive working environment that is 
both safe and supportive. Employee safety 
is a long-held and central commitment 
of our operational philosophy. While the 
number of incidents we have experienced 
remains low, we need to remain vigilant 
and reduce the number of high potential 
incidents. We remain committed to the 
highest standards of safety and wellbeing 
across the Group. 
I would also like to welcome colleagues 
from ScottishPower. We believe they will 
provide highly complementary expertise 
and a strong cultural fit, to create an 
expanded world-class engineering 
and operations capability.
My sincere thanks to all of my colleagues 
for their ongoing commitment, dedication 
and hard work. 
In concluding, I would like to say that 
the Board remains totally committed to 
the complementary aims of delivering 
sustainable long-term value for the Group, 
supporting the communities in which 
we operate and enabling a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future for the UK.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
STRATEGY
Our purpose is ‘to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future’, and this is the 
basis of our strategy. 
Over time we expect the UK’s power 
system to become increasingly dominated 
by intermittent wind and solar power. 
A smaller, but important, part of our power 
will need to be provided by other forms 
of low carbon generation that is available 
when wind and solar power are not 
available. Our strategy is to meet that 
need and support the UK power system.
Through addressing UK energy needs, 
and those of our customers, our strategy 
is designed to help us deliver long-term 
financial performance across the Group. 
In doing so we are reducing our historic 
exposure to commodity markets and 
delivering higher quality earnings with 
opportunities for growth.
Further growth will come from flexible 
operation of the Group’s expanded 
generation portfolio and the provision of 
system support services as well as growth 
in our Pellet Production and B2B Energy 
Supply businesses. As we integrate 
the ScottishPower assets in 2019 we 
will be reassessing our longer term 
financial targets.
The Group’s commitment to safety remains 
strong and, while the number of overall 
incidents was low, we did have a serious 
injury in one of our pellet plants in the US. 
During 2019 we will be strengthening 
our focus to reduce the number of high 
potential incidents.
SUMMARY OF 2018
We have made good progress with the 
delivery of our strategy during 2018 and 
delivered a Group Scorecard performance 
ahead of target.
Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR), our 
primary safety measure, was 0.22. This 
reflects a strong performance in Power 
Generation but with a significant failing in 
Pellet Production. As always there is more 
we can do in our pursuit of zero incidents, 
and in 2019 we will be redoubling our 
efforts to improve our safety performance.
Adjusted EBITDA, a financial KPI, was 
£250 million, in line with our expectation 
and significantly ahead of 2017. In Power 
Generation the impact of unplanned 
biomass outages in early 2018 restricted 
renewable power output. However, 
a strong team effort, the flexible and 
responsive operation of our coal 
generating units and the conversion 
of a fourth unit to biomass helped to 
mitigate the impact. Pellet Production 
increased output and reduced cost per 
pellet, although challenges remain on 
pellet quality. B2B Energy Supply grew 
its market share and margin per meter, 
but faced a challenging market for 
customers and competitors.
Progressing our strategy and 
supporting the UK’s transition 
to a low carbon economy.”

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
In December 2018 we completed the 
acquisition of a portfolio of assets 
from ScottishPower for an initial net 
consideration of £687 million (based on 
total consideration of £702 million, less 
customary working capital adjustments). 
We expect the portfolio to provide high 
quality earnings and financial returns 
significantly ahead of the Group’s cost 
of capital. Integration of these assets 
will take place during 2019.
During the year we replaced floating debt 
with fixed rate bonds, reducing our overall 
cost of debt and extending the maturity 
profile to further strengthen our already 
strong balance sheet. Net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA was 1.3x at the end of December 
2018, ahead of the forecast contained 
in the Shareholder Circular, dated 
5 December 2018, of around 1.5x for  
the full year. The acquisition consideration 
was paid on 2 January 2019.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Our TRIR in Pellet Production was 0.63, a 
reduction on the previous year (2017: 0.83). 
We had five recordable safety incidents, 
three at our LaSalle plant and two at 
Amite. Morehouse completed the year 
with no incidents. 
Our Pellet Production operations saw 
growth in Adjusted EBITDA and record 
levels of pellets produced, with output of 
1,351kt, up 64% year-on-year. This reflects 
the successful commissioning of our 
third pellet plant, LaSalle, which has now 
achieved full production – ahead of plan – 
as well as consistent production at our 
Amite and Morehouse plants. 
The focus of our activity is the US Gulf 
region – an area with strong commercial 
forestry, and good infrastructure and 
sustainability credentials. Recognising 
the importance of the region, we relocated 
our US administration from Atlanta, 
Georgia to Monroe, Louisiana, providing 
operational savings and supporting our 
focus on delivering good quality 
sustainable pellets at the lowest cost. 
Pellet costs and pellet quality, which we 
measure based on the amount of fines 
(smaller particles of wood pellet material) 
in each cargo, are KPIs for the Group. High 
levels of fines lead to higher levels of dust, 
which can create health and safety risks 
through the supply chain. Year-on-year we 
have seen a significant improvement in 
pellet quality, although we did not achieve 
our target for 2018 and are focused 
on addressing this issue in 2019. 
Increased volumes, operational 
improvements and a continuing focus 
on cost contributed to a year-on-year 
reduction in cost per tonne of 10%. This 
represents good progress, but there are 
more opportunities for cost reduction 
in order to achieve our goal of making 
biomass power generation viable without 
subsidy. We will do this by using a greater 
proportion of the very cheapest wood 
residues and expanding the use of 
sustainably sourced low-cost materials.
Early progress in this regard was the 
signing of a co-location agreement with 
Hunt Forest Products, a sawmill operator, 
which will see them build and operate 
a sawmill next to LaSalle. The agreement 
will enable a greater proportion of lower 
cost sawmill residues to be used, reducing 
transportation and the number of steps in 
the production process, thereby reducing 
the cost. 
We have also built a new rail spur linking 
LaSalle to the regional rail network and 
our port facility at Baton Rouge. This will 
increase transportation efficiency, provide 
economies of scale and reduce both cost 
and carbon footprint.
We continue to evaluate opportunities for 
the acquisition of pellet capacity as well 
as the expansion of our existing sites.
In Power Generation, the unplanned 
biomass unit outages in early 2018 
resulted in reduced generation. Biomass 
availability is a KPI for the Group. Since 
returning to service the units have 
performed well, with high availability 
during the remainder of the year. In 2018 
the availability of our biomass units was 
91%, ahead of target.
Notwithstanding outages our biomass 
units produced 12% of the UK’s renewable 
power – enough to power four million 
homes. This level of renewable generation, 
combined with the flexibility of our 
expanding portfolio, allows the Group to 
support the continued deployment of 
intermittent renewables and the UK’s 
ambitious targets for decarbonisation. 
The protection of both our people and 
our assets is a top priority. The fire 
we experienced in December 2017 
demonstrates the combustible nature of 
biomass and the need for strong controls 
and processes. Throughout the year we 
commenced installation of suppression 
equipment throughout our biomass 
handling plant. These complement our 
existing processes and respond to the 
detection of ingition events in milliseconds.
In August 2018 we completed the 
conversion of a fourth generating unit 
from coal to biomass. This allows us to 
produce a greater amount of renewable 
power at times of high demand, which are 
typically periods of higher carbon intensity. 
In this way we plan to deliver more 
renewable power, while providing system 
support at minimum cost to the consumer. 
The operational experience to date has 
been encouraging. 
In May 2018 we commenced a low-cost 
pilot project looking at the potential for 
Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage 
(BECCS). While at an early stage, the 
scheme is capturing carbon and offers 
the potential for biomass to deliver carbon 
negative generation, which will be required 
if the UK is to achieve its decarbonisation 
targets, further supporting the case for 
biomass generation in the long-term.
Stronger power prices in 2018, reflecting 
colder weather and higher underlying 
global commodity prices, led to an increase 
in the level of coal generation in the latter 
half of the year. However, the market for 
coal generation was challenging and our 
two remaining units increasingly focus on 
short-term power market opportunities, 
rather than baseload power generation.
In 2018 Value from Flexibility (a Scorecard 
measure of the value from flexible power 
generation, support services provided to 
the power network and attractively priced 
coal fuels) was £79 million, in line with plan. 
Given the structural shift in UK generation 
towards intermittent renewables we 
expect greater power price volatility, a 
growing need for system support services 
and increasing value from flexibility. 
Our heritage is coal but our business is 
now flexible, low carbon and renewable 
power. We believe gas generation is 
consistent with supporting the transition 
of the energy system. To that end we are 
making progress with the development of 
options for four 299MW Open Cycle Gas 
Turbine (OCGT) plants and up to 3.6GW of 
 Group Financial Review page 34

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
coal-to-gas repowering at Drax Power 
Station. These projects would require 
support through the Capacity Market 
(once re-established) and if successful in 
a future auction could result in 15-year 
index-linked capacity agreements, 
providing a clear investment signal and 
extending visibility of our contract-based 
earnings through the late 2030s. 
As part of the acquisition of the 
ScottishPower generation assets, the 
Group also acquired a permitted option for 
the development of a 1.8GW Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine at Damhead Creek, Kent.
In B2B Energy Supply, we increased our 
market share by 1%(1). This was a creditable 
performance in what is a competitive 
market, although below target.
The quality of business (a measure of the 
margin from power sales) was below our 
target, reflecting exceptionally cold winter 
weather, the costs associated with 
competitor failure, and a challenging 
market for customers resulting in 
increased bad debt expense and 
provisioning. In the context of the wider 
market this reflects a good performance.
Integration of Opus Energy is progressing 
and we have now consolidated our 
Northampton operations into a single site, 
which we expect to deliver additional 
operational efficiencies and cost savings.
We are making progress in reducing our 
cost to serve against target, which will 
be an important source of competitive 
advantage in the future. We are currently 
progressing the implementation of a new 
technology platform which will provide 
further opportunities for efficient 
operations. Technology has a key role 
in shaping the market and our business 
and we remain alert to opportunities this 
may present.
Digital offerings are a growing feature 
of the market. We believe our investment 
in this area will provide commercial 
opportunities, a reduced cost to service 
and an enhanced customer experience. 
It will also provide scalable data analytics 
and build on the roll-out of smart meters 
to deliver tailored customer propositions. 
The business has a strong renewable 
proposition, with 69% of power sales 
renewable in 2018, a level which we expect 
to increase. Opus Energy also provides a 
route to market for more than 2,000 small 
embedded renewable generation sites. 
POLITICS, REGULATION AND POLICY
Brexit remains a key issue for the UK. 
To date the impact on the Group has been 
limited, with the principal risk being a 
weakening of sterling and the cost of 
biomass which is generally denominated 
in other currencies. Through our use of 
medium-term foreign exchange hedges 
the Group has protected its position out 
to 2022 at rates close to those that we 
saw before the Brexit referendum vote. 
Most of our wood pellets are imported 
from North America and Europe. The 
potential for delays at ports is a challenge, 
but with access to facilities at four UK 
ports and associated freight links, in 
addition to storage throughout our supply 
chain, we have a good degree of resilience 
should delays occur.
In the event of a ‘hard’ Brexit, the UK has 
indicated that it will leave the European 
Energy Union and EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme. This mechanism is an important 
part of the UK’s total carbon price (the 
combined UK Carbon Price Support (CPS) 
and the European Union Emissions Trading 
Scheme – (EU ETS). The Government has 
confirmed that were this to happen the 
UK would increase the carbon tax to  
£34/tonne, compensating for the loss 
of the EU ETS until 2021. CPS has been 
the single most effective instrument in 
reducing the level of carbon emissions in 
power generation and Drax continues to 
support an effective carbon price signal 
for investment in low carbon technology.
CAPACITY MARKET
In November 2018 the Court of Justice 
of the European Union declared that the 
process used by the European Commission 
to approve the UK Capacity Mechanism 
was not valid. Following this decision the 
UK Government suspended capacity 
payments whilst the European 
Commission conducted a formal 
investigation. The European Commission 
is also challenging the Court’s ruling.
The suspension of the Capacity Market 
impacted Group Adjusted EBITDA during 
2018. In Generation we continued to meet 
our obligation and provide capacity but 
did not receive or accrue the revenue 
expected from this activity during the final 
three months of the year. In B2B Energy 
Supply we provided for all costs associated

with the Capacity Market in 2018. Our 
approach was based on continuing to 
include charges in customer bills, with 
cash collected from those customers 
during the period. The cash will be paid to 
Elexon, as the collection agent, and held in 
escrow pending the re-establishment of 
the capacity market for generators, at a 
date yet to be determined during 2019. 
The net impact across the Group in 2018 
was a £7 million loss to Adjusted EBITDA.
The Group assumes £68 million of 
capacity payment revenues in 2019. 
Of this, up to £47 million is derived from 
the ScottishPower assets. As part of the 
acquisition of these assets we agreed a 
compensation mechanism with Iberdrola. 
In the event that capacity payments are 
not received in respect of these assets in 
2019, the mechanism provides, subject to 
gross margin thresholds, up to £26 million 
of payments to Drax. The agreement also 
allows for payments of up to £26 million to 
Iberdrola by Drax, subject to significantly 
higher than expected gross margin. These 
payments, if made, would not form part of 
Adjusted EBITDA for 2019.
 We believe that the Capacity Market is 
an important cornerstone energy policy, 
a cost-effective safeguard for security 
of supply and necessary to underpin 
the development of new generation 
projects, including our own gas projects. 
Our view that the Capacity Market will be 
re-established on the same or similar terms 
is consistent with the position expressed 
by the UK Government. We expect the 
issue to be resolved during 2019 and we 
reflect this in our expectations for the year.
SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY AND 
GOVERNANCE
The health, safety and wellbeing of 
our employees and contractors is vital 
to the success of the Group and remains 
our priority. We believe that a safe and 
sustainable business model is critical to 
the delivery of our strategy and crucial 
for long-term performance. 
We have continued to maintain our 
rigorous and robust approach to biomass 
sustainability, ensuring the wood pellets 
we use are fully compliant with the UK’s 
mandatory sustainability standards. The 
biomass we use to generate renewable 
power provides an 86% carbon emissions 
saving against coal, inclusive of supply 
chain emissions. Our biomass life cycle 
carbon emissions are 131kgCO2-eq/MWh 
of electricity, less than half the UK 
Government’s 285 kgCO2-eq/MWh limit. 
The sustainability credentials of biomass 
have been further reinforced by the EU’s 
Renewable Energy Directive which was 
agreed by both the European Parliament 
and Council in June. This includes 
biomass sustainability criteria which 
should reinforce the credentials of 
sustainable biomass. During the year 
we also became participants of the CDP, 
a global disclosure system to measure 
and manage environmental impacts. 
We reported our performance for the 
climate and forest programmes.
During 2018, we published our second 
statement on the prevention of slavery and 
human trafficking in compliance with the 
UK Modern Slavery Act (2015) and have 
joined the UN Global Compact (UNGC). 
We are committed to promoting the UNGC 
principles on respect for human rights, 
labour rights, the environment and 
anti-corruption.
PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES
Our people are critical to the success of 
the business. Through 2018 we have 
continued the implementation of our 
people strategy focused on driving 
performance and developing and retaining 
talent to deliver the Group’s objectives. 
We have established Group-wide practices, 
including a behaviour framework focused 
on performance and personal development, 
and a Group-wide approach to recognising 
and retaining talent.
We are committed to having a diverse 
and inclusive workforce, where every 
employee has the opportunity to realise 
their potential. As part of this we aim to 
have, by the end of 2020, 40% of senior 
leadership roles held by women.
In March 2018 we published our first 
gender pay gap data. While the data 
showed that our businesses were in line 
with the energy sector overall, it 
highlighted that we still have work to do. 
We continue to make an important 
contribution to the UK economy and to the 
local communities in which we operate. 
According to a study published by Oxford 
Economics in 2018, Drax’s total economic 
impact – including our supply chain and 
the wages our employees and suppliers’ 
employees spend in the wider consumer 
economy – was £1.6 billion, supporting 
17,500 jobs across the UK in 2017.
OUTLOOK
Our focus remains on the delivery of our 
strategy and long-term earnings growth, 
underpinned by safety, sustainability, 
operational excellence and expertise 
in our markets.
In Pellet Production we remain focused 
on the production of good quality pellets 
at the lowest cost, cross-supply chain 
optimisation and identifying low-cost 
options to increase self-supply. 
In Power Generation, 2019 will see the 
integration of the ScottishPower assets 
into our generation business and 
opportunities to operate as a coordinated 
portfolio of flexible, low-carbon and 
renewable generation.
We believe that biomass has an important 
role to play in the UK power market. We 
also believe that existing and new gas 
generation has an important role to play in 
supporting the transition to a zero carbon, 
lower cost, energy future and we continue 
to develop our projects in that area.
In B2B Energy Supply, we are investing 
in digital infrastructure which we believe 
will enable us to continue to grow, offer 
market leading propositions and develop 
our presence in the market for flexible 
demand management and other value-
added services.
We have made good progress with the 
delivery of our strategy and will continue 
to build on this as we progress our targets, 
while playing an important role in our 
markets and enabling a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future for the UK.

MARKET CONTEXT
2018 saw the 10th Anniversary of 
the Climate Change Act (the ‘Act’) which 
has transformed the UK energy market 
and has demonstrated that market 
instruments can drive a cost-effective 
transition of the energy sector in line with 
climate goals. Since the Act became law 
the UK has seen its grid carbon content 
fall by more than 250g CO2/kWh and coal 
generation has fallen by over 75%. 
Despite this progress there is more to do. 
Decarbonisation of power generation, 
transport and heat remains a key driver of 
change across the energy sector. The UK’s 
ambitious targets to reduce carbon 
emissions by 80% of 1990 levels means 
our power sector will almost certainly 
have to be net zero carbon by 2060. 
Decarbonisation at this scale, across all 
sectors, is likely to require an absolute 
increase in the amount of electricity 
produced and consumed due to the 
electrification of heating and transport. 
A report from the Energy Transitions 
Commission (November 2018) estimates 
that electricity’s contribution to global 
energy supply must rise from 20% to 60% 
by 2060. The European Commission’s 
long-term strategy is only slightly less 
bullish when it concludes electricity 
will need to meet 50% of primary 
energy demand. 
The International Panel on Climate Change 
concluded that as much as 85% of this 
energy could come from renewable energy 
– mainly wind and solar. Due to their 
intermittent nature this scale will only be 
achieved if the remaining 15% comes from 
sources which complement wind and solar, 
balancing the system and providing the 
increasingly valuable support services that 
a well-functioning energy system requires.
The challenges and opportunities 
presented by climate change are 
significant but they are not the only trends 
affecting the energy sector. Others 
include a need for more power generation, 
as the transport and heat sectors embrace 
new technologies, a need to manage 
more volatile sources of power, widely 
distributed sources of generation and 
customers who increasingly want more 
control over the way they use or generate 
their own energy. On page 13 we explore 
Drax’s response to these trends in 
more detail.
Drax operates in a dynamic,  
rapidly changing market.

 Drive to reduce carbon emissions
The UK Government aims to end unabated coal generation by 
2025. Coal produced 5% of UK power in 2018 compared to 39% 
in 2012.
> OUR RESPONSE
We have reduced our coal generation facilities over the last five 
years, converting four of Drax Power Station’s six generation 
units to use sustainable biomass. In 2018 we generated 13.8 
TWh of renewable power, which represents 12% of the UK’s 
total renewable power supply and means Drax is the largest 
renewable generator in the UK. We also launched a Bioenergy 
Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot project.

 Evolving mix of generation
The use of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, 
is increasing and flexible, thermal generation, such as coal, 
is declining. This places additional pressure to balance the 
energy system. 
> OUR RESPONSE
Drax’s portfolio of flexible generation (biomass, hydro and 
gas) provide these increasingly important services and 
bring more development opportunities. 
As much as
 85% 
of the energy of the future could  
come from renewable sources
 3
 Need to safeguard the  
UK’s security of supply
More distributed generation and the increase in intermittent 
renewables are driving increased levels of volatility in short-term 
prices and a need for assets to provide system support services. 
There is an increasing need for flexible sources of power which 
can provide services such as response, reserve, reactive power, 
black start and inertia. 
At peak times UK power supply has been getting close to the total 
available generation capacity. Increasing intermittent renewable 
generation has resulted in higher levels of volatility in short-term 
prices and a need for flexible generation.
> OUR RESPONSE
Drax is becoming a truly national power generator with 
generation assets distributed across Scotland, Northern England 
and the South East, and options to develop generation assets 
in Wales and the East of England. The Group’s total generation 
capacity now stands at 6.5 GW and we have options to develop 
a further 6.6GW. As well as adding capacity this increases our 
ability to provide the system services the grid relies upon.
 4
 Increasing market convergence  
and changing customer behaviour
As the energy market evolves, our business- to-business 
customers increasingly seek to create value from their portfolios 
through the installation of their own generation capabilities, 
the provision of demand side response and energy trading.
> OUR RESPONSE
Smart meter technology presents an opportunity to offer 
behind-the-meter services and the aggregation of information 
and capacity to customers large and small. This means Drax can 
open up power and flexibility markets to more customers. With 
flexible, renewable, low-carbon generation and trading expertise, 
Drax is strongly placed in this market to create shared value for 
customers and the Group.
 5
A need for affordable, sustainable power
The business-to-business energy market is highly competitive 
and customers are demanding access to both low cost and 
renewable power.
> OUR RESPONSE
Drax now supplies more of its business-to-business customers 
with 100% renewable power, at no premium, than any of our 
competitors. Our investment in digital technologies is providing 
new opportunities, a reduced cost to serve and an enhanced 
customer experience.

global supply chains in order to showcase 
the location and types of fibre we source, 
as well as key growth and inventory trends 
in the areas from which we source. 
Its depth of information, and accessibility 
for non-experts, makes it an important 
tool for informing and engaging 
the range of stakeholders with an 
interest in Drax’s biomass sustainability 
and sourcing practices. 
ForestScope was launched at two 
stakeholder engagement briefings in 
June and July 2018. The London and 
Brussels events led to important 
discussions with organisations such 
as WWF, Client Earth and the Natural 
Resources Defence Council (NRDC). 
We invite feedback from stakeholders 
to improve ForestScope and the 
sustainability of our operations.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND KPIs
Adjusted EBITDA of £21 million grew 
significantly compared to 2017 (£6 million), 
driven by increasing volumes of pellets 
produced and sold to the Power 
Generation business (on an arms-length 
basis) and lower production costs per 
tonne. This reflects operational 
efficiencies and greater utilisation of lower 
value forestry materials such as sawmill 
residues. Revenue in the year ended 
31 December 2018 totalled £214 million, 
an increase of over 50% versus 2017.
Raw fibre procurement, transportation 
and processing comprised the majority 
of cost of sales and as such this 
remains an important area of focus  
and an opportunity for the business. 
Through incremental investment in plant 
enhancements we expect to see further 
benefits from efficiencies and greater 
utilisation of lower cost residues. 
Operating costs vary with throughput and 
increased in 2018, reflecting increased 
pellet production levels and throughput 
at the Port of Baton Rouge.
KPIs reflect a good performance on 
reducing the cost of production, which 
was ahead of target offset by the level 
of fines being significantly below target. 
Good quality pellets at the lowest cost is 
a key focus for the business and we will 
continue to work to improve quality and 
reduce cost during 2019.

CASE STUDY
Hunt Forest 
Products
The wood products industry produces 
large quantities of residual materials. 
Drax is making use of this and forming 
part of a virtuous cycle that benefits 
the forestry sector, rural communities 
and the environment.
With the world growing increasingly 
digital, the markets for residuals for 
pulp have been in decline. But with the 
growth of markets for biomass, in the 
form of sustainable wood pellets – 
which can utilize the same residuals 
for production of pellets and other 
parts of the process – there remains 
a sustained demand and market for 
this material.
As this alternative market continues to 
grow, so will demand. Finding ways in 
which this market can be made more 
efficient now could lead to benefits 
in the long term.
A collaboration between Drax and 
Louisiana-based Hunt Forest Products 
is helping to do precisely this through 
investment in a co-location site in 
Urania, LA, which will see a sawmill 
and pellet facility sitting side by side.
This innovative co-operation will help 
cut costs at our LaSalle plant, save 
time, reduce transportation emissions, 
and deliver further efficiencies.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW:  
POWER GENERATION
Drax Power Station remains the largest 
power station in the UK. Between Q4 2017 
and Q3 2018 the station met 5% of the  
UK’s electricity needs, whilst providing  
12% of its renewable electricity, alongside 
important system support services.
With an increase in intermittent 
renewables and a reduction in the thermal 
generation provided by coal, the energy 
system of the future will require solutions 
which are flexible and able to respond 
quickly to changes in system demand. 
These long-term needs inform our 
generation model and options for 
future growth.

contributed to a £73 million increase in 
revenue from 2017, following a full year 
of output. This was offset by lower 
margins from coal generation and lost 
capacity payments.
Biomass remains the single largest cost 
for the Group. We remain focused on 
opportunities for long-term cost reduction 
through efficiencies in operations, 
optimisation of our supply chain and 
expansion of the fuel envelope to include 
lower cost sustainably sourced material.
Operating costs included works associated 
with unplanned outages. These were 
offset by a deferral of a major planned 
outage on Unit 4 until summer 2019, 
and by the implementation of lean 
management programmes to improve 
business performance.
Remeasurements reflect gains and losses 
on derivative contracts.
KPIs were ahead of Scorecard targets, 
reflecting good biomass availability 
beyond the forced outages at the 
beginning of 2018, and value from 
flexibility – a measure of flexible 
generation, system support services 
and attractively priced coal fuels.
Value from flexibility reduced £9 million 
year-on-year, reflecting a specific ancillary 
services contract in 2016-2017 which did 
not extend into 2018.
Not all MWs are equal, the 
energy market requires more 
than just low-carbon electricity
Historically non-generation system support services have been provided 
by baseload thermal generation – coal and gas. As these assets withdraw 
from the market, and at the same time the level of intermittent generation 
increases, Drax is well positioned to meet these system needs and provide 
increasingly important and valuable services to the UK energy system.
Biomass, pumped storage, hydro and gas are all strategically aligned with 
these needs and enable Drax to offer a full suite of services to the grid:
• Renewable and low carbon 
electricity
• Flexible dispatchable generation
• Reserve
• Headroom and footroom
• Inertia
• Voltage control
• Reactive Power
• Black start
• Frequency Response

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND KPIs
Adjusted EBITDA of £28 million was a 
decline of £1 million from 2017 (£29 million), 
Revenue increased 12% during the year, 
reflecting the inclusion of Opus Energy 
(acquired in February 2017) for a full-year, 
and a 0.8% increase in market share. 
During the final three months of the year, 
when the Capacity Market was suspended, 
we continued to include Capacity Market 
charges in customer bills, and to accrue 
the associated payments which will be 
transferred to Elexon during 2019.
Cost of Sales, which includes power 
purchases and grid charges, also increased 
12%. The increased cost of meeting our 
Renewable Obligation (RO) during the year 
reflects the impact of RO mutualisation, 
caused by the failure of several market 
participants which resulted in a larger 
proportion of the industry’s RO costs 
being shared by the remaining suppliers. 
In addition, gas costs were higher than 
expected following the “beast from the 
east” weather front during the first quarter. 
Gross profit of £143 million grew 22% 
compared to 2017. 
Within operating costs, bad debt expense 
grew by £13 million in the year, to £31 million, 
reflective of challenging market conditions. 
Our investment in next generation systems 
and strong focus on continual process 
improvement are key elements in 
managing bad debt exposure and enabling 
operating efficiencies in future years.
In the context of the wider market this 
reflects a good performance. 
CASE STUDY
Value of 
Flexibility  
and Demand 
Management
Flexibility in the form of demand 
management has an important role to 
play in an increasingly decentralised 
and low-carbon energy market. We 
are working with large customers 
to create value from their portfolios 
through the provision of demand-side 
response services and access to 
energy trading markets. In time, 
enabled by the deployment of smart 
meter technology, we also see an 
opportunity to offer behind-the-
meter services and the aggregation 
of information and capacity to 
smaller customers, opening 
the market for flexibility to more 
customers. With flexible, low carbon 
and renewable generation and 
trading expertise, Drax is strongly 
placed in this market to create shared 
value for customers and the Group.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
Drax Group’s total Scope 1 carbon 
emissions decreased by 33.4% between 
2017 and 2018. This reflects a reduced  
use of coal and the conversion of a fourth 
generation unit at Drax Power Station  
to use sustainable biomass as fuel.
Our Scope 2 carbon emissions increased, 
due to Pellet Production moving into our 
reporting scope. Pellet Production saw a 
record output as our third pellet plant, 
LaSalle in Louisiana, achieved full 
production in 2018.
We have reported our global and UK 
Total Energy Consumption for 2018, in

 2017, 2016 and 2015 data has been restated to reflect an update to the emissions factor applied to combustion data for Drax Biomass sites
Notes
We calculate and report our carbon emissions in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). We are required to disclose 
emissions from biologically sequestered carbon, which includes emissions released through the combustion of biomass to generate electricity. The biogenic CO2 emissions resulting 
from power generation are counted as zero in official reporting to both UK authorities and under the EU ETS as the use of sustainable biomass is considered to be CO2 neutral at the 
point of combustion. This methodology originates from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The majority of our emissions result from the process of using 
solid fuel. This can make it difficult to identify other smaller trends that are still significant. To counteract this dominance and to ensure we retain a balance between highlighting 
significant developments and providing meaningful data, we have adopted a materiality threshold of 100,000 tonnes of CO2e.

INNOVATING TO DECARBONISE 
OUR BUSINESS
Drax is playing its part to enable a zero 
carbon future. We completed the 
conversion of our fourth biomass generating 
unit, which became operational in August 
2018. We continue our work to replace our 
two remaining coal generating units with 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs).
In May 2018 we started Europe’s first 
Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage 
(BECCS) pilot project at Drax Power 
Station. The pilot will capture up to a tonne 
of CO2 a day from the gases produced 
when renewable power is generated 
using biomass.
ADVOCATING FOR CARBON PRICING
In 2018 we continued our engagement 
with Government and stakeholders to 
advocate for a robust carbon price. We 
signed a joint European carbon pricing 
declaration with global companies calling 
for more action to support a strong and 
predictable carbon price.
ZERO CARBON ENERGY SUPPLY 
Our B2B Energy Supply businesses are 
committed to sourcing the renewable 
power that our customers want. We 
provided over 350,000 UK business 
premises with 100% renewable electricity, 
making our B2B Energy Supply business 
the largest renewable electricity supplier 
to UK business for the Ofgem compliance 
period ending in 2018.
Additional information on our B2B Energy 
Supply fuel mix disclosures is available at
www.drax.com/opus-sources 
www.drax.com/haven-sources
At Drax we want to 
enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy 
future – to do that  
we have to test the 
technologies that could 
allow us, as well as  
the UK and the world, 
to deliver negative 
emissions and start  
to reduce the amount 
of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere.”
Will Gardiner
Group CEO, Drax Group
We are committed to managing, monitoring 
and reducing the environmental impact of 
our operations and the Group environment 
policy outlines our approach.
Our Environmental Management System 
(EMS) covering Drax Power Station is 
certified to ISO 14001. There were no 
major or minor breaches to our 
environmental permits at Drax Power 
Station in 2018. Emissions of sulphur 
dioxide and nitrogen oxides have reduced 
significantly over the last ten years, with 
the reductions continuing in 2018. This 
can be partly attributed to our reduced 
coal generation, as we completed the 
conversion of a fourth generating unit to 
burn biomass. Our particulate emissions 
also fell in 2018, with our emissions 
continuing to be well within our 
environmental permit limits.
Independent testing conducted on our 
behalf found emissions to air at Morehouse 
pellet plant exceeded permitted levels. We 
referred ourselves to the relevant authorities 
and we are working to ensure compliance.

ENSURING SUSTAINABLE BIOMASS
We ensure our biomass is sustainable and 
compliant with appropriate legislation 
through a combination of proactive 
supplier engagement, third party 
certification schemes and our own audits 
and checks. The Group sustainability 
policy outlines our requirements and 
details of our due diligence process are 
available at www.drax.com/sustainability.
We are reviewing our woody biomass 
sourcing policy in line with the 
recommendations made by Forest Research 
in its 2018 report(1) . This is to provide 
further assurance that the biomass we 
source makes a net positive contribution 
to climate change, protects and enhances 
biodiversity and has a positive social 
impact on local communities.
In 2018 our biomass was sourced from 
established, responsibly managed working 
forests in the USA, Canada, Europe and 
Brazil. To enhance our biomass supply 
chain transparency, we provide detailed 
supply chain information at Drax

100% of our biomass is  
legally and sustainably sourced
At Drax, all our biomass suppliers must demonstrate that all necessary 
sustainability and legal requirements are being met. Supplier compliance 
is evidenced either by our own checks and an independent audit or by 
Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) certification. SBP is a certification 
system for woody biomass, of which Drax is a founding member. We 
encourage our suppliers to move from our own audits and checks towards 
SBP certification. In Q4 2018 92% of our woody biomass sourced was 
SBP certified. This resulted in us achieving our target of sourcing 90% 
SBP-certified biomass fuel by the end of 2018.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS continued
No concerns regarding biomass supplier 
sustainability compliance were raised or 
escalated to the Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee or the Executive 
Committee in 2018.
We monitor each step in the supply chain 
to ensure that our requirements are being 
met and that greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions associated with producing our 
biomass are calculated according to the 
regulatory requirements.
The UK Government has set a limit on the 
maximum supply chain GHG emissions 
permitted for sustainable biomass to be 
eligible for support under the Renewables 
Obligation. The current limit is 285 
kgCO2-eq/MWh of electricity, reducing to 
200 kgCO2-eq/MWh of electricity in 2020. 
In 2018, our average biomass supply chain 
GHG emissions amounted to 131 kgCO2-eq/
MWh* of electricity. This is consistent with 
our 2017 average biomass supply chain 
GHG emissions.

CASE STUDY
Maintaining forest carbon stocks
We source only sustainable biomass from working forests that are fully established 
and properly managed. Biomass can play an important role in providing markets for 
thinnings and low grade roundwood where few alternative uses exist. It also offers a 
market for material that has been damaged by natural disturbances, such as wind, fire, 
pests and diseases, and by-products of forest stands managed for the production of 
solid wood products, such as construction saw-timber and furniture.
We are committed to sourcing biomass that contributes to the long-term 
maintenance of growing stock and productivity and that helps to improve the health 
and quality of forests at a local and regional level. We monitor forest inventory data 
and local industry trends, in addition to certification and our auditing process, to 
determine whether biomass demand is having a positive impact on regional forest 
industries. This allows us to make informed sourcing decisions.

CUSTOMERS
Customer Service Excellence
Our aim is to provide customers with the 
best possible service. Both Haven Power 
and Opus Energy have strict standards 
for treating customers fairly, protecting 
customer data and privacy and have 
a clear complaints procedure if things 
go wrong.
Haven Power was shortlisted for “Supplier 
of the Year” at the Energy Awards 2018.
Enabling our Customers
SMART AND DIGITAL ENABLEMENT
Smart meters are key to supporting 
customers with greater insight and 
opportunities to optimise their energy use. 
We are leading the way in rolling out smart 
meters to UK businesses and are investing in 
our digital platform to provide commercial 
opportunities, reduced cost to service 
and an enhanced customer experience. 
In 2018 we upgraded the Haven Power 
and Opus Energy websites onto a single 
content management system, making it 
faster and easier for our teams to react 
to the market and deliver a smoother 
customer experience. We also created 
new functionality, making it simpler for 
UK businesses to get an accurate quote 
and switch to us online.
FACILITATING PROSUMERS’ ROUTE 
TO MARKET
Opus Energy buys energy from generators 
and developers of solar, anaerobic digestion, 
hydro and wind power across the UK. 
In 2018 this amounted to 1,103 GWh 
of renewable energy generated 
from 2,176 generators.
During the year, Opus Energy worked 
in partnership with Home Farm near 
Daventry in Northamptonshire to trial an 
innovative solar power and battery storage 
system. The farm’s 50 kW solar panels 
generate more power than the farm 
consumes. The surplus electricity is 
exported to the National Grid and Home 
Farm is paid for it by Opus Energy through 
a power purchase agreement.
CASE STUDY
Kinetic Café by Opus Energy
Our B2B Energy Supply businesses provide value-adding sessions to our 
customers. Opus Energy opened a pop-up juice bar, the Kinetic Café in 
London, for two days in August. Small business owners were served free 
energetic juice and welcomed to network and share their business 
challenges, advice and personal experiences in Q&A sessions. We served 
over 1,000 juices to customers and visitors who stopped by the café over 
the course of two days.

We have Safety Management Systems 
(SMS) in place to ensure safe workplaces 
for all our people. At Drax Power Station, 
the SMS is certified to OHSAS 18001 and 
subject to regular compliance reviews, 
the last of which took place in 2016. 
In Pellet Production, the SMS meets the 
requirements of OHSAS 18001 and the US 
certification ANSI Z10. The Group health 
and safety policy outlines our approach.
Safety performance is reported and 
reviewed regularly by local management 
teams, the Executive Committee and the 
Board. Each incident is comprehensively 
analysed and reviewed, lessons learned 
are shared with employees and actions 
are taken to mitigate the risk of future 
occurrences. At Drax Power Station, 
a weekly safety update is uploaded to 
our intranet and at Pellet Production, 
information is made available to employees 
through a health and safety online portal.
The Board receives monthly reports which 
include Total Recordable Injury Rates 
(TRIR), Lost Time Injury Rates (LTIR) and 
numbers of Reporting of Injuries, Diseases 
and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 
(RIDDORs) (or US equivalent) for the Group.
Our Group TRIR for 2018 was 0.22 per 
100,000 hours worked. Following the fire 
at our Drax Power Station biomass pellet 
unloading facility in 2017, we carried out a 
full Safety and Engineering review. In 2018, 
initiatives were implemented to reduce 
the risk of future incidents and improve 
operator and plant safety. These initiatives 
continue into 2019.
2018 also saw the launch of the One Safe 
Drax toolkit for safety leaders, managers 
and supervisors at Drax Power Station. 
These tools provide a standard approach 
for safety management and support us in 
creating Safe People, Safe Systems and 
Process, and Safety Assurance to ensure 
we all go home safe and well every day.
Unfortunately, in December 2018 we had a 
major safety incident at our Drax Biomass 
LaSalle site which resulted in a colleague 
being injured. Operations at LaSalle were 
suspended until all employees were retrained 
on safety protocols and procedures.
A full safety audit was carried out by 
an independent third party at all three 
pellet plants. The audits identified a 
major difference in safety culture 
between LaSalle and our other facilities. 
We currently have 42 action items we 
are working on that consist of the 
recruitment of new management staff, 
development of new safety programmes 
and procedures, safety audits, safety 
committees and structured training.

CASE STUDY
Supporting our employees’  
mental health
All employees across the Group have access to an Employee Assistance Programme. It’s 
a free and confidential 24-hour service which offers support on anything from financial 
stress and family and relationship issues to addiction, housing concerns or legal 
information. There is a phoneline and an app and users can be referred for six sessions 
of counselling per issue, per year. Opus Energy ran 15 voluntary workshops to help our 
leaders understand the benefits of this service and they were attended by 113 managers.

People and Culture
The Group works to maintain consistently 
high standards in its employment practices 
and all our employees benefit from a 
range of policies to support them in the 
workplace. These include policies designed 
to enable different work and lifestyle 
preferences, processes for employees to 
raise grievances or concerns about safety, 
along with supporting a diverse and 
inclusive workplace. Our Group-wide 
people strategy focuses on valuing our 
people, driving business performance and 
developing talent to deliver our strategic 
and operational objectives.
During the year we introduced our 
One Drax Awards, which recognise 
high-potential employees and reward those 
employees who act in ways that support 
and underpin our culture and values.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Drax Group is fully committed to the 
elimination of unlawful and unfair 
discrimination and we value the 
differences that a diverse workforce brings 
to the organisation. Our goal is to create 
and maintain a working environment that 
is both safe and supportive of all our 
people and where every employee has the

We believe that a commitment to diversity 
is critical to achieving our strategic goals. 
We are determined to be a place where 
employees, customers and suppliers alike 
feel respected, comfortable and supported 
in their diversity.
Further information on gender diversity 
is available in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 50.
EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION 
AND ENGAGEMENT
Across the Group, 19% of the workforce is 
covered by collective bargaining. We have 
representative employee consultation and 
information arrangements in place for 
those employees who have individual 
employment contracts.
We communicate with employees through 
channels including our internal intranet, 
quarterly newsletter and Open Forum 
meetings. Employees can ask our Group 
CEO questions through a weekly online 
question and answer portal.
We track employee engagement through 
our annual survey and in 2018 this 
was completed by 79% of employees. 
Key themes included creating greater 
clarity for our colleagues about our key 
priorities and ensuring we continue to 
make improvements to the learning and 
development opportunities we have 
available. In 2019, we will develop Group 
and business action plans to address each 
theme, which the Executive Committee 
will review regularly.
Ethics and Integrity
At Drax Group we are committed to 
conducting business ethically, with 
honesty and integrity, and in compliance 
with all relevant laws and regulations. 
We do not tolerate any form of bribery, 
corruption or other unethical 
business conduct.
Our compliance framework consists of 
principles, policies and procedures. The 
principles underpin the wider framework 
and are set out in our Group ethics 
handbook, Doing the right thing. The 
handbook identifies the behaviours 
expected from our employees and 
contractors on topics including human 
rights, ethical business conduct and 
integrity. Our policies and procedures 
provide further guidance and instruction, 
in line with best industry practice. These 
include our Group Corporate Crime policy 
and Gifts and Hospitality, Conflicts of 
Interest and Due Diligence procedures.
The ethical principles contained in the 
handbook form part of our terms of 
employment. In 2018 the handbook was 
converted into a series of short videos. 
These are used as part of our new starter 
induction programme and for annual 
ethics refresher training. Teams that are 
exposed to increased risk receive tailored 
e-learning or classroom-based training.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS continued
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ETHICS
Governance of our framework is overseen 
by the Group Ethics and Business Conduct 
Committee (EBCC). The Committee 
meets quarterly and is chaired by the 
Group CFO. Managers and senior managers 
across the Group are responsible for 
demonstrating leadership on ethical 
matters and supporting teams to apply 
our ethical principles.
Our Group Corporate Compliance team 
carries out an annual review of the Group’s 
gift and hospitality records and our 
Internal Audit team provides assurance 
on the robustness of our policies and 
processes. Results of the annual review, 
details of investigations conducted and 
audit outcomes are reported annually to 
both the EBCC and the Audit Committee.
The Group Corporate Compliance team 
also conducts annual risk assessments of 
each of its compliance programmes, which 
relate to areas including anti-bribery and 
corruption and modern slavery in supply 
chains. This is to ensure procedures remain 
fit for purpose and to recommend any 
further mitigation measures. The results 
are presented to the EBCC.
WORKING WITH OTHERS
We joined the UN Global Compact (UNGC) 
in January 2018 and have established 
representation on both their UK Advisory 
Group and Modern Slavery Working Group. 
This will enable us to play an active role in 
the UK UNGC network, to benchmark our 
compliance programmes, to share and 
exchange experience and promote 
peer collaboration.
We seek to work with suppliers, partners, 
agents, intermediaries, contractors, 
consultants and counterparties whose 
standards are consistent with our own. 
Third parties are subject to our pre-
contract due diligence checks and 
continual monitoring through the lifecycle 
of the contract, via our third party due 
diligence system. In cases where a red flag 
is raised, we follow an EBCC-approved 
escalation protocol. Depending on the 
nature of the flagged issue, we may decide 
not to engage with a third party, to engage 
on a conditional basis, to collaborate on 
remedial action or to end an existing 
business relationship.
ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION
Our internal processes ensure consistency 
with our zero tolerance approach to 
bribery and corruption.
Geographic risk is factored into our 
country due diligence and third party due 
diligence systems. Conducting business 
in higher risk countries must receive prior 
approval from the Group Operational Risk 
Management Committee.
Following country approval, third parties 
are then put forward for our due diligence 
process. Suppliers in higher risk countries 
receive a higher level of initial due diligence 
and ongoing monitoring. We also screen the 
affiliates (directors, shareholders) of these 
suppliers and refresh their information on a 
more frequent basis, compared to our lower 
risk suppliers. Third parties with operations 
in, or linked to, higher risk countries are 
escalated to the EBCC for review prior 
to engagement. Ongoing monitoring is 
performed with new information provided 
to the relevant committee, as appropriate. 
In May 2018, we implemented a new due 
diligence system across the Group to 
facilitate this process.
Drax Group was not involved in any legal 
cases related to corruption and bribery 
in 2018. 
LABOUR AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Our commitment to the protection of 
human rights includes not tolerating the 
use of underage workers or forced labour. 
This is captured in our Corporate Crime 
policy and our Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) statement.
Our CR statement outlines the standard of 
ethical business conduct we expect from 
suppliers. Businesses in our supply chain 
should offer a safe workplace for their 
employees that is free from harm, 
intimidation, harassment and fear. We have 
incorporated further provisions into our 
statement template to manage these risks 
within our procurement contracts and will 
further advance this effort in 2019 with 
the development of a Code of Conduct.
Within the Code of Conduct, we will 
emphasise our requirement for our 
suppliers and contractors working on our 
behalf to challenge unethical behaviour 
and promote a “speak up” culture.
MODERN SLAVERY
In 2018, we published our second modern 
slavery statement in accordance with 
the UK Modern Slavery Act. This describes 
the steps we are taking to reduce the risk 
of modern slavery in our supply chain.
DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
We take the privacy and security of the 
personal data we control seriously. We 
are committed to maintaining effective 
privacy and security programmes to 
ensure our people, customers and the 
third parties with which we engage have 
confidence in our data handling practices.
As part of our continual improvement 
programme, our Privacy, IT and Security 
teams were re-organised and expanded 
in 2018. Following an internal audit, which 
identified weaknesses in operational 
IT controls that support our cyber security 
at Drax Power Station, we initiated a 
comprehensive remediation programme 
to address the findings and introduce 
more robust control measures. We also 
continue to update our Privacy Compliance 
Programme to take account of the 
requirements of the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new 
UK Data Protection Act 2018 and other 
associated legislation.
To support our privacy compliance 
processes and policies, we maintain 
industry-leading control measures to 
protect our employee and customer data, 
by detecting and preventing threats and 
security breaches. In addition to traditional 
security measures, we undertake 
advanced threat monitoring and analytics 
measurement as a layered toolset 
designed to detect, identify, respond to 
and resolve cyber threats and attacks 
before they can happen. We are conscious 
that such threats continue to change. 
Accordingly, we run a continual security 
programme to improve and evolve our 
controls and response to cyber threats.

WHISTLEBLOWING
As set out in our Whistleblowing policy, at 
Drax we encourage employees to speak 
out and report concerns either internally 
or through our whistleblowing hotline.
Employees can raise issues internally 
through managers, a member of the Group 
Corporate Compliance team, directly with 
the EBCC or though our anonymous 
hotline, which is independently operated 
by a third party.
The Corporate Human Resources 
team records all hotline reports received 
and will raise any ethical-related matters 
with the Group Corporate Compliance 
team, which maintains an investigations 
log. Where required, the EBCC and Group 
General Counsel are consulted, and a 
course of action agreed. Should genuine 
concerns be raised, we have a strict 
non-retaliation policy.
During 2018, no reports were made 
through our third party whistleblowing 
hotline.
Additional information on ethics and 
integrity is available at
www.drax.com/sustainability
Positive Social Impact
We provide jobs, support economic 
growth, pay tax responsibly and deliver 
charitable and volunteering initiatives 
in the communities where we operate. 
Oxford Economics estimate that the 
Group contributed £1.6 billion towards 
UK GDP and supported 17,500 jobs across 
the country in 2017.
VOLUNTEERING AND CHARITABLE GIVING
In 2018, we provided £129,016 in charitable 
donations through employee match 
funding, payroll giving, our community 
fund and national fundraising days. 
We also established strategic national 
partnerships and consistent Group charity 
and community principles. We will roll-out 
our Group-wide social impact strategy 
in 2019.
Our Haven Power employees continued 
to support the Eden Rose Coppice 
Trust’s Brickmakers’ Wood project. They 
volunteered 882 hours and raised £6,052. 
Recognising its work with the charity, 
Haven Power was awarded the Utility 
Week 2018 ‘Community Initiative of the 
Year’ title.

GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW
INTRODUCTION
The Group has delivered year-on-year 
growth, with Adjusted EBITDA increasing 
to £250 million from £229 million in 2017. 
This is a significant achievement given 
the operational challenges faced during 
the first quarter in our Power Generation 
business. Strong operating performance 
in the remaining nine months from Power 
Generation, along with the conversion of a 
fourth generating unit from coal to biomass 
in the summer has helped to mitigate 
these events. Pellet Production reached 
record levels in 2018 with a reduction to 
the cost of each tonne produced. Our B2B 
Energy Supply business delivered a growth 
in gross profit through customer meter 
acquisition and retention, despite 
challenging market conditions, albeit 
Adjusted EBITDA was adversely affected 
by an increased level of bad debt charges.
Following the adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ in the year, the Group has 
elected to present the income statement 
in a columnar format. Total Results 
represent the results of the Group in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). They include 
re-measurements in relation to the fair 
value derivative contracts taken out to 
de-risk future cash flows, but which cannot 
be designated as hedging instruments 
under IFRS, and also exceptional items 
which are not part of the underlying 
performance of the business. 
Adjusted Results exclude the impact of 
these items, and are consistent with the 
way the Board and executive management 
review performance of the business 
throughout the year. They are discussed 
below separately from the Group’s 
Total Results. 
Certain remeasurements on derivative 
contracts have been allocated to the 
relevant line item to which the contracts 
relate; revenue or cost of sales. 
Upon adoption of IFRS 9, we have 
recognised fair value gains and losses 
on certain foreign exchange forward 
contracts through other comprehensive 
income. These gains and losses were 
previously recognised in the income 
statement. As a result, prior year results 
have been restated. Further information 
is given in note 8.3 to the Consolidated 
financial statements. 
The Group improved its access to capital in 
the year, with the issue of US$300 million 
loan notes at a fixed interest rate, which 
mature in November 2025. These were 
swapped back to sterling upon issuance. 
The proceeds were used to redeem 
£200 million loan notes with a floating 
interest rate and maturity date of May 2022, 
thereby extending the tenor of Drax’s 
senior debt, giving increased certainty 
regarding future interest costs as well 
as diversifying available markets for future 
funding opportunities. The Group closely 
monitors and manages its cash position 
and closing net debt which was £319 million, 
resulting in a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio of 1.3x at the end of the year. The initial 
net £687 million consideration for the 
acquisition of ScottishPower Generation 
Limited is included in payables at the 
year end. 
Following shareholder approval at the 
General Meeting held on 21 December 2018, 
we completed the acquisition and gained 
control of ScottishPower Generation Ltd 
(subsequently renamed Drax Generation 
Enterprise Ltd) from Iberdrola on 31 December 
2018. The company owns and operates a 
portfolio of UK pumped storage, hydro and 
gas generation assets. The acquisition has 
been partly funded by a debt facility of 
£725 million which matures in H2 2020. 
£550 million was drawn against this facility 
on 2 January 2019, with the remainder of the 
consideration settled in cash. We expect 
to refinance this debt during 2019.
On 15 November 2018 the Court of Justice of 
the European Union ruled that the process 
used by the European Commission to approve 
the UK Capacity Market was not valid, with 
the result that payments to UK generators 
were suspended. The net impact on the 
Group of the suspension in the 2018 results 
was a reduction in Adjusted EBITDA and 
Total operating profit of £7 million.
We remain committed to 
a strong balance sheet, 
alongside options for growth 
and delivery of a sustainable 
and increasing dividend.”

INCOME STATEMENT
ADJUSTED RESULTS
Adjusted Results exclude the impact of 
certain remeasurements on derivative 
contracts which cannot be designated  
as hedging instruments under IFRS, along 
with exceptional items. More details on 
exceptional items are shown in note 2.7 
to the Consolidated financial statements. 
REVENUE
Adjusted revenue for 2018 of £4,237 million 
was £552 million greater than 2017, driven 
by Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) 
sales, the full year impact of Opus Energy 
(which was acquired in February 2017) 
and growth in sales in our B2B Energy 
Supply business.
Adjusted revenue in our Power Generation 
business rose to £3,332 million (2017: 
£2,720 million) despite a fall in electrical 
output, as a result of an increase in 
Contract for Difference (CfD) income from 
increased unit availability in 2018, together 
with an increase in ROC sales. Electrical 
output fell to 18.3TWh (2017: 20.0TWh) 
following unplanned outages during the 
first quarter. Subsequent to the fire in 
December 2017 in our biomass rail 
unloading facilities, safety measures were 
implemented which restricted operational 
availability. In addition, there was an 
unplanned outage on one of our biomass 
units. The combination of these events led 
to lower biomass generation in the first 
three months of 2018 than the equivalent 
period in 2017. Electrical output also 
reflects the impact of a maintenance 
outage for one coal unit, the conversion of 
a fourth unit from coal to biomass and the 
impact of low load factors on coal units 
during the summer. 75% of our generation 
was from biomass and 25% from coal in 
the year. 
ROC sales of £665 million (2017: 
£368 million) increased significantly in 
the year as a result of a combination of 
the increase in market prices and actions 
taken to accelerate the timing of cash 
flows from ROCs. Where we choose to 
sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we 
may choose to purchase ROCs at a later 
date to meet our obligation, leading 
to an offsetting charge in cost of sales. 
At 31 December 2018, following these 
actions there was a similar value 
in revenue and cost of sales for ROC 
sales and purchases. 
B2B Energy Supply revenues increased 
from £1,999 million in 2017 to £2,242 million 
in 2018 based on strong customer meter 
retention performance, and also 
benefiting from an additional month 
of Opus Energy revenue which was 
acquired in February 2017.
Revenues of our US-based Pellet 
Production business continued to rise, 
as we increased production from 822k 
tonnes in 2017 to 1,351kt in the year. This 
includes output from LaSalle Bioenergy 
which we acquired in 2017, and which 
commissioned in 2018. All three of our 
wood pellet plants are demonstrating an 
improvement in operating performance, 
having produced at record levels in 2018. 
Pellet Production revenues are from the 
sale of pellets from the US to our Power 
Generation business, based on an 
arm’s-length contract. 
GROSS PROFIT
Adjusted gross profit for 2018 of 
£601 million (2017: £545 million) was 
primarily derived from our generation 
and supply activities.
Power Generation delivered £396 million 
of Adjusted gross profit, largely in line 
with the prior year (£398 million) despite 
the impact of a reduction in generation 
noted above and a £7 million impact of 
lost revenue resulting from the Capacity 
Market suspension during the fourth 
quarter. This was partially offset by an 
increase in income from the CfD unit 
which generated more in 2018 than in 
the prior year when the unit underwent 
an unplanned outage, and by the receipt 
of insurance proceeds in respect of a claim 
for loss of generation from our biomass 
units during 2016-2018 (£17 million) which 
was largely recognised within cost of sales. 
ROCs continue to form a key component 
of financial performance and the expected 
benefit of ROCs earned is recognised as 
a reduction in our biomass fuel costs at 
the point of generation. Each ROC is 
subsequently recognised as revenue when 
that ROC is sold to a third party. We earned 
ROCs, reducing costs, with a total value of 
£468 million in 2018 (2017: £481 million) 
reflecting additional biomass generation 
from the conversion of a fourth unit, net 
of the impact of the quarter one outages 
on biomass generation.

B2B Energy Supply Adjusted gross 
profit improved from £117 million in 2017 
to £143 million in 2018, which includes 
an additional month of Opus trading. 
Margins benefited from a focus on higher 
value contracts with larger customers. 
All Capacity Market costs have been 
accrued for the fourth quarter, despite 
its suspension. Our approach is based on 
the assumption that the Capacity Market 
will reopen during 2019. In the Generation 
business, no Capacity Market income has 
been accrued. Until legislation is in place 
which enables Capacity Market payments 
to be made to generators for the fourth 
quarter, expected future revenue 
represents a contingent asset and will not 
be recognised in the income statement. 
Pellet Production Adjusted gross profit 
relies on volume of pellet sales to our 
Power Generation business and close 
control over production costs. There is 
significant focus on reducing the cost 
base within this segment, and that, along 
with increasing output volumes which 
reduced the cost per tonne of pellets, 
has helped to improve gross profit 
to £65 million in 2018 (2017: £39 million).
Further segmental financial performance 
information is provided in the notes to 
our Consolidated financial statements 
on page 123.
OPERATING COSTS AND IMPAIRMENT 
LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS
Operating costs of £320 million increased 
from £297 million in 2017, reflecting 
unplanned outage costs on a biomass 
unit and a major planned outage on one 
of the coal units in Generation, along with 
a full year of costs in Opus Energy. 
The B2B Energy Supply business 
experienced a £13 million increase in 
bad debt charges in the year taking the 
total charge to £31 million. The charge 
reflects a deterioration in market 
conditions in 2018, the impact of the 
increase in revenue, and the write-off 
of legacy debt.
Central costs of £28 million in 2018 
reduced from £34 million in 2017, as a 
result of various savings initiatives. 
ADJUSTED EBITDA
As a result of the financial performance 
described above, Adjusted EBITDA for 
2018 was £250 million, compared to 
£229 million in 2017.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION
Depreciation of £129 million increased by 
£6 million in the year, reflecting charges  
for the LaSalle pellet production facility 
which was commissioned during the first 
quarter of 2018.
Amortisation charges totalled £45 million, 
in line with prior year, and largely relate 
to customer relationships and brand 
acquired with Opus Energy and also 
computer software. More details are 
shown in note 5.3 of the Consolidated 
financial statements. 
OPERATING PROFIT
Adjusted operating profit increased from 
£47 million in 2017 to £76 million in 2018, 
influenced by the items described above.
NET INTEREST CHARGES
Adjusted net interest charges of £39 million 
have increased from £31 million in 2017 
largely reflecting a full year’s interest 
charge on the debt incurred in relation to 
the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 
2017 and other costs associated with 
working capital management. More details 
are shown in Note 2.5 of the Consolidated 
financial statements.
PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE AND AFTER TAX
The Group’s Adjusted profit before tax 
was £37 million for 2018, compared to 
a restated profit of £5 million for the 
previous year. The increase predominantly 
reflects an improvement in underlying 
business performance, reflected in higher 
gross profits. 
The tax credit of £5 million compares 
to a £2 million charge in 2017. In 2017, 
HMRC agreed a claim arising from a patent 
relating to biomass which enables the 
Group to pay corporate taxes at a lower 
rate (10%) on profits which arise from the 
use of innovation. A benefit of £8 million 
was recognised during 2018 which drives 
a lower effective tax rate than the 
standard corporation tax rate in the UK. 
The prior year charge includes the effects 
of a £16 million deferred tax charge arising 
from the reduction in US Federal tax rates 
to 21% from 1 January 2018, net of a credit 
of £10 million in relation to the patent box 
claim for years 2013 to 2016.
Adjusted profit after tax increased to 
£42 million in 2018 from £3 million in  
2017 as a result of the factors above.

GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
A proportion of foreign currency 
derivatives do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. In addition to hedging foreign 
currency commitments, we forward 
purchase coal, gas and freight, aspects 
of which also do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. The gains on these contracts 
in the year have predominantly been 
driven by the weakening of sterling 
following uncertainty around Brexit. 
Prior year Total gross profit has been 
restated to reflect our new derivative gains 
and losses accounting policy, following 
IFRS 9 adoption, reducing it by £177 million.
In addition, under IFRS 9 we have elected 
to recognise fair value gains and losses 
on certain foreign exchange forward 
contracts directly in reserves in order 
to reduce income statement volatility.  
This change results in a reduction in 
derivative gains and losses recognised 
in the income statement of £17 million 
as at 31 December 2017.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION
In August, we completed the conversion 
of a fourth generating unit from coal to 
biomass. £27 million of coal-specific assets 
in relation to this unit have been fully 
written down, as they are no longer required 
to support generation activity. This charge 
is shown within exceptional items. 
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit is stated after acquisition 
and restructuring costs of £28 million 
(2017: £8 million). 
This included costs of £21 million which 
were incurred in connection with the 
acquisition of the generation business 
from ScottishPower. 
During the first quarter, we announced the 
closure of our Atlanta office to relocate 
the US head office to Monroe, Louisiana, 
in close proximity to the pellet production 
and port facilities. As at 31 December 2018, 
we had incurred costs of £4 million 
(2017: £nil) in relation to this transition, 
which have been included within 
acquisition and restructuring costs. 
TOTAL RESULTS
Total Results represent the results of the 
Group in accordance with IFRS. They 
include re-measurements in relation to 
the fair value derivative contracts taken 
out to de-risk future cash flows, but 
which cannot be designated as hedging 
instruments under IFRS, and exceptional 
items which are not part of the underlying 
performance of the business. See note 2.7 
to the Consolidated financial statements 
for more details. 
IFRS 9 requires all gains and losses on 
derivative instruments to be reflected in 
profit or loss as they arise, independently 
of the maturity of the related commodity 
contract. Due to the volatility in fair value 
movements, which is entirely market 
dependent, we have chosen to exclude 
fair value gains and losses from  
Adjusted Results and present them in  
a separate column in arriving at Total 
Results, in order to retain transparency  
of underlying business performance.  
Fair value gains and losses are non-cash 
accounting adjustments. 
REVENUE
Revenue re-measurements relate to fair 
value gains and losses on gas contracts in 
our Power Generation business, which are 
used as a proxy hedge to movements in 
power prices. After taking these losses 
into consideration, Total revenue in 2018 
rose to £4,229 million from £3,684 million 
in 2017.
GROSS PROFIT
Total gross profit increased significantly 
in 2018 to £639 million (2017: £368 million) 
which reflects the underlying business 
performance along with fair value gains, 
principally on foreign exchange contracts, 
in 2018 as compared with significant fair 
value losses in 2017. 
Foreign currency contracts are a 
key component of the Group’s risk 
management strategy and help to 
secure and de-risk the future cash flows 
of the business, particularly fuel purchases 
which are typically denominated in 
US dollars, Canadian dollars or euros. 
As we continue to integrate our B2B Energy 
Supply businesses we have incurred 
certain one-off restructuring costs, as part 
of a programme of changes alongside 
our digital transformation. These totalled 
£3m (2017: £nil) and are also included in 
acquisition and restructuring costs. 
Prior year transaction and restructuring 
costs relate to the acquisition of Opus 
Energy along with the disposal of 
Billington Bioenergy.
Total operating profit increased to 
£60 million from a loss of £138 million in 
2017, primarily as a result of the movement 
in gains and losses on derivative contracts. 
NET INTEREST CHARGES
Total net interest charges, excluding 
FX gains and losses of £46 million 
(2017: £56 million) includes £7 million 
of refinancing costs and acceleration of 
deferred financing costs related to the 
£200 million senior secured floating rate 
loan notes, which have now been repaid. 
The prior year included £24 million of early 
repayment charges and accelerated 
deferred finance costs for loans redeemed 
as part of the 2017 refinancing. These 
charges have been presented separately 
within exceptional items. 
A full breakdown of interest payable is 
shown in note 2.5 to the Consolidated 
financial statements.
PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE AND AFTER TAX
The Group’s Total profit before tax was 
£14 million for 2018, compared to a 
restated loss of £204 million for the 
previous year. The improved result 
predominantly reflects an improvement 
in underlying business performance 
(reflected in Adjusted EBITDA) along 
with the swing from losses on foreign 
currency contracts in 2017 to gains 
in 2018.
Applying the tax credit results in a 
Total profit after tax of £20 million (2017: 
restated loss after tax of £168 million) and 
a basic earnings per share of 5.0 pence 
(2017: loss per share of 41.3 pence).

BALANCE SHEET
The Group’s Consolidated balance sheet 
at 31 December 2018 includes the assets 
and liabilities acquired as part of the 
acquisition of a portfolio of ScottishPower 
assets. No trading results are included in 
2018, given the acquisition closed at 23:59 
on the final day of the year. See note 5.1 to 
the Consolidated financial statements for 
more details. 
PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
The Group has a disciplined approach 
to capital expenditure, with all projects 
subject to review by investment 
committees and large projects requiring 
Board approval. Investment is prioritised 
to address safety and regulatory 
requirements, ensure the plant is 
maintained and fit for purpose, and is 
only released to enhancement projects 
where incremental returns have been 
identified. Capital expenditure in the year 
was £114 million, a £51 million reduction 
in expenditure from 2017. The prior year 
includes £48 million for the purchase and 
development of pellet production assets 
at LaSalle Bioenergy. 
At Drax Power Station, investment 
reflected the outage following the 2017 
fire, conversion of a fourth unit to biomass 
generation, along with routine asset 
replacement and upgrades, the purchase 
of strategic spares and continuing 
investment to develop the OCGTs and 
gas generation. Total expenditure for 
the year was £87 million. 
Pellet Supply continued to invest in 
opportunities to improve efficiency and 
reduce costs, including the development 
of a new rail spur at LaSalle Bioenergy. 
Excluding the purchase of the generation 
business from ScottishPower, the total 
carrying value of plant, property and 
equipment fell by £60 million in the 12 
months to 31 December 2018, reflecting 
increased depreciation and the write-off 
of obsolete coal assets. Our four OCGT 
assets remain under development. 
See note 5.3 to the Consolidated financial 
statements for more information. 
The total carrying value of plant, property 
and equipment, including the effect 
of the acquisition from ScottishPower, 
was £2,292 million, at 31 December 2018 
(2017: £1,662 million).
In B2B Energy Supply the development of 
a new information technology platform 
and preparations for smart meters 
adoption added £28 million of capital 
expenditure to intangible assets.
CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS
Cash generated from operations was 
£336 million in 2018, a decrease of 
£39 million from the previous year. 
The Group has a strong focus on cash flow 
discipline and uses various methods to 
manage liquidity through the business’ 
cash generation cycle. In addition to the 
£315 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), 
the Group optimises its trade receivables, 
trade payables and ROC assets to manage 
the day to day working capital position. 
The B2B Energy Supply business has 
access to a facility which enables it to 
accelerate cash flows associated with 
trade receivables on a non-recourse 
basis which generated a cash inflow 
of £24 million at 31 December 2018 
(£34 million at 31 December 2017). 
The facility terms were amended 
during the year, bringing more of the 
receivables balance into the scope 
of the facility, further improving our 
overall liquidity and risk profile. More 
details can be found in note 4.4 to the 
Consolidated financial statements. 
During the year the Group has actively 
sought to bring its trade payable 
days closer to industry standards and 
has accessed several purchasing 
facilities which were used to manage 
cash payments while limiting the 
impact on suppliers. These facilities have 
generated a cash inflow of £87 million in 
the year (2017: £nil). The amounts under 
these facilities fall due 4-60 days from 
the year end. 
During the year there was an increase 
in ROC assets of £71 million adversely 
impacting working capital (2017: inflow of 
£112 million). This reflects the increase in 
ROCs generated following the conversion 
of a fourth unit and the improvement in 
biomass generation output in the final 
quarter of 2018 compared to 2017. 
Cash from ROCs is typically realised 
several months after the ROC is earned. 
However, through selling and subsequently 
buyings ROCs through normal ROC sale 
and purchase arrangements we can 
optimise the timing of cash flows over 
a proportion of these assets.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
Together these facilities and arrangements 
created a net cash inflow of £100 million 
(2017: inflow of £195 million) which has 
helped to drive a net inflow from working 
capital of £112 million in the year to 
31 December 2018, compared to an 
inflow of £166 million in the year to 
31 December 2017.
The overall net cash inflow for the year 
was £66 million (2017: £4 million outflow), 
after cash payments for capital 
expenditure of £104 million (2017: 
£159 million), dividend payments of 
£53 million (2017: £22 million) and share 
buy-backs of £47 million (2017: £nil).  
Cash taxes paid during the year were 
£1 million (2017: £14 million).
NET DEBT AND FUNDING
The Group held total borrowings of 
£608 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: 
£590 million) and net debt of £319 million 
(2017: £367 million). 
In April 2018, the Group successfully 
completed a refinancing to convert 
floating to fixed debt and to extend the 
debt maturity out to November 2025. 
The Group issued a US$300 million 
bond with a fixed interest rate of 6.625%, 
which was swapped back to sterling upon 
issuance at an effective interest rate of 5%. 
The proceeds of the new issue were used 
to repay in full the £200 million floating 
rate bond issued in 2017 which had a 
maturity of 2022. 
Incremental costs of the new borrowing 
(£4 million) have been deferred and will 
be amortised to net interest costs in the 
income statement. 
The Group’s financing structure also 
includes a £350 million 4.25% fixed rate 
bond and a £350 million facility  
comprised of an RCF with a value of 
£315 million and an index-linked term loan 
of £35 million. The RCF matures in April 
2021, with an option to extend by one  
year. At 31 December 2018 the RCF had 
been used to draw down letters of credit 
with a total value of £32 million (2017: 
£36 million). 
On 2 January 2019, the Group drew 
down £550 million from a £725 million 
acquisition bridge facility to partially 
fund the acquisition of a portfolio of 
ScottishPower assets, with the remainder 
of the consideration funded from the 
Group’s cash resources. The bridge facility 
matures in H2 2020. The amount payable 
in relation to the acquisition was included 
in other payables as at 31 December 2018. 
The use of the receivables facility, trade 
payables facilities and ROC sales 
mentioned above accelerated cash  
flows to a value of £100 million (2017: 
£195 million) with a corresponding 
reduction in net debt. We expect to 
continue to use these facilities to  
manage our working capital in 2019.
The Group also has access to secured 
trading lines, available with certain 
counter parties, providing support to 
the trading programme.
We remain committed to a strong balance 
sheet and to maintaining an appropriate 
credit rating. The optimisation of working 
capital helped to drive a reduction to the 
net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio to 1.3x 
at 31 December 2018 (2017: 1.6x), excluding 
the £687 million paid on 2 January 2019 
in respect of the acquisition of a 
generation business from ScottishPower. 
Further information on funding 
arrangements is included in note 4.3 
to the Consolidated financial statements, 
on page 142.
PENSIONS
The Group operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme in each of its operating 
companies and, in addition, the Power 
Generation business operates a defined 
benefit scheme within the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme framework, 
which closed to new members in 2002. 
The actuarial review of our defined benefit 
pension scheme at 31 December 2018, 
applying assumptions consistent with 
the methodology adopted in previous 
accounting periods, has resulted in a 
funding surplus of £19 million (31 December 
2017: deficit of £1 million). This is largely 
driven by an increase in the discount rate 
assumption to 3.0% (31 December 2017: 
2.6%) following lower inflation expectations, 
which has decreased the value of the 
scheme liabilities by £23 million. 
The terms of the Trust Deed for the defined 
benefit scheme allow the Group to recover 
any surplus once the liabilities of the 
scheme have been settled. We have 
therefore recognised the funding surplus 
at 31 December 2018 in non-current assets 
within the Consolidated balance sheet. 
The defined benefit scheme triennial 
valuation, which was last completed 
as at 31 March 2016, is based on more 
conservative discount rate and cost 
assumptions and resulted in a technical 
provisions deficit. This provision has 
improved since the triennial valuation, 
consistent with the movement in the 
accounting provision. The Group remains 
committed to make contributions towards 
the repair of this deficit until 2025. 
Upon completion of the acquisition of the 
portfolio of assets from ScottishPower, 
certain employees with defined benefit 
pension rights were transferred to Drax. 
The employees continue to participate in 
the ScottishPower pension scheme whilst 
Drax is in the process of setting up a new 
scheme for the members to transfer to, 
which will include assets and liabilities for 
past service benefits. Drax’s share of the 
ScottishPower pension scheme assets 
and liabilities for these employees has been 
calculated for inclusion in the Consolidated 
balance sheet, and results in a pension 
scheme surplus of £4 million. The Group is 
entitled to receive any surplus on the new 
scheme once the liabilities have been met 
under the terms of the draft Trust Deed. 
DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
We enter into forward contracts for the 
purchase and sale of physical commodities, 
principally power, gas, coal, biomass and 
carbon emissions, to secure the margin 
associated with forward electricity sales, 
and also foreign currency derivatives to fix 
sterling cash flows. All derivative contracts 
are measured at fair value as at the balance 
sheet date, with changes to this value being 
recognised in either the income statement 
(Total Results) or the hedge reserve 
dependent upon whether the contract 
qualifies as an effective hedge under 
IFRS (see note 7.2 to the Consolidated 
financial statements).

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
A gain of £92 million (2017: loss of 
£219 million) was recognised in the hedge 
reserve driven primarily by movements 
on foreign currency contracts as sterling 
weakened following Brexit uncertainty, 
The term of our foreign currency derivative 
hedges is limited by available credit lines 
and market liquidity. We have hedges in 
place to cover anticipated exposures for 
five years, beyond which there is a risk 
that the cost of our fuel purchases will 
materially increase. We are actively 
working on reducing the long-term cost 
of biomass fuel.
The accounting treatment of derivative 
contracts is set out in note 7.2 to the 
Consolidated financial statements.
OTHER INFORMATION
ACQUISITION OF SCOTTISHPOWER 
GENERATION LIMITED
On 21 December 2018 shareholders 
approved the acquisition of ScottishPower 
Generation Limited and SMW Limited 
and the deal subsequently completed  
on 31 December 2018 for an initial net 
consideration of £687 million after  
working capital adjustments. 
The acquisition terms include a 
compensation mechanism whereby if 
100% of contracted Capacity Market 
payments are not received for the period 
from 1 January to 30 September 2019 
a further payment could be made by  
either the Group or the vendor, up to 
a maximum of £26 million.
The acquisition consideration was paid 
on 2 January 2019 and is included in 
amounts payable in respect of acquisitions 
in the 31 December 2018 Consolidated 
balance sheet. 
Given the short interval between signing 
the purchase agreement and completing 
the sale, a transitional service agreement 
has been executed with ScottishPower 
and includes a range of paid for services 
covering aspects of financial control, 
IT, accounting and payments for up to 
12 months. 
Financial information on the assets and 
liabilities acquired, plus an assessment 
of the impact of the acquisition on our 
financial statements, is provided in note 5.1 
to the Consolidated financial statements.
IMPACT OF BREXIT
The ongoing negotiations for the 
withdrawal of the UK from the European 
Union and the evolving trade policy of the 
US administration continue to increase 
political and regulatory uncertainty. 
The Group continues to monitor these 
situations closely. We are engaged with 
government and regulators in the UK and 
internationally to ensure the Group’s views 
and positions on current and forthcoming 
legislation and regulations, and on energy 
and environmental policy issues that may 
have implications for our business, are 
represented and to promote the benefits 
of biomass. Any associated sterling 
weakness may influence the future cost 
of fuel used by the Power Generation 
business. To manage this risk a number 
of financial instruments, including FX 
options, are used within the foreign 
exchange hedging programme, 
effectively capping future FX liabilities 
on an additional proportion of the future 
foreign currency fuel exposures.
DISTRIBUTIONS
On 20 April 2018, the Group commenced 
a £50 million share buy-back programme, 
designed to reduce share capital 
and return funds to shareholders. 
At 31 December 2018, this was 
substantially complete and the Group 
had bought back £47 million of shares, 
at an average price of 361 pence per share, 
which are held in a separate treasury share 
reserve. The programme was completed 
in January 2019. 
At the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 
2018, shareholders approved payment 
of a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence per share 
(£30 million). The final dividend was paid 
on 11 May 2018.
On 23 July 2018, the Board resolved to pay 
an interim dividend for the six months 
ended 30 June 2018 of 5.6 pence per share 
(£22.4 million), representing 40% of the 
expected full year dividend. The interim 
dividend was paid on 12 October 2018.
At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, on 17 April 2019, the Board 
will recommend to shareholders that a 
resolution is passed to approve payment 
of a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per 
share (£33.6 million), payable on or before 
10 May 2019. Shares will be marked 
ex-dividend on 18 April 2019. This brings 
the total dividend payable for 2018 to 
£56 million and delivers 12% growth on 2017. 
The Board is confident that this level of 
dividend is sustainable and expects it 
to grow as the implementation of the 
business strategy generates an increasing 
proportion of stable earnings and cash 
flows. In determining the rate of growth 
in dividends the Board will take account 
of future investment opportunities and 
the less predictable cash flows from the 
Group’s commodity based businesses. 
If there is a build-up of capital in excess 
of the Group’s investment needs the 
Board will consider the most appropriate 
mechanism to return this to shareholders.
PROFIT FORECASTS
In the Class 1 circular, published on 5 
December 2018 in connection with the 
acquisition of a generation business from 
ScottishPower, we made the following 
statement in relation to the outlook for 
2018: “Outlook for 2018 – continued growth 
in EBITDA”, which constituted a profit 
forecast under the Listing Rules. Our 
financial results for 2018, as set out in this 
Annual report, demonstrate that we have 
achieved a growth of 9% in Adjusted 
EBITDA between 2017 and 2018, which 
is therefore consistent with the profit 
forecast that was made in the circular.
In the Class 1 circular, published on 5 
December 2018 in connection with the 
acquisition of a generation business from 
ScottishPower, we made a profit forecast in 
relation to the portfolio of assets acquired 
for the 12-month period ending 31 December 
2019. Full details of the profit forecast 
(including the assumptions on which it was 
made and the sensitivity to the Capacity 
Market payments due in 2019) are set out 
on pages 59 and 60 of the Class 1 circular.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
The assessment of viability was led by the 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer in conjunction with divisional 
and functional management teams and 
presented to the Board as part of the 
annual planning process. In reviewing 
this assessment, the Board has considered 
the principal risks faced by the Group, 
relevant financial forecasts and 
sensitivities, the availability of adequate 
funding and the strength of the Group’s 
control environment.
ASSESSMENT PERIOD
The Board conducted this assessment 
over a period of three years, selected for 
the following reasons:
• The Group’s Business Plan (Plan), which 
is prepared annually, updated twice 
during the year and also used for 
strategic decision making, includes 
a range of financial forecasts and 
associated sensitivity analysis. This Plan 
covers a three-year period in detail, 
before extending into the medium term. 
• Within the three-year period liquid 
commodity market curves and 
established contract positions are used 
in the forecasts. Liquid curves typically 
cover a one to two-year window and 
contracts cover periods between one 
and ten years. In particular, the Group 
benefits from the stable and material 
earnings stream available from the CfD 
until 2027. Selecting a three-year period 
balances short-term market liquidity 
against longer term contractual positions.
• There is limited certainty around the 
Group’s markets and regulatory regimes. 
However, in selecting a three-year period 
the Board has assumed no material 
changes to the medium term regulatory 
environment and associated support 
regimes beyond those already 
announced at the date of this report.
REVIEW OF PRINCIPAL RISKS
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, set out in detail on  
pages 44 to 49, have been considered  
over the period.
The principal risks with the potential to 
exert significant influence on viability are: 
commodity price changes, political and 
regulatory changes, and plant operating 
failures. A significant adverse change to 
the status of each risk has the potential 
to place material financial stress on 
the Group.
The risks were evaluated, where possible, 
to assess the potential impact of each on 
the viability of the Group, should that risk 
arise in its unmitigated form. The potential 
inputs were included, where appropriate, 
as sensitivities to the Plan and considered 
by the Board as part of the approval 
process, in January 2019, before the 
Plan was adopted by the Group.
The Group has a proven track record of 
adapting to changes to its environment 
and deploying innovative solutions to 
protect financial performance. Adverse 
events over the past 18 months have 
tested the ability of the Group to deliver its 
targets, but on each occasion it has been 
able to respond positively and manage 
the impact. This provides the Board with 
confidence that risks can be mitigated, 
and viability can be maintained, during 
the assessment period. 
The Board also considered the impact of 
Brexit, concluding that the Group’s FX 
hedging programme provides mitigation 
against FX volatility, whilst recognising 
that a material carbon asset may exist 
in the event of a no deal Brexit. 
REVIEW OF FINANCIAL FORECASTS
The Plan considers the Group’s financial 
position, performance, cash flows, credit 
metrics and other key financial ratios and 
was most recently updated to reflect 
current market and external environment 
conditions in December 2018. It is built 
by business and segment, and includes 
growth assumptions appropriate to the 
markets each business serves. The Plan 
for 2019 includes the generation and 
other assets acquired from ScottishPower 
on 31 December 2018.
The Plan includes certain assumptions, 
the most material of which relate to 
commodity market price curves and levels 
of subsidy support available to the Group 
through the generation of biomass-fueled 
renewable power. It is underpinned by the 
stable revenues available through the 
generation of CfD-backed electricity 
and contracted sales to B2B Energy 
Supply customers.
The Plan is subject to stress testing, which 
involves the construction of reasonably 
foreseeable scenarios, including those 
aligned to the principal risks, which test 
the robustness of the Plan when key 
variables are flexed both individually 
and in unison. 
Scenarios were constructed to 
consider the financial impact of Principal 
Risks occuring during the period, 
either as one-off events (e.g significant 
outage) or a sustained downturn 
(e.g commodity prices).
Where such scenarios suggest a risk to 
viability, the availability and quantum of 
mitigating actions is considered and the 
scenario is reassessed including plausible 
mitigations, which include acceleration 
of cash receipts, reductions to capital 
expenditure and operating costs and 
changes to trading strategies. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Group over a period 
significantly longer than the 12 months  
required by the going concern provision.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
The Board considers the most material 
scenario in the assessment period to be 
a significant deterioration of commodity 
market prices, leading to a fall in the 
available price for power and thus a fall in 
the margins available to the Group from 
power generation and supply activities. 
This is based on a ‘low case’ where power 
prices fall by greater than £10/MWh from 
base case assumptions. This impact would 
however be partially mitigated through 
the earnings stability provided by the CfD, 
the Group’s ability to trade effectively 
in volatile power markets and reductions 
to discretionary expenditure. 
The Plan also included assessment of 
a scenario considering the risk of the 
recently-suspended capacity market 
remaining closed during the period. The 
Board believes that the Capacity Market 
will be reinstated in some form during 
2019, but mitigating actions are available 
if this does not occur.
Based on its review, the Board is satisfied 
the viability of the Group would be 
preserved in a range of scenarios, 
including significant deterioration 
of commodity market prices.
AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FUNDING
The sources of funding available to the 
Group are set out in note 4.3 to the 
Consolidated financial statements (see 
page 142). The Board expects these 
sources, along with stable cash flows 
generated by the Group from its normal 
operations, to provide adequate levels of 
funding to support the execution of the 
Group’s Plan.
During the year the Group restructured 
its debt facilities, including the placement 
of a new $300 million bond, maturing in 
November 2025, to fix future debt service 
costs. The existence of established bond 
facilities, across the UK and US, provides 
the Group with the ability to access debt 
markets, should that need arise during 
the viability assessment period. Details 
of current facilities are described on 
page 40 of the Group Financial Review, 
and in Note 4.3 to the Consolidated 
financial statements.
On 2 January 2019, the Group drew  
down £550 million of its £725 million 
acquisition facility (maturing by July 2020) 
to support the acquisition of assets 
from ScottishPower. The Group is well 
positioned to refinance the acquisition 
facility promptly and the Board is 
confident that the Group has access to 
a range of options to maintain a robust 
capital structure. 
EXPECTATIONS
The directors have considered a range of 
factors in their assessment of viability over 
the next three years, including the latest 
Plan, scenario analysis, levels of funding, 
the control environment and the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
The directors have also considered 
the availability of actions within their 
control in the event of plausible negative 
scenarios occurring. They therefore have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period of their assessment.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
We manage the commercial 
and operational risks faced by 
the Group in accordance with 
policies approved by the Board.
We have reviewed the principal risks and 
consider they are broadly unchanged from 
the previous year, with the addition of 
Transaction risks to reflect the risks 
associated with the acquisition of 
generation assets from ScottishPower.
The Board is responsible for defining risk 
appetite and ensuring the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal controls 
across the Group. The Group has a 
comprehensive system of governance 
controls to manage key risks.
GROUP APPROACH TO RISK 
MANAGEMENT
The effective identification and 
management of risk across the Group is 
integral to the delivery of our strategy. 
The risk appetite determined by the 
Board varies dependent on the risk and 
guides the principles of the Group’s culture 
and behaviour, and the intensity of risk 
management activities in achieving our 
business objectives. 
The Group has a Risk Management Policy, 
that was reviewed this year and approved 
by the Board, which defines the Group’s 
approach to risk management. The key 
elements of the Policy are as follows:
• identify principal risks that threaten 
the achievement of our strategic 
objectives then assess their significance 
to the business;
• put in place appropriate mitigating 
controls to manage identified risks 
to an acceptable level;
• escalate and report principal risk 
and control information to support 
management decision making;
• assign responsibility and define 
accountabilities for risk management 
and put these into practice across 
the Group;
• continuously monitor the changing risk 
environment, the Group’s principal risks, 
the effectiveness of mitigation strategies 
and the application of the risk 
framework.
The approach manages rather than 
eliminates the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and provides 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE
The risk management governance 
structure includes executive level 
principal risk owners and two Group 
risk management committees (RMCs) 
whose responsibilities include:
• ensuring that risks are identified, 
assessed and managed effectively 
within risk appetites and limits, 
including new and emerging risks;
• demonstrating robust governance 
of risk management by reviewing and 
challenging risk management across 
the Group and driving the completion 
of actions to manage risks within risk 
appetites and limits;
• driving an appropriate risk management 
culture, and an environment that 
promotes and creates positive risk-taking 
behaviour and clear accountability.
The Group RMCs receive reports from 
business unit RMCs and undertake reviews 
of the management of each principal risk 
across the Group. 
Each business unit has RMCs that:
• report to the executive management of 
that area, assisting in the management of 
their risks. Each executive is responsible 
for ensuring that all risks associated 
with their specific area of the business 
are identified, analysed and managed 
systematically and appropriately;
• has terms of reference that require local 
level risk policies and control systems 
to be approved, implemented and 
monitored to ensure that activities are 
commensurate with the risk appetite 
established by the Board, are adequately 
resourced and comply with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
The Group Executive Committee and 
the Board review reporting on risks from 
the Group RMCs and from Group Risk. 
In addition, the Audit Committee reviews 
the suitability and effectiveness of risk 
management processes and controls 
on behalf of the Board.

INTERNAL CONTROL
The Group has a comprehensive and 
well-defined internal control system with 
clear structures, delegated authority levels 
and accountability. The Board has adopted 
a schedule of matters which are required 
to be brought to it for decision. The internal 
control system is designed to ensure that 
the directors maintain full and effective 
control over all significant strategic, 
financial and organisational issues.
Through the Audit Committee, the Board 
has implemented a programme of internal 
audits of different aspects of the Group’s 
activities. The programme is developed 
based on an assessment of the key risks 
of the Group, the existing assurance and 
controls in place to manage the risks and 
the core financial control framework.
The results of each internal audit are 
documented in a report for internal 
distribution and action. A full copy of 
the report is distributed to the Group 
Executive Committee and the Chair of 
the Audit Committee, with an executive 
summary going to the other members of 
the Audit Committee. Each report includes 
management responses to Internal 
Audit’s findings and recommendations 
and an agreement of the actions that 
management will take to improve the risk 
management and the internal control 
framework. In addition to the results of 
work undertaken by Internal Audit, the 
Audit Committee also satisfies itself that 
an action plan is in place and management 
are addressing issues raised by the 
external auditor in their yearly 
management letter.
Based on the reporting from the Group 
RMCs and from the Audit Committee in 
2018, the Board determined that it was 
not aware of any significant deficiency 
or material weakness in the system of 
internal control.

STRATEGIC RISKS
Context
The Group has a strategy designed to 
strengthen the long-term future of the 
Group. The strategy includes:
 
– Building on our leading market 
position to provide system stability 
through an increasing portfolio of 
flexible; generation and demand. 
This provides higher quality, 
diversified earnings and 
management of commodity market 
exposure by increasing contractual 
and non-commodity related 
earnings; and
 
– Targeted long-term growth 
opportunities with priority on post 
2027 earnings and creating new 
opportunities in all the markets in 
which we operate.
Risk and impact
• Development of new, flexible OCGT 
plants and the re-powering of coal 
units to gas with a battery storage 
option is dependent on winning 
contracts with acceptable returns 
in Capacity Market auctions which 
is uncertain.
• Post 2027 biomass generation 
is dependent upon the cost of 
generation relative to market prices.
• Biomass self-supply requires 
acquisition and/or expansion to 
achieve the 30% self-supply target. 
Acquisition opportunities are 
dependent on willing vendors or 
distressed plants coming to market.
• The energy markets in which we 
operate are evolving at a rapid pace. 
New entrants compete with existing 
players in both power generation and 
B2B Energy Supply and services.
• Diversifying our generation capacity through 
the acquisition of 2.6GW of portfolio of 
pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired 
generation assets.
• Working on reducing projects’ costs to 
increase competitiveness in the Capacity 
Market auction; a disciplined approach to  
the auction means such projects will only go 
forward upon obtaining a suitable contract 
which meets our hurdle rate.
• Working on cost reductions from biomass 
supply and generation efficiency to support 
post-2027 operations.
• Actively pursuing potential acquisitions  
of pellet plant facilities and evaluate the  
case for expansion of existing facilities.
• Continually analysing the changing dynamics 
of the markets in which we operate. 
• Implementing a programme of targeted 
investment to incubate new energy products 
and services to bring to market; research, 
develop and pilot new technologies; and 
develop joint ventures and partnerships 
where we need access to new skills and 
technology.
<
• Acquisition of portfolio of flexible, 
renewable, low carbon assets from 
ScottishPower provides significant 
diversification of long-term earnings 
and expansion of our renewable 
generation model.
• Conversion of fourth unit from coal 
to biomass gives greater flexibility 
of generation. 
• UK Capacity Market payments and 
auctions suspended following ruling 
by the European Court of Justice
• LaSalle pellet facility now fully 
operational supporting self-supply 
target.
PEOPLE RISKS
Context
We need to ensure we have the right 
people in place with the leadership, 
specialist skills and engagement to 
help the Group to compete, innovate 
and grow.
Risk and impact
• Our performance and the delivery 
of our strategy is dependent upon 
having strong, high-quality leaders 
and engaged and talented people 
at all levels of the organisation.
• Maintaining consistent Group-wide 
performance management, potential 
assessment and career development 
frameworks.
• Regularly surveying employees to  
monitor engagement levels and alignment 
of people with Group values.
• Investing in development for all.
• Ensuring regular employee communications.
• Maintaining reward packages to aid 
recruitment and retention.
=
• Continued embedding of our ‘Creating 
a great place to work’ strategy centred 
around valuing people, driving 
business performance and focusing 
on talent. This is placing greater onus 
on performance, learning, equitable 
treatment and consistency in 
approach across the Drax Group.
• As part of the acquisition of assets 
from ScottishPower the c.250 
employees who have moved to the 
Drax Group will need continued 
support as they integrate and 
contribute to our culture and processes.

POLITICAL AND REGULATORY RISKS
Context
We remain alert to changes in 
government policy at UK and EU level. 
The energy sector is subject to detailed 
legislation and regulation that is 
frequently changing as the economy 
trends towards decarbonising and 
decentralising. Regulation and 
compliance generally applicable to 
businesses is also increasing with 
increasing requirements for 
transparency and accountability.
Risk and impact
• Changes to UK policy, regulations or 
tariffs may reduce our ability to deliver 
forecast earnings from our base 
business and our growth strategy 
putting pressure on our financial 
results and cash flows. Issues include 
reform to: legal framework following 
Brexit; data privacy regulation; 
network access and charging 
arrangements; consumer service 
and affordability requirements.
• More complex and challenging 
regulations increase the potential for 
non-compliant outcomes, regulatory 
investigation and sanctions. Brexit 
may require changes in regulatory 
reporting and data requirements.
• Engaging with politicians across the political 
spectrum and Government officials to 
understand and influence perception.
• Communicating our socioeconomic  
value to the UK.
• Working with stakeholders to establish  
Drax as a thought leader on priority policy 
and regulatory issues.
• Engaging with regulators and industry bodies 
to influence strategic direction of, and ensure 
compliance with, regulatory requirements.
• Working with Energy UK to identify market 
improvements, enhance competition and 
develop voluntary codes of practice.
• Maintaining regulatory and compliance 
control frameworks to mitigate the risk 
of non-compliance covering: risk assessment; 
policy development; adequate process; 
training; audit; and continual improvement. 
>
• Brexit continues to create uncertainty. 
Weakened sterling and difficulties in 
cross border trade could influence fuel 
costs and/or lead to customers going 
into financial distress. Delays at ports 
could affect our supplies of fuel and 
components, although the nature of 
our dedicated supply chain mitigates 
this risk.
• The Government has confirmed  
that the Carbon Price Support (CPS)  
is set at approximately the right level 
although the longer term level is 
dependent on how the UK exits the EU.
• The status of the UK Capacity Market 
is uncertain. UK Capacity Market 
payments and auctions are currently 
suspended.
• Many ancillary services require policy, 
regulatory and market change to 
ensure generators are suitably 
compensated for these services.
• Ofgem is reviewing the way in which 
network businesses are remunerated 
and user access is procured/costs 
allocated, which will impact the cost 
base of generators and retailers.
• The Government has introduced a 
price cap for domestic power retailers: 
we remain vigilant to the risk that this 
could be extended to some SMEs.
• The smart meter roll-out continues and 
the obligation to install a smart meter 
for every customer (where reasonable 
steps have been exhausted) remains.
• Failures of small energy suppliers 
(cost mutualisation across industry).
• The acquisition of assets from 
ScottishPower will change our 
engagement with government, 
particularly in Scotland.
BIOMASS ACCEPTABILITY RISKS
Context
The biomass market is still relatively 
new. Sustainability legislation at  
both an EU and UK level, and public 
understanding of the benefits of the 
technology, needs to be improved.
Risk and impact
• EU or UK sustainability policy changes 
could be unworkable and make it 
difficult for us to comply with policy 
requirements and claim subsidy in 
support of economic biomass 
generation.
• Detractors and some environmental 
NGOs influence policy makers against 
biomass use.
• Increased transparency in how we  
evidence sustainability.
• Working with academics, think tanks 
and specialist consultants to improve 
understanding and analysis of the  
benefits of biomass.
• Engaging with key NGOs to discuss issues 
of contention.
• Forging closer relationships with suppliers  
on sustainability through the supplier 
relationship programme.
• Maintaining strong processes to ensure 
compliance with regulation.
• Increased engagement across all European 
Institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council), 
and relevant UK Government departments.
• Developing and maintaining strong coalition 
with other utilities and those engaged in 
forest industries including using EU and US 
forestry expertise to brief Brussels.

• The legislative process for the 
Renewables Energy Directive has 
been completed and our current 
policy and approach satisfies it.

Context
The reliability of our operating plant is 
central to our ability to create value for 
the Group.
Risk and impact
• Single point failures of plant could 
result in forced outages in our 
generation or pellet production plants.
• Successful generation using biomass 
requires stringent quality throughout 
the supply chain, which continues to 
evolve and mature. Poor quality could 
result in unplanned loss of generation.

plant investment and maintenance 
programme.
• Maintaining adequate insurance in place to 
cover losses from plant failure where possible.
• Undertaking significant research and 
development on the production of wood 
pellets as well as the handling and burning 
of biomass.
• Full testing of all biomass supplies prior 
to acceptance and the use of contractual 
rights to reject out of specification cargoes.
• Maintaining stringent safety procedures 
in place for handling biomass and dust 
management.
• Sampling and analysis through the supply 
chain to increase understanding of causes 
of fuel quality issues.

• Commissioning of LaSalle BioEnergy 
which is now fully operational.
• Newly acquired assets from 
ScottishPower may increase the

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SECURITY RISKS
Context
Our IT systems and data are essential to 
supporting the strategy and operations  
of the Group and meeting our legal, 
regulatory and compliance requirements. 
They need to be fit for purpose, fit for use 
and the confidentiality, availability and 
integrity of the systems and data needs  
to be ensured.
Risk and impact
• Delivery of key IT systems transformation 
is needed to support our strategy. 
• Reduced systems performance or 
reduced or non-availability of IT systems, 
data and facilities adversely affecting

ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS
Context
The health and safety of all our 
employees, contractors and visitors is of 
paramount importance to us. We believe 
that a safe, compliant and sustainable 
business model is critical to the delivery 
of our strategy and crucial for sustained 
long-term performance. Safety is at the 
heart of our operational philosophy and 
we continue to work across the Group 
to maintain high standards and a culture 
of safe working. Compliance with 
environmental legislation and our 
environmental permits and consents is 
essential to ensure the long-term future 
of the business.
Risk and impact
• Our operations involve managing a 
range of hazards to personnel and the 
environment that arise from the 
processes we operate.
• Training employees to a high level of 
competence to appreciate and manage 
health, safety and environmental risk.
• Maintaining robust management systems 
designed to mitigate risk.
• Continuous reporting of events and prompt 
implementation of corrective actions.
• Continuously monitoring processes to 
identify trends in performance.
• Auditing of compliance against standards, 
policy and procedures.
• Engaging with regulators and stakeholders 
to identify improvements to our systems 
and operations.
• Investigating the underlying reasons for 
events and implementation of any necessary 
changes in the management system 
and culture.
• Timely identification of future legislation 
and appropriate investment to optimise 
performance.
=
• TRIR continuing at better than the 
industry benchmark. 
• Commissioning of LaSalle BioEnergy 
which is now fully operational. 
• Installation of further fire suppression 
devices in our biomass conveying 
systems.
• Newly acquired generation assets 
from ScottishPower may increase 
the environment, health, safety 
and environmental risks until fully 
integrated.

Mitigations
Movement Changes in factors impacting risk in 2018
TRADING AND COMMODITY RISKS
Context
The margins of our Power Generation 
and B2B Energy Supply businesses are 
influenced by commodity and non-
commodity market movements, which 
are inherently volatile.
Risk and impact
• Uncertainty in trading conditions could 
result in lower margins and a reduction 
in cash flow in our Power Generation 
business.
• Drax Power may fail to secure future 
grid system services contracts which 
are a source of revenue diversity for  
the Group.
• Commercial value from flexibility and 
leveraging a complicated supply chain, 
with uncertain running regimes 
requires good trading performance 
presenting opportunities in the market.
• The value of ROCs generated may be 
lower than forecast if the recycle value 
outturns are below BEIS projections 
due to higher than anticipated 
renewable generation.
• Ensuring high levels of forward power sales 
for 2019/20 and a CfD for one generation 
biomass unit.
• Enhancing optimisation capabilities through 
the newly acquired ScottishPower assets.
• Hedging energy supply commodity price 
exposures when fixed price sales are 
executed with third parties.
• Purchasing wood pellets under long-term 
contracts with fixed pricing.
• Significant hedging of forward foreign 
exchange.
• Hedging fluctuations in ROC generation from 
wind farms through weather derivatives.
=
• Sterling exchange rates against the 
Euro and Dollar remain weak.
• Power prices higher with low market 
liquidity and increased volatility in 
short-term prices.
• Prices for wood pellets increased.
• Generation running regimes optimised 
with managed positions and scenario 
planning .
• Conversion of additional unit to 
biomass provides opportunity for 
greater flexibility of generation and 
management of ROCs.
• Increased power generation, change 
in exposure and additional hedging 
requirements with the acquisition of 
assets from ScottishPower. The OCGT 
plants bring a natural hedge to falling 
gas prices .
• Recent supplier failures have led to 
supplier mutualisation processes 
being invoked for ROCs.
TRANSACTION RISKS
Context
We need to ensure that the integration 
of the assets newly acquired from 
ScottishPower runs smoothly and 
efficiently. In addition, contracted 
capacity payments make up a 
significant portion of the earnings of the 
ScottishPower assets but UK Capacity 
Market payments and auctions are 
suspended following the ruling by 
the European Court of Justice.
Risk and impact
• We may face difficulty in consolidating 
and integrating the assets into our 
procedures and systems.
• The assets may fail to meet our 
expectations.
• The status of the UK Capacity Market 
is uncertain. UK Capacity Market 
payments and auctions are currently 
suspended.
• A detailed integration plan has been 
developed. Performance against the business 
case and key integration milestones will be 
tracked by management and reported 
regularly to the Board and Audit Committee.
• The Group has agreed a risk-sharing 
mechanism with the vendor (Iberdrola S.A.), 
which will activate in the event the Group 
does not receive 100% of the contracted 
Capacity Market payments for the acquired 
assets. The value of any further payment is 
capped at £26 million. Full details of the risk 
sharing mechanism are set out on the 
Group’s website at www.drax.com/cmrisk. 
 
The UK Government has confirmed that the 
Capacity Market ruling does not change its 
belief that Capacity Market auctions are 
the most appropriate way to deliver secure 
electricity supplies at the lowest cost. The UK 
Government also noted that the Capacity 
Market ruling was decided on procedural 
grounds and did not constitute a direct 
challenge to the design of the Capacity 
Market mechanism itself.
NEW
• This risk was not included in 
the previous annual report as 
the acquisition completed on 
31 December 2018.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT:
LETTER FROM THE CHAIR
challenges ahead through our strategic 
planning. We invited experts from outside 
the Company to share their insights and 
experience with the Board, which provided 
us with a broader understanding of the 
factors affecting our markets, assets 
and communities.
Our people – employees and contractors 
– remain a key asset of the business and 
their safety is a long-held commitment 
of our operational philosophy. We pay 
particular regard to our safety 
performance and received regular 
updates from management.
It is important that our decisions as 
a Board are informed by long-term 
considerations. Actions taken today will 
shape the future performance of Drax 
and determine our impact on the world. 
By providing both support and challenge 
to management, in terms of how they 
address material issues, we have helped 
to develop ongoing opportunities for the 
business and to protect the long-term 
interests of stakeholders.
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I am pleased to present our Corporate 
Governance Report for 2018. We believe 
that good governance is essential to 
our continued success. The Board is 
committed to upholding the highest 
standards of governance and works 
closely with the executive team to do so. 
We are supportive of the new 2018 
Corporate Governance Code (2018 Code) 
and are actively engaged in considering 
how we can most effectively apply 
the principles. 
The Board consists of a strong team 
with a wide range of experience across 
various industries. Board membership 
has increased this year, as we continue to 
refresh our skills, experience and diversity. 
KEY AREAS OF FOCUS
In 2018 we made strong progress with the 
strategy we announced in December 2016, 
ending the year with the successful 
acquisition of a portfolio of flexible, low 
carbon and renewable generation assets.
During 2018, we also spent a great deal 
of time discussing the wider economic, 
political and regulatory environment 
and considering the impact on Drax, 
addressing the opportunities and 
BOARD CHANGES
The Board has seen a number of changes 
in 2018. In January, Will Gardiner became 
Group CEO, succeeding Dorothy 
Thompson who retired. His appointment 
followed a thorough review of internal 
and external candidates and was a 
natural successor after two years as CFO 
working alongside Dorothy developing 
the Group’s strategy.
In October we announced the 
appointment of Andy Skelton as Group 
CFO who joined us in January 2019. Andy 
is highly experienced, having previously 
served as CFO at Fidessa Group and held 
senior finance positions at CSR, Ericsson 
and Marconi. 
I would like to extend my thanks to Den 
Jones for his excellent job as Interim CFO, 
supporting the delivery of the strategy 
and the acquisition of the ScottishPower 
assets. Den will remain with the Group 
until May 2019 to support the process 
of integrating those assets.
I am delighted to welcome Vanessa Simms 
to the Board who joined as a Non-executive 
director in June 2018. As reported in our 
Annual Report last year, Nicola Hodson 
joined in January 2018. Details of these 
new appointments can be found in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 65.
Setting the right standards 
on governance helps  
protect the business and  
the interest of stakeholders.”

CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE
Our aim is to maintain an open and 
collaborative culture across all areas of the 
business. We believe that an effective and 
well embedded corporate culture helps 
to create a successful business. This will 
continue to be a key focus of the Board.
Good governance and behaviours are 
essential characteristics of how a 
successful business is run and how it 
reports, and we place high expectations on 
ourselves and therefore all of our people. 
Setting the right standards helps to 
protect the business and the interests 
of our stakeholders.
BOARD INDUCTION AND EVALUATION 
A comprehensive induction programme 
is important for all of our new Board 
members. Both Nicola and Vanessa 
participated during 2018. We also run 
a programme of continuing evaluation 
for the Board to assess its effectiveness. 
More details of our evaluation and 
induction processes in the year are set 
out on pages 65 and 68. 
OUR VALUES

Energised

Together 
We work collaboratively with our colleagues, customers and stakeholders with a friendly 
approach and recognise the value each of us brings to achieving our Group vision
SUCCESSION PLANNING AND DIVERSITY 
We recognise the importance of diversity 
within the Group and we report on Board 
and Executive Committee composition 
and diversity on pages 52 to 54. We have 
set a clear target to increase female 
representation in senior leadership across 
the Group, to build a more diverse and 
inclusive business. By the end of 2020 
our aim is to have 40% of senior leadership 
roles (Executive Committee and career 
levels 1 to 3) held by women. At the end 
of 2018 the figure was 27%.
We are committed to regular reviews of our 
succession planning, making sure that it is 
aligned to the Group’s strategy. In addition 
to the succession planning for Board roles, 
the Nomination Committee received an 
update from the Group People Director 
on succession planning for senior 
management and the talent pipeline. 
Throughout the year, directors took 
opportunities to meet with senior 
management across the Group including 
at the leadership team meeting in York 
and other informal discussions throughout 
the year.
The Board, through the Nomination 
Committee, also regularly reviews the 
length of tenure, skills and experience 
of the Board.
Maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance across the Group 
is a priority for the Board. This is integral 
to the delivery of our strategy and for 
creating sustainable long-term value 
for the benefit of our shareholders 
and stakeholders.
Philip Cox CBE
Chair
The Board provides strong stewardship of 
the Group, shaping our purpose and strategy

Governance
All Board committees are authorised to obtain legal or other 
professional advice as necessary, to secure the attendance 
of external advisers at their meetings and to seek information 
required from any employee of the Group in order to perform 
their duties.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles), give the 
directors power to authorise conflicts of interest. The Board has 
an effective procedure to identify potential conflicts of interest, 
consider them for authorisation and record them. The Articles 
also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in Group companies 
without restriction (for example to appoint a director to a Group 
company). The Articles are available on the Group’s website at 
www.drax.com.
The Company has appropriate insurance cover in place in respect 
of legal action against directors of the Company and its 
subsidiaries.

The Board and its committees have regular scheduled

committee meetings, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and 
any General Meetings.
• The Board has eight scheduled meetings each year.
• In 2018, additional meetings were held (by telephone)  
to address matters requiring formal decisions.
• A shareholder General Meeting was held in December 2018 
in order to approve the acquisition of ScottishPower 
generation assets.
• The Board meets at least annually to consider strategy.

The key responsibilities of members of the Board are as follows:

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing 
on 1 January 2018, the Company has complied in full with the 
principles of the Code issued in April 2016. The Code can be found 
on the Financial Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk.
With the exception of Nicola Hodson, who was appointed as a 
director on 12 January 2018, Vanessa Simms who was appointed 
as a director on 19 June 2018, and Andy Skelton who was 
appointed as a director on 2 January 2019, all of the directors 
listed on pages 52–53 served throughout the year. Each of 
those listed remained directors as at the date of the approval 
of this report. Biographical details of the directors appear on 
pages 52–53.
TIME COMMITMENT
Directors’ other commitments are kept under review to ensure 
that they have sufficient time to dedicate to our business. Under 
the terms of their letter of appointment, the Chair is expected to 
commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to this role. Under the 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment, each is expected 
to commit 12 to 15 full days a year. That includes attendance at 
Board meetings, the AGM, one annual Board strategy away day 
and at least one site visit per year. 
In addition, they are expected to devote appropriate preparation 
time ahead of each meeting. The time commitment expected 
in respect of their membership of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees is an additional three to four full days 
a year in each case. However, in practice considerably more time 
is devoted, particularly by the Chairs of the Board committees. 
Non-executive directors also spend time with management, 
to maintain their knowledge of the developing business and 
to understand the operational challenges being faced.
In January 2019 Phil Cox took on the role of Executive Chair at 
Kier Group plc on an interim basis during the search for a new CEO 
at Kier. The Board considered and approved his taking on of this 
additional interim commitment, and was confident that he would 
be able to continue to devote the appropriate time to his role as 
Chair of the Group. 
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS, INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS  
AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
Other than a service contract between the executive directors 
and a Group company, or as noted in the Remuneration 
Committee report, no director had a material interest at any time 
during the year in any significant contract with the Company 
or any of its subsidiary undertakings.
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
because of a takeover bid.
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-executive 
director. None of the non-executive directors who served during 
the year had any material business or other relationship with the 
Group, and there were no other matters that were likely to affect 
their independence of character and judgement. The Board 
recognises that in view of the characteristics of independence 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, length of service 
is an important factor when considering the independence of 
non-executive directors and that directors having served for 
longer than nine years may not be considered independent. 
In November 2017, David Lindsell was re-appointed for a fourth 
time until the 2019 AGM. David is the Chair of the Audit 
Committee and the Senior Independent Director. The Board 
considered that David Lindsell’s experienced oversight in ensuring 
careful financial stewardship as Chair of the Audit Committee was 
crucial during a period of change in the implementation of the 
new strategy, the development of the new Group CEO into that 
role, and the selection and appointment of a new Group CFO. 
To have David continuing in post during this period of transition, 
and assisting in the recruitment and induction of a new 
Audit Committee Chair in 2018, was considered to be an integral 
part of ongoing good financial governance. When David steps 
down after the 2019 AGM he will have served on the Board for 
over ten years. The Board is satisfied that David’s judgement 
has remained wholly independent and that he has consistently 
displayed all of the behaviours expected of our independent 
non-executive directors. 
The Board considers all of the non-executive directors 
to be independent.

CASE STUDY
The Board’s role in the acquisition 
of ScottishPower generation assets
During 2018, the Board considered the potential acquisition of a portfolio of flexible low 
carbon and renewable generation assets. Early discussions included a consideration of, 
among other matters:
• Rationale for the transaction
• Alignment with strategy
• Integration plan
• Key risks
• Key financial considerations
Further preliminary work took place over the following months so that the Board was able 
to consider the opportunities and risks in greater detail. The Board received advice from 
internal teams including legal, treasury and finance functions and external advisers 
including legal, corporate brokers and the corporate sponsor.
Detailed papers to help the Board consider various aspects of the acquisition opportunity 
were considered including:
• Risk analysis
• Financial projections
• Funding 
• Integration
• Effect on the Group’s legal requirements
• Terms of the transaction
The effect on the Group’s key stakeholders including shareholders, the workforce, customers, 
the community, external industry and environmental stakeholders was also considered.
A number of Board meetings were held to review the progress of negotiations and approve 
next steps. Day-to-day consideration of the transaction was delegated to a committee of 
the Board. In between formal Board meetings, the Chair, CEO and other members of senior 
management updated the Board on significant developments. Procedures were put in 
place to deal with any potential leak of market-sensitive information.
On 21 December 2018, shareholders in a General Meeting approved the transaction, 
which was completed on 31 December 2018.

SUCCESSION PLANNING
Good succession planning contributes to the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy by ensuring the desired mix of skills and 
experience of Board members now and in the future. In 2019, 
three of our longest serving non-executive directors will be 
stepping down following the end of their tenure. In line with 
existing succession plans, arrangements are already in place to 
ensure, where appropriate, the smooth and effective transition 
into positions made vacant by these changes.
David Lindsell will step down after the 2019 AGM and will 
be succeeded as Audit Committee Chair by Vanessa Simms. 
David has been mentoring Vanessa as part of a structured 
induction programme to help with a smooth transition into 
the role. Tony Thorne will step down in June 2019 and will 
be succeeded as Chair of the Remuneration Committee by 
Nicola Hodson from the 2019 AGM. Nicola, who was appointed 
to the Remuneration Committee on her appointment to the 
Board in January 2018, has been mentored by Tony Thorne 
and will have served on the Committee for 15 months when 
she becomes the Remuneration Committee Chair. Finally, 
Tim Cobbold’s tenure will come to an end in September 2019, 
having by then completed nine years.
David Nussbaum will be appointed as the Senior Independent 
Director from the 2019 AGM to succeed David Lindsell.
In addition to the recent appointment of Nicola Hodson and 
Vanessa Simms, the search for another new non-executive 
director is underway.
The Board is also committed to recognising and nurturing talent 
within executive and management levels across the Group to 
ensure that opportunities are created to develop current and 
future leaders. Through 2017 we developed a new people 
strategy which focuses on driving performance and developing 
talent to deliver the Group’s objectives. During 2018 Group-wide 
practices have been established, including a career development 
and behaviour framework, focusing on performance and 
personal development. 
DIRECTORS’ DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTION
To assist the Board in undertaking its responsibilities, a 
programme of training and development is available to all 
directors. Training needs are assessed as part of the Board 
evaluation procedure. The Board programme includes regular 
presentations from management and informal meetings to 
build understanding of the business and sector.
During the year, Board meetings took place in London, Selby 
and Northampton and included site tours, informal walkabouts 
and presentations from local management to give directors 
deeper understanding of, and insight into, particular issues faced 
by the business.
During the year directors had access to the advice and services 
of the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. Directors 
may take independent advice at the Company’s expense when 
it is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. No such independent advice was sought in 2018. 
All new directors receive a comprehensive and tailored induction 
programme, including meetings with key managers, sites visits, 
and briefings on key operational matters, Board procedures and 
governance matters. Both Nicola Hodson and Vanessa Simms 
participated in such inductions during 2018. This included 
specific elements for assuming the roles respectively of Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee and Chair of the Audit Committee.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The feedback from our stakeholder engagement activities is 
available to the Board through the Executive Committee. This 
ensures that the interests of all stakeholders are considered, 
when relevant, in our decision making and is supportive of the 
Board’s duty to promote the success of the Company as set out 
in Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. (For further detail and 
information on stakeholder engagement and communication 
please refer to pages 32 and 33.)
61
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued
Understanding the needs of our 
various stakeholders is essential 
to our long-term success
> OUTCOMES
The AGM provides all shareholders with a forum to put questions 
to the Board of directors, and to vote on important issues.
Shareholder meetings
Through the year the management team are available to meet 
shareholders and, in addition, following the full and half year 
results, a structured programme of meetings is arranged to 
allow management to meet with institutional shareholders 
and prospective investors.
The Board receives reports of meetings which have taken place 
with institutional shareholders, together with regular market 
updates, which give the directors a clear understanding of their 
views and concerns. The Chair and Senior Independent Director 
are also available to meet with shareholders, independently 
of the executive directors, as required. 
During 2018 the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
Tony Thorne, consulted with shareholders on the proposed 
changes to the Remuneration Policy.
> OUTCOMES
This allows the owners of the business to have access  
to management, for a two-way conversation, to better 
understand the business, its operation and strategy.
Sell-side analyst engagement
Executive directors engage with sell-side analysts at the full 
and half year results presentations, and the Head of Investor 
Relations is in regular dialogue with analysts. 
Financial results are communicated to the market twice a year, 
at the preliminary and interim results, where a presentation is 
given to sell-side analysts, which is made available to the public 
through a webcast on the Group’s website. 
> OUTCOMES
Allows analysts and investors to have up-to-date and accurate 
information on the business and its strategy so that they can 
come to an informed view on the Company’s performance 
and prospects. 
Engaging with our shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given a high priority. The 
Chair is keen to ensure that he maintains an open relationship 
with the Company’s major shareholders, communicates 
directly with them and offers them the opportunity to meet 
any other directors. This enables the Board to understand 
their views on the Group and its governance.
Through the course of the year, the Group Chief Executive 
Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer and Head of Investor 
Relations meet with institutional shareholders and sell-side 
analysts (see opposite). These meetings allow us to discuss 
the Company’s business model, strategy and marketplace, 
as well as provide an update on performance. Meetings are 
arranged proactively and on request and often include site 
visits, which provide shareholders with valuable insight into 
the Group’s operations.
The Group engages Makinson Cowell, part of the KPMG Group, 
to advise and assist with communications with shareholders 
and regularly discusses matters with its brokers, Royal Bank 
of Canada and JP Morgan.
HOW DO WE ENGAGE?
The Annual General Meeting
The AGM is attended by the full Board of directors. 
Shareholders are encouraged to attend, ask questions 
and join the directors for informal discussions over coffee.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the 2019 AGM 
can be found in the Notice of AGM at www.drax.com. 
A printed copy of the notice can also be obtained from 
our registrars, Equiniti, or the Group Company Secretary. 
Details for both can be found on page 191.

Engaging with our employees
We recognise how important engaged and motivated 
employees are to the continued success of the business. 
That is why we communicate with our employees through 
various channels.
HOW DO WE ENGAGE? 
“Ask Will”
Each week the CEO takes questions from across the Group 
on a wide range of topics. His responses are shared with the 
whole workforce.
> OUTCOMES
Allows the CEO to hear the employee “voice” directly, 
and allows employees to receive direct feedback on 
their questions.
Employee voice
The Executive Committee and the Board have discussed the 
best and most effective means of engaging with employees. 
More direct interface by Board members with employee 
forums will commence in 2019 and be regularly reviewed 
to ensure it is effective and meaningful. 
> OUTCOMES
Allows the Board to gain greater insight into matters that 
are most important to employees, engaging directly with 
employee representatives, and being able to share the 
Board’s views on employee matters and, more broadly, 
the future of the business.
Beyond Coal
Executive director, Andy Koss, led ongoing engagement 
with employees in the Power Generation business on the 
largest transformation in the history of the power station.
> OUTCOMES
Gave employees the opportunity to learn more about 
future plans and progress being made. The Board 
attended a Beyond Coal Exhibition to meet employees.
Employee engagement 
The Board receives regular updates on employee matters, 
including engagement scores, wellbeing initiatives, 
gender pay gap reporting and safety.
> OUTCOMES
Provides a foundation to support richer conversations with 
employees as the employee voice framework develops.

Chair
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
• keep under review the Board’s structure, size and composition 
(including requisite skills, diversity, knowledge and experience);
• conduct the search and selection process for new directors, 
taking advice from independent search consultants as 
appropriate; and
• ensure a rigorous succession planning process for the directors 
and other senior managers, including the identification of 
candidates from both within and outside the Group.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES IN 2018
• Appointed Vanessa Simms as a non-executive director
• Appointed Andy Skelton as Group Chief Financial Officer
• Considered the effectiveness and performance of the Board 
and its committees
• Reviewed management development and succession planning
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2018.
When considering the appointment of new directors the 
Committee adopts a formal process which considers the skills, 
knowledge, diversity and experience that support the Company 
in delivering its strategic goals. This includes providing the Board 
with an appropriate balance and mix of skills required for both 
now and in the future. 
As Chair of the Committee, I am responsible for overseeing the 
progress made towards improving diversity in appointments to 
the Board and supporting an effective succession plan for senior 
management in a way that is consistent with the long-term 
strategy of the Group. The Committee will continue to monitor 
the balance of the Board to ensure sufficient breadth and depth 
of expertise is available from the existing members, and will 
recommend further appointments to the Board as appropriate. 
The Committee also takes an active interest in the quality 
and development of talent and capabilities below Board level, 
ensuring that appropriate opportunities are in place to develop 
high-performing individuals and to build diversity in senior roles 
across the business.

DIRECTORATE CHANGES 
As detailed in last year’s annual report, Will Gardiner was appointed 
as Group CEO in January 2018 and Den Jones was appointed on 
an interim basis as CFO. 
In conducting our search for a CFO, a thorough and rigorous 
recruitment process was initiated and overseen by the 
Committee. Heidrick & Struggles/JCA Group was appointed to 
assist with the search and ensure a comprehensive search of the 
external market. Heidrick & Struggles/JCA Group has signed up 
to the Hampton Alexander voluntary code of conduct on gender 
diversity and, aside from assisting with recruitment, has no 
connection with the Group. Due to the complex and technical 
nature of the Drax business the search was specifically looking for 
a CFO who would be able to quickly get up to speed and credibly 
engage with the wide variety of operational activities across 
the Group as well as play a key role in shaping its future. When 
assessing the relative importance of different skills, it was felt 
that core skills of control, reporting, cost management and 
process understanding were particularly important.
The candidate selection process focused on both technical 
expertise and experience as well as the behavioural traits 
important for success at Drax. In particular, the ability to look for 
the right solution, innovate for a better future, embrace change 
and lead teams. Psychometric tests were used to further 
enhance and refine the selection decision. 
As we announced in October 2018, Andy Skelton joined the Board 
as Group CFO in January 2019. 
Andy Skelton was chosen for this role due to his experience in 
building and leading finance teams, and also understanding and 
optimising processes, both within finance and across businesses. 
He has strong core financial control and accounting expertise 
and very good experience of driving business transformation. 
Two new non-executive directors also joined the Board in 2018. 
Firstly, Nicola Hodson, whose appointment was reported in 
our Annual report and accounts last year, joined in January 
bringing her experience in technology, business transformation 
and energy. Nicola will succeed Tony Thorne as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee from the 2019 AGM. Secondly, 
Vanessa Simms who joined in June, has more than 20 years’ 
experience in senior finance roles, bringing a particular focus 
on implementing strategic change. Vanessa will succeed 
David Lindsell as Chair of the Audit Committee, when he 
steps down on the conclusion of this year’s AGM. 
In considering the selection of candidates for these two new 
non-executive appointments, the Committee reflected on the 
attributes, skills and experience necessary for suitable successors 
to the roles of Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairs. Finally, 
Tim Cobbold will step down in September 2019, as by that date he 
will have completed nine years on the Board.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will be 
appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the Board 
being satisfied with the director’s performance and commitment, 
and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate AGM, may be 
renewed by mutual agreement. The Board will not normally 
extend the aggregate period of service of any independent 
non-executive director beyond nine years, and any proposal made 
to extend a non-executive director’s aggregate period of office 
beyond six years is subject to rigorous review. 
On page 58 we explain the rationale for David Lindsell remaining 
on the Board until the 2019 AGM, notwithstanding that his term 
as Non-executive director exceeds nine years.
I would like to thank David Lindsell, Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold 
for their very considerable contributions to the Board during 
a period of significant changes for the business.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATION
The Board recognises that it continually needs to monitor and 
improve its performance. This is achieved through the annual 
performance evaluation, full induction of new Board members 
and ongoing Board development activities. 
For 2018 it was determined that an internal Board performance 
evaluation would be most beneficial to the Company. The Chair 
and the Group Company Secretary coordinated the evaluation 
ensuring that areas of focus arising from last year in particular 
were subject to review.
The form of questionnaire was approved by the Chair, 
and was subsequently completed by all directors. Following 
completion of the questionnaires, the Chair holds a series 
of one-to-one meetings with each of the directors to allow 
him to fully evaluate the performance of the Board, each of 
its Committees and individual Board members.

SUCCESSION PLANNING AND DIVERSITY
The Board recognises that effective succession planning is 
key to the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives. 
It is also integral to maintaining an effective Board. Selecting 
and supporting the right individuals is an essential role of the 
Committee. In November, the Group People Director provided 
an update to the Committee on the talent succession 
and development programme with a strong focus on the 
leadership pipeline. By the end of 2020, the aim is to have 
40% of senior leadership roles held by women.
The Board embraces diversity in its broadest sense, believing that 
a wide range of experience, background, perspective, skills and 
knowledge is the foundation of a high performing and effective 
team. As part of our commitment to this, the Board’s Diversity 
Policy was reviewed and updated by the Committee. The review 
included aspects of new and emerging best practice and 
regulatory developments in the area of senior management 
and Board diversity. The policy now covers race, gender, 
educational and professional background. 
As well as bringing important skills and experience from their 
respective backgrounds, the addition of Nicola Hodson and 
Vanessa Simms to the Board has improved the Board’s gender 
diversity. This will continue to be a key consideration during 
2019 when we seek to recruit a new non-executive director 
to the board. 
SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOARD
 A key responsibility of the Committee is to ensure that the 
Board maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
appropriate to the long-term operation of the business and 
delivery of the strategy. As in past years, the Nomination 
Committee has reviewed the composition of the Board and 
as part of this review the Committee considered whether the:
• Board contains the right mix of skills, experience and diversity;
• Board has an appropriate balance of executive directors 
and non-executive directors; and
• non-executive directors are able to commit sufficient 
time to the Company in order to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.
Following the review, the Committee was satisfied that the Board 
continues to have an appropriate mix of skills and experience, 
both for now and for the future, to operate effectively. All the 
directors have many years of experience, gained from a broad 
range of businesses and they collectively bring a range of 
expertise and knowledge of different business sectors to Board 
deliberations, which encourages constructive, challenging and 
innovative discussions.

INDUCTION OF NEW DIRECTORS
All new directors receive a comprehensive, tailored, induction. 
During the year, Nicola Hodson and Vanessa Simms were 
appointed as non-executive directors. It was anticipated that 
Nicola would be appointed as Remuneration Committee Chair 
and that Vanessa would be appointed as Audit Committee 
Chair and as such their induction programmes were tailored 
accordingly. More details can be found in the table above.
RENEWAL AND RE-ELECTION
If the Board appoints a director, that director must retire at the 
first AGM following their appointment. That director may, if they 
so wish, put themselves forward for election. Vanessa Simms 
and Andy Skelton were appointed by the Board subsequent to 
the 2018 AGM and therefore they will retire and offer themselves 
for election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The Articles provide that one-third of directors shall retire by 
rotation each year and are eligible for re-election by shareholders 
at the AGM. In accordance with the Code, the Company will 
continue its practice to propose all directors for annual re-
election. Accordingly, each of Tim Cobbold, Philip Cox, Will 
Gardiner, Nicola Hodson Andy Koss, David Nussbaum and Tony 
Thorne will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, 
offer themselves up for re-election. David Lindsell will be 
standing down on the conclusion of the AGM. 
Following the evaluation and review of the Board described 
above, I concluded that the directors offering themselves for 
election and re-election continue to demonstrate commitment, 
management and business expertise in their particular role and 
continue to perform effectively. The election and re-election 
respectively of each director is recommended by the Board. 
Further information of the service contracts for the executive 
directors and letters of appointment for the non-executive 
directors are set out in a table on page 97.
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
by prior arrangement during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office. They will also be available for 
inspection at the venue of the AGM, prior to that meeting, 
details of which are contained in the Notice of Meeting.
During the year, I held 8 meetings with the non-executive 
directors in the absence of the executive directors, and, 
separately, the Senior Independent Director held a meeting 
with the non-executive directors without me being present, 
as required by provision A.4.2 of the Code.
This report was reviewed and approved by the  
Nomination Committee.

ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee’s role is unchanged. It assists the Board to fulfil 
its oversight responsibilities by undertaking the following:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and other 
information provided to shareholders;
• reviewing significant financial reporting issues and judgements 
contained in the financial statements;
• advising the Board on whether the Committee believes the 
annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable;
• maintaining an appropriate relationship with the Group’s 
external auditor and review the effectiveness and objectivity 
of the external audit process;
• reviewing the systems of internal control and risk management;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function; and
• making recommendations to the Board (to put to shareholders 
for approval) regarding that appointment of the external auditor.
AUDIT COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES IN 2018
The Audit Committee follows a programme of work designed to 
ensure that the Group has sound risk management processes, 
a robust system of internal control and delivers fair and balanced 
performance reporting.
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in 
accordance with an annual work plan, which is agreed in 
November for the following calendar year. A rolling 12-month plan 
is also reviewed at each meeting, to enable the consideration 
of any emerging issues to be scheduled. 
The main areas of work undertaken by the Committee at each 
of its routinely scheduled meetings during 2018 are set out on 
page 70. In addition, the Committee met in November 2018 
to review the contents of the shareholder circular in relation to 
the acquisition of power generation assets from ScottishPower 
and recommend that the Board approve the circular.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed annually 
by the Committee and then by the Board. The terms of

The Committee receives annual updates on financial risks and 
controls from each of the Group’s primary business units. The 
Pellet Production, Power Generation and B2B Energy Supply 
businesses each attended a Committee meeting to discuss the 
risk management and internal control systems in their businesses.
During the year the Committee met the external auditor twice, 
and the Head of Group Risk and Internal Audit once in the 
absence of management. No matters of concern were drawn 
to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. 
The Committee’s understanding with both the external and 
internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become 
aware of any matters giving them significant concern, they 
will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention via the  
Chair of the Committee.
REVIEWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM  
OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Committee received updates on the Group’s internal control 
environment and feedback on internal audit reports at each 
meeting. Risk mitigations and progress with previously agreed 
actions were monitored and progress discussed. 
During 2018 two areas of control weakness were identified: 
cyber security operational controls and payroll at Opus Energy.
Whilst no serious cyber security breaches have occurred and 
Drax has continued to invest in a range of cyber security 
solutions, an internal audit review of cyber security controls 
in Power Generation and Drax Corporate identified some 
weaknesses in the definition and consistency of operation 
of operational controls. A comprehensive programme designed 
to address these weaknesses, including the establishment of 
a technology governance function, was immediately initiated. 
The majority of the required improvements had been made 
by 31 December 2018 and the remaining actions will be 
completed in 2019.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
No serious issues have arisen with the operation of the Opus 
Energy payroll, but weaknesses in processes and controls were 
identified. These had resulted in a small number of errors in 
payments to staff. Management responded by preparing a plan 
to improve the internal processes which support the payroll, 
including deploying new staff, and also proposed bringing the 
entire payroll in-house. This will be implemented during 2019. 
The Committee also reviews the outcome of whistleblowing 
reports and conducts an annual review on behalf of the Board. 
The Board has access to these reviews and also receives updates 
when issues arise. No issues arose during the year which required 
further investigation by the Committee or the Board.
At the November meeting the Committee considered in detail 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems and also its procedures for detection of 
fraud, based principally on its reviews during the year of key risks 
and internal controls in the Group’s three businesses and its 
corporate functions, the quarterly updates by management on 
the control environment, internal audit findings and discussions 
with the external auditor. 
REVIEWING THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
Between the year-end date and the date of the approval of the 
annual report and accounts, the Committee met in February 2019 
principally to review the draft 2018 Annual report and accounts 
and the external auditor’s findings. The Committee reviewed 
papers prepared by management on accounting issues and 
judgements affecting the accounts and a report from Deloitte 
setting out their audit findings.
The Committee also reviewed the underlying process, internal 
controls, forecasts and relevant assumptions made in preparing 
the Viability Statement, disclosed on page 42. Having challenged 
the assumptions made in this process and considered the 
appropriateness of the three-year period of assessment, the 
Committee concluded that the process supporting the Viability 
Statement was robust and that the Statement was fair.
Explanations of the critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions are set out in detail throughout the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements, with a summary on pages 114 
to 116. The Committee reviewed these aspects of the financial 
statements, paying particular attention to those issues that 
involve the most subjective and complex judgements, namely 
the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts, the 
new presentation of certain re-measurements and exceptional 
items in the consolidated income statement, the measurement of 
unbilled and deferred revenue in the B2B Energy Supply business. 
and the accounting for the acquisition of the portfolio of assets 
from ScottishPower. 
Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Valuation of 
derivative 
financial 
instruments
The Group makes extensive use of derivative financial 
instruments in order to manage key risks facing the 
business and its balance sheet includes significant 
assets and liabilities arising from derivatives which 
are stated at their fair value. 
The fair values for derivative financial instruments are 
determined using forward price curves and, where 
an instrument incorporates an element of optionality, 
an option pricing model.
The inputs to these calculations include assumptions 
regarding future transactions and market movements, 
as well as credit risk, and are therefore subjective.
The fair value of open derivative contracts, which is 
in essence the difference between the contract price 
and the price that could be achieved in the market at 
31 December 2018, was £511 million in the case of 
contracts for which the market value was greater 
than the contract price, and £151 million in the case 
of contracts for which the market value was less than 
the contract price.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s derivative position 
in February, July and November 2018, having regard in 
particular to the critical judgemental areas described 
in note 7.2 to the consolidated financial statements. The 
Committee considered the position as at 31 December 
2018 at its meeting in February 2019, when it also 
reviewed the change in presentation of the consolidated 
income statement triggered by the implementation 
of the new accounting standard IFRS 9, as discussed 
in ‘Presentation of certain re-measurements and 
exceptional items’ below.
At each meeting, management explained the trends 
in market prices that underpinned changes in the 
fair value of the derivative portfolio and highlighted 
any new types of derivative instrument for the 
Committee’s consideration.
The Committee concluded that the fair value 
calculations had been performed in a reasonable and 
consistent manner based on quoted market prices as 
explained in note 7.2 to the consolidated financial 
statements and that the system of controls in place 
was fit for purpose. Accordingly, it was concluded 
that the amounts included in the financial statements 
were appropriate.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued
Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Presentation of 
certain 
remeasurements 
and exceptional 
items
In order to present more clearly what the Group 
considers to be its underlying business performance, 
the Group has this year introduced a columnar 
presentation of its income statement. As well as 
a column that presents all items of income and 
expense in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), Adjusted results that 
exclude exceptional items and reflect certain 
re-measurements of derivative financial instruments 
are reported separately in a different column, with 
a middle column bridging the other two columns. 
This is consistent with the practice followed by 
other major UK power generation companies.
The decisions on classification of exceptional 
items involve judgement as to whether an item 
is truly exceptional by virtue of its nature,  
size and/or incidence.
The Group’s policy is to fix exposures to commodity 
price movements and changes in foreign exchange 
rates using derivative contracts (see notes 7.1 and 7.2 
to the consolidated financial statements). Where such 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
unrealised gains and losses on the contracts are 
credited or charged to income under IFRS. It is the 
Group’s view that such unrealised gains and losses do 
not reflect the underlying performance of the 
business because they are economically related to 
contracted future purchases and sales of 
commodities. Accordingly, such gains and losses are 
excluded from Adjusted results until the related 
contract is recognised as a physical sale or purchase, 
at which point Adjusted results reflect the commodity 
sale or purchase (and any associated foreign 
exchange contract) at the contracted price(s).
For each of the material exceptional items, the 
Committee considered management’s justification 
for classifying the item as exceptional and concluded 
that separate disclosure of these items in the income 
statement was appropriate.
The Committee discussed with management the 
controls applied to ensure that all maturing derivative 
contracts that qualify for re-measurement are identified 
and that the cumulative gains and losses on such 
contracts are correctly calculated, and discussed with 
the external auditors the work they had carried out to 
satisfy themselves that the total net IFRS accounting 
loss reported on such contracts was fairly stated.
Unbilled B2B 
Energy Supply 
revenue
The Group’s revenue for energy supply includes an 
estimate of energy supplied between the date of 
the last meter reading and 31 December 2018. The 
method of estimating such revenues is complex and 
judgemental. They are estimated through the billing 
systems on a customer-by-customer basis, using 
historical consumption patterns and taking account 
of current factors such as weather patterns. Further 
information regarding unbilled revenue is given 
in note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The method of estimating unbilled revenue is 
inherently complex and involves judgement. The value 
of unbilled revenue in the B2B Energy Supply business 
was £147 million at 31 December 2018.
The Committee reviewed with management the process 
for and the key assumptions applied in determining 
the calculation of unbilled receivables, noting that 
historically, final settlements had been closely in line 
with the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
The Committee also noted the work done in this 
area by the external auditors and in particular their 
observation that more than 90% of the unbilled debt 
as at 31 December 2018 had been billed by the end 
of January 2019. The Committee concluded that 
the process and assumptions applied were appropriate 
and reasonable.

Accounting for 
the acquisition 
of the portfolio 
of assets from 
ScottishPower
On 31 December 2018 the Group acquired 
ScottishPower Generation Limited (since re-named 
Drax Generation Enterprise Limited) for an initial net 
consideration of £687 million. Business combination 
accounting requires a fair value exercise to be 
undertaken to allocate the purchase price to the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, 
with any excess of the consideration over the net of 
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed being recognised as purchased goodwill. 
Particularly in the case of a capital intensive business 
such as power generation, fair value assessments 
require subjective judgements based on a wide range 
of complex variables.
The Committee reviewed management’s report on the 
fair value exercise, noting that the exercise had been 
carried out for the Group by a major accounting firm, 
focusing on the key judgements and estimates including 
the basis for the purchased goodwill arising, and 
obtaining explanations from management for any 
significant variances from the asset valuations prepared 
for and used by the Board in arriving at the amount of 
the purchase consideration to be offered to the vendor. 
The Committee concluded that the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed were fairy stated in the consolidated 
balance sheet on the basis of the fair value exercise and 
approved the disclosures in note 5.1 to the consolidated 
financial statements, while noting that the initial 
accounting for the acquisition was incomplete and 
the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements for the business combination thus had been 
determined only provisionally.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
As a result of its review of the Annual report and accounts, 
underpinned by its discussions with operating and finance 
management regarding the Strategic report, and with the Group 
finance team regarding the financial statements, the Audit 
Committee advised the Board that, in the Committee’s view, the 
Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
REVIEW OF AUDIT COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS BY MEMBERS
In line with the FRC’s Guidance on Audit Committees, the 
Committee reviewed its own effectiveness. This review was 
completed using the Board performance evaluation 
questionnaire referred to on page 65.
The questionnaire included questions on the effectiveness of 
the Audit Committee in monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements, the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems, its arrangements and processes to ensure 
compliance with its ethical standards, and the effectiveness of 
the internal audit activities and the external audit process. The 
questionnaire also asked whether the Committee has sufficient 
expertise, time and access to key staff and information to enable 
it to discharge its monitoring and oversight role effectively. 
The questionnaire results were discussed by the Committee at the 
February 2018 meeting, which concluded that the composition of 
its membership, the manner in which it operates and the reviews 
that it undertakes throughout the year all contribute to the 
continued effective functioning of the Committee. Members 
were satisfied that the Committee remained effective.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor, Deloitte, who have performed the role continuously 
since the Company’s listing in 2005 and were reappointed in 2017 
following a tender process. The Committee’s assessment was 
based on inputs obtained in the course of monitoring the integrity 
of the financial statements and the significant financial reporting 
issues and judgements underlying the financial statements, and 
on its direct interactions with the external auditors.
The Committee’s principal interactions with the auditors were 
its discussions of the audit work performed on areas of higher 
audit risk and the basis for the auditors’ conclusions on those 
areas. These interactions were supplemented by others that 
enabled them, for example, to gauge the depth of the auditors’ 
understanding of the company’s business. The Committee’s 
review focused on the level of experience and expertise of the 
audit team, their objectivity and professional scepticism, and 
their preparedness to challenge management in a knowledgeable, 
informed and constructive manner. The Committee’s review 
also took account of feedback from management on the 
effectiveness of the audit process.
INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy, the provisions 
of which include:
• seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in its professional 
judgement, independent of the Group, and obtaining from it 
an account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s 
independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff;
• a requirement to rotate the lead audit partner every five years;
• a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit work, under which:
 
– the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain categories 
of work, including those where they may be required to audit 
their own work or make management decisions, or where 
the auditor would act in an advocacy role for the Group;
74
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued
 
– there is a clear approval process for engaging the auditor 
to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to 
financial limits. Permitted non-audit services for which the 
fee exceeds £50,000 are required to be approved in advance 
by the Audit Committee;
 
– all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work 
are reported to the next meeting of the Committee; and
 
– the balance between the fees paid to the external auditor 
for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee.
The Policy can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.drax.com.
The Committee also receives reports from the external 
auditor on its own processes and procedures, to ensure its 
independence and objectivity and to ensure compliance with 
the relevant standards.
The current lead audit partner, James Leigh, has completed the 
maximum permitted term of five years. The Committee has 
agreed that he will be replaced by Anthony Matthews, who has 
previously acted as the audit partner for the Group’s B2B Energy 
Supply Business. 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the 
year for audit and other services are set out in note 2.3 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 128. Deloitte were 
appointed as reporting accountant for the circular to 
shareholders in relation to the acquisition of generation assets 
from ScottishPower, which required them to report on historical 
financial information relating to Drax and the generation assets 
concerned. They also performed financial due diligence for the 
directors and for JP Morgan Cazenove as sponsor in relation to 
the transaction. The services concerned are in the nature of 
assurance services and not advisory services but are required by 
the EU Audit Regulation to be classified as “non-audit services”. 
However, audit firms are permitted to carry out such investment 
circular reporting engagements for audit clients and this is 
common practice in the UK as the auditor is able to bring to 
bear their knowledge of the business and its financial reporting 
processes, which enables them to perform the work required in 
a more efficient, and possibly more effective, manner than a firm 
that does not have such knowledge. Nevertheless, in order to 
minimise any threat to the integrity, objectivity and independence 
of the audit team, the financial due diligence work was carried out 
by a separate team from Deloitte. 
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice 
of external auditor.
AUDITOR REAPPOINTMENT
Having considered the effectiveness and independence of 
the external auditor as described above, the Audit Committee 
agreed to recommend to the Board that a resolution to reappoint 
Deloitte LLP as the company’s external auditor should be put 
to shareholders at the AGM in April 2019. 
The Group has complied with the provisions of The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Group operates a co-sourced model for its internal audit 
function. Under this model, the internal team conducts core 
financial controls reviews. Reviews of specialist technical areas 
are outsourced to firms with appropriate experience and 
qualifications.
The Committee reviews and approves the internal audit plan for 
the year. Its review is designed to ensure that priority is given to 
the areas of highest risk for the Group and that the audit work 
focuses on key controls, so as to optimise the level of assurance 
provided to the Committee and to management 
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding 
the internal audit programme and reviews undertaken. 
Recommendations are made to management for control 
improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit 
reports reviewed by the Committee during 2018 included:
• Property, plant and equipment recognition, existence and controls
• Revenue recognition
• Business plan modelling, governance and monitoring
• ROC and CfD claims 
• Corporate crime risk management and compliance framework
• Cyber security
• GDPR readiness
• Derivatives valuation and accounting treatment
• Off-site biomass stocks controls
• Commodity hedging in B2B Energy Supply
• Market regulation compliance
• Opus payroll 
• IT project management
• Health and Safety
• Pellet Production financial controls and procurement
In addition, at each of its scheduled meetings the Committee 
received reports detailing progress with implementing 
recommendations previously raised by internal audit and is 
satisfied that management has taken appropriate steps to 
implement the recommendations raised.
The Chair of the Committee, independent of management, 
maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal and 
external auditor, allowing open dialogue and feedback. 
The Committee has considered the effectiveness of internal 
audit, based on the quality of its plan and the information 
provided in it its reporting, and is satisfied that the co-sourcing 
model described above remains appropriate for the Group and 
that on this basis the quality, experience and expertise of the 
function is appropriate for the business.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued
ANNUAL STATEMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear shareholders
This report reviews the key matters considered by the 
Remuneration Committee in the past year and the matters 
we expect to consider in the future. With two clarifications 
to address shareholders’ concerns, highlighted below, the 
Committee has operated in line with the revised 2017-2019 
Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders, 
at the April 2018 AGM. 
I leave the Board in June 2019, having served nine years as 
a non-executive director, six as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. I am delighted to say that Nicola Hodson will replace 
me as Chair. During 2019 Nicola will lead a full review of the 
Remuneration Policy, with the results of this review incorporated 
into a new policy which will be compliant with the new Corporate 
Governance Code, for consideration by shareholders at the 
2020 AGM. 
REVIEW OF 2018
Management had a successful year, both in terms of business 
results and advancing the Group’s strategy. This success has been 
reflected in the Group’s share price which was up by over 30% 
over the year. Our strategic objectives are reflected in our Group 
Scorecard which drives performance across all our employees 
and are taken into account in determining both the short-term 
and long-term remuneration outcomes for the executive 
directors. In terms of performance against our key objectives  
I am pleased to note the following highlights: 
Adjusted EBITDA at £250 million increased by 9% compared  
to the prior year, with the Group benefiting from good availability 
in the Power Generation business, better electricity prices and  
a substantial uplift in output in Pellet Production. In B2B Energy 
Supply margin grew, and market share increased by 1%, but the 
business faced a challenging market for customers and higher 
than expected bad debt provisioning. A significant step in the 
acceleration of our strategy was the December 2018 acquisition 
of ScottishPower’s generation assets, but there were also 
important strategic moves in the conversion of Unit 4 to biomass 
and bringing the LaSalle pellet plant on stream, ahead of schedule. 
Management continued to extend our capabilities in the 
utilisation of biomass fuel and the sustainability of alternative 
low carbon energy sources. Drax’s own programme has been 
reinforced by the sustainability criteria set out in the 2018 
European Union Directive on biomass. A third-party audit 
designed to test the efficacy of Drax’s reporting of biomass 
sustainability data enabled us to demonstrate the veracity of our 
own analysis of biomass sustainability as a genuine alternative to 
traditional energy sources. This is important, as the data is crucial 
for the payments to be made under the ROC and CfD regimes. 
Safety was generally good throughout the Group, with an 
improvement in the Total Recordable Injury Rate to 0.22 
(2017: 0.27). 
It was note-worthy the degree to which the executive directors 
involved themselves in the process improvements and 
determination of additional investment to reduce the chances 
of a repeat of the explosion experienced on the biomass rail 
unloading facilities at the end of 2017. 
The Group continues to be committed to paying a competitive 
and fair salary and benefits package that is consistent with our 
employees’ roles and the external market. To provide the basis for 
a common approach to valuing roles and thus setting salary and 
benefits across the Group, management carried out a Group-wide 
job evaluation and external benchmarking exercise in 2017. 
In addition, employee feedback has been sought on employee 
benefits provisions and, relevant changes to this provision will 
be implemented during 2019. The Gender Pay Gap report 
demonstrated, consistent with the industry, that there are 
significantly fewer women at senior level. It is recognised that this 
needs to change and our aim is to have 40% of the senior roles 
filled by women by the end of 2020 (27% as at 31 December 2018).
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE IN 2018
The Committee determines the remuneration of the executive 
directors and members of the Executive Committee against 
the strategic objectives and priorities of the Group. Principally 
this is done through an assessment of performance against the 
targets set in the Group Scorecard, with the Remuneration 
Committee using its discretion to adjust the result where the 
numeric outcome does not reflect properly Group or individual 
performance. Executive pay is therefore closely aligned 
to business performance with a high proportion of total 
remuneration delivered through variable pay, rewarding 
achievement of short-term and long-term targets. In 2018 
changes to the Remuneration Policy were approved by 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM, which included removing the 
personal element in the determination of executive director 
bonuses. This fully aligns the approach to bonus across all levels 
of the Group with the executive directors and members of the 
Executive Committee earning bonus only where this is merited  
by the Group’s performance against pre-determined metrics  
set by the Committee. 
There is a detailed review of performance against the 
Scorecard on pages 92 and 93. Components within the Scorecard 
can be scored between 0 and 2, a score of 1 representing 
on-target performance. Mindful of the overall objectives of the 
Group and taking account where considered appropriate of 
the representations of the executive directors, the Committee 
sets stretching targets at the beginning of the year. During 
the year there are two formal reviews giving the Committee 
the opportunity to discuss with and, challenge management 
on the progress made and likely Scorecard outcomes.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
The Committee determines the final Scorecard result in February 
of the following year and reports to Shareholders on the outcome 
in the annual report for the year in which the bonus is paid. In 
2018 there were no changes to the targets within the year. For 
the financial year 2018, the Committee determined the overall 
performance at 1.05 which was marginally above target 
performance. The Committee assessed that this fairly reflected 
the Group’s performance and that there was no need to apply 
discretion to the outcome of the Scorecard. 
The above score results in annual bonuses of 53% of the 
maximum being paid to executive directors. The Committee 
believes that this bonus outcome fairly reflects the performance 
of each of the executive directors. Further detail on this outcome 
is set out on page 94.
The above score is applied to both the annual bonus and the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Details of the outcomes are  
set out on page 94.
LONG-TERM ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE
Under the current remuneration policy the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) is delivered through a Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
in respect of which the first grants were made in 2017. However, 
for vestings which will take effect in 2018, the relevant award 
to test is the share award granted in 2016, made under the 
2014-2016 Remuneration Policy which operated a Bonus 
Matching Plan (BMP). 
Share awards made in 2016 under the BMP were tested at the 
end of 2018 through two measures: Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) accounted for up to 50%, and the three-year average of 
the Group Scorecard, which also accounted for up to 50%. 
The Company’s TSR over the period was between the median and 
upper quartile of the comparator group, leading to 89.5% vesting 
of the 50% related to relative TSR. The average Corporate 
Scorecard outcome over the same period was 1.06 leading to 
25.76% of vesting. By combining the above vesting percentages, 
it creates an overall vesting of 57.63% of the 2016 share awards.
The Committee determined that the vesting outcome was 
consistent with the Group’s and executive directors’ performance 
and did not exercise discretion in determining the final outcome 
for the 2016 share awards. 
CEO TOTAL REMUNERATION
At £1.9 million Will Gardiner’s 2018 total remuneration is above 
that of his predecessor’s 2017 total remuneration of £1.2 million. 
Will’s base pay and bonus earned are both lower than his 
predecessor’s while the earnings under the BMP matching award, 
made in 2016 following Will’s recruitment, are higher, primarily 
reflecting better relative (and absolute) share price performance. 
Based on the financial performance of the Group in the year, Will’s 
contribution to the performance of the Group over the period 
since he joined and the TSR and Scorecard performance, the 
Committee has determined that the vesting of the award is 
appropriate. Further details on the vested shares is shown on 
page 94.
BASE PAY INCREASES
Will Gardiner was promoted from CFO to CEO effective  
1 January 2018, with an appropriate uplift in pay from £400,000 
to £530,000. No separate uplift was applied to reflect the salary 
increases applied to other executive directors or the wider 
workforce. Prior to her departure, Will’s predecessor was paid a 
salary of £588,318. There was an interim CFO in place for 2018 
(not appointed as a statutory director). 
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss’s salary was reviewed and he received 
an increase of 3.8%, effective from 1 April 2018, this increase 
being aligned with the wider workforce.
For the 2019 pay review, where an increase has been applied for 
executive directors, increases will be in line with those applied 
to the wider Group workforce and will take effect in April 2019. 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
During 2018 we engaged with each of the largest 12 shareholders 
plus four proxy agencies, with an explanation of the proposed 
revisions to the 2017-19 policy. There were follow ups with a 
number of these and good discussions around not only the 
proposed changes but also their feedback on specific aspects 
of the policy. These discussions will be used in shaping the 
2020-2022 policy, which will go out for consultation with the 
major shareholders, prior to it being finalised. Additionally, there 
were a number of discussions with the proxy agencies on the 2017 
remuneration report, specifically in regard to the termination 
arrangements for the previous CEO. Again, these discussions 
provided valuable feedback. 
Including abstentions, the level of shareholder support at the 
2018 AGM was 93% for the revised policy and 92% for the 
remuneration report. This was a significant and pleasing 
improvement on the previous policy at the 2017 AGM where 
the level of support was 77.03%.
APPLICATION OF POLICY
During the year we applied the revised 2017-19 executive 
remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders in 2018 
at the AGM, subject to two amendments:
Firstly, we amended the pensions provision for executive directors 
to allow the employer’s contribution to be ‘up to 20%’ as opposed 
to the existing straight 20%. Consistent with this revision, the 
Committee determined that the contribution to the pension for 
Andy Skelton at the time of his appointment as CFO would be 16%, 
which is the same level paid to members of the Executive 
Committee and other senior staff. 
Secondly, in respect of the termination of an executive director, 
for whatever reason, we have removed any obligation on the 
Committee to consider the departing executive for an annual 
bonus for any unworked period of notice. The removal of this 
obligation was achieved through each executive director 
agreeing to vary long standing contractual terms. As previously 
agreed with shareholders there is now no such obligation in the 
executive directors’ contracts of employment so the Committee 
saw it appropriate to clarify the policy and wishes to thank the 
executive directors for their agreement. 
78
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued
Feedback from shareholders, emerging best practice and 
Committee judgement is reflected in the outcomes to the 
following areas addressed in the year:
(i) treatment of the outgoing Group CEO, Dorothy Thompson, 
taking into account the agreed termination arrangements, 
the remuneration policy, and her service agreement;
(ii) remuneration package for the incoming Group CFO, balancing 
the need to remunerate a high-quality individual competitively 
with the objective to stop the ratcheting up of remuneration; 
and 
(iii) pay outcomes for the year in the context of performance 
achieved. 
In addition to the above, the Committee reviewed the progress 
made across the Group in implementing the changes made to 
performance management and the ongoing work with regards 
to benefits alignment across the UK businesses. It also approved 
the new approach to remuneration governance to be put in place 
for 2019. 
UPDATE ON TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
PREVIOUS CEO 
As noted in the 2017 Remuneration Report (page 84), we 
announced in September 2017 that Dorothy Thompson had 
given notice of her intention to stand down as Group CEO and 
to leave the Drax Group. It was agreed that she would leave 
on 31 December 2017 prior to the completion of her 12-month 
notice period. 
Details of related remuneration were included in the 2017 report 
and, as part of this, it was noted that Dorothy was entitled to 
salary, pension and other benefits for the unworked period of 
notice from January 2018 to September 2018. Phased payments 
in respect of this unworked notice were made in March 2018, 
June 2018 and, the final payment was made in September 2018. 
Considering Dorothy’s commencement of alternative 
employment during 2018, the final payment for unworked notice 
was reduced by the amount she earned in her new appointment 
which took effect during her notice period. 
In addition, the termination arrangements for Dorothy meant 
she was eligible to be considered for a bonus for the unworked 
period of her notice, this being January to September 2018. 
This reflected the terms set in connection with Dorothy standing 
down and mindful of the terms of her prevailing service 
agreement. Following Dorothy being appointed to a significant 
external role, the Committee determined that she had forfeited 
the right to be considered for a bonus. Therefore, no bonus for 
2018 will be paid to Dorothy. 
These adjustments were made in line with the terms of her 
service agreement and verified by external advisers. 
APPOINTMENT OF NEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Andy Skelton was appointed Group CFO effective 2 January 2019, 
with a salary of £355,000, an annual on-target bonus potential of 
70% of salary (maximum 140%) and a potential award of shares 
under the Performance Share Plan of 175% of salary. Consistent 
with the Group-wide pay review process and, as a result of his 
start date, Andy’s salary will not be reviewed again until April 
2020. Andy will receive cash in lieu of pension, at 16% of salary. 
This is below the level of 20% for the other executive directors 
but in line with members of the Executive Committee and other 
senior staff. The lower pension contribution as compared to the 
other executive directors, reflects general shareholder concerns 
over executive pension contributions and the Committee’s aim 
to lower fixed remuneration, where appropriate. No additional 
provisions or buy outs, beyond the package detailed above, have 
been put in place as part of Andy’s remuneration. The grant of 
shares to Andy under the PSP is expected to be made in the 
period following announcement of the results of the 2018 
financial year.
COMPARISON WITH DRAX REMUNERATION POLICY AND 
THE NEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE (CODE)
The existing Drax Remuneration Policy is considered to be broadly 
compliant with the new Code on Corporate Governance although 
we expect, during 2019, to implement further changes to 
practices to enable us to comply with the Code. We will of course 
report on this within the annual report for 2019. The 2019 review 
will also consider the Terms of Reference of the Committee. 
Highlighted below are certain matters which are under review.
Remuneration Committee Remit and Employee Voice: The 
Committee sets the remuneration of the executive directors and 
the next level, being the members of the Executive Committee. 
Periodically or when there is a change of personnel at senior level, 
the Committee will externally benchmark the salaries against 
an agreed comparator group of companies. Salary increases 
for executive directors and Executive Committee members are 
made only after the Committee has reviewed increases for the 
wider workforce. 
Annually the Committee reviews the individual salaries, bonuses 
and LTIP awards to other senior managers across the Group below 
the Executive Committee, comprising approximately 20 persons. 
It also reviews the trends in salaries and bonuses each year, 
including the average salary increase and the range of increase 
for the workforce, within the three businesses units and the 
corporate office.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
In 2018 the Group People Director reported twice to the 
Committee to update on progress with regard to the impact on 
the workforce of a number of ongoing Group-wide remuneration 
initiatives. Detailed information was shared with the Committee 
which had the opportunity to raise questions and challenge the 
approach. Topics covered included, but were not limited to, 
employee benefits provision, remuneration governance, updates 
to the implementation of changes made to employee bonus 
arrangements, gender pay gap reporting and, annual outcomes 
for employee pay and bonus reviews. The Committee was also 
updated on the implementation of the previously agreed 
approach to performance management, which supported 
cultural change across the Group. Information provided to 
the Committee included the results of employee surveys.
There are a number of existing channels designed to capture 
the views of the workforce on a wide range of issues including 
remuneration. Feedback from these is included in the 
presentations by the Group People Director. Nevertheless, as part 
of the 2019 review, the Committee will consider whether these 
existing channels are enough to make sure that employees’ views 
are sufficiently understood by the Committee to inform its 
decisions or whether there is a need to reinforce the existing 
structures. The Committee believes that its approach to 
executive remuneration does align with the wider company pay 
policies but, in the 2019 review, it will need to consider how best 
to explain this to the wider workforce. 
LTIP vesting period and post-termination shareholding 
requirement: The structure of the Group’s LTIP (the Performance 
Share Plan) with a three-year performance period and a further 
two years post-vesting holding period meets the criteria specified 
by the Code. It also applies to leavers as seen in the termination 
arrangements for the previous CEO. 
The current share ownership guideline is 200% of salary in 
Drax shares to be accumulated over five years although we 
recognise that some of our shareholders would like to see a 
higher requirement. It is worth noting that Will Gardiner made 
a substantial purchase of shares in 2018 to further align his 
interests with those of shareholders.
The 2019 review will also develop a policy around how the share 
ownership guideline will apply post termination and the processes 
required to implement this. 
Pensions: There are a wide range of pension arrangements 
across the Group including both Defined Benefit and Defined 
Contribution plans. 
Executive directors’ remuneration has historically included a 20% 
company contribution, either as a contribution to pension or cash 
in lieu of same, with members of the Executive Committee and 
senior managers (not in the Defined Benefit scheme) eligible for 
up to 16%. As mentioned on page 77, we have made changes 
to this element of the Policy and the incoming Group CFO’s 
remuneration package includes a company contribution of 16% 
which reflects the broader intent to align with the updated Code. 
The pension arrangements for executive directors will form a part 
of the 2019 remuneration policy review. 
NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
CEO pay ratios: We recognise the requirement for UK quoted 
companies, with more than 250 employees, to publish the pay 
ratio between their CEO and the average UK employee for 2019, 
i.e. in 2020. Given that the review of UK employee benefits, which 
will impact significantly on the reporting values, will only be 
finalised in 2019, the Committee decided to continue with the 
existing format (see page 81) for the 2018 reporting year. 
Therefore, the first report from the Drax Group, under this 
requirement, will be made as part of the 2019 Annual Report. 
SUMMARY
Along with the other members of the Committee, I am satisfied 
that the 2018 remuneration outcomes for the executive directors 
fairly reflect the corporate performance, provide a fair and 
consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, and 
remain in shareholders’ interests. The planned review, in 2019, 
of the current remuneration policy will allow the provisions of the 
revised Code to be incorporated whilst also taking into account 
the feedback received from shareholders and other stakeholders.

subject to TSR performance and up to 50% of shares vesting subject to Group Scorecard performance as below:
Total shareholder return TSR (50%)
Company Scorecard (50%)
TSR performance over three years relative to FTSE 51–150 
as follows:
• Below median = 0% vesting
• At median = 15% vesting (threshold)
• Upper quartile = 100% vesting
Group Scorecard performance averaged over the three-year 
performance period as follows (capped at 1.5):
• Score <1 = 0% vesting
• Score 1 = 15% vesting (threshold score)

As noted on page 79, the first reporting of values under the 
new CEO pay ratio reporting requirements will be made in the 
remuneration report for 2019. The ratio included here shows the 
ratio of pensionable pay between the executive directors and 
the wider UK workforce. The equivalent ratio between the CEO 
and the wider UK workforce is 13.4:1.
In addition, following the initial submission of gender pay gap 
reports, in respect of 2017, the 2018 gender pay gap data will 
be submitted and published in line with the mandated deadline. 
As with the 2017 reports, the submissions will re-emphasise the 
Group’s commitment to significantly reducing the currently 
identified gender pay gaps.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The current remuneration policy was effective from 25 April 2018. Normally it would be binding on the Group for three 
years but, as detailed in our 2017 Remuneration Report, the Committee intends to review the policy in 2019 and incorporate 
the results of this review in a new policy to be presented to shareholders at the 2020 AGM. It is intended to undertake 
consultation with shareholders in the summer of 2019.
The 2017-19 Remuneration Policy was revised in 2017 and, voted 
on last year when we received high levels of shareholder support. 
The principal change from that of the previous policy was to 
remove the personal element in calculating the executive directors 
annual bonus, thereby ensuring alignment with the changes being 
made across the wider workforce. The policy will be reviewed to 
ensure that it remains fit for purpose at Drax and is consistent 
with the new Corporate Governance Code and investor sentiment 
in 2019 with the results of this review incorporated into a new 
three-year remuneration policy to be presented to shareholders 
at the 2020 AGM. 
In the meantime and, as outlined in the Chair’s letter, the current 
executive directors no longer have a clause in their contracts 
requiring the Committee to consider whether to pay a bonus 
pertaining to any unworked notice for the financial year in which 
their employment is terminated. Although this change has already 
taken effect, the revised policy to be put to shareholders at the 
2020 AGM will also incorporate this change.
The core principles of the current remuneration policy are set 
out below:
• making sure that executive remuneration is linked strongly to 
performance and the achievement of strategic objectives;
• ensuring transparency in executive pay reporting through 
simplification in design and appropriate reporting;
• securing and retaining top talent and incentivising strong 
performance; 
• maintaining flexibility, to recognise the uncertain business 
environment, whilst ensuring that remuneration outcomes are 
aligned to shareholder interests; and
• bonuses earned solely for the delivery of stretching corporate 
and divisional related financial, strategic and operational targets, 
as measured through the Group Scorecard.
The Committee retains the overall discretion to adjust the bonus 
if the Group Scorecard outcome is not reflective of corporate or 
individual performance in the year. 
The following is an overview of our remuneration framework 
under the policy.
KEY COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed 
to support the delivery of strong business performance and the 
creation of shareholder value. We set out below the key 
components of the remuneration policy for executive directors, and 
in the notes following the table we comment on differences 
between the policy and the remuneration of employees generally.
BASE SALARY
Base salary is set in order to attract, reward and retain the right 
calibre of executive to deliver the leadership and management 
needed to execute the Group’s vision and Business Plan.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and experience, 
and market level. It is paid in 12 monthly instalments.
To determine the market level, the Committee reviews 
remuneration data on executive positions at companies which 
the Committee considers to be appropriate comparators.
The comparator companies are selected, with advice from the 
Committee’s remuneration advisers, taking into account factors 
such as, but not limited to, sector, size, and international presence.
On appointment, an executive director’s base salary is set at 
the market level, or below if the executive is not fully 
experienced at this level.
Where base salary on appointment is below market level to 
reflect experience, it will be increased over time to align with 
the market level, subject to performance.
Base salaries of all executive directors are generally reviewed 
once each year, with increases applying from April. Reviews 
cover individual performance, experience, development in the 
role and market comparisons.
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
The base salaries of executive directors in post at the start of 
the policy period, and who remain in the same role throughout 
the policy period, will not usually be increased by a higher 
percentage than the average annual percentage increase 
in salaries of all other Group employees.
Exceptions to this, subject to performance and development, 
are where:
(i) An executive director has been appointed at below market 
level to reflect experience. Under this scenario, increases 
will be capped at 5% above the average annual percentage 
increase in salaries of all other Group employees. 
(ii) An executive director has been promoted internally and 
their salary is below market level. Under this scenario, 
increases will not be capped and the Committee can 
increase base salary to the market level within an 
appropriate timeframe. 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
No performance measures apply.

ANNUAL BONUS
The award of annual bonus is linked directly to achieving the annual Business Plan targets.
The aim of the deferred portion of annual bonus is to further align executives to shareholders’ interests, by linking share-based reward 
to long-term sustainable performance.
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
65% of annual bonus earned is paid in cash, normally three 
months after the end of the financial year to which it relates.
35% of annual bonus earned is deferred in nil cost awards over 
shares under the Deferred Share Plan (DSP), which vest after 
three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” 
termination provisions.
The DSP was introduced in 2017, as a vehicle for deferring the 
relevant proportion of annual bonus in shares.
Annual bonus earned (subject to the maximum opportunity) is:
Target bonus x Group score.
Target bonus is 50% of maximum.
Score ranges from zero to 2.0.
Each measure in the Group scorecard is assigned a weighting and 
three performance levels (low, target and stretch). The score is 
zero if performance is below the low target, one if performance 
is at target and two for stretch performance.
Dividends in respect of the deferred shares are reinvested in 
additional shares, which vest when the deferred shares vest.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply clawback 
to any annual bonus awards, as set out in the notes to the 
policy table.
Summary scorecard and performance results are published in the 
annual report on remuneration.
The Committee will review the formulaic outcome of the annual 
bonus and has the discretion to amend the final outcome to make 
sure that bonus payments reflect overall performance. The use of 
such discretion will be explained fully in the relevant annual 
report on remuneration.
Role
Maximum 
bonus potential

There is no payment for below threshold performance.
Performance measures
Group score is based on performance, against the Group 
Scorecard, of strategic and Business Plan targets set, each year, 
by the Committee, in conjunction with the Board. Performance 
measures include financial, operational and strategic objectives. 
Typically, across the Group and Business Units, around 40% of the 
Scorecard is based on financial objectives, 30–40% on strategic 
goals with the balance on operational issues. The Committee 
has the discretion to vary the weightings from year to year.
The Scorecard is amended each year, in line with business 
strategy and objectives.
In exceptional circumstances such that the Committee believes 
the original measures and/or targets are no longer appropriate, 
the Committee has discretion to amend performance measures 
and targets during the year.

DRAX 2017 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP is the Company’s long-term incentive plan implemented following shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM. It replaces the 
legacy BMP and links long-term share-based incentives to TSR and to the achievement of Business Plan strategic targets.
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Under the PSP, executive directors receive an annual grant 
of nil cost conditional awards over shares.
Shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject to 
continued service or “good leaver” termination provisions, and the 
achievement of performance conditions over a three-year period 
determined by the Committee. Vested awards are subject to 
a further holding period of two years.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume notional 
reinvestment) are paid on PSP awards.
The Committee will include an override provision in each grant 
under the PSP. This will give the Committee discretion to 
determine that no vesting shall occur, or that vesting shall be 
reduced, if there are circumstances (relating to the Company’s 
overall performance or otherwise) which make vesting when 
calculated by reference to the performance conditions alone 
inappropriate.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus or 
clawback to unvested/vested awards, as set out in the notes 
to the policy table.
The Committee reserves discretion to:
(i) amend the performance conditions/targets attached to 
outstanding awards granted under this policy, in the event 
of a major corporate event or significant change in economic 
circumstances, or a change in accounting standards having 
a material impact on outcomes; and 
(ii) adjust the vesting of PSP awards and/or the number of shares 
underlying unvested PSP awards, on the occurrence of 
a corporate event or other reorganisation. 
In the event of a change of control, the treatment of long-term 
incentives will be determined in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules.
The maximum annual grant is 175% of base salary.
Performance measures
There are two performance measures which apply to PSP 
awards, as follows:
(i) TSR performance over three years relative to FTSE 350 
comparator group (50% of award), vesting as follows:
 
Below Median = 0%  
At Median = 25%  
Upper Quartile = 100% 
(ii) Average corporate scorecard (as described in the annual 
bonus) over three financial years (50% of award), vesting 
as follows:
 
Average Score 0.75 = 0%  
Average Score 1 = 50%  
Average Score 1.5 = 100% 
While each annual corporate score can range from zero to 2.0, 
the three-year average corporate score is capped at 1.5. 
For illustration:
Year 1 Score 1.8
Year 2 Score 0.9
Year 3 Score 1.2
Average corporate score = 1.3
Straight line vesting occurs between performance levels for 
both conditions.

PENSION
Pension provision is one of the components to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of executive, to ensure delivery of the 
leadership and management needed to execute the Group’s vision and Business Plan.
Practical operation
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of the 
Group’s defined contribution pension plan. The employer’s contribution 
for executive directors is a maximum of 20% of base salary. (Note – As 
explained on page 77, following consultation with shareholders in 2018, the 
percentage employer contribution was revised to allow for a maximum of 
20% of salary to executive directors (previously the policy stated a set 20% 
of salary).)
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have 
contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension 
schemes, cash in lieu of pension (subject to normal statutory deductions), 
or a combination of pension contributions and cash in lieu of pension.
Maximum potential value
Maximum is 20% of base salary.
Performance measures
No performance measures apply.
BENEFITS
Benefits are provided to be market competitive as an integral part of directors’ total remuneration.
Practical operation
Executive directors receive a car allowance, life assurance (four times 
salary), the opportunity to participate in all-employee share plans on the 
same basis as other employees, annual private health assessment and 
annual private medical cover.
Additional benefits may be provided if the Committee considers them 
appropriate.
Relocation expenses and/or second base expenses are paid, where 
appropriate, in individual cases. Directors’ relocation expenses are 
determined on a case-by-case basis. The policy is designed to assist the 
executive director to relocate to a home of similar standing.
Maximum potential value
Benefits are set at a level appropriate to the individual’s 
role and circumstances.
The maximum opportunity will depend on the type 
of benefit and cost of its provision, which will vary 
according to the market and individual circumstances.
Performance measures
No performance measures apply.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE
The Group’s share ownership guidelines align the interests of executives with shareholders.
Practical operation
The share ownership guideline is that all executive directors should retain 
shares to the value of 200% of base salary, to be accumulated over five 
years. Until this level is reached, directors who receive shares by virtue of 
any share plan award or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 
50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance 
contributions). Only shares that have actually vested count towards  
the threshold.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND APPROACH TO SETTING TARGETS
The measures for elements of variable pay are:
• Group Scorecard, consisting of strategic and Business Plan targets set by the Committee each year in conjunction with the Board. 
The Group Scorecard aligns incentives of executive directors with achievement of key business goals.
• Relative TSR, which aligns executive director remuneration with creation of long-term shareholder value.
• The Committee sets targets for the performance measures each year, taking into account market conditions, the Business Plan 
and other circumstances as appropriate. A summary of the Group Scorecard targets that apply for the following year are disclosed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH MALUS OR CLAWBACK MAY APPLY
Malus and/or clawback may be applied to incentive awards under the following circumstances:
• Clawback for the annual bonus – the Committee may require a director to repay any amount of annual bonus payment it considers 
appropriate, in circumstances of financial misstatement, or misconduct, or if assessment of a performance condition is found to 
have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information, or in other circumstances that the Committee considers to 
justify the operation of the clawback provision.
• Malus and clawback for the BMP – if a repayment of bonus is required (see “annual bonus” above) the Committee shall reduce 
the number of shares that may vest under the BMP by an appropriate amount (in respect of an award made pursuant to the 
annual bonus payment subject to the clawback). The Committee may also reduce the number of shares under a BMP award in 
circumstances of financial misstatement, or if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, 
inaccuracy or misleading information, or in other circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the operation of the 
clawback provision.
• Malus and clawback for the PSP and DSP – the Committee may also reduce the number of shares under a PSP and/or DSP award 
in circumstances of financial misstatement, or if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, 
inaccuracy or misleading information, or in other circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the operation of the 
clawback provision.
COMMITTEE’S JUDGEMENT AND DISCRETION
In addition to assessing and making judgements on the meeting of performance targets and the appropriate incentives payable, 
the Committee has certain operational discretions it can exercise in relation to executive directors’ remuneration. These include, 
but are not limited to:
• reviewing the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus and applying discretion to amend the final outcome, to ensure that bonus 
payments reflect overall performance or an individual executive’s performance;
• deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award; and
• determining whether a leaver is a “good leaver”.
Where such discretion is exercised, it will be explained in the relevant directors’ remuneration report.
REMUNERATION SCENARIOS
The composition and value of the executive directors’ remuneration packages at low, target and stretch performance scenarios 
under the Drax Group remuneration policy are set out in the charts on page 87. The assumptions used in the charts are provided

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee will apply the core principles on page 82 and the components set out in the table on pages 82 to 86 to determine 
the remuneration of newly appointed directors. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the 
director being appointed. Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the market level, subject to 
performance. The incentive provision for a new executive director will include annual bonus up to 150% of salary and a PSP award 
of up to 175% of salary.
In relation to directors appointed from outside the Group, where the Committee considers it to be necessary to secure the 
appointment of the director, the Committee may:
• pay compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share incentives (subject to 
the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the Company’s right to claw back any 
amount which is subsequently paid to the executive by the former employer, and to claw back an appropriate proportion of the 
payment if the executive leaves soon after appointment); and
• make appropriate payments in circumstances where a director is relocated from outside the UK.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND COMPENSATION ON LOSS OF OFFICE
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ notice.
Element
Details
Notice periods
Executive directors may be required to work during the notice period or may be provided with pay in lieu of notice if not required 
to work the full notice period.
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements, the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of 
termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during 
the contractual notice period.
Compensation for loss 
of office
If an executive director’s employment is brought to an end by either party and if it is necessary to determine a termination payment, 
the Committee’s policy, in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the director, is to determine a director’s termination 
payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The termination payment will be calculated based on the value of base salary 
and contractual benefits that would have accrued to the director during the contractual notice period. The Committee will seek 
mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment to a leaving director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the 
circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may, for example, be appropriate to consider mitigation if the director has 
secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would not apply retrospectively to a contractual payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights. The Group may pay reasonable fees for 
a departing director to obtain independent legal advice in relation to their termination arrangements and nominal consideration 
for agreement to any contractual terms protecting the Company’s rights following termination. No service agreement includes any 
provision for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to 
be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.

Treatment of annual 
bonus on termination
All bonus payments are discretionary benefits. The Committee will consider whether a departing director should receive an annual 
bonus in respect of the financial year in which, and/or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated to reflect the 
period of the performance year completed at the date of termination. The Committee will take into account performance; cooperation 
with succession; any breach of goodwill, and adherence to contractual obligations/restrictions. If the employment ends in any of the 
following circumstances, the director will be treated as a “good leaver” and the director will be eligible for a bonus payment:
• redundancy;
• retirement;
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Company; and
• death.
If the termination is for any other reason, a bonus payment will be at the Committee’s discretion and it is the Committee’s policy to 
ensure that any such bonus payment properly reflects the departing director’s performance and behaviour towards the Company. 
Therefore the amount of any such payment will be determined, taking into account (i) the director’s personal performance and 
behaviour towards the Company and (ii) the Group performance. If a bonus payment is made, it will normally be paid as soon as is 
reasonably practicable after the Group performance element has been determined for the relevant period. There may be circumstances 
in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the bonus payment to be made earlier, for example, on termination due to 
ill-health, in which case, on-target Group performance score shall be assumed.
No payment will be made unless the director is employed on the date of bonus payment, except for “good leavers” as defined above.
Treatment of unvested 
long-term incentive and 
deferred share awards 
on termination
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the director under the BMP, DSP 
and PSP should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee will be in accordance with the rules of the BMP, DSP and PSP 
(as approved by shareholders).
In summary, the rules of the BMP and PSP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date of employment termination) 
if employment ends for any of the following reasons (“long-term good leaver reasons”):
• redundancy;
• retirement;
• ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company;
• change of ownership; and
• death.
If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the BMP and PSP require the Committee to exercise its discretion. In doing so, 
it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, the Company’s performance; the director’s performance and behaviour 
towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; and other relevant factors, including the proximity of the 
award to its maturity date.
The rules of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, deferred and conditional shares vest as soon as 
reasonably practicable following termination. Awards, which vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, 
will be time pro-rated and will be phased over the performance cycle of the relevant awards.
The rules of the DSP provide that deferred bonus awards will vest (in full) if employment ends for any of the “long-term good leaver 
reasons” detailed above. If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the DSP require the Committee to exercise its 
discretion. In doing so it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, the Company’s performance; the director’s 
performance and behaviour towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; and a range of other relevant 
factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
The rules of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, they do so at the normal vesting date, unless the 
Committee exercises discretion to vest awards earlier. Awards which vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions will be (time) pro-rated.
Outside appointments
Executive directors may accept external Board appointments, subject to the Chair’s approval. Normally only one appointment to 
a listed company would be approved. Fees may be retained by the director.

CONSIDERATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES FOR LEAVERS
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving director is fair and appropriate, taking 
account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may be minded to award an annual bonus 
payment and/or permit the vesting of PSP awards include:
• the director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice; and
• the director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements.
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is:
• poor performance; or
• the director does not continue to perform effectively following notice.
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND CHAIR
Remuneration component and link to strategy
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
Fees 
To attract a Chair and independent 
non-executive directors who, together with 
the executive directors, form a Board with 
a broad range of skills and experience.
The Chair’s remuneration is determined by the Committee whilst that of the 
other non-executive directors is determined by the Chair and the executive 
directors. These are determined in the light of:
• fees of chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed companies 
selected for comparator purposes, on the same basis as for executive 
directors;
• the responsibilities and time commitment; and
• the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills 
and experience.
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed periodically against market 
comparators. They were last reviewed in 2017. Current fee levels are shown 
in the annual report on remuneration.
The Chair receives an annual fee.
Non-executive directors receive an annual base fee.
Additional annual fees are paid:
• to the Senior Independent Director (which includes the fee for chairing 
a Board Committee other than the Audit Committee);
• to the Chair of the Audit Committee;
• to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee; and
• to the Chair of any other committee (this is not paid to the Chair of the 
Nomination Committee if he or she is also the Chair of the Board).
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any performance 
related remuneration arrangements.
Overall aggregate fees paid to 
all non-executive directors will 
remain within the limit as stated 
in the Company’s Articles 
(currently £1,000,000).
Expenses
Reasonable travel and accommodation expenses are reimbursed as applicable.
Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus, pension or any 
of the Group’s share-based reward plans.
The Chair’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE POLICY AND THE REMUNERATION OF EMPLOYEES GENERALLY
The following differences apply between the remuneration of directors and the arrangements for the remuneration of employees 
generally:
• executive directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for PSP awards, although there are differences in terms  
of levels of grant;
• annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, but the requirement to defer a portion of annual bonus applies only to  
executive directors;
• employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus subject to Company performance 
and continued employment, whereas directors and all other UK-based employees participate in a discretionary bonus scheme; and
• in some cases hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments.
CONTEXT
Wider employee population
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the Group. 
The Committee’s policy is that annual salary increases for executive directors should not exceed the average annual salary increase 
for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the nature or scope 
of responsibilities or if an executive director has been appointed at a salary below market level reflecting experience in the role.
The Committee has considered a number of comparison metrics when determining its approach to executive remuneration, 
including the ratio of Group Chief Executive to median employee pay.
Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the 
remuneration of executive directors. Specific measures can be included in the balanced Group Scorecard. The Committee is also 
able to consider these issues in determining whether to exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score, and in considering 
the performance conditions override under the PSP, as described on page 86.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
Outlined below is a brief synopsis of the KPIs used and their strategic rationale:
Group
• Safety is the first priority for the business. The Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) is defined as the number of incidents per  
100,000 hours worked. We continue to target upper quartile safety performance.
• Financial performance metrics for 2018 were based on underlying adjusted EBITDA, net debt and progress on delivering strategy. 
The weighting given to adjusted EBITDA, at 30%, reflects the priority given to a strong Group financial performance.
• Being a sustainable business means driving long-term, profitable growth while achieving a positive economic, social and 
environmental impact. Ensuring that our staff are fully engaged and regard Drax as an employer they would recommend is an 
important part of this impact.
• Pellet quality impacts both Drax Biomass and Drax Power. The “fines” metric is used to drive pellet quality, from own supply,  
which in turn minimises downstream supply chain costs. 
• Developing strong in-house pellet supply capability, and lowering pellet production costs have a direct impact on gross margins 
available from Generation.
• The value available to the Group from biomass generation is a key driver of gross margins. Biomass unit technical availability reflects 
the value that can be derived from maximising biomass unit output.
• The value from flexibility captures the value available from fully supporting the grid.
Further details of how these individual metrics support the business strategy and drive both shareholder value and performance  
can be found on pages 1 to 49.
The Committee made an in-depth review of the score for each of the performance measures, ensuring these were individually 
supportable, and then reviewed the overall outcome, to determine whether to exercise its discretion and adjust the final score. 
Additional consideration of the appropriateness of the overall Group Scorecard result was also reviewed by the Committee.
Safety. The independently verified Total Recordable Injury Rate for the 2018 financial year was 0.22 which was on target and 
represented an improvement on the score for the 2017 financial year (0.27).
Finance. Adjusted EBITDA achieved for the 2018 financial year of £250 million, included the impact of the Government’s suspension 
of Capacity Payments. The Committee determined this qualified as in line with the target of £251 million. Net debt at the year-end 
had reduced to £319 million against a stretch target of £362 million, reflecting management’s strong focus in this area (for further 
information, see page 40 of the Group Financial Review). In respect of delivery of strategy, separate objectives were set addressing 
a combination of operational efficiency, cost reduction and transitioning to new technology platforms, each of which are important 
drivers for future development and which contain commercially sensitive information. The Committee set thresholds at the beginning 
of the financial year and after considering the performance against each objective, the Committee determined an outcome of 1.3.
Sustainability. In the three areas shown in the table, the Committee set specific objectives which constituted part of the Group’s 2018 
sustainability plan. In determining performance, the Committee reviewed quantitative outcomes, (for example analysis included 
assessment prepared by an external agency tracking reputation). The quantitative outcome for the year was below target at 0.9. 
In reviewing this outcome the Committee decided, that despite progress in this important area over the year, it would not adjust 
the score.
Pellet Production. Fines (a measure of wood pellet quality) and cost of production are key measures for assessing operational efficiency. 
Fines failed to achieve the minimum threshold whilst cost of production was scored at 1.2. Further information can be found on page 7 
of the CEO report.
Power Generation. Biomass technical availability (defined on page 192) is a key metric relating to our ability to operate when needed 
and is considered by the Board regularly as part of overall operational performance. The Committee considered performance 
to have exceeded target. Value from flexibility is used by management to assess Drax’s support to balancing the electricity grid. 
The Committee determined that performance was on target. Further information can be found on page 7 of the CEO report.
B2B Energy Supply. Each of the three targets adopted by the Committee are used by management and reported to the Board 
as part of tracking business performance. Each is commercially sensitive. Quality of business was below the minimum threshold.  
Growth in market share satisfied the low threshold whilst cost to serve customers was judged to have satisfied the stretch target. 
Further information on each target can be found on page 8 of the CEO report.
The Committee approved the Group Scorecard result for 2018 at its meeting on 20 February 2019, subject to the final approval of the 
financial results and annual report and accounts by the Directors on 25 February 2019.

SHARESAVE AWARDS GRANTED DURING 2018
A total of 8,551 Sharesave awards were granted to Andy Koss on 28 March 2018. The exercise price was 210.5 pence which represents 
a 20% discount to the prevailing share price at the time of offer. The face value of the awards was £23,515 which is based on the share 
price of 275 pence on 28 March 2018. The awards will vest after three years subject to continued service only.
TOTAL PENSION ENTITLEMENTS FOR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES (AUDITED INFORMATION)
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of the Group’s defined contribution pension plan, with either an 
employer contribution of up to 20% of base salary, or contributions to a personal pension, or cash in lieu of pension, or a combination 
of any of these up to a maximum contribution of up to 20% of base salary.
No director was a member of the defined benefit pension scheme.
In line with the broader Group-wide review of colleague benefits, the current arrangements afforded to Executive Directors will be 
reviewed during 2019. 
PAYMENTS TO FORMER DIRECTORS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
Dorothy Thompson stood down as an executive director of the Group with effect from 31 December 2017. Pursuant to the terms 
of her service agreement, and reflecting an adjustment in respect of the final instalment following the exercise of discretion by the 
Committee, payments were made to Dorothy in 
January 2018 (£278,963); 
June 2018 (£139,482); and 
September 2018 (£78,861). 
These were in respect of pay and contractual benefits for the period of unworked notice. The payments are in addition to any 
payments relating to the vesting of Drax long-term incentive awards granted prior to her final date of employment. In addition (with the 
exception of the final instalment), the payments are in accordance with the arrangements noted in the 2017 Annual Report. As noted 
on page 78, adjustments were made to the final values which were in line with the terms of Dorothy’s service agreement and verified 
by external advisers. No separate payments were made in respect of Dorothy’s termination arrangements.
As reported in the 2017 Remuneration Report, Dorothy is entitled to pro-rata vesting of BMP and PSP Awards made in 2016 and 2017. 
A total of 95,417 shares, including dividend shares, are due to vest in March 2019 in respect of the BMP Awards made in 2016, based on 
the resulting vesting of 57.63%.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING AND SHARE INTERESTS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
The shareholding guidelines require executive directors who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards, or who receive deferred 
bonus shares under the cash bonus plan, to retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance 
contributions) until the value held is equal to at least 200% of salary. Only shares that have actually vested count towards the 
threshold. As at 31 December 2018, the shareholding guidelines had not been met, as detailed in the table below:

GROUP SCORECARD
The Group Scorecard measures and targets for 2019 have been established for the Group and for each Group business. Details of 
performance against the measures will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration so far as possible, whilst maintaining 
commercial confidentiality.
The following table sets out the categories and a description of the measures.
Target
Reason for use
GROUP
Safety
TRIR
The same basis for assessing performance as in previous years, focused on reducing the number 
of safety-related incidents.
Finance & strategy
Group Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is our principle financial metric, combining the underlying performance of each 
business (including the acquired ScottishPower assets) to give a Group outcome. The targets assume 
that the Government resumes capacity payments in full, within the year. In the event it did not, the 
Remuneration Committee will determine the appropriate adjustment to the targets.
Average Net Debt
A structural reduction in debt is a key objective for the Group with progress assessed against average 
net debt targets.
Progress on  
delivering strategy
This element will assess progress in the integration of the acquired ScottishPower assets, comparing 
actual performance against the acquisition case approved by the Board.
Sustainability
People, reputation  
& responsibility
Sustainability is assessed under the three elements of people, reputation and the sustainability  
of our biomass fuel combining performance against three KPIs into a single score.
Pellet Production
KPI
Fines at disport
Our focus remains on improving the quality of biomass pellets, measured as the percentage of fines 
(dust) in each shipment unloaded at UK ports.
Cost of production
Reducing the cost of biomass production will make a positive contribution to the Group’s financial 
performance in the medium term and beyond 2027.
Power Generation
KPI
Commercial availability
Availability of our generating assets is a key determinant of our ability to deliver earnings.
Value from flexibility
Financial value is created by providing flexible support services to the UK electricity grid.
B2B Energy Supply
KPI
Cost to serve customers
By reducing cost to serve we increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our energy supply operations.
Value created as gross margin
Gross margin is the key driver of value for our energy supply business.
SMART meter installation
By increasing the volume of smart meters installed, we expect to increase profit and to meet 
regulatory requirements.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
Non-executive directors’ fees will be reviewed by the Chair and executive directors in November 2019.

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHING TO SHARES
There are various rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares which are set out in the Articles. A copy of the Articles can 
be accessed on the Company’s website at www.drax.com/policies.
Attention should be given to the following sections within the Articles, covering the rights and obligations attaching to shares:
Variation of rights – which covers the rights attached to any class of shares that may be varied with the written consent of the holders 
of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares.
Transfer of shares – provides detail of how transfers of shares in certified and uncertified form may be undertaken. It also sets out the 
directors’ rights of refusal to effect a transfer and the action that directors must take following such refusal. It should be noted that a 
shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other holders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares 
to take place.
Voting and deadlines for exercising voting rights – these sections of the Articles deal with voting on a show of hands and on a poll. 
They also cover the appointment of a proxy or corporate representative. In respect of voting deadlines, the Articles provide for the 
submission of proxy forms not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting. It has been the Company’s 
practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General Meetings and General Meetings.
A trustee holds shares on behalf of employees in respect of the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights attached to such shares 
are not directly exercisable by the employees. The employee may direct the trustee on how to vote at a General Meeting and the 
trustee may only cast its vote in respect of shares over which it has received a valid direction from employees.
Changes to the Articles – the Articles may only be changed by shareholders by special resolution.
DISABLED EMPLOYEES
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues, 
and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, so far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.

of persons acting in concert gains control of Drax Group plc or if Drax Group plc no longer holds directly or indirectly 100% of the issued 
share capital of Drax Group Holdings Limited or else if a party other than Drax Group plc becomes the beneficial owner of more than 
50% of the voting rights of Drax Group plc’s direct subsidiary, Drax Group Holdings Limited. Following a change of control, if any lender 
requires, it may by giving notice to the relevant Group entity within 30 days of receiving notice from such Group entity that a change  
of control has occurred, cancel its commitments and require the repayment of its share of any outstanding amounts within three 
business days of such cancellation notice being given.
Under the Indenture, a change of control occurs if a party other than Drax Group plc becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% 
of the voting rights of Drax Group plc’s direct subsidiary, Drax Group Holdings Limited, or else if all or substantially all of the assets of 
Drax Group Holdings Limited are disposed outside of the Drax corporate group. No later than 60 days after any change of control,  
Drax Group Holdings must offer to purchase any outstanding Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes at 101% of the principal

of the Group following a takeover bid.

AUDITORS AND THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR
So far as each person serving as a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being 
information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made enquiries 
of fellow directors, each director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to ascertain any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This information is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.
Resolutions will be proposed at the AGM for (i) the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group; and (ii) authorising 
the directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration. As explained, the Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, 
the auditor’s effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. 
Further details on the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74.
The directors’ report was approved by the Board on 25 February 2019 and is signed on its behalf by:

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law), set out in FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company 
for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
• In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

VERIFICATION STATEMENT FROM BUREAU VERITAS UK LIMITED
Bureau Veritas UK Limited (hereafter “Bureau Veritas”) has been commissioned by Drax Group Plc. (hereafter “Drax”) to provide limited 
assurance over sustainability activities reported in its Annual report and accounts 2018 (hereafter ‘the Report’) and website  
(www.drax.com/sustainability), including the following selected performance indicators:
• GHG emissions (scope 1, 2);
• Health and safety performance (Total Recordable Injury Rate);
• Employee headcount (gender, country, business unit);
• Water data; and
• Biomass supply chain emissions.
Based on our verification activities and scope of work, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the selected performance 
indicators are not fairly stated in the Report in all material respects.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY 
Based on the work conducted, we identified the following areas of progress and good practice:
• Drax keeps track of the workers’ incidents and produces monthly Health & Safety executive reports containing incident details,  
hours worked and injury frequency rates.
Based on the work conducted we recommend Drax to consider the following:
• Reduce the materiality threshold for GHG emissions reporting. For the Report, Drax has adopted a materiality threshold of  
100,000 tonnes of CO2; and
• Be consistent on the inclusion of Drax businesses in the reported sustainability key performance indicators. For parameters,  
such as water, Drax does not include data from all businesses.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF DRAX GROUP PLC
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2018 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
• the Consolidated income statement;
• the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the Consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
• the Consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
• the Consolidated cash flow statement;
• the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies on pages 114 to 116; 
• the related Group notes 2.1 to 8.4; and 
• the related parent company notes 1 to 9
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm 
that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit  
matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Presentation of the Consolidated income statement
• Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts 
• Estimation of retail unbilled revenue 
• Accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (Scottish Power assets)
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with 
 and any key audit matters which are the same as the 
prior year identified with 
.
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £7.6m (2017: £6.8m). This was determined taking 
into consideration a number of metrics, but with particular focus on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements, 
as this measure is of direct relevance to readers of the financial statements. Our selected materiality represents 
approximately 3.0% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2017: 2.9% of Adjusted EBITDA).
Scoping
We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at five locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus 
Energy, Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited. These were subject to a full scope audit, other than Drax 
Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited which were subject to specific audit procedures to support our Group 
audit opinion. These five locations represent the principal business units and account for virtually all of the Group’s net 
assets, revenue and profit before tax.

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH CONTINUED
Significant 
changes  
in our 
approach
The following changes were made to the key audit matters reported in the prior year:
• We have included as a key audit matter the presentation of the Consolidated income statement covering both 
exceptional items and certain remeasurements; 
• We have also included the accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited as a new acquisition 
in the year; and
• The risk of impairment at Drax Power is no longer a key audit matter given the levels of headroom in both the previous 
and current year. 
In the current year, our Group audit scope was extended to include Drax Generation Enterprise Limited following its 
acquisition by the Group on 31 December 2018.
Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent with the prior year.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 42-43 to the financial statements concerning whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We considered as part of our risk assessment the nature of the Group, its business model and related risks 
including where relevant the impact of Brexit, the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework 
and the system of internal control. We evaluated the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, including challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used to make the assessment, 
and evaluated the directors’ plans for future actions in relation to their going concern assessment.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that 
we have nothing 
material to 
report, add or 
draw attention 
to in respect of 
these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the 
directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required 
to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 44-49 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 44 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 42 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group required 
by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that 
we have nothing 
material to 
report, add or 
draw attention 
to in respect of 
these matters.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We previously identified the risk of asset impairment at Drax Power as a key audit matter reflecting the significant management 
judgements involved in assessing impairment and the sensitivity of the level of headroom to reasonable changes in assumptions made. 
Given the improvements in revenue arising from both commodity prices and other sources of income, the level of headroom within the 
impairment assessment in the prior year, and the established impairment assessment process in place, we no longer consider this to be 
a key audit matter.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF DRAX GROUP PLC continued
PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT 
Key audit matter  
description
In the current year, the Group has changed the presentation of its Consolidated income statement set out on page 118 
of the Annual Report. The Consolidated income statement now segregates Adjusted results from Exceptional items 
and certain remeasurements (the ‘Middle column’) in arriving at the results for the year. The prior year Consolidated 
income statement has been restated on a consistent basis. Further detail is disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116, note 2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional 
items and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74. 
The Adjusted results are a critical measure for stakeholders and underpin the Group’s segmental analysis and 
description of business results and therefore the classification of items between Adjusted results and the Middle 
column is important for users of the accounts. 
The key items included within the Middle column are as follows:
• Remeasurement of certain energy contracts; 
• Asset obsolescence charges;
• Acquisition and restructuring costs;
• Debt restructuring costs; and
• Related tax charges and credits.
The Group has established a policy which governs which items are exceptional and should be recognised in the 
Middle column. However, judgement is applied in the application of this policy, and whether the above items meet 
the definition under the policy to be presented within the Middle column. This is a key area of audit focus for us.
Certain remeasurements comprise unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective. Such gains and losses are 
reclassified into Adjusted results when the related contract leads to a physical sale or purchase. The effect of 
excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted result is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at 
contracted prices in those Adjusted results. 
There is a risk that adjusted profit measures are misleading and that the principles used to determine the 
classification as exceptional are not in line with relevant guidance, substantiated or applied on a consistent basis. 
This also represents a possible fraud risk in relation to the allocation of items to the Middle column. 
How the 
scope of our 
audit responded 
to the key 
audit matter
We assessed the design and implementation of key controls around the presentation of items within either 
Adjusted results or the Middle column. 
We evaluated the Group’s accounting policy for exceptional items and certain remeasurements against guidance 
issued by the FRC and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regarding the publication of 
transparent, unbiased and comparable financial information. 
We considered management’s rationale for the treatment of exceptional items presented, and performed an 
independent assessment of the selection and presentation of each item against the Group’s accounting policies 
and relevant regulatory guidance. We challenged management over the principles used to determine items as 
exceptional, assessing whether the application of the Group’s policy was appropriate and consistent.
For the remeasurement of certain derivative contracts and the recycling of fair value movements to either revenue 
or cost of sales on realisation, we reviewed relevant accounting literature in order to determine whether the 
approach adopted was appropriate. The accounting standards for this are subject to interpretation and are 
currently being reviewed by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’). 
However, their draft determination supports the Group’s new presentation of the Consolidated income statement. 
We reviewed the presentation and disclosure of management’s conclusions in the Annual Report & Accounts 
to assess whether the disclosures are consistent with the Group’s policy and relevant accounting standards. 
Key observations
We are satisfied that the items presented as exceptional and within certain remeasurements in the Financial 
Statements are materially in compliance with the Group’s accounting policies, applicable accounting standards 
and guidance, and are clearly described to readers of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
We are satisfied that the prior year Consolidated income statement has been represented on a basis consistent 
with the new format adopted for 2018. 
The majority of acquisition and restructuring costs relate to the Scottish Power acquisition (£21m). However, there 
are certain smaller costs incurred in the year which relate to restructuring activities in other areas of the business, 
and which have been treated as exceptional items, and presented within the Middle column in the Consolidated 
income statement. Whilst the treatment of these costs as exceptional is subjective, the costs incurred are not 
material to the Financial Statements.

VALUATION OF COMMODITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
Key audit matter  
description
Net Gains on derivative contracts recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the year are £38.4m 
(2017: losses of £176.9m), with related derivative assets of £510.6m and liabilities of £151.4m recognised on the balance 
sheet as at 31 December 2018. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116 and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74. 
Section 7 sets out the financial risk management notes.
The Group has exposure to a number of different financial risks including foreign exchange risk and commodity 
risk, and use a variety of derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, including commodity contracts, floating swap 
forwards and cross currency swaps. 
The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection of 
appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk factors.
Due to the large amount of data involved in the contract valuations, and the requirement for certain manual 
adjustments, we have identified a fraud risk relating to the potential for management or employees of the 
company to value trades inappropriately.
How the 
scope of our 
audit responded 
to the key 
audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related to the 
valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts.
We used our internal financial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements and calculations, 
including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, confirming key contractual terms such as 
volumes and contracted prices.
We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the 
fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a sample of both commodity 
and foreign exchange contracts.
We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking these 
to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial 
statements, such as asset impairment.
We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments such 
as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments.
Key observations
From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is reasonable. 
We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve assumptions 
adopted are within an acceptable range.
ESTIMATION OF RETAIL UNBILLED REVENUE 
Key audit matter  
description
The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last meter reading 
and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. Across the retail division, unbilled revenue at the balance sheet 
date amounted to £146.5m (2017: £195m) Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical 
accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116 and the Audit Committee report 
on pages 69 to 74. Accrued income is disclosed in note 3.5.
The method of estimating unbilled revenue is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the 
volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value.
We identified a fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the retail businesses, in particular to the estimates 
underpinning unbilled revenue, as these judgemental areas could be manipulated by management to mis-report 
revenue. 
How the 
scope of our 
audit responded 
to the key 
audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related to the 
estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings provided by the 
energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also tested the controls 
over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue.
When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date, we obtained and considered 
management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of revenue supplied and 
completed sample tests to check that the December 2018 unbilled revenue amount was subsequently billed.
We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts 
recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued. 
Key observations
Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high level 
of accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue earned in the year to be appropriate.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF DRAX GENERATION ENTERPRISE LIMITED 
Key audit matter  
description
On 31 December 2018, the Group acquired Drax Generation Enterprise Limited for £686.9m. In accordance with IFRS 3 
“Business Combinations”, management has recognised the identifiable assets and the liabilities at their acquisition 
date fair values. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116, the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74, and the 
acquisition note at 5.1.
We have identified a key audit matter in relation to the assumptions applied in respect of the Purchase Price 
Allocation (PPA) exercise, identifying in particular judgement related to the fair value of property, plant and 
equipment (PP&E), goodwill and any intangible assets arising. Goodwill of £74.8m has been recognised. 
How the 
scope of our 
audit responded 
to the key 
audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls related to the acquisition process.
We tested the acquisition balance sheet and initial fair value adjustments of the acquired businesses including 
challenging management with regards to the identification and valuation of PP&E, the recognition of intangible 
assets and identification of liabilities. This was performed by assessing the adjustments applied to the acquired 
assets and liabilities and determining whether these have been appropriately recorded at fair value.
We considered the expertise and approach taken by third party experts engaged by management to perform the 
PPA exercise. We evaluated the valuation work undertaken to support the acquisition, and whether contradictory 
evidence to the valuations adopted existed. We also used our internal valuation specialists to review the third 
party report and identify areas for particular focus in our work.
Key observations
Based on the work performed, we are satisfied that the acquired businesses have been appropriately accounted 
for in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. 
Initial judgements in valuing PP&E in particular have been applied, including in the determination of depreciated 
replacement cost values. The disclosures in note 5.1 make clear that the valuation is preliminary and there could be 
further amendments as the valuations are finalised, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3. 
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements
Materiality
£7.6m (2017: £6.8m)
£4.6m (2017: £4.1m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
We have determined materiality by considering a range 
of possible benchmarks but with a particular focus on 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of exceptional 
items and certain measurements, together with profit 
before and after interest and tax as well as the scale of the 
balance sheet and the overall size of the business. 
Our selected materiality represents a approximately 3.0% of 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2017: 2.9% of Adjusted EBITDA)
We have capped materiality at 60% of the 
materiality identified for the Group. This is a 
judgement and reflects the significant value of 
investments held on the balance sheet at the year 
end (£717.0m).
Rationale for  
the benchmark 
applied
When determining materiality, we have considered the size 
and scale of the business and the nature of its operations. 
We have also considered which benchmarks would be of 
relevance to the users of the financial statements and 
those applied to the audit of similar businesses.
We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is of particular 
relevance to users of the financial statements and is a key 
measure of performance used by the Group, and excludes 
volatility caused in particular by the remeasurements of 
derivative contracts. 
When determining materiality, we considered the 
net assets of the company as its principal activity 
is as an investment holding company for the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.4m (2017: £0.3m) 
for the parent company and Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily 
on the audit work at five locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise 
Limited. These represent the principal business units of the Group and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and 
profit before tax. This is in line with 2017, other than Drax Generation Enterprise Limited which is new in the year. A full scope audit was 
performed for Drax Power, Haven Power and Opus Energy. For Drax Generation Enterprise Limited and Drax Biomass, specific audit 
procedures were performed in order to support the Group audit opinion. This scope was selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at all locations was executed at 
levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £3.0m to £5.3m 
(2017: £3.5m to £5.2m).
At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject 
to audit or audit of specified account balances.
During 2018 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Drax Power, and other senior team members also visited Drax Generation Enterprise 
Limited, Opus Energy and Haven Power. The Senior Statutory Auditor visited Drax Biomass in the US in 2017. 
In previous years, a US component team performed the audit of Drax Biomass. In the current year, the Group audit team has performed 
this audit, following a restructuring of Drax Biomass resulting in more of the finance function being controlled from the UK.
OTHER INFORMATION
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements 
of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors on page 104 that they consider the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee on pages 69 to 74 does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement on 
page 58 required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not 
properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing 
to report in 
respect of  
these matters
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud are set out below.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD
We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws 
and regulations, our procedures included the following:
• enquiring of management, internal audit and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, 
concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating to:
 
–identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;
 
–detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
 
–the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
• discussing among the engagement team including all component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including 
tax, pensions, IT and financial instrument specialists, regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and 
any potential indicators of fraud. As part of this discussion, we identified the potential for possible fraud risk in the following areas: 
the impairment of fixed assets, the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts, the cut off risk for unbilled and billed 
revenue, the presentation of the Consolidated income statement and the use of working capital transactions to potentially enhance 
cashflows; and
• obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and 
regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group.  
The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions legislation,  
Tax legislation, and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the Group operates, including the Office  
of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem).
Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified the presentation of the Consolidated income statement, valuation of commodity and 
foreign exchange contracts and estimation of retail unbilled revenue as key audit matters. The key audit matters section of our report 
explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. 
In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
• reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with relevant laws 
and regulations discussed above;
• enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
• performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud;
• reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence 
with HMRC;
• in addressing the risk of fraud in the impairment of fixed assets, we have challenged management’s underlying assumptions and 
future cash flow forecasts, benchmarked key market related assumptions including future commodity prices, support mechanisms 
and discount rates against external data where available, and run sensitivity analysis to assess whether an impairment would be 
required if a range of more conservative assumptions were adopted;
• in addressing the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, we have performed focussed testing on trades close to the year end combined 
with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised;
• in addressing the risk of fraud in the use of working capital transactions, we have challenged management on the rationale for all 
transactions entered into and reviewed the accounting treatments adopted by management against the specific contractual terms 
and arrangements associated with each individual transaction and reviewed the related disclosures in the financial statements; and

• in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other 
adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and 
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including 
internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws 
and regulations throughout the audit.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INTRODUCTION
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed 
information about the financial performance (Consolidated 
income statement), financial position (Consolidated balance 
sheet), and cash flows (Consolidated cash flow statement) of 
Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities 
controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group).
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information 
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated 
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes 
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the 
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is 
required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding 
of the primary statements set out on pages 118-122.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that are 
measured at fair value (principally derivative financial instruments 
and those acquired as part of business combinations) and the 
assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes (measured at fair value and using the projected unit credit 
method respectively).
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at 
the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items are not retranslated.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such revaluations 
are recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a 
functional currency other than sterling are translated into 
sterling using published exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenditure of such operations are translated 
into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of 
the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results 
for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments 
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows, 
are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49 of this 
Annual Report.
In the viability statement on page 42 the directors state that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the next three years.
Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months 
and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the 
Company, (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.
The Group acquired and gained control of ScottishPower 
Generation Limited (subsequently renamed Drax Generation 
Enterprise Limited), a company that owns and operates a portfolio 
of UK hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired generation assets, at 
23:59 on 31 December 2018 (the Acquired Generation Business). 
The assets and liabilities acquired have been included in the 
Group’s Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018. 
Due to the timing of the acquisition, no income, expenditure or 
cash flows are included in the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements in respect of the Acquired Generation Business.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an 
individual item in the financial statements are described in the 
note to the financial statements relating to the item concerned 
(see contents on page 117).
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except 
for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2018. 
The Group has not early-adopted any standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. 
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and 
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial 
statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of new 
requirements has not had a material effect on the financial 
statements, other than in respect of IFRS 9. The transition to 
IFRS 9 is described in note 8.3.
Note 8.2 also includes the anticipated impact of IFRS 16 which 
will affect the financial statements in future periods.
JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires judgement to be 
applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or 
complexity are set out below and in more detail, including 
sensitivity analysis where appropriate, in the related notes.

Critical accounting judgements
The critical judgements made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements are set out below.
Capacity market – on 15 November 2018 the General Court of the 
Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim 
against the European Commission, annulling the Commission’s 
State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market. This ruling imposed 
a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under 
existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended 
indefinitely until reapproval. The Government have since 
announced that they expect the Capacity Market to be reinstated 
during 2019, and that back-dated payments will be made to 
generators who have complied with their capacity obligations 
during the standstill period.
Following the ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity 
market income in Generation. Revenue accrued but unpaid 
during the period from 1 October was derecognised due to 
the current uncertainty over the recovery of these amounts 
(totalling £7 million). 
Reflecting previous Government consultations and the 
announcement on 7 February 2019 that the Collection Agent 
expects to recommence collection of the supplier charge from 
March 2019, including amounts relating to the standstill period, 
Capacity Market costs have been accrued in the B2B Energy 
Supply business in full. 
The impact of this approach on the Group’s financial statements 
is a reduction in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 
£7 million. 
 See note 7.6 on page 171
On the basis the Group expects the Capacity Market to be 
reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators, 
the suspension has not had a material impact on estimates of 
future cash flows for the purpose of impairment analyses in the 
Generation business, including the OCGT development projects. 
 See note 2.4 on page 128 and note 5.3 on page 150
Certain remeasurements and exceptional items – management 
makes judgements regarding transactions to exclude from the 
Adjusted Results of the Group, as described under Alternative 
Performance Measures, below.
 See note 2.7 on page 132
Acquisition accounting – having assessed the circumstances of 
the transaction to purchase the Acquired Generation Business on 
31 December 2018, it was concluded that the transaction 
represented the acquisition of a business and not an asset 
purchase. The Group acquired assets, people and processes. 
Accordingly, the transaction has been treated as a business 
combination in the financial statements.
 See note 5.1 on page 148
Sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that 
carry the most significant risk of a material effect on next year’s 
accounts – that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next 
12 months could vary significantly from the estimates made in 
determining the reported amount of an asset or liability.
Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic 
life. Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past 
experience, future replacement cycles and other available 
evidence. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually. 
 See note 3.1 on page 135
Fair value of acquired assets and liabilities – the assets and 
liabilities of the Acquired Generation Business have been 
recognised at fair value in the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet. 
The fair values of the property, plant and equipment have been 
calculated based on their depreciated replacement cost, before 
adjusting to reflect either a premium for immediate availability or 
a provision for economic obsolescence, as appropriate. 
In addition, the terms of the acquisition include a risk-sharing 
mechanism with the vendor that may result in a change to the 
overall level of consideration payable in the event UK Capacity 
Market payments are not received during 2019. A further payment 
may be made by the vendor, or by the Group, as applicable. The 
value and beneficiary of the further payment is dependent upon 
the gross profit achieved by the acquired business in 2019 and is 
capped at £26 million, as described in the Circular of 5 December 
2018, published on the Group’s website. 
On the basis the Group believes that the Capacity Market will be 
reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators, 
the fair value of the contingent payment at 31 December 2018 is 
considered to be £nil. The contingent arrangement could increase 
or decrease the fair value of the acquisition consideration in these 
financial statements by up to £26 million.
 See note 5.1 on page 148
Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of 
goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units where an 
indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2018, an impairment 
assessment has been completed for three of the Group’s CGUs 
which have allocated goodwill or intangible assets with an 
indefinite life. The assessment of future cash flows that underpins 
such a review is based on management’s best estimate of retail 
margins, future commodity prices, supply volumes, the capacity 
market and economic conditions. 
 See note 2.4 on page 128 and notes 5.2 and 5.3 on page 150
116
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the 
Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value 
is derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in 
question. The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon 
forward curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable 
quotations and third party sources. However, any forward 
curve is based at least in part upon assumptions about future 
transactions and market movements. Where such instruments 
extend beyond the liquid portion of the forward curve, the 
level of estimation increases as the number of observable 
transactions decreases.
 See note 7.2 on page 167
Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s 
activities, particularly within the B2B Energy Supply segment, 
results in revenue being based on the estimated volumes of 
power supplied to customers at an estimated average price per 
unit. Assumptions that underpin these estimates are applied 
consistently and comparison of past estimates to final settlements 
suggests a high degree of accuracy. However, actual outcomes 
may vary from initial estimates.
Revenue from contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line 
with the progress of those contracts. Assumptions are applied 
consistently but actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
 See note 2.2 on page 125
Pensions – the Group records a net surplus or liability in its 
balance sheet for its obligation to provide benefits under 
approved defined benefit pension schemes, less the fair value 
of assets held by the pension schemes. The actuarial valuation 
of the scheme assets and liabilities is performed annually and 
depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, 
future salary and pension increases, mortality and other factors, 
any of which are subject to future change. 
An actuarial gain on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme 
has resulted in an accounting surplus arising on the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme at 31 December 2018. The terms 
of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once 
the liabilities of the scheme have been settled; accordingly, the 
surplus has been recognised in full as a non-current asset on the 
balance sheet. The net surplus in 2018 includes an initial estimate 
of amounts due in respect of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension 
to equalise pension benefits for men and women, following a 
High Court ruling in October 2018.
 See note 6.3 on page 157
Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax the 
Group makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items 
of income and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions 
are based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where 
required, consultation with external advisers.
 See note 2.6 on page 130
ADOPTION OF IFRS 9 AND IFRS 15
In the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ for the first time. 
During the year, the Group reviewed the presentation of gains and 
losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting in the consolidated income statement. Following 
this review, the Group has elected to present these amounts in the 
line item most closely related to the underlying commodity contract. 
Previously unrealised gains and losses were presented separately. In 
addition, the Group has elected to apply the ‘cost of hedging’ provisions 
of IFRS 9, resulting in certain unrealised gains and losses previously 
recognised in the income statement being recognised in reserves.
Both of these changes have been applied retrospectively and 
the prior year financial statements have been restated. See note 8.3 
for further details. 
Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the timing 
or amount of revenue recognised. See note 8.3 for further details.
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APMS)
The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured in 
accordance with IFRS, is shown in the “Total Results” column on 
the face of the income statement. Exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements are deducted from the Total Results in arriving 
at the “Adjusted Results” for the year. The Group’s Adjusted Results 
are consistent with the way executive management and the Board 
assess the performance of the Group, and are intended to reflect the 
underlying trading performance of the Group’s businesses and are 
presented to assist users of the accounts in evaluating the Group’s 
trading performance and performance against strategic objectives.
Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not 
reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. For 
a transaction to be considered exceptional, management considers 
the nature of the transaction, the frequency of similar events, 
previous precedent and commercial context. Exceptional items 
are approved by the Audit Committee.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on 
derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts do not 
qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, 
which under IFRS are recorded in revenue or cost of sales as 
described above. The Group regards all of its forward contracting 
activity to represent an economic hedge. The impact of excluding 
these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and 
purchases at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect 
of delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the 
impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency 
purchases), in the Adjusted Results.
Further information on exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements in the current and previous period is included 
in note 2.7 to the financial statements.
The Group presents an additional subtotal in the Adjusted Results 
column. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and 
certain remeasurements. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure 
used by the Board and executive management to assess the financial 
performance of the Group.

The consideration of £687 million due in respect of the Acquired Generation Business was settled subsequent to the year end on 
2 January 2019. There were no material non-cash transactions in either the current or previous year.
The Group recorded a net loss of £21.7 million arising on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the Consolidated income 
statement in 2018. Acquisition and restructuring costs of £27.7 million are included in cash generated from operations (see note 4.4) 
and cash paid in respect of debt restructuring of £2.0 million in cash used in financing activities. All other exceptional items and 
remeasurements are non-cash and adjusted in the reconciliation shown in note 4.4.

The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a 
summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (note 2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (notes 
2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, distributable profits and dividends (notes 2.7–2.10). Further 
commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in Adjusted 
EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions 
that have affected the results.
2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate office providing 
certain specialist and shared functions. Our businesses are:
• Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK; 
• Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and
• B2B Energy Supply: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK.
The generation assets acquired from ScottishPower will form part of the Power Generation segment. No profit or loss has been 
recognised in respect of these assets in 2018 as the assets were acquired at 23:59 on 31 December 2018.
The operating segments are consistent with the prior year. Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental 
reporting. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on 
these three operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis 
is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined on page 116).
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate 
office costs are included within central costs.
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2018. The Board

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as 
those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all the 
reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months.
Capital expenditure by segment
Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by 
operating segment.

Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, 
equate to market prices at the time of the transaction. During 2018, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value 
of £213.7 million (2017: £135.7 million) to the Power Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and 
ROCs with a total value of £1,336.7 million (2017: £1,033.4 million) to the B2B Energy Supply segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation.
Major customers
Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2018 includes £555.8 million from one individual customer (2017: no 
amounts from any individual customer) that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year. These revenues arose in the 
Power Generation segment.
2.2 REVENUE
Accounting policy
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 for the first time in 2018. The accounting policies have been updated, however the amount and timing 
of revenue recognition in the Group’s financial statements is unchanged (see note 8.3).
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity by our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates 
specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Following conversion of the fourth unit in July 2018, three biomass-fuelled generating units at Drax Power Station earn Renewable 
Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is 
recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction 
in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.3). Revenue from sale of ROCs 
is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD (see below) in the income statement as a component of revenue at 
the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant 
generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the B2B Energy Supply business is recognised 
on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be 
determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered 
consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is 
estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income.
Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The measurement of progress is 
based on cost inputs for fixed price B2B Energy Supply contracts, and volume supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied 
consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
The Group is eligible for, and therefore applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information related 
to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. The right to receive consideration from a customer is at an 
amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system support services) are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the 
delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by 
reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement 
in estimating probable future outcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) 
are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the 
customer’s premises.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
2.2 REVENUE continued
CfD payments
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity 
responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes 
or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated 
by reference to a strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with 
the UK Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2018 was £111 per MWh.
When market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/
from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments 
are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income 
from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.
ROC sales
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme places an obligation on electricity 
suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued 
to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to bilateral counterparties, including suppliers to demonstrate that they 
have fulfilled their obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, 
CP1 commenced in April 2002. At 31 December 2018 we are in CP17.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set 
at £30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation. The buy-out price in CP17 is £47.22. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length 
transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the 
CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis 
to ROC generators.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the 
expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received 
at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of ROCs to help optimise our working capital 
position. External sales of ROCs in the table below include £555.8 million of such sales (2017: £201.2 million), with a similar value 
reflected in cost of sales. See note 3.3 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by the Power Generation business and those 
utilised by the B2B Energy Supply business in the year.

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is 
an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. 
The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, 
Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and the OCGTs) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of five CGUs.
The assets of the Acquired Generation Business have been recognised on the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 
2018 at fair value (see note 5.1). These assets are therefore not included in the impairment review at 31 December 2018.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the 
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected 
price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of 
recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes 
all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and 
condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly 
attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging 
activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges.
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of 
any future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value 
using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying 
amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill balances and intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2 and 5.3).

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT continued
Assessment of indicators of impairment
A review of the Group’s CGUs did not give rise to any indicators of impairment. Accordingly no detailed impairment calculation has 
been completed for CGUs where no goodwill is allocated (Drax Power and Drax Biomass). The review considered the effect on 
previously calculated headroom of movements in market prices for commodities and changes in foreign exchange rates. The review 
also considered the impact of the recent suspension in Capacity Market payments. The Group’s core planning assumption reflects the 
belief that the UK electricity market needs a capacity mechanism to ensure continuity of supply and that the Capacity Market will be 
reinstated during 2019. As a result, estimates of future cash flows are not materially affected by the current suspension. Separate 
consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3.
2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bonds) as well as foreign 
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discount on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives 
(see note 5.4) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by 
interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in 
money market funds.
On 26 April 2018, the Group issued loan notes of USD $300 million, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the issue 
were used to repay in full the £200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017. Incremental costs of the new borrowing (£3.8 million) 
have been deferred and are being amortised over the period to maturity of the debt instrument. Deferred costs of £5.2 million in relation 
to the floating rate notes have been written off in the period, in addition to an early repayment charge of £2.0 million (2017: deferred 
costs of £10.4 million and early repayment charges of £13.8 million in relation to the refinancing of the Group’s previous debt structure). 
As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded from the Adjusted Results and are presented as exceptional items in arriving 
at Total Results. Further information about the Group’s financing structure can be found in note 4.3.

2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION 
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits 
(which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for 
tax purposes and therefore on which additional tax is required) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an 
accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the 
accounting and tax rules. This is reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on 
the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far 
as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. 
Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current 
tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively.
Significant estimation uncertainty
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax 
purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full 
provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively 
enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets 
relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own 
internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19.00% (2017: 19.25%) of the assessable profit or loss for the 
year. Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before tax as follows:

As a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates from 2018 to 21%, and tax relief now arising to the Group from the UK Patent Box 
regime (see below), in the medium term we anticipate our Group underlying effective tax rate to be marginally lower than the main rate 
of corporation tax in the UK. Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to 
the technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the 
Company is now entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that 
technology. Adjustments in respect of prior periods includes a claim agreed in respect of the Patent Box regime for previous years  
of £4.8 million (2017: £10.3 million).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise they are shown

Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £31.8 million (2017: £22.7 million) in relation to start-up losses and other 
temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in 
operational performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset.
2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the Adjusted Results column of the Consolidated income statement. In order to 
provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional items are presented in a separate 
column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the financial performance of the business and 
is consistent with the way executive management, the Board and the analysts assess the performance of the business.
The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional are approved 
by the Audit Committee. 
In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately:
• Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of ScottishPower Generation Limited (2018) 
and Opus Energy Group Limited (2017) into the Group, along with costs associated with the restructuring of the Pellet Production 
and B2B Energy Supply businesses.

2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued
• Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Group’s debt in 2018 and 2017, including facility break costs and the acceleration 
of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities.
• Asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power 
Station to run on biomass. 
Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of 
commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the current period. 
The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted 
prices – i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, to better present the 
trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

2.8 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share in issue. Basic EPS is 
calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that are expected to 
vest on their future maturity dates (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2) were exercised and 
treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment 
of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £33.6 million) payable on 
or before 10 May 2019. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2018. This would bring total dividends 
payable in respect of the 2018 financial year to £56.0 million.
In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most appropriate 
mechanism to return this to shareholders.
2.10 RETAINED PROFITS
Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over its 
lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed to shareholders. The table below sets out the movements in retained profits 
during the year.

Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits 
and cash resources.
The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 182 to 187 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s 
distributable reserves of £233.6 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions 
in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future. 
The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors 
the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend 
payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves. 
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £289.0 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within 
note 4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management 
purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group. 
The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any given 
year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future.

SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL
This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and 
liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.
3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to 
generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset 
over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful 
economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and 
rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring 
the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not 
depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended. This category has been shown separately for the first time in 2018.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over their estimated useful 
economic lives (UEL) of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the 
power station – currently expected to be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the 
average remaining useful life at the balance sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years:

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.
Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common 
to the whole plant and are shown separately.
Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production segment.
Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part 
of rolling outage cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and 
technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Any changes are applied prospectively.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT continued
Significant estimation uncertainty
Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. Following the Government’s announcement relating to the cessation of 
coal generation, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but that the two existing coal units will be retained 
for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039. The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by biomass are 
unaffected by this change. No changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that 
these assets may be impaired. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review 
conducted during 2018, are set out in note 2.4.

Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2018 of £0.9 million 
(2017: £1.1 million).
Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period e.g. when an asset under construction is 
complete, it is transferred to the relevant depreciable asset category, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and maintenance 
projects. When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment balance 
and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.
3.2 OTHER FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS
Other fixed asset investments include equity investments held by the Group.
Accounting policy
Other fixed asset investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices where available, at the date of transfer. The 
Group designates its investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income, as they are intended to be held and not traded, 
in accordance with IFRS 9. Where quoted market prices are not available and investments cannot be fair valued, they are held at cost 
and are reviewed for impairment annually.

3.3 ROC ASSETS
We earn Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), 
as a result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of these assets that 
we hold at the year end.
Accounting policy
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated 
sales prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.
Where our B2B Energy Supply business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the 
period incurred.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices.  
Where relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our  
own ROC obligations. Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred.
Significant estimation uncertainty
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated based on assumptions regarding future sales prices in 
the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions 
used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.
ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the 
compliance period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure 
sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are paid over to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on 
assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some 
uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates.  
Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable but they remain subject to possible variation.

Recognition of revenue from sales of ROCs is described in further detail on page 126. The Group has increased sales and purchases 
of ROCs in the year as a result of working capital arrangements as described in note 4.4.
3.4 INVENTORIES
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity and raw materials used in 
the production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables held at the 
end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those off-site locations.
Accounting policy
Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, 
including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support 
mechanism) and transport/handling costs. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs 
denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, 
the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value. In previous periods, the cost of fuel stock also included gains and losses arising from 
fair value changes on maturing derivative contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This practice has been discontinued  
and all such gains and losses are now included in cost of sales when they arise. The prior year has not been restated for this change  
in policy as the impact was not material.

3.4 INVENTORIES continued
Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting our sites using technology regularly calibrated to 
industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency 
calculations to provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable 
error. All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate.
Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision is made where 
the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, 
the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed 
domes with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. 
Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.

Other fuels and consumables include £4.4 million of consumables acquired as part of the ScottishPower acquisition.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2018 was £1,601.1 million (2017: £1,285.8 million).
3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for. 
Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced 
the following month. 
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. The transition to IFRS 9 has not 
had a significant impact on the calculation of the provision.

Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both our Power Generation  
and B2B Energy Supply businesses. At 31 December 2018, the Group had amounts receivable from two (2017: five) significant 
counterparties representing 12% (2017: 20%) of total trade receivables and accrued income.
Of total trade receivables and acrrued income at 31 December 2018 £266.6 million (2017: £255.7 million) relates to B2B Energy  
Supply sales. 
Contract assets have been separated from accrued income for the first time on application of IFRS 15. The 2017 figures have been 
updated on the same basis. Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the 
entitlement to consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time. The Group has recognised a contract asset 
for any work performed where payment is not yet due. Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade 
receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer, usually in the following financial period.

The Group does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the provision for doubtful debts of 
£44.0 million (2017: £28.2 million). This provision, which principally relates to B2B Energy Supply receivables, has been determined using 
a lifetime expected credit loss calculation. Assumptions made regarding the recoverability of balances have been determined with 
reference to past default experiences in line with our policies and future prospects reflecting our understanding of our customer base. 
Specific balances are provided against where default events have occurred. Balances are only written off if deemed irrecoverable after 
all credit control procedures have been exhausted or the customer is in administration. 
The expected credit loss rates have been reviewed and updated during 2018 in order to reflect current cash collection rates in the B2B 
Energy Supply business and expectations of future cash collection rates. The change in rates applied has not had a material impact 
on the total provision in the current period and is not expected to significantly impact future periods. However, it has resulted in more 
balances having a provision applied. As a result, the value of trade receivables that are past due but are completely unprovided against, 
in accordance with the assessment described above, has reduced to £1.2 million (2017: £32.2 million). 
Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1. 
In the B2B Energy Supply business amounts provided against trade and other receivables increased by £33.6 million in the year, with 
a net charge in the income statement of £31.4 million, following a deterioration in cash collection rates in the first half of the year. 
During the second half of the year, collection processes were reviewed and improved. We expect this improvement to be indicative 
of future collection rates. At the end of the year, provisions of £44.0 million were £15.8 million higher than the end of the prior year.

3.6 CONTRACT COSTS
The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the B2B Energy Supply businesses.
Accounting policy
Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts are 
recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs and amortises them on a straight line basis over the contract 
period in line with the recognition of revenue. The balance is included within prepayments in note 3.5. This amount includes both 
current and non-current balances.
Amounts capitalised on the Consolidated balance sheet were £39.0 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: £39.3 million). In 2018 the 
amount of amortisation was £37.2 (2017: £24.4) and there was no impairment loss recognised.
3.7 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for trade purchases and ongoing costs), tax authorities and 
other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment 
in the future as a result of our activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).
Accounting policy
Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.

from B2B Energy Supply activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £51.7 million 
(2017: £36.8 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £14.1 million (2017: 25.9 million).
The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading 
Scheme (ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2018 include £nil (2017: £30.6 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability 
to deliver CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
Other payables includes £87.0 million (2017: £Nil) due under payment facilities described in note 4.4. 
Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas contracts, 
for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract. This has been shown separately for the 
first time in 2018 due to the implementation of IFRS 15. The prior year has been restated to the same format. The balance reduces 
as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received.

This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from 
operations during the year.
4.1 RECONCILIATION OF NET DEBT
Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below 
reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

Borrowings at 31 December 2018 does not include the acquisition bridge facility that was drawn down after the balance sheet date on 
2 January 2019, see note 4.3. 
During 2018, the Group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect 
of the Group’s US dollar denominated debt (see note 4.3). If US dollar balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate 
prevailing at the balance sheet date, net debt would be reduced by £22.0 million (2017: £nil). The corresponding value of the hedging 
instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial instrument, see note 7.2.
4.2 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that is accessible on demand. It is our policy 
to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts.

4.3 BORROWINGS
Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the 
principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the 
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with exchange gains and losses 
arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign currency risk in 
accordance with the policy set out in note 7.1. Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt instruments, 
the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately on the balance sheet.
Post-balance sheet events
On 16 October 2018, the Group entered into a £725 million acquisition bridge facility (the Facility) to finance the acquisition of 
ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1). The Group incurred £3.8 million of costs establishing the Facility during the year, 
which were deferred on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018. 
On 2 January 2019, the Group settled the initial consideration due in respect of the acquisition of £687 million, which was part-funded 
by £550 million drawn from the Facility. The balance of the consideration was funded from existing cash reserves.

On 26 April 2018, the Group issued USD $300 million loan notes listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The notes have a fixed interest 
rate of 6.625% and mature in 2025. The proceeds of the issue were used to repay £200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017. 
Costs associated with the repayment of these loan notes have been classified as exceptional. 
The purpose of the new loan notes is to extend the maturity date of the Group’s senior debt and reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
The Group has taken out a cross-currency interest rate swap (see note 7.1) to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the USD 
loan notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five year period, this instrument fixes the sterling 
repayment of principal at £213.3 million in 2023, the impact of which would reduce borrowings by £22.0 million.
The $25 million revolving 30 day facility remains available to the Group, but was undrawn at 31 December 2018.

In addition to the $300 million USD loan notes issued in 2018, the Group’s financing structure also includes £350 million of 4.25% fixed 
rate notes and a £350 million Senior Facility comprised of a £315 million revolving credit facility (RCF) and an index-linked term loan of 
£35 million.
The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 
2018, the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £31.8 million (2017: £35.7 million). 
The Group had two facilities available but undrawn at 31 December 2018:
• £725 million acquisition bridge facility, subsequently part-drawn on 2 January 2019 (as described above); and
• USD $25 million 30-day revolving facility. 
The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it has access to certain non-recourse trade receivable finance facilities and 
payment facilities, as described in note 4.4, which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash inflows and defer cash outflows.

Note:
(1)  During 2016 we closed out a number of in-the-money forward foreign currency purchase contracts with a total value of £14 million. As these contracts were designated into hedge 
accounting relationships under IFRS 9, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs.
(2)  The prior year has been restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9 (see note 8.3). 
The B2B Energy Supply business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables 
on a non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of £24 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, reflected as a 
reduction in receivables in the table above (2017: inflow of £34 million). The facility terms were amended during the year, increasing 
the facility size to £150 million and bringing more of the receivables balance into its scope, further improving the Group’s overall 
liquidity and risk profile.
Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and purchase 
arrangements we are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact of ROC purchases and sales on 
operating cash flows was a £10.5 million outflow (2017: £161.0 million inflow). We also have access to facilities enabling us to sell ROC 
trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. These facilities were unused at the period end (2017: £Nil). 
The Group entered into a number of payment facilities in 2018 to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing, 
whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group, for which £87.0 million was outstanding at 31 December 2018 (2017: £Nil). 
The amounts fall due between 4 and 60 days from the end of the year.
The Group has sought to normalise payment across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some 
reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be accelerated in 
advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect our working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the 
Group. At 31 December 2018, amounts utilised were not material.

4.5 EQUITY AND RESERVES
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its 
liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds.

the Group had repurchased 13.0 million ordinary shares as part of the programme at a total cost, including transaction costs, of £47.1 
million. These shares are held in a separate Treasury Share reserve awaiting reissue or cancellation and have no voting rights attached 
to them. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 21 January 2019, the buy-back programme concluded. In total, the Group purchased 13.8 million shares 
for total consideration of £50.4 million, including transaction costs.

Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s US-based subsidiaries from their functional currency 
(US dollar) into sterling for presentation in these consolidated financial statements are recognised in the translation reserve.
The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005. Movements in 
the share premium reserve reflect amounts received on the issue of shares under employee share schemes.
Movements in the hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve, which reflect the change in fair value of derivative financial

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, 
including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions.
5.1 ACQUISITIONS
Accounting policy
Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration 
transferred and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The 
assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and profit or loss of the acquired business are 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income 
statement in the period the acquisition occurs as an exceptional item. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited
The Group announced the proposed acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited from Iberdrola on 16 October 2018. The acquisition 
was approved by shareholders on 21 December 2018 and subsequently completed at 23:59 on 31 December 2018. 
ScottishPower Generation Limited was renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (DGE) on 9 January 2019.
DGE owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired power generation assets, including Cruachan Power 
Station, one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, run-of-river hydro schemes in Lanark and Galloway, and gas-fired Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in the south of England, and Blackburn Mill in 
the north. DGE also owns SMW Ltd, a company operating a biomass-from-waste facility on the outskirts of Glasgow.
The new sites are complementary to the Group’s existing generation activities, diversifying the Drax portfolio and widening the Group’s 
UK footprint. The expanded portfolio of assets ensures the Group can support a power system with increasing intermittent renewable 
capacity by providing flexible generation and system support. 
The acquired assets are expected to make a positive contributions to both Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows from 2019, as set out in 
the shareholder Circular recommending the acquisition, on 5 December 2018, and in the profit forecast referenced on page 41 of this 
Annual report.
The purchase consideration was £702 million, payable entirely in cash, subject to working capital adjustments customary for a 
transaction of this type. In addition, following the suspension of the UK Capacity Market on 15 November 2018, the Group announced 
it had agreed a risk-sharing mechanism with the vendor which will activate in the event the Group does not receive 100% of the 
contracted Capacity Market payments for the acquired assets in the period 1 January to 30 September 2019.
If 100% of Capacity Market payments are not received in this period, a further payment will be made either by the Group or by the 
vendor, the value and beneficiary of which is contingent upon the 2019 gross profit achieved by the acquired assets. The value of  
any further payment for both parties is capped at £26 million. Full details are set out on the Group’s website. (www.drax.com/cmrisk).  
In the event Capacity Market payments remain suspended beyond 2019, the Group will be entitled to no further compensation.
Reflecting the Group’s belief that the Capacity Market is likely to be reinstated during 2019, no value has been ascribed to the 
risk-sharing mechanism in determining the fair value of the consideration payable on the acquisition date.
In the event the Capacity Market restarts and the Group receives payments relating to the period following the Capacity Market 
suspension but prior to the acquisition date (1 October to 31 December 2018), these payments will be passed directly to the vendor and 
accordingly no amounts are recorded in the provisional fair values shown below.
The total consideration, after adjusting for estimated working capital values, was £687 million. The consideration remains provisional 
and is subject to a completion accounts process. 
The consideration was paid on 2 January 2019, funded by a combination of existing cash reserves (£137 million) and the partial drawing 
of a £725 million acquisition bridge facility (£550 million). The Group expects to conclude a refinancing of the bridge facility during 
2019, as described in note 4.3.
Acquisition-related costs, including stamp duty and advisers fees, amounted to £18.4 million and have been recognised in 2018. 
The Group incurred a further £2.6 million of costs in 2018 on activities to ensure operational readiness and initial integration activities 
at completion. The total costs of £21.0 million are reported as exceptional items and included in the acquisition and restructuring line 
in the income statement.

Provisional goodwill of £74.8 million is largely reflective of the trading and operational opportunities that arise from acquiring a 
multi-site multi-fuel generation portfolio together with the assembled skilled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be 
deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets reflect software previously recognised on the balance sheet of the acquiree. 
The financial assets acquired include £35.8 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for ancillary services 
and balancing market activity. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual 
amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was less than 
£0.1 million. Financial assets includes a net balance of £3.5 million in respect of amounts payable to and receivable from the vendor 
and its fellow group undertakings. The Group received an initial settlement in respect of these balances on 2 January 2019, which will 
be finalised as part of the completion accounts process.
Additional financial information
The consolidated results of the Group, assuming DGE had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show Total revenue of 
£4,780.0 million (compared to reported Total revenue of £4,229.0 million) and a Total profit after taxation of £43.2 million (compared 
to the reported Total profit after taxation of £20.2 million). This information includes the revenue and profits made by DGE and its 
subsidiary undertaking between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, extracted from the historical financial records of the acquired 
companies. Profit centre analysis was used to exclude the historic results and restructuring activities relating to assets not acquired 
by the Group; however no adjustment has been made for the alignment of accounting policies nor the impact of measuring acquired 
assets and liabilities at fair value. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have 
been achieved had the acquisition actually occurred on 1 January 2018, nor is it indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
5.2 GOODWILL
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. 
Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for 
that CGU assessed. The table below shows movements and balances:

5.2 GOODWILL continued
In addition, the Group recognised £74.8 million of provisional goodwill in respect of the ScottishPower transaction in 2018 (see note 
5.1). Reflecting the timing of the acquisition, none of the provisional goodwill has been allocated to individual CGUs. This will be 
completed during 2019.
Impairment review
The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using 
the Group’s established planning model. This model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are 
customer margins and supply volumes. Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply costs. 
Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.
The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2018 was £40 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU were 
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to 
the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s B2B Energy Supply business). We believe that this rate reflects the 
prospects for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was 
significantly in excess of its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2018 was £342 million, including intangible assets of £162 million. 
Following further integration of Opus Energy into the Group’s existing B2B Energy Supply business during 2018, the discount rate was 
assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 8.1%. The value in use of the Opus Energy CGU, including the goodwill and 
intangible assets, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. Reflecting the recent acquisition of Opus, the recoverable amount 
of the Opus CGU was tested using a range of discount rates up to the rate used in the acquisition valuation of intangible assets in 2017 
(10.7%) – application of discount rates across the 8.1% to 10.7% range would not result in an impairment charge. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU. This analysis indicates that any 
reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment 
loss in respect of goodwill.
5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired in 
business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases 
computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.
Accounting policy
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are measured 
at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the 
condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No changes 
to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2018. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained 
in further detail below.
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand are 
attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2.

Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which 
provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million reflected the 
estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent upon estimates 
of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has an estimated useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate 
analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time.
Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11 million on a relief-from-royalty 
method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life.
Computer software
Additions in the period include assets acquired in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business, 
which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment. Software assets are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years.
As at 31 December 2018, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to £24.5 million (2017: £11.1 million).
Development assets
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value 
of planning and consents. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised 
and are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2018, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived 
from the Group’s established planning model. The assessment reflected the Group’s core planning assumption that the Capacity 
Market will be reinstated during 2019 and incorporated assumptions related to likely Capacity Market clearing prices, construction 
costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the direct costs of generating those revenues. 
152
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued 
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 9.1%, which includes an assessment of the level of 
construction and execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed. The analysis indicated a 
recoverable amount in excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets.
The analysis is sensitive to the discount rate applied. Increasing the pre-tax discount rate by approximately 1% would result in a 
recoverable amount below the current carrying value. In the event costs materially increase, or expected future revenue streams 
reduce from current estimates, the Group may not proceed with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet 
would be impaired. In particular, the analysis depends upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions 
(or equivalent income if the Capacity Market is not reinstated in its previous form).
Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading 
Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon 
assets are not amortised. In the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal, these allowances may no longer be required, as noted 
in the risks and viability statements on pages 42 to 49.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for 
the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent 
further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.
5.4 PROVISIONS
We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets 
and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a site-by-site basis 
and represents the present value of the expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from 
the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount 
rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate that reflects the duration of the liability. The average discount rate used across the Group’s 
decommissioning provisions is 1.8% (2017: 1.8%). The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows 
have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and 
equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable 
and similar charges. 
Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased offices and other provisions recognised as part 
of the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1).

Decommissioning provisions are made in respect of the Group’s thermal generating plants (Drax Power Station and CCGT power 
stations). The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place 
at the end of the expected useful life of each site (which varies between 2026 and 2039) and has been estimated using existing 
technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent updates took 
place in December 2017 for Drax Power Station, and 2018 for other sites.

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
We operate two share option schemes for our employees; the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for directors and senior executives (which 
replaced the Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) from 2017) and incorporates the Deferred Share Plan (DSP); and the Savings-Related Share 
Option Plan (SAYE) for all qualifying employees. We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, 
which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy
The PSP, BMP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the 
fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The PSP was introduced for directors and senior executives to replace the Bonus Matching Plan. Under the PSP, annual awards of 
performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a 
maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a 
proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. 50% of the PSP options 
granted in 2018 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with the remaining 50% 
vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. 
The fair value of the 2018 PSP awards of £2.5 million (2017: £2.8 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes 
into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the 
share price at the grant date of 272 pence (2017: 325 pence), expected volatility of 41% (2017: 44%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% 
(2017: 0.13%).

Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive 
directors. DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination 
provisions. The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2018 was 272 pence (2017: 325 pence) and the fair value of 
these awards of £0.4 million (2017: £0.6 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year 
vesting period. 
The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability 
of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the share price at date of grant, expected 
volatility of 41% (2017: 44%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% (2017: 0.13%).

50% of the DSP options granted in 2018 will vest in three years conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of 
companies, with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. 
Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and 
other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP. For 
awards prior to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion 
of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017 
and 2016 BMP awards, £0.6 million and £2.6 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the corresponding three-year vesting periods.
The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability 
of different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2018.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)
In March 2018, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to 
acquire shares at a price of 211 pence (2017: 280 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in 
accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts. The fair value of the 
options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of £1.2 million (2017: £0.9 million) is being charged to the income statement over the

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five 
years respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 365 pence 
(2017: 305 pence).
The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 212 pence (2017: 224 pence). 
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 16 months (2017: 22 months).
The number of options exercisable at the year-end was 2,252 (2017: nil).

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group operates one defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes. 
The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a defined benefit scheme: a pension 
arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members 
are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free 
lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax 
Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual 
contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.
As part of the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (see note 5.1), employees with defined benefit pension rights were 
transferred to the Group. These employees continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the 
process of setting up a new scheme (the Drax 2019 Scheme) for the members to transfer into.
Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them 
to the contributions. The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid 
by the Group in respect of the current period.
For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains 
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately 
in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined 
benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised 
in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense 
is recognised in finance costs.
Significant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including 
discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually 
and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are 
reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from 
such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2018 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with 
independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates four defined contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, 
Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the 
defined contribution schemes are as follows:

During 2018, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Drax Power Group of the ESPS, which are described in 
further detail below, resulted in the scheme moving into a position of surplus assets over liabilities. The scheme rules allow the Group 
to benefit from any residual surplus upon winding up of the scheme. As a result, the surplus has been recognised in the balance sheet 
in full.
Drax Power Group (DPG) section of ESPS
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members 
of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk
The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets 
(diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, though expected to outperform 
corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets 
is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Discount rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this 
will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.
Longevity risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation will 
lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely 
correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on 
inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The scheme has a significant holding 
in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk is hedged.
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the 
burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members 
with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016. 
The actuarial review at 31 December 2018 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The scheme 
board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost. 
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account 
experience over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit 
method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future 
improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2018 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they 
are male (2017: 26 years) and for a further 29 years if they are female (2017: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female 
non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively (2017: 27 and 30 years respectively).
The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the DPG section of the ESPS is the excess of the fair value of the plan

On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that defined benefit schemes should be amended to equalise 
benefits in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions (GMP) for men and women. It is not yet agreed how benefits will be equalised 
in practice; however, on the grounds that implementation will not lead to any further obligations, the Group’s actuarial advisers have 
initially estimated that the liabilities of the scheme will increase by £0.6m as at the date of the court ruling. This has been reflected as 
a past service cost in 2018.

The actuarial gains of £23.0 million (2017: £4.8 million) reflect gains of £21.8 million arising from changes in financial assumptions 
(2017: gains of £5.5 million) and £1.8 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions (2017: losses of £4.5 million) 
offset by losses arising from scheme experience of £0.6 million (2017: gains of £3.8 million).
The gains due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising 
as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 3.0% (2017: 2.6%) following increases in corporate bond yields.

investing (29%), long lease property (12%), and cash (5%) 
(2)  Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower) 
(3)  Other assets include £15.5 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2017: £17.9 million) 
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets 
are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market 
principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class 
relative to the actual asset allocation for the scheme.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions 
where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet 
to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the 
duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.
Future contributions
The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of £10.1 million to the defined benefit pension plan during 
the 12 months ended 31 December 2019.
In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions 
as at the 31 March 2016 valuation. The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of £45 million including an estimate of the impact of 
future service costs, which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2018 for inclusion in the financial statements. 
This valuation has improved since 31 March 2016, in line with the accounting surplus, although this remains subject to a recovery plan.
The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit. At this point the 
scheme is expected to be self-sufficient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed 
in the valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group’s business plan. The terms 
of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled. Accordingly the deficit 
contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.
Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme
On 31 December 2018, the Group purchased a generation business from ScottishPower (see note 5.1). Under the terms of the sale and 
purchase agreement (SPA), a number of employees with defined benefit rights transferred to the Group. The employees in question 
continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the process of setting up a new scheme for the 
members to transfer into (the Drax 2019 Scheme). 
The calculations set out below have been performed on the assumption that the transfer of members and assets into the Drax 2019 
Scheme occurs during 2019, and will be in accordance with the terms set out in the SPA and the draft Trust Deed regarding the future 
operation of the new scheme.
The liabilities and asset values at 31 December 2018 have been calculated based on advice from PwC, an independent qualified actuary. 
The liabilities have been calculated using full member by member data as at 16 October 2018, the date of the SPA. The valuation has 
been prepared at 31 December 2018 allowing for the accrual of benefits up to the year end date and based on the assumptions set 
out below. The valuation includes an allowance for the equalisation of GMP, calculated using an actuarial GMP benefit modelling tool. 
The total asset value at 31 December 2018 has been estimated based on a share of funds mechanism agreed with ScottishPower 
in the SPA.

Assumptions have been set using the best information currently available to the Group and based on the Group’s expectations of 
events during 2019 in order to set up the new pension scheme. In the event that experience in 2019 differs from these estimates,

This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.
7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability 
of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the risk 
management committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties (page 44) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial  
risks in close coordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, the price of coal, 
sustainable wood fibre and pellets, other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have 
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so and 
in line with specified limits under approved policies. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash 
flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities 
principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The Group applies 
the own use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 as set out in the accounting policies in notes 7.2 and 7.4.
Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially-settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of 
power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of its B2B Energy Supply 
customers and, looking forward following the acquisition of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) assets at the end of 2018, as a fuel  
for its gas-fired generation portfolio.
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic 
and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash 
flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the 
balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, in the Group’s Total Results:
• profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by £6.6 million (2017: loss after tax would increase/
decrease by £1.5 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and
• the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £18.9 million (2017: increase/decrease by £5.6 million) mainly as a result of the changes 
in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulting from committed and forecast transactions in foreign 
currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Power Generation business. These purchases are typically 
denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euros.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in US dollars  
(see note 4.3). The Group utilises derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt.
It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign 
currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative contracts, 
including forwards and options, to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period.
The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc.
SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT 
164
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Foreign currency sensitivity
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, in the 
Group’s Total Results:
• profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by £112.3 million/£124.7 million (2017: loss after tax 
would decrease/increase by £351.1 million/£285.5 million). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange 
contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and
• other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £160.6 million/£183.6 million (2017: decrease/increase by £111.1 million/£122.8 million) 
as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to cash and cash equivalents and floating rate debt 
instruments. At December 2018 the Group had no floating rate debt instruments drawn. The Group has taken out a fixed to fixed 
cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with the USD $300 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, 
effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows. 
The return generated on the Group’s cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility, are also exposed to 
movements in short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst 
retaining liquidity.
Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided in note 4.3.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the 
balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance 
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the 
year ended 31 December 2018 would decrease/increase by £1.0 million (2017: loss after tax would decrease/increase by £2.2 million) 
as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.
Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of 
directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group 
maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding 
for business requirements. 
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items 
(principally those related to ROC sales and B2B Energy Supply power sales). In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis 
and accordingly the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. As discussed in the financial 
review on page 34, the Group also utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers 
on time. The impact on the Group’s cash flows is described in note 4.4.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both 
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest 
rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Interest payments are calculated based on forward interest rates estimated at the balance sheet date using publicly available 
information.
The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on the Group’s borrowings was 4.56% (2017: 4.38%).
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked to 
market, based on the undiscounted cash flows. Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been 
determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward 
curves existing at the reporting date.

Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of currency, sustainable biomass and other goods 
and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial 
difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost 
goods or services from other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these 
counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £44.0 million (2017: £28.2 million) and exclude 
non-financial receivables such as prepayments.
Of the Group‘s three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the 
number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production segment only trades intra-group.
The highest risk is in the B2B Energy Supply segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of 
markets. In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised 
largely of smaller retail and commercial entities. 
In the B2B Energy Supply segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both 
before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. In addition 
the B2B Energy Supply segment extended its trade credit insurance programme to increase its mitigation to credit risk.
For the Power Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as sale of by-
products from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by 
category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net 
settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods 
to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral and letters of credit. 
The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions. 
In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds are 
available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those funds 
within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum 
investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern and maintain its credit rating while maximising 
the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of 
shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed 
in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2.

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass 
and CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial forward 
and option contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign currency risk (see note 7.1).
A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to the Group’s business model. Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price 
movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to 
de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2018, the fair value of our 
forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies (principally for the purpose 
of fixing the sterling cost of sustainable biomass purchases), increased to £359.0 million (2017: £160.0 million). 
Accounting policy
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence 
the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract 
in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from 
fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the Group’s 
own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances 
and forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in 
the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts 
are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are 
not met. The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts 
to be economic hedges, regardless of whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met. To ensure these derivatives are not 
reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the Adjusted Results in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets 
or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.
The location in the consolidated financial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in the current and previous 
year is summarised in the table below:

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Significant estimation uncertainty
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward 
price curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for 
delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward 
price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do 
not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate 
of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued 
using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, 
discount rate and assumptions about volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future 
transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
Fair value accounting
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial 
coal, financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet 
at fair value as follows:

The Group maintains a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in 
foreign currencies. The vast majority of fuel purchases, and therefore currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars. 
The unrealised gains reflect the weakening of sterling against the US dollar in the year.
A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IFRS 9 and thus the gains on 
these contracts were recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised gains or losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains or losses on the portion of forward currency 
exchange contracts that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9.

Fair value measurement
• Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is 
calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market 
price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the 
current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
• Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is 
determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
• Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, 
is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market 
price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain 
embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, 
and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
IFRS requires categorisation of our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on 
which their fair values have been determined:
• Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
• Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are largely determined by comparison 
between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and 
receivables arising from operations.
Fair value
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.5) and trade and other payables (note 3.7) generally have 
a short time to maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s 
borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans, see note 4.3.
The financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost. The terms of the instruments have been reviewed for the existence 
of embedded derivatives. The 2022 fixed rate loan notes and the 2025 USD loan notes both contain an early repayment option that 
meets the definition of an embedded derivative. However, in both cases, these have not been separated as they are deemed to be 
closely related to the host contract. At 31 December 2018, the fair value of the loan notes was £4.6 million and in excess of the carrying 
value of £574.3 million (based on quoted market prices).

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
7.4 HEDGE RESERVE
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow 
hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with 
its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether 
the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent 
they are effective.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated 
commodity or currency.

Commodity contracts and financial contracts are released from equity to revenue or cost of sales in the income statement. Gains and 
losses on the cross currency interest rate swap are released to interest costs. 
The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period 
end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve 
are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is 
when the underlying power is delivered. For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. 
Further information about the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.
Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released to 
the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the 
year (2017: £Nil). Due to the nature of the hedge relationships, the movement in value for the hedged items and hedging instruments 
are comparable.
The expected release profile from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows:

7.5 COST OF HEDGING RESERVE
On transition to IFRS 9, the Group has elected to allocate unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of foreign currency derivative 
contracts to a new cost of hedging reserve. The prior year amounts have been restated and a reconciliation is provided in note 8.3.
A large proportion of the derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps. 
Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow 
hedge relationships. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, an election was made to designate the cost of hedging – being the change in 
fair value associated with forward points including currency basis – to equity. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively. 
As a result, the Group’s loss on initial application has decreased and the corresponding increase was taken through equity to a new 
cost of hedging reserve.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated currency.

7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of the 
Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Capacity market suspension
On 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim against the European 
Commission, annulling the Commission’s State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market. This ruling imposed a standstill period on the 
Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until re-approval. 
Following this ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity market income in Power Generation. Any revenue up to 30 September was 
received, but from this date no amounts have been recognised.
The Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (BEIS) has indicated its intent, in a consultation document dated 19 
December 2018, to work with the European Commission to achieve a reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible. 
Furthermore, BEIS has indicated that, upon reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to Generators who have complied with 
their capacity agreements during the standstill period. At the date of signing these accounts the Group has complied with its capacity 
obligations in full. However, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU State aid re-approval and accordingly at the date of these 
accounts remains uncertain. 
If the capacity market is reinstated and payments are backdated, the Group will receive income of £7 million in respect of payments 
due to the Power Generation business which would become payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2018.
As disclosed in note 5.1, should 100% of the contracted Capacity Market payments for the Acquired Generation Business not be 
received in respect of the period 1 January to 30 September 2019, a risk sharing mechanism may result in further payments being made 
either to or from the Group in respect of the acquisition.

7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 
Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number 
of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s 
contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £31.8 million (2017: £35.7 million).
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £63.7 million 
(2017: £41.3 million).
Guaranteed Minimum Pension
The Group has previously disclosed a contingent liability in respect of the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP). 
On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that schemes should be amended to equalise benefits in relation 
to GMP for men and women.
Accordingly, the Group has included the estimated cost of equalisation (£0.6m) in calculating its defined benefit pension obligations 
at 31 December 2018 (see note 6.3).
7.7 COMMITMENTS
The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not 
recorded in the balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase 
of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision 
of services.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily for the 
delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2019–2027. To the 
extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing 
to application of the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.2).

SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION
This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group 
(e.g. operations and registered office). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that 
are not specific to any one note.
8.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together, the Group) have three principal activities:
• electricity generation;
• electricity supply to business customers; and
• manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US.
The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, 
United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements, 
which follow these consolidated financial statements.
8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2018. The Group adopted the following from 
1 January 2018:
IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 (including clarifications issued on 12 April 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.
Other than the adoption of IFRS 9, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group. The transition disclosures for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 have been included in note 8.3.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending 
endorsement by the EU – marked by *):
IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reportings beginning on or after 1 July 2018.*
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*
IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) 
– effective date deferred indefinitely.*
IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – effective from 1 January 2019.
IAS 19 (amended) – Employee Benefits – effective from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 3 (amended) – Business Combinations – effective from 1 January 2020.
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (amended) – effective from 1 January 2020.
IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 (amended) Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors – effective from 1 January 2020.
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts – effective from 1 January 2021.
174
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued  
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group, 
other than IFRS 16 as noted below.
IFRS 16 – Leases
The Group will adopt IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 and has chosen to adopt the modified retrospective application. Consequently, 
comparative information in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 will not be restated.
The new requirements will impact the Group’s accounting for lease contracts.
The Group’s current operating lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating 
sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, these leases will be brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the 
Group will recognise a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts.
On transition, the Group will make use of the practical expedient available not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. 
Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or 
modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group will apply the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on 
or after 1 January 2019. We do not anticipate this change to have a significant impact on the assessment of contracts that are in scope 
of the definition of a lease.
For short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets, the Group will elect to recognise a lease expense on a straight-
line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. Short-term leases include those which end within 12 months of transition.
Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with our policy outlined in note 2.4. This will replace the 
previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts.
Impact on lease accounting
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of approximately £31 million. 
A preliminary assessment has been concluded that indicates the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease 
liability of approximately £20 million on transition to the new standard in 2019. This value is lower than the value of non-cancellable 
minimum lease payments owing to the existence of short-term and low-value leases, and the effect of discounting.
The preliminary assessment indicates that £18 million of the existing lease obligations relate to short-term and leases of low value assets. 
The effect of discounting has been estimated for the purpose of this analysis. The anticipated effect on profit or loss (compared to 2018 
results for lease contracts in existence at the balance sheet date) is a reduction in administrative and operating expenses of 
approximately £5 million, offset by increases in depreciation of approximately £4 million and finance costs of approximately £1 million. 
Actual values may differ from those in this preliminary assessment.
Due to the timing of the transaction the Group has not yet completed any detailed analysis of lease contracts acquired as part of the 
ScottishPower generation portfolio for this purpose. Initial investigations indicate the largest lease in the portfolio has a present value 
of approximately £5 million.

8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations. It applies to all revenue arising from 
contracts with customers, unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards. Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any 
changes to the amounts recognised in these financial statements compared to the previous requirements, nor any restatement 
of the prior period comparative information. 
The adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the amount or timing of revenue recognised in either period. In accordance 
with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new requirements retrospectively and has reclassified certain 
balance sheet receivables and payables for the 2017 financial year. The Group has applied certain practical expedients on initial 
application including the exemption from the requirement to apply the standard to contracts that begin and end within the same 
annual reporting period and contracts completed before 1 January 2017. These practical expedients did not have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
The accounting policies, as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for 31 December 2017, have not materially changed. Particular 
areas for consideration have been in respect of the growing B2B Energy Supply Segment which supplies to businesses ranging from 
micro-businesses to large Industrial & Commercial participants. Larger customers actively rather than passively renew their supply 
contracts. These contracts have been separated into two main categories; those with a fixed price for a contracted period of time, 
and those with a variable or flexible price where the contract price varies according to changes in the cost of supply.
For fixed price contracts, progress is measured with reference to the costs of supply incurred at the point the energy is delivered and 
revenue is accrued or deferred accordingly. For variable rate and flexible contracts, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the 
energy is supplied and is measured at the contracted price per unit supplied.
The B2B Energy Supply business accrues revenue based on estimated usage each period and this is recognised in the balance sheet as 
accrued income. Where the consideration received from the customer is in advance of supply, revenue is deferred on the balance sheet. 
Generation revenue continues to be recognised at the point of delivery. Activities within the scope of IFRS 9 (see below) are outside 
the scope of IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement; 
impairment; and hedge accounting which has been fully adopted by the Group. 
On transition to IFRS 9, the key change in the Group’s accounting policy for financial instruments is to recognise the ‘cost of hedging’ 
(explained below) initially in a reserve, rather than the income statement. Amounts are subsequently reclassified from the cost of 
hedging reserve and recognised in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged item. This change in policy has been applied 
retrospectively with comparative information for the period beginning 1 January 2017 being adjusted as though the cost of hedging 
approach had always been applied for those derivatives that existed at or since 1 January 2017.
Unrealised fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating 
to fuel purchases, which will be recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, are released directly from the hedge reserve.
Prior year comparatives have not been restated for other aspects of IFRS 9, as the effect is not material. 
In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to provisioning and has 
calculated this using lifetime expected losses. This calculation has had no material impact on the financial statements.
The transition to the new standard is complete; however, the Group will monitor emerging developments and interpretations of the 
new standard.
Changes in presentation of income statement
All gains and losses on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in revenue or cost of sales as and 
when they arise. 
However, since the purpose of the derivative contracts concerned is to hedge certain risk exposures, principally commodity price 
and foreign currency risks, a columnar format has been adopted for the income statement in which adjusted results are presented, 
excluding certain gains and losses arising from remeasuring derivative contracts to fair value. The purpose of adjusted results is 
to reflect sales of electricity and purchases of fuel at the contracted price. This includes the effect of relevant financial derivatives 
(such as forward foreign currency contracts) used to secure the all-in sale or purchase price of the commodity concerned.
176
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued
The adjusted results therefore in effect apply the accounting treatment that would have applied under IFRS 9 had the derivative 
contracts concerned qualified for hedge accounting. This is consistent with the practice followed by other major UK power generation 
companies. This change has been applied retrospectively but has not changed the prior year results, only their presentation.
The impact on the previously reported amounts in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, due to changes in 
accounting policies, are set out in the tables below. There have been no changes to the balance sheet other than the creation of a cost 
of hedging reserve.

8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued
(a) Adoption of IFRS 9 
A large proportion of our derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps. 
Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow 
hedge relationships. As part of the transition, an election has been made to apply the cost of hedging approach resulting in the change 
in fair value associated with forward points, including currency basis, being initially recognised in equity and subsequently reclassified 
to profit or loss. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively. As a result, the Group reclassified £57.5 million of cumulative 
losses to the new cost of hedging reserve on initial application and restated the 2017 financial results to reflect £20.8 million of gains 
(plus associated tax of £4.0 million) in the cost of hedging reserve.
Fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges of £85.7 million that relate to fuel purchases, which were recycled to inventory in the 
balance sheet, have been restated as though they were released directly from reserves and therefore are no longer recognised in Other 
comprehensive income. The related deferred tax of £(15.6) million has also been reallocated.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are now disclosed separately on the face of the income statement (previously included within 
operational and administrative expenses). Application of IFRS 9 has not had a material impact on the value of trade receivable 
impairment losses. 
b) Representation of the income statement
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts have been included in the line item to which they relate.
(c) Other losses
There were no material adjustments to the Group’s classification and measurement of financial instruments. 
The Group has changed its policy regarding the classification of listed equity investments from fair value through profit and loss to fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). 
(d) Tax charge
Upon adoption of IFRS 9, deferred tax and income tax values were adjusted accordingly.
8.4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

8.5 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ENLARGED GROUP
As required by the Listing Rules, the Group reproduces below the unaudited pro forma financial information included in Part VI on 
pages 51-55 of the Class 1 circular, published on 5 December 2018 in connection with acquisition of the Acquired Generation Business. 
Capitalised terms on this note are defined within the Class I circular, available at www.drax.com/circular2018.
The unaudited pro forma income statement and unaudited pro forma net assets statement of the Enlarged Group (together the 
“Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”) set out below has been prepared on the basis of the notes below, and in accordance 
with Listing Rule 13.3.3R, to illustrate the impact of the Acquisition on the income statement of Drax Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2017, as if it had taken place on 1 January 2017, and on the net assets of Drax Group plc as at 31 December 2017, as if it had 
taken place at that date. 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and presentation 
adopted by Drax Group plc in relation to its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and includes the 
combined income statement of the ScottishPower Generation Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and net assets of the 
ScottishPower Generation Group as at 31 December 2017. 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, by its nature, addresses a 
hypothetical situation and does not, therefore, represent the Enlarged Group’s actual financial position or results. The Unaudited Pro 
Forma Financial Information does not purport to represent what the Enlarged Group’s financial position and results of operations 
actually would have been if the Acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to represent the results 
of operations for any future period or the financial condition at any future date.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does not constitute financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Shareholders should read the whole of this Circular and not rely solely on the summarised financial information 
contained in this Part VI (Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information relating to the Enlarged Group).

Notes
No adjustment has been made to reflect any synergies that may arise after the transaction has completed.
No adjustment has been made to reflect the financial results of Drax Group plc or the ScottishPower Generation Group since 31 December 2017.
(1)  The net assets of Drax Group plc as at 31 December 2017 have been extracted without adjustment from the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2017.
(2)  The net assets of the ScottishPower Generation Group have been extracted without adjustment from the historical financial information included in Part V (Historical Financial 
Information relating to the ScottishPower Generation Group) of this Circular.
(3)  The Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Net Assets has been prepared on the basis that the Transaction will be treated as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. However, 
it does not reflect any fair value adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities, as the fair value measurement of these items will only be performed at the date of Completion. The 
fair value adjustments, when finalised, may be material. For the purpose of the pro forma statement of net assets, the excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount of net 
assets of £456.8m has been attributed to property, plant & equipment.

Upon completion of the acquisition, the Drax Group will draw down on an acquisition bridge facility with a maximum value of £725m. 
For the purpose of the unaudited pro forma statement of net assets, the entire purchase price of £702m plus estimated acquisition-
related costs of £23m have been funded by the acquisition bridge facility. Drax may use available cash reserves to reduce the amount 
drawn on completion.
The acquisition-related costs are not included in the calculation of the preliminary uplift as they will be expensed as transaction costs 
or capitalised as borrowing costs, as required by IFRS.
£18m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the purchase of the ScottishPower Generation Group. 
These costs will be expensed in the income statement.
£5m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the acquisition bridge facility. These costs will be 
capitalised and offset against total borrowings and are expected to be amortised over the 19-month term of the bridge facility as 
required by IFRS. This increases interest payable by £3.2m (being 12/19 months’ amortisation of these costs) and reducing borrowings 
by £1.8m in the unaudited pro forma statements.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC).
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (incorporating the amendments to FRS 101 issued by 
the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016 and the amendments to company law made by the Companies, Partnerships and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2015).
The Company applied certain new and amended standards for the first time in 2018, including IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IFRS 
15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). The full list of standards adopted is set out in the consolidated accounts on page 173. 
These updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation 
to presentation of a cash flow statement, financial instruments, share-based payments, capital risk management, standards not 
yet effective and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated 
financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
summarised below, and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(A) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where relevant, provision for impairment.
(B) Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records amounts by which the proceeds from issuing shares 
exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 are met, in which case 
the difference is recorded in retained earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
(A) Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies
The critical accounting judgements, to the extent they apply to the Company, are consistent with those of the Group described 
on page 115.
(B) Impairment of fixed asset investments
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimates of the investment’s values 
in use. The methodology for calculation of value in use is consistent with that of the Group, as described in note 2.4.
4. PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. The Company’s profit and loss account was approved by the Board on 25 February 2019. The profit attributable to the 
Company is disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
The Company received dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings totalling £102.6 million in 2018 (2017: £19.9 million).
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and a proportion 
was recharged to the Company.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 was £21,000 
(2017: £20,500).

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 11 16⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. 
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Issued under employee share schemes
From January to December 2018 a total of 158,739 shares were issued in satisfaction of options vesting in accordance with the rules of 
the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. Of the shares issued, 42,874 were issued to individuals who have left the Group where 
discretion was used to vest the shares.
The total cash received, split between nominal value and share premium, is shown in the statement of changes in equity on page 183.
Full details of share options outstanding are included in note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
7. DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES
Note 8 sets out the proposed final dividend of £33.6 million in respect of 2018.
The Company considers its distributable reserves to be comprised of the profit and loss account less treasury shares, with a total value 
of £233.6 million. Accordingly, the Company considers itself to have sufficient distributable profits from which to pay the current year 
final dividend. Based on a total dividend for 2018 of £56.0 million, the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay four years of 
dividend at the current level without generating further distributable profits. In addition to its own reserves, the Company has access 
to the distributable reserves of its subsidiary undertakings with which future dividend payments can be funded (see note 2.10 to the 
consolidated accounts for additional information).
The Company is dependent upon its subsidiaries for the provision of cash with which to make dividend payments. As shown in note 4.2 
to the consolidated financial statements, the Group has sufficient cash resources with which to meet the proposed dividend.

of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £33.6 million) payable on or 
before 11 May 2019. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2018.
9. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company has provided unsecured guarantees to third parties in respect of contracts held by a subsidiary company. 
The guarantees have been issued for nil consideration and the Company has not charged the subsidiary for the guarantees.
The Company has granted a charge over the assets of certain of its subsidiaries, in respect of the Group’s debt (detailed in note 4.3 
to the consolidated financial statements), which is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the subsidiary undertakings of the 
Company that is party to the security arrangement. The Company itself is not a guarantor of the Group’s debt.

Act 2000.
The tax-free Dividend Allowance of £5,000 per annum was reduced to £2,000 effective April 2018. This means that there is no tax 
to pay on the first £2,000 of dividend income, no matter what non-dividend income a shareholder may have. Dividends paid on shares 
held within pensions and ISAs will be unaffected, remaining tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income between £2,001 and £10,000 will need to make a declaration 
(to HMRC) for the first time. Individuals with dividend income of more than £10,000 are already required to be in HMRC’s Self-
Assessment regime. The impact on Share Incentive Plan participants receiving cash dividends on their plan shares align with  
those for Shareholders. Further information and updates on tax on dividends can be found on the HMRC website at www.gov.uk/

BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND “INFORMATION RIGHTS”
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, receive 
information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. In order for this to happen, you must contact the third party 
registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications by beneficial owners of shares where the shares are held by third 
party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder and not to Drax or Equiniti.
SHAREGIFT
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing to dispose 
charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no capital gains tax 
implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. Further information can be 
obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org.
SHARE FRAUDS (“BOILER ROOM SCAMS”)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message in the correspondence 
claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. At the time of this report, the Company was 
not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such as those outlined are usually made by unauthorised 
companies and individuals. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a premium or offers of 
free reports into the Company. Below is the advice from the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).
BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy 
or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud:
• Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
• Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
• Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
• Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
• Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
• Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
• Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.
• Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service 
or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
• Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
REPORT A SCAM
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can 
find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

exceptional items, certain remeasurements, acquisition  
and restructuring costs, and debt restructuring costs.
APM
Alternative Performance Measure.
ANCILLARY SERVICES
Services provided to national grid used for balancing supply 
and demand or maintaining secure electricity supplies within 
acceptable limits, for example Black Start contracts. They are 
described in Connection Condition 8 of the Grid Code.
AVAILABILITY
Average percentage of time the units were available for generation.
BARK SPREAD
The difference between the power price and the cost of biomass, 
net of renewable support.
BLACK START 
Procedure used to restore power in the event of a total or partial 
shutdown of the national electricity transmission system.
BIOMASS
Organic material of non-fossil origin, including organic waste, that 
can be converted into bioenergy through combustion. Drax uses 
woody biomass from low grade wood, sawmill residues and forest 
residues, in the form of compressed wood pellets, to generate 
electricity at Drax Power.
CAPACITY MARKET
Part of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform, the Capacity 
Market is intended to ensure security of electricity supply by

CARBON PRICE SUPPORT MECHANISM (OR CARBON PRICE 
FLOOR OR CARBON TAX)
A tax upon fossil fuels (including coal) used to generate 
electricity. It is charged as a levy on coal delivered to the 
power station.
CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCE (CFD)
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity 
generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for generators 
at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will 
receive revenue from selling their electricity into the market 
as usual. However, when the market reference price is below 
the strike price they will also receive a top-up payment from 
suppliers for the additional amount. Conversely if the reference 
price is above the strike price, the generator must pay back 
the difference.

carbon, including CO2 allowances under the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme and the UK Carbon Price Support (CPS) Mechanism.

are made to ensure the generator receives an agreed tariff. 
The feed-in tariff payment would be made in addition to the 
generator’s revenues from selling in the market.
FORCED OUTAGE
Any reduction in plant availability, excluding planned outages.
FORCED OUTAGE RATE
The capacity which is not available due to forced outages 
or restrictions expressed as a percentage of the maximum 
theoretical capacity, less planned outage capacity.
FREQUENCY RESPONSE 
Automatic change in generator output aimed at maintaining 
a system frequency of 50Hz. Frequency response is required 
in every second of the day.
GRID CHARGES
Includes transmission network use of system charges (TNUoS), 
balancing services use of system charges (BSUoS) and 
distribution use of system charges (DUoS).
