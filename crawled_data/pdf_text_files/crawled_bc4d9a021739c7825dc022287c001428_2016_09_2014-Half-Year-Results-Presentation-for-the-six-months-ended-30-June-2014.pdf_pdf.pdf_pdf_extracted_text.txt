API2/4/6 
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on 
board (“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered 
FOB to Newcastle, Australia. 
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE 
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges). 
BM 
BALANCING MECHANISM 
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the 
system minute by minute. 
CESP 
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME 
CESP was created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It required gas and 
electricity suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers 
in specific low income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 2009.  The CESP 
obligation period ran from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.  
DECC

DIRECT INJECTION 
A process whereby biomass is fed directly (i.e. avoiding the pulverising mills) to the burners situated in 
the boiler walls. 
EBITDA 
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative 
contracts. 
ELV 
EMISSION LIMIT VALUES 
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD. This sets annual limits on the emissions of 
NOX, SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the forthcoming PPC permit. 
EUA 
EU ALLOWANCE 
European Union Allowances, the tradable unit under the EU ETS. Equals 1 tonne of CO2. 
EU ETS 
EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME 
Trading Scheme within the European Union. The first compliance phase ran from 2005-07, the second 
compliance phase continued from 2008-12 and the third phase is proposed to run from 2013-2020. 
IUK 
INTERCONNECTOR UK 
Sub sea gas pipeline and terminal facilities providing a bi-directional link between the UK and continental 
European energy markets.  
LCPD 
LARGE COMBUSTION PLANT DIRECTIVE 
European Union Large Combustion Plant Directive sets emission standards for NOX, SO2 and particulate 
from all Large Combustion Plant (>50MW). 
LEC 
LEVY EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE 
Evidence of Climate Change Levy exempt electricity supplies generated from qualifying renewable 
sources. 
Appendix 1: Definitions

LNG 
LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS 
LTIR 
LOST TIME INJURY RATE 
The frequency rate calculated on the following basis (number of accidents/hours worked * 100,000). 
Accidents are defined as occurrences where the injured party is absent from work for more than 24 
hours. 
NERP 
NATIONAL EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLAN 
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD and the one selected by Drax. This sets 
annual limits on the emissions of NOX, SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the 
forthcoming PPC permit. 
NOx 
Nitrogen oxides, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD. 
OFGEM 
OFFICE FOR GAS AND ELECTRICITY MARKETS 
OPTED-IN / OPTED-OUT 
An opted-in plant is a power station that has elected to comply with the LCPD emissions standards. 
Opted-out plant has not elected to comply and is therefore only permitted to run for 20,000 hours and 
must in any event close by the end of 2015. 
ADVANTAGED FUELS 
Fuel that gives a price advantage against standard bituminous coals. Such fuels include, off 
specification coals and petcoke. 
RO 
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION 
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity 
from eligible renewable sources.  
ROC 
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE 
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of 
the electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable 
energy sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation 
dependant on date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.

SELECTIVE NON CATALYTIC REDUCTION 
SO2 
Sulphur dioxide, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD.  
TRIR
