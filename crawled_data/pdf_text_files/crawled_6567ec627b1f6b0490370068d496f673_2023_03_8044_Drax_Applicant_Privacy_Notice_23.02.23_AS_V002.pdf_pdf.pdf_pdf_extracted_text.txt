information in this notice.
Canadian, Japanese and UK laws require that we provide this

a Drax group company operating in Canada, Japan or the UK.

when your personal information is processed outside the US, 
however, US state laws are evolving so we will update this notice 
accordingly.
WHO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION

controllers of personal information provided by you or collected

we hold and use personal information about you and that we are 
required to notify you of the information contained in this notice. 
It is important that you read this notice so that you are aware 
of how and why we are using your personal information and 
how we will treat it. Depending on the circumstances, we may 
on occasion provide you with a shorter privacy notice to cover 
specific types of processing that will be supplemented by this 
notice.
This notice applies to those applying for roles at Drax, current 
and former employees, workers and contractors. This notice does 
not form part of any contract of employment or other contract to 
provide services. We may update this notice at any time, so you

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your 
personal information. Our Group Data Protection Officer is 
responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this notice. If

The situations in which we will process your personal information 
are listed below. We have indicated by asterisks the purpose 
or purposes for which we are processing or will process your 
personal information, as well as indicating which categories of 
personal information are involved.
We need all the categories of information in the list below (see 
The kind of information we hold about you) primarily to allow us 
to perform our employment contract with you* and to enable us 
to comply with legal obligations**. In some cases, we may use 
your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our 
own or those of third parties (UK only)***, provided your interests 
and fundamental rights do not override those interests. On 
some rare occasions, we may need your consent to process your 
personal information****.
Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there 
may be several grounds which justify our use of your  
personal information.
We may also use your personal information in the following 
situations, which are likely to be rare:
•  Where we need to protect your vital interests (or someone 
else’s interests), for example, if you are involved in a serious 
accident and we need to provide health information to the 
accident responders;
•  Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes.

Drax Applicant and Employee Privacy Notice
HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
COLLECTED?
We will collect personal information about employees, workers 
and contractors through the application and recruitment 
process, either directly from candidates or sometimes from an 
employment agency or background check provider. We may 
sometimes collect additional information from third parties 
including former employers, credit reference agencies or other 
background check agencies. If we do so, you will be provided with 
more specific information at the time. 
POINTS TO NOTE
On joining the company, you provided your personal contact/
next of kin details, which are stored in case of emergency. Such 
emergencies include but are not limited to notifying you that 
your workplace is not accessible, for example, due to bad weather 
and advising you that due to an incident, normal operations are 
suspended or being managed elsewhere***.
In the event you have not reported for work or notified us of your 
absence, if we are unable to speak with you via your personal 
number, your manager, or a member of HR may attempt to 
contact your emergency contact (or next of kin), especially in 
cases where there is a genuine concern for  
your wellbeing***.
We may also use your personal contact details to send you 
information or rewards, e.g. to thank you for your contribution to 
the business***.
When you send an email to a shared inbox (for example, senior 
leadership team members), there may be a number of employees 
who are authorised to access that inbox, so if you do not wish 
for your email to be seen by a wider group of individuals (for 
example, personal assistants), please seek an alternative way to 
communicate your message*.
When you attend events and functions organised or managed 
by the company, we may take photographs or videos to 
record the event so that we can share them on the intranet, 
internal communications, company websites or other external 
publications***. If you do not wish your image to be utilised, you 
can bring this to the attention of the organiser of the event or 
function and they will manage your request.
If you do not provide personal information
If you do not provide certain information when requested such as 
bank details or a national insurance number, we may not be able 
to perform the contract we have with you (such as paying you 
or providing a benefit), or we may be prevented from complying 
with our legal obligations (such as to ensure the health and safety 
of our workers).
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for 
which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we 
need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible 
with the original purpose. 
Please note that we may process your personal information 
without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the 
above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
HOW WE USE SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may also collect, store and use the following more  sensitive 
personal information if it relates to your employment with us:
• 
Information about your health, including any medical condition, 
health, vaccination and sickness records;
• 
Information about your race or ethnicity, religious beliefs or 
sexual orientation;
• 
Trade union membership, where appropriate;
• 
Information about criminal convictions and offences.
• 
Biometric measurements taken from a finger (but not a 
fingerprint image).
Sensitive personal information requires higher levels of protection 
and justification for collecting, storing and using this type 
of personal information. We may process sensitive personal 
information in the following circumstances:
• 
Where we need to carry out our legal obligations, for example, 
complying with health and safety obligations; 
• 
Where it is needed in the public interest, for example, equal 
opportunities monitoring;
• 
Where it is needed to assess your working capacity on health 
grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards;
• 
Where it is needed to help us drive equal opportunities for all;
• 
In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.
Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it 
is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect 
your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable 
of giving your consent, or where you have already made the 
information public.
Our obligations as an employer
We may use your sensitive personal information in the  
following ways:
• relating to leaves of absence, which may include sickness 
absence or family related leave, to comply with employment and 
other laws;
• about your physical or mental health, or disability status, to ensure 
your health and safety in the workplace and to assess your fitness 
to work, to provide appropriate workplace adjustments, provide 
Mental Health First Aider or First Aider Support, to monitor and 
manage sickness absence and to administer benefits;
• about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, 
or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity 
monitoring and reporting;
• trade union membership information to pay trade union 
premiums, register the status of a protected employee and to 
comply with employment law obligations.
Do we need your consent?
We do not need your consent if we use sensitive personal 
information in accordance with our written policy (our Privacy 
Policy) to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights 
in the field of employment law.
In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written 
consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive 
5
Drax Applicant and Employee Privacy Notice
personal information, for example ethnicity. If we do so, we will 
provide you with full details of the information that we would 
like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider 
whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not 
a condition of your employment contract with us that you agree 
to any request for consent from us and you can withdraw your 
consent at any time.
INFORMATION ABOUT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS
Where we are legally permitted and/or required, and it is 
appropriate given the nature of your role (e.g. a finance role), we 
will collect information about unspent criminal convictions as 
part of the recruitment process and we may repeat those checks 
from time to time during your employment with us as considered 
necessary. In addition, we may be notified of such information 
directly by you in the course of your employment, for example 
informing us of a driving offence which is relevant to your ability 
to drive for business purposes.
We will use information about unspent criminal convictions 
to meet our legal obligations such as to assess whether your 
continued employment poses an unacceptable risk to us, 
our customers or our employees / workers. We may also use 
information relating to criminal convictions where it is  necessary 
in relation to legal claims or to protect your (or someone else’s) 
interests and you are not capable of giving your consent.
DATA SHARING
We may have to share your personal information with third 
parties, including service providers and other companies in the 
Drax group. We require third parties to respect the security of 
your personal information and to treat it in accordance with 
the law. We have a Third-Party Onboarding Privacy Policy 
that governs our appointment of third-party service providers 
where we may share, or they may be able to access, personal 
information that we control. It requires us to carry out due 
diligence on them and to ensure appropriate data protection 
terms are in our agreement with them.
Why might we share your personal information with third 
parties?
We may share your personal information with third parties where 
required by law (for example, a tax collection office), where it is 
necessary to administer the working relationship with you (for 
example, payroll providers) or where we have another legitimate 
interest in doing so (for example, employee survey providers). We 
may also share your personal information with our insurers and 
external lawyers where it may be necessary for us to defend a 
legal claim.
Which third-party service providers process my personal 
information?
“Third parties” includes third-party service providers (including 
contractors and designated agents) and other entities within our 
Drax group of companies. 
In addition to the above, the following activities are carried 
out by third-party service providers: benefits provision and 
administration, private health care, pension administration, 
employee survey production, administration and reporting, 
child-care vouchers provision, ride-to-work schemes, banking, 
insurance, purchasing card provision and the like.
We will share your payroll bank details with Equiniti, who manage 
our Sharesave scheme, so sale proceeds and refunds can be paid 
directly into your bank account.
When might we share your personal information with other Drax 
group companies?
We will share your personal information with other companies in 
the Drax group as part of our regular human resources processes 
such as arriving at job role levels and bonus awards, during usual 
reporting activities on company performance, in the context of 
a business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise, for 
system maintenance support and hosting of personal information 
and in the event of an inter-company transfer of employment.
Transferring information outside the United Kingdom (UK), 
European Union (EU), Canada and Japan
Most of the personal information we collect about you will remain 
in the country you are employed. Where a service provider is 
based outside the UK, Canada or Japan, they are required to 
comply with data protection law. If that is the case, we ensure a 
similar degree of protection is affordedby ensuring at least one of 
the following safeguards is implemented:
• we will only transfer your personal information to countries that 
have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for 
personal information by the relevant regulator; or
• where we use certain service providers who are not in a 
‘adequate’ country, we may use specific contracts approved 
by the regulator which give personal information the same 
protection it has in the UK, Canada or Japan as required.
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of the UK, 
Canada or Japan, please contact us using the details in the 
“Contacting Us” section at the end of this notice.
DATA SECURITY  
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed such as 
corporate firewalls protecting multilayer server configuration and 
penetration testing. If you would like to know more, contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this 
notice. 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those 
employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have 
a business need to know. They will only process your personal 
information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of 
confidentiality and an obligation to comply with data protection 
law. See the Data Sharing section above for further information.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
data security breach and will notify you and the regulator of a 
suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
DATA RETENTION
How long will we use your information for?
We will only retain your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for 
the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting 
requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period 
for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and 
sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm 
from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, 
6
Drax Applicant and Employee Privacy Notice
the purposes for which we process your personal information and 
whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, 
and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal 
information can be obtained by contacting us using the details in 
the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this notice.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal 
information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in 
which case we may use such information without further notice 
to you.
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND 
RESTRICTION
Your duty to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal information we hold about you 
is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal 
information changes during your working relationship with us.
Your rights in connection with personal information
Data protection laws provide you with rights when your data 
is processed in the UK, Canada and Japan. Where you are not 
entitled to exercise a right, we will consider your request and 
feedback accordingly.
• 
Request information about how and with who your personal 
information is being used or shared (UK, British Columbia and 
Japan);
• 
Request access to your personal information. This enables 
you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold 
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it 
(UK, Canada and Japan);
• 
Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected (UK, 
Canada and Japan);
• 
Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good reason 
for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask 
us to delete or remove your personal information where you 
have exercised your right to object to processing (see below). 
However, this is not an absolute right and there will be 
circumstances where we are required to retain your personal 
information even if you are no-longer an employee of ours, 
for example, to administer pension benefit (UK  
and Japan);
• 
Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to  ask 
us to suspend the processing of personal information about 
you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or 
the reason for processing (UK only);
• 
Request the transfer of your personal information to yourself 
or another party (UK only). 
You also have a Right to Object to the processing of your 
personal information (UK and Japan).
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this 
notice.
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any time 
to the regulator for data protection issues as follows:
UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for  
British Columbia
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for Alberta
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your 
concerns before you approach the regulator, so please contact us 
in the first instance using the contact details set out below.
You also have a right to request a file review by the regulator 
(Canada only)
No fee usually required
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we 
may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly 
unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply 
with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it.
Timing of our response
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 
days. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your 
request is particularly complex or you have made a number of 
requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT 
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided 
your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your 
personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to 
withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time 
(UK and Canada).
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details in 
the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this notice. Once we 
have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, 
we will no longer process your information for the purpose 
or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another 
legitimate basis for doing so in law.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE  
We reserve the right to update this notice at any time, and we 
will provide you with a new notice when we make any material 
updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time 
about the processing of your personal information.
