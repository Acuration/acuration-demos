Customer Privacy Notice 
This document (together with our contractual terms with you) 
sets out how the Opus Energy Group and Drax Energy Solutions 
use, sometimes jointly, personal information about prospective, 
current and past customers.
Opus Energy Group Limited is made up of different legal 
entities, including Opus Energy Limited, Opus Energy 
(Corporate) Limited, Opus Gas Supply Limited, Donnington 
Energy Limited, Farmoor Energy Limited and Opus Energy 
Renewables Limited (the “Opus Energy Group”). This privacy 
notice is issued on behalf of the Opus Energy Group and Drax 
Energy Solutions. So, when we mention “Opus Energy”, “ Drax 
Energy Solutions”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy notice, we 
are referring to the relevant company in the Opus Energy Group 
or Drax Energy Solutions who are all responsible for processing 
your personal data.
Opus Energy and Drax Energy Solutions provide energy and 
related products and services to the business community. Our 
collection of personal data is therefore limited to the personal 
information of individuals representing our customers that will 
enable us to manage our commercial relationship with you, as 
explained further in this notice. You will have entered into a 
contract with either Drax Energy Solutions or Opus Energy but 
within the Drax group of companies, each company is working 
together to align systems and processes to better serve you as a 
customer, which means you will be offered a more efficient and 
cost effective service.
This notice only applies to our use of “personal data” about “data 
subjects” (as defined by data protection law and called personal 
information in this notice) which includes personal information 
relating to our prospective, current and past customers who 
are sole traders or non-limited partnerships, and contacts at 
corporate customers (“you” or “your”). This notice does not 
apply to information which you provide to us or which we 
collect about corporations (e.g. limited companies).
We will be the joint data controllers of your personal information 
which you provide to us or which is collected by us from you 
or third parties, such as your broker, if you have one. This 
means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and 
use personal information about you and that we are required 
to notify you of the information contained in this notice. It is 
important that you read this notice so that you are aware of 
how and why we are using such information and how we will 
treat it.
The information which you provide to us may include 
information about other individuals who are associated with 
the management of your business, the administration of your 
account with us or, contacts within your business. If you provide 
us with information about such individuals, it is important that 
you provide them with a copy of this notice prior to providing 
us with the information and that you provide them with any 
updated notices we provide from time to time. 
LEGAL BASIS AND PURPOSE FOR PROCESSING 
We will collect various types of personal information from you.

• ** to pursue our legitimate interests, provided that your 
interests and fundamental rights do not override those 
interests; 
• *** to enable us to comply with our legal obligations; and/or 
• **** with your consent.

Onboarding you as an energy services customer 
If you express an interest in any of our energy services products, 
i.e. electric vehicle related products, net zero products or other 
electric assets, we will require, where applicable, details of your 
current energy consumption, supplier, and details relating to 
the sites where products we supply are installed or monitored. 
To facilitate this we may use a trusted third party to gather this 
information*. 
Managing your account

Credit checking of energy supply and service customers
During the energy supply energy service customer 
onboarding process and whilst you have an account with us, 
we may use the above personal information to search the 
files of credit reference and fraud prevention agencies for the 
purposes of making decisions about your customer account, 
assessing your creditworthiness and product suitability, 
checking your identity, managing your account, tracing and 
recovering debts and preventing criminal activity**/***. 
Credit Reference Agencies (“CRAs”) collect and maintain 
information about credit behaviour. This includes data 
sourced from the Electoral Register, fraud prevention, 
and credit information - including details of previous 
credit applications and your payment history - and public 
information such as County Court Judgements, and 
bankruptcies. CRAs will give us information about you such as 
your financial history.
When a credit check is carried out on you, your credit records 
will be searched, along with any financially associated 
individuals such as your spouse or partner when you are a 
sole trader. The CRA will keep a record of this search and 
place a “footprint” on your credit file. 
The information we provide to credit reference agencies 
about you, such as your payment history, details of false or 
inaccurate information provided by you, or if we suspect 
fraud, may be provided to other organisations and used by 
them to: 
•  help make decisions, for example when managing credit 
and credit-related accounts or facilities; 
• detect and prevent crime, fraud and money laundering; 
• check your credit history; 
• verify your identity; 
• trace your whereabouts; and 
• undertake research, statistical analysis and systems testing. 
We will also continue to exchange information about you 
with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled 
accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time.  CRAs 
will share your information with other organisations. The 
identities of the CRAs, and the ways in which they use and 
share personal information, are explained in more detail at 
http://www.experian.co.uk/crain/index.html

Customer Privacy Notice 
Theft risk assessment service 
In order to facilitate the prevention, detection and any 
subsequent investigation of energy theft, all UK energy 
suppliers are required by law to provide information about their 
energy supply customers and the results of theft investigations 
to a central database, managed by a fraud prevention agency 
on behalf of the energy industry. This project is known as the 
Theft Risk Assessment Service (“TRAS”). 
If we suspect or can confirm that you are involved with any 
cases of fraud or energy theft, we will record this information 
and share it with TRAS***. The information that we provide 
to TRAS will be linked to other information which the fraud 
prevention agency holds, including information provided by 
other energy suppliers. This information may be provided to 
other UK energy suppliers with whom you have an account to 
help them investigate and prevent the theft of energy. Equally, 
TRAS may provide information provided by other energy 
suppliers to us to help us identify potential fraud or theft of 
energy. 
We may use such information to make decisions about you, 
including the products and services that we offer to you and 
the terms and conditions on which those products and services 
are made available to you. 
The information provided to or by TRAS will not be used for any 
other purpose, unless required or permitted by law.

We require all service providers and Drax group companies 
that we share your personal information with to respect the 
privacy and security of your personal information and to treat 
it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party 
service providers, including Drax group companies, to use 
your personal information for their own purposes and only 
permit them to process your personal information for specified 
purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 
Most of the personal information we collect about you is 
based in the United Kingdom or in some cases, a service 
provider or their sub-processor may be based elsewhere in the 
European Union (EU) and so, they are required to comply with 
European data protection law. On occasion, we may appoint 
a third-party service provider whose operation or a server or 
sub-processor may be based outside of the EU. As part of our 
Vendor Management Policy, we carry out due diligence on 
our third-party providers and assess whether your personal 
information will be transferred to them or accessed by them 
from outside the EU. If that is the case, we ensure a similar 
degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of 
the following safeguards is implemented: 
•  we will only transfer your personal information to countries 
that have been deemed to provide an adequate level 
of protection for personal information by the European 
Commission 1; or 
•  where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer 
personal information to them if they are part of the Privacy 
Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to 
personal information shared between the EU and the US. 
You can view certifications at www.privacyshield.gov2 ; or 
•  where we use certain service providers who are not in a 
‘adequate’ country or part of the Privacy Shield, we may use 
specific contracts approved by the European Commission 
which give personal information the same protection it has in 
the EU, called an EU Model Clause Agreement3 . 
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of the EU, 
please contact us using the details set out in the “Contacting 
Us” section at the end of this Notice.

 Article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation
 Article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation
STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
We will only keep your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose(s) we collected it for, as 
set out above in this notice, and for as long as we are required 
to keep it for legal purposes. 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal 
information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity 
of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from 
unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the 
purposes for which we process your personal information and 
whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, 
and the applicable legal requirements. 
For example, by law, we must keep basic information about 
our customers (including contact, identity, financial and 
transactional data) for six years after they cease being 
customers for tax purposes. 
In some circumstances: 
•  you can ask us to delete your personal information, see “Your 
Rights” below for further details; and 
•  we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can 
no-longer be associated with you) for research or statistical 
purposes, in which case we may use this information 
indefinitely without further notice to you. 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to 
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
who have a business need to know that information. They will 
only process your personal information on our instructions, and 
they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
personal information breach and will notify you and any 
applicable regulator where appropriate. 
YOUR RIGHTS 
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights 
where we are processing your personal information (but not in 
respect of information about a corporation); to: 
•  request access to your personal information (commonly 
6
Customer Privacy Notice 
known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you 
to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about 
you and to check that we are lawfully processing it; 
•  request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected; 
•  request erasure of your personal information. This enables 
you to ask us to delete or remove personal information 
where there is no good reason for us continuing to process 
it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your 
personal information where you have exercised your right to 
object to processing (see below); 
•  request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the 
processing of personal information about you, for example 
if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for 
processing it; 
•  request a copy of your personal information which you have 
provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-
readable format and the right to transfer it, or to require us to 
transfer it directly, to another controller; and
•  request a review of a decision made based on your profile, or 
request a review of a machine-made decision, for example a 
credit check.
You also have the “right to object” to the processing of your 
personal information where we are relying on a legitimate 
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about 
your particular situation which makes you want to object to 
processing on this ground. You also have the right to object 
where we are processing your personal information for direct 
marketing purposes. 
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights above). 
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for 
access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may 
refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. 
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it. 
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the data 
protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office 
(ICO). The ICO can be contacted by telephone on 0303 123 
1113 or by post as follows: Information Commissioners Office, 
Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF or via 
email at casework@ico.org.uk. We would, however, appreciate 
the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the 
ICO, so please contact us in the first instance using any of the 
details set out below in the “Contacting Us” section. 
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICE 
Any changes we make to our notice in the future will be posted 
on our website and, where appropriate, notified to you in 
writing.
