“Explanatory text should set the scene and provide an overview and narrative of 
the whole pre-application stage as it relates to the particular project. It would 
assist if a quick reference guide in bullet point form, summarising all the 
consultation activity in chronological order, is included near the start of the report.” 
 
“This section should define the whole pre-application consultation and explain the 
relationship between any initial strategic options stage, any subsequent informal 
consultation that may have taken place, and the statutory consultation carried out 
under the 2008 Act…"

Consultation 
with the 
prescribed 
consultees 
(s42) 
“This includes prescribed statutory bodies, local authorities consulted under s43 of 
the Act and those with an interest in the land consulted under s44 of the Act. 
These separate strands of prescribed consultees should be clearly identified. 
The applicant should include a full list of the prescribed consultees as part of the 
Consultation Report. If the prescribed consultees have been consulted on multiple 
occasions, perhaps at different phases of the consultation, then this should be 
explained. If the applicant’s list of prescribed consultees varies in any way from 
the list of organisations set out in schedule 1 of the Applications: Prescribed 
Forms and Procedures Regulations 2009 (APFP) then this should be robustly 
justified. The list of organisations set out in schedule 1 of the APFP should be 
followed in terms of the order in which the consultees are presented. 
“A short description of how s43 of the Act has been applied in order to identify the 
relevant local authorities that should be included. This could be supported by a 
map showing the site and identifying the boundaries of the relevant local 
authorities. 
It is important that those with an interest in the land consulted under s44 of the Act 
are identified as a distinct element of the wider s42 consultation. S44 consultees 
include those whose land would be subject to compulsory acquisition as part of 
the development consent order, those who may have a relevant claim and those 
whose land may be affected by the development. 
Where compulsory acquisition forms part of the draft DCO, the consultees who 
are also included in the book of reference for compulsory acquisition purposes 
should be highlighted in the consolidated list of prescribed consultees.” 
Bodies identified under 
s43 and s44 of the act are 
described in para.6.4.15 
to 6.4.25.  
For the Phase 1 
consultation, the full list of 
prescribed consultees is 
contained in Appendix 
3.N.
For the Phase 2

Consultation 
process (s47) 
The SoS needs to be satisfied that the applicant has complied with the SoCC 
preparation process. Evidence should be submitted as part of the consultation 
report which shows which local authorities were consulted about the content of the 
draft SoCC; what the local authorities’ comments were; confirmation that they 
were given 28 days to provide their comments and a description about how the 
applicant had regard to the local authorities’ comments. 
Copies of the published SoCC as it appeared in the local press should be 
provided along with confirmation of which local newspapers it was published in 
and when. 
Where there were any inconsistencies with the SoCC, for example where 
additional activities took place that were not included in the SoCC(s), then this 
should be clearly explained and justified. It would be useful to set out the relevant 
local authorities’ views about any changes made to the consultation methodology 
that were not dealt with by way of a review of the SoCC. The SoCC process is 
usually best dealt with as a discrete section within the consultation report.”

Statutory 
publicity (s48) 
“A copy of the s48 notice as it appeared in the local and national newspapers, 
together with a description of where the notice was published and confirmation of 
the time period given for responses should be included in the report.  
applicants should also provide confirmation that the s48 notice was sent to the 
prescribed consultees at the same time as the notice was published. A description 
of the consultation material used and how the prescribed consultees were able to 
access it would also be useful.  
The s48 publicity is best dealt with as a separate section within the report.”

DCLG, The 
Planning Act 2008, 
Guidance on the 
pre-application 
process (2015) 
The consultation 
report and 
responding to 
consultees 
Para. 12 
The pre-application consultation process is crucial to the effectiveness of the 
major infrastructure regime. Without adequate consultation, the subsequent 
application will not be accepted when it is submitted. If the SoS determines that 
the consultation is inadequate, he or she can recommend that the applicant 
carries out more consultation activity before the application can be accepted. 
Once a scheme is in examination there is limited scope to make changes to what 
has been included in the MPL Draft Development Consent Order (MPL Draft 
Order). This is why it is important that issues are made known and explored during 
pre-application consultation and prior to finalising the application version of the 
draft Order.  
This Report details the 
pre-application 
consultation undertaken 
by MPL. 
Paragraph. 13 
Compliance with this guidance alone will not guarantee that the SoS will conclude 
that the applicant has complied with the pre-application consultation requirements 
introduced by the Planning Act. However, where an applicant has complied with 
all statutory requirements and applicable guidance, and where the applicant is 
satisfied that they have consulted as widely as is appropriate for the scale of the 
project, an applicant can reasonably expect that an application will not be rejected 
on the grounds of inadequate consultation. Where applicants have not been able 
to comply with this guidance for some reason, they should consider providing 
comments in their consultation report. Where local authorities are not content with 
the consultation approach taken, their views should be set out in any adequacy of 
consultation representation they make. This will aid the decision on whether to 
accept the application. 
This section 3 signposts 
where it is demonstrated 
within this report how 
MPL has complied with 
the statutory consultation 
requirements.   
Paragraph. 14 
In brief, during the pre-application stage applicants are required to:

- notify the SoS of the proposed application;
- identify whether the project requires an EIA; where it does, confirm that they will
be submitting an ES along with the application, or that they will be seeking a
screening opinion ahead of submitting the application;7
- produce a Statement of Community Consultation, in consultation with the
relevant local authority or authorities, which describes how the applicant proposes
to consult the local community about their project and then carry out consultation
in accordance with that Statement;
- make the Statement of Community Consultation available for inspection by the
public in a way that is reasonably convenient for people living in the vicinity of the

Application.  
Paragraph. 15 
The requirements of the Planning Act form the basic framework for the pre-
application consultation process. The Government recognises, however, that 
major infrastructure projects and the communities and environment in which they 
are located will vary considerably. A ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach is not, therefore, 
appropriate. Instead, applicants, who are best placed to understand the detail of 
their specific project, and the relevant local authorities, who have a unique 
knowledge of their local communities, should as far as possible work together to 
develop plans for consultation. The key aim should be to ensure that the amount 
of consultation undertaken, and who is consulted, should be in proportionate to 
the size and scale of project and where its impacts will be felt.  
Section 5 describes 
MPL’s overall approach to 
consultation on the 
Project.  
Paragraph. 17 - 
18 
Consultation should be thorough, effective and proportionate. applicants will have 
their own approaches to consultation and already have a wealth of good practice 
on which to draw. For example, larger, more complex applications will usually 
need to go beyond the statutory minimum timescales laid down in the Planning 
Act to provide enough time for consultees to understand project proposals and 
formulate a response. Many proposals will require detailed technical input, 
especially regarding impacts, so sufficient time will need to be allowed for this. 
Consultation should also be sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs and 
requirements of consultees, for example where a consultee has indicated that they

would prefer to be consulted via email only, this should be accommodated as far 
as possible.  
The Planning Act requires certain bodies and groups of people to be consulted at 
the pre-application stage, but allows for flexibility in the precise form that 
consultation may take depending on local circumstances and the needs of the 
project itself. Sections 42-44 of the Planning Act and secondary legislation11 set 
out details of who should be consulted, including local authorities, the Marine 
Management Organisation (where appropriate), other statutory bodies, and 
persons having an interest in the land to be developed.12 Section 47 in the 
Planning Act sets out the applicant’s statutory duty to consult local communities. 
In addition, applicants may also wish to strengthen their case by seeking the views 
of other people who are not statutory consultees, but who may be significantly 
affected by the project. 
description of the process 
is provided in section 5.  
Paragraph. 20 
From time to time a body may cease to exist but for legislative timetabling 
reasons, may still be listed as a statutory consultee. In such situations the SoS will 
not expect strict compliance with the statutory requirements. applicants should 
identify any successor body and consult with them in the same manner as they 
would have with the original body. Where there is no obvious successor, 
applicants should seek the advice of the Inspectorate, who may be able to identify 
an appropriate alternative consultee. Whether or not an alternative is identified, 
the consultation report should briefly note any cases where compliance with 
statutory requirements was impossible and the reasons why.  
The identification of 
consultation parties under 
s42 of the PA 2008 are 
described in paras. 6.4.5 
to 6.4.42 which applies to 
both Phase 1 and Phase 
2 of the consultation.  
Paragraph. 21 
applicants will often need detailed technical input from expert bodies to assist with 
identifying and mitigating the social, environmental, design and economic impacts 
of projects, and other important matters. Technical expert input will often be 
needed in advance of formal compliance with the pre-application requirements. 
Early engagement with these bodies can help avoid unnecessary delays and the 
costs of having to make changes at later stages of the process. It is equally 
important that statutory consultees respond to request for technical input in a 
timely manner. applicants are therefore advised to discuss and agree a timetable 
with consultees for the provision of such inputs 
Pre-application non-
statutory engagement is 
described in section 6.2 
for Phase 1 and in section 
8.3 for Phase 2.  
Paragraph. 23 
Local authorities have considerable expertise in consulting local people. They will 
be able to draw on this expertise to provide advice to applicants on the makeup of 
the community and on how consultation might best be undertaken. In addition, 
many authorities will already have a register of local interest groups, and should

be able to readily provide applicants with an appropriate list of such groups for the 
purposes of consultation. 
Phase 1 and on the 
Phase 2 SoCC is 
described in paras. 8.5.4 - 
8.5.19.  
Paragraph. 24 
The applicant has a duty under section 47 of the Planning Act to prepare a 
Statement of Community Consultation, and then to conduct its consultation in line 
with that statement. Before doing so, the applicant must consult on their 
Statement of Community Consultation with each local authority in whose area the 
proposed development is situated. This may require consultation with a number of 
different local authorities, particularly for long, linear projects. In this situation, the 
local authorities in question should, as far as practicable, co-ordinate their 
responses to the applicant. This will ensure that the consultation proposals set out 
in the Statement are coherent, effective, and work across local authority 
boundaries. 
Overview of the 
preparation of Phase 1 
SoCC is provided in 
paras. 6.4.43 to 6.4.65 
and for the Phase 2 
SoCC is provided in 
paras. 8.5.4 - 8.5.19.  
Paragraph. 25 
Even where it is intended that a development would take place within a single 
local authority area, it is possible that its impacts could be significantly wider than 
just that local authority’s area - for example if the development was located close 
to a neighbouring authority. Where an applicant decides to consult people living in 
a wider area who could be affected by the project (e.g. through visual or 
environmental impacts, or through increased traffic flow), that intention should be 
reflected in the Statement of Community Consultation. 
The rationale for the 
adoption of the CCZ and 
OCZ as the basis for 
consultation is provided in

Paragraph. 26 
In its role as a consultee on the Statement of Community Consultation, the local 
authority is not expected to provide a view on the project itself, but to focus on 
how the applicant should consult people in its area. The Planning Act requires 
local authorities to respond to the applicant’s consultation on their proposed 
Statement of Community Consultation within 28 days of receipt of the request. 
However, prior to submitting their draft Statement of Community Consultation 
applicants may wish to seek to resolve any disagreements or clarifications about

the public consultation design. An applicant is therefore likely to need to engage in 
discussions with local authorities over a longer period than the minimum 
requirements set out in the Act. 
Appendix 2.C for Phase 
2.  
Paragraph. 27 
The role of the local authority in such discussions should be to provide expertise 
about the make-up of its area, including whether people in the area might have 
particular needs or requirements, whether the authority has identified any groups 
as difficult to reach and what techniques might be appropriate to overcome 
barriers to communication. The local authority should also provide advice on the 
appropriateness of the applicant’s suggested consultation techniques and 
methods. The local authority’s aim in such discussions should be to ensure that 
the people affected by the development can take part in a thorough, accessible 
and effective consultation exercise about the proposed project. 
Information on hard to 
reach groups was 
received from CBC.  A 
summary of this is 
provided in sections 6.2 
and 6.4 which applies to 
both Phase 1 and Phase 
2. 
Paragraph. 28 
Topics for consideration at such pre-consultation discussions might include: 
- the size and coverage of the proposed consultation exercise (including, where
appropriate, consultation which goes wider than one local authority area);
- the appropriateness of various consultation techniques, including electronic-
based ones;
- the design and format of consultation materials;
- issues which could be covered in consultation materials;
- suggestions for places/timings of public events as part of the consultation;
- local bodies and representative groups who should be consulted;
- timescales for consultation.
A summary of 
discussions at pre-
consultation meetings 
with CBC and BBC is 
provided in Appendix 3.F 
for Phase 1 and Appendix 
3.H for Phase 2.
Paragraphs. 
29-30
It is expected that in most cases applicants and local authorities will be able to 
work closely together and agree on the local consultation process. Where 
significant differences of opinion persist between the applicant and local authority 
(or authorities) on how the consultation should take place, the Inspectorate may 
be able to offer further advice or guidance to either party. However, such advice 
will be without prejudice to any later decision on whether to accept or reject an 
application for examination. 
Where a local authority raises an issue or concern on the Statement of 
Community Consultation which the applicant feels unable to address, the 
applicant is advised to explain in their consultation report their course of action to 
the SoS when they submit their application. 
Responses were received 
from BBC and CBC on 
the Phase 1 SoCC during 
the Phase 1 consultation 
and on the Phase 2 
SoCC during the Phase 2 
consultation. These are 
contained in Appendix 
2.B and Appendix 2.C
respectively for Phase 1
and Phase 2.

Relevant section in 
Consultation Report 
Where a local authority decides that it does not wish to respond to a consultation 
request on the Statement of Community Consultation, the applicant should make 
reasonable efforts to ensure that all affected communities are consulted. If the 
applicant is unsure how to proceed, they are encouraged to seek advice from the 
Inspectorate. However, it is for the applicant to satisfy themselves that their 
consultation plan allows for as full public involvement as is appropriate for their 
project and, once satisfied, to proceed with the consultation. Provided that 
applicants can satisfy themselves that they have made reasonable endeavours to 
consult with all those who might have a legitimate interest or might be affected by 
a proposed development, it would be unlikely that their application would be 
rejected on grounds of inadequate public consultation. 
Paragraphs. 
32-34
Local authorities are also themselves statutory consultees for any proposed major 
infrastructure project which is in or adjacent to their area. applicants should 
engage with them as early as possible to ensure that the impacts of the 
development on the local area are understood and considered prior to the 
application being submitted to the SoS. 
Local authorities will be able to provide an informed opinion on a wide number of 
matters, including how the project relates to local development plans. Local 
authorities may also make suggestions for requirements to be included in the MPL 
Draft Order. These may include the later approval by the local authority (after the 
granting of a Development Consent Order) of detailed project designs or schemes 
to mitigate adverse impacts. It will be important that any concerns local authorities 
have on the practicality of enforcing a proposed Development Consent Order are 
raised at the earliest opportunity. 
The local authority in whose area a proposed project is located or an authority 
adjoining the project will be invited by the SoS to submit a local impact report once 
the application has been accepted for examination. The local impact report will 
allow local authorities to set out details of their views on the likely effect of the 
development on the local area and community.

Paragraph. 36-
37 
Local people have a vital role to play at the pre- application stage. People should 
have as much influence as is realistic and possible over decisions which shape 
their lives and communities. It is therefore critical that they are engaged with 
project proposals at an early stage. Because they live, work and socialise in the 
affected area, local people are particularly well placed to comment on what the 
impact of proposals on their local community might be; or what mitigating 
measures might be appropriate; or what other opportunities might exist for 
meeting the project’s objectives. 
In consulting on project proposals, an inclusive approach is needed to ensure that 
different groups have the opportunity to participate and are not disadvantaged in 
the process. applicants should use a range of methods and techniques to ensure 
that they access all sections of the community in question. Local authorities will be 
able to provide advice on what works best in terms of consulting their local 
communities given their experience of carrying out consultations in their area. 
The range of methods 
adopted for consultation 
are described in sections 
5, 6 and 8.   
Paragraph. 38 
applicants must set out clearly what is being consulted on. They must be careful to 
make it clear to local communities what is settled and why, and what remains to 
be decided, so that expectations of local communities are properly managed. A 
short document should be prepared by applicants specifically for local 
communities, summarising the project proposals and outlining the matters on 
which the view of the local community is sought. It should also describe the key 
elements of the project, and explain what the potential benefits and impacts of the 
projects might be. The document should be written in clear, accessible, and non-
technical language. applicants should be ready to make it available in formats 
appropriate to the needs of people with disabilities if requested. There may be 
cases where documents may need to be made bilingually (for example, Welsh, in 
applications affecting Wales), but it is not the policy of the Government to 
encourage documents to be translated into non-native, foreign languages.

consultation process. Where possible, the first of the two required local newspaper 
advertisements should coincide approximately with the beginning of the 
consultation with communities. However, given the detailed information required 
for the publicity in secondary legislation, aligning publicity with consultation may 
not always be possible, especially where a multi-stage consultation is intended.

applicants will often also require detailed technical advice from consultees and it is 
likely that their input will be of the greatest value if they are consulted when project 
proposals are fluid, followed up by confirmation of the approach as proposals 
become firmer. In principle, therefore, applicants should undertake initial 
consultation as soon as there is sufficient detail to allow consultees to understand 
the nature of the project properly. 
The consultation process 
is described in section 5, 
6 and 8 which shows how 
the consultation and 
design process are 
interrelated.  
Paragraph. 52 
To manage the tension between consulting early, but also having project 
proposals that are firm enough to enable consultees to comment, applicants are 
encouraged to consider an iterative, phased consultation consisting of two (or 
more) stages, especially for large projects with long development periods. For 
example, applicants might wish to consider undertaking informal early consultation 
at a stage where options are still being considered. This will be helpful in informing 
proposals and assisting the applicant in establishing a preferred option on which 
to undertake formal statutory public consultation. 
Non-statutory

that this may be sufficient for projects which are straightforward and 
uncontroversial in nature. But many projects, particularly larger or more 
controversial ones, may require longer consultation periods than this. applicants 
should therefore set consultation deadlines that are realistic and proportionate to 
the proposed project. It is also important that consultees do not withhold 
information that might affect a project, and that they respond in good time to 
applicants. Where responses are not received by the deadline, the applicant is not 
obliged to take those responses into account. 
6.4 for Phase 1 and 
section 8.5 for Phase 2. 
Paragraphs. 55 
- 57
applicants are not expected to repeat consultation rounds set out in their 
Statement of Community Consultation unless the project proposals have changed 
very substantially. For example, where proposals change to such a large degree 
that what is being taken forward is fundamentally different from what was 
consulted on, further consultation may well be needed. This may be necessary if, 
for example, new information arises which renders all previous options 
unworkable or invalid for some reason. When considering the need for additional 
consultation, applicants should use the degree of change, the effect on the local 
community and the level of public interest as guiding factors. 
Where a proposed application changes to such a large degree that the proposals 
could be considered a new application, the legitimacy of the consultation already 
carried out could be questioned. In such cases, applicants should undertake 
further re-consultation on the new proposals, and should supply consultees with 
sufficient information to enable them to fully understand the nature of the change 
and any likely significant impacts (but not necessarily the full suite of consultation 
documents), and allow at least 28 days for consultees to respond. 
If the application only changes to a small degree, or if the change only affects part 
of the development, then it is not necessary for an applicant to undertake a full re-
consultation. Where a proposed application is amended in light of consultation 
responses then, unless those amendments materially change the application or 
materially changes its impacts, the amendments themselves should not trigger a 
need for further consultation. Instead, the applicant should ensure that all affected 
statutory consultees and local communities are informed of the changes.

Themed responses and

Phase 1 and section 9 for 
Phase 2.  
Paragraph. 64 
The consultation report may not be the most appropriate format in which to 
respond to the points raised by various consultee groups and bodies. applicants 
should therefore consider producing a summary note in plain English for the local 
community setting out headline findings and how they have been addressed, 
together with a link to the full consultation report for those interested. If helpful, this 
could be supplemented by events in the local area. 
An Executive Summary of 
the Consultation Report is 
provided in Section 1 of 
the report and provides a 
condensed summary of 
activities undertaken, 
which are then expanded 
upon in the remainder of 
the report and 
appendices. 
Paragraph. 65 
Response to points raised by consultees with technical information is likely to 
need to focus on the specific impacts for which the body has expertise. The 
applicant should make a judgement as to whether the consultation report provides 
sufficient detail on the relevant impacts, or whether a targeted response would be 
more appropriate. applicants are also likely to have identified a number of key 
additional bodies for consultation and may need to continue engagement with 
these bodies on an individual basis.

Annabel, 
 
Please find attached a draft of MPL’s Consultation Plan and SoCC for your review. As you will see a good number of 
details are yet to be decided (highlighted yellow). Of particular note is the way in which we address Bedford 
Borough Council; at the moment the project red line boundary (RLB) just crosses into BBC by a few meters at Green 
Lane and therefore they will be part of the formal review process for the SoCC. However, we expect that we will be 
able to pull the RLB back such that it does not cross into BBC – this is dependent on the detailed design of the 
junction which is underway now. Chris and Paul will talk about this further on Thursday. 
 
I can confirm that Chris and Paul will be able to meet you at 2.30 at your offices on Thursday. I have prepared a 
suggested agenda below which any of you may want to amend.     
 
Agenda 
 
1)      Consultation; 
•         Summary of informal Exhibitions 
•         Locations for S47 exhibitions 
•         Hard to reach groups 
•         BBC update 
•         OCZ – size and consultation strategy 
•         SoCC notice 
•         Any other comments on SoCC 
2)      Scoping report – any questions from CBC? 
3)      PPA exchange 
4)      AOB 
 
On the matter of the PPA – can you fill in the ‘Responsible CBC Officer column’ or do you want me to remove it? Feel 
free to call me next week if you have any questions. 
 
Best regards,

DRAFT FOR STATUTORY REVIEW – 29th July 2014 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”) proposes to develop a gas-fired power generation 
plant and connections to the electricity and gas networks on land located in Rookery 
South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Lidlington, Millbrook and Marston Morteyne 
in Bedfordshire. 
 
The proposed power generation plant would be capable of generating up to 299 MW 
of electricity. Using the latest and most efficient power generating technology, it will 
burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. Due to 
its size, the Millbrook Power project would be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project and as such it would require a Development Consent Order (DCO).  
 
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  
The community consultation described is carried out under section 47 of the 
Planning Act 2008; the Act sets out requirements for formal pre-application 
consultation for those applications that are considered by the Planning Inspectorate 
on behalf of the relevant Secretary of State.   
 
Section 47(1) of the Planning Act 2008 states that the applicant must prepare a 
statement setting out how it proposes to consult those people, who are living in the 
vicinity of all or part of the land to which the proposed application relates, about the 
proposed application. 
  
Furthermore,  MPL is required to consult Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and 
Bedford Borough Council (BBC) on its proposed  Statement of Community 
Consultation ("SoCC").  Once MPL has finalised its SoCC, it is required to make the 
same available to the public in a way that is reasonably convenient and must also 
publish a notice in the local press as to where and when the SoCC can be inspected. 
This plan sets out how Millbrook Power Limited intends to meet these s47 
consultation requirements. This plan is not itself required pursuant to the Planning 
Act 2008, however at Appendix 1 a draft of the SoCC that is required by the Act can 
be found.  
 
1.0 PURPOSE 
a. This document explains how MPL intends to consult people living and working in 
the vicinity of the proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power station, its integral gas 
and electrical connections and other related infrastructure (the “Project”) on land 
July 2014                                                  1 
 
 
 
located in and adjacent to Rookery South Pit. The land is situated in the Marston 
Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill, 
a local market town, and 7 km south west of Bedford in Central Bedfordshire and 
Bedford Borough. 
 
b. The Project’s infrastructure that is integral to the power generation plant includes 
a new purpose built access road, a gas pipeline connection and a new electrical 
connection that will facilitate the export of power to the National Grid for 
distribution to homes and businesses.   
 
c. MPL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit.  Watt Power is seeking to develop flexible gas fired power 
generation assets at three further sites in the UK to support the UK Government’s 
drive towards a low carbon economy: one at Eye Airfield in Suffolk, one near 
Aberdare in south Wales and the third near Felindre, also in south Wales. 
 
d. Stag Energy provides the resources to MPL through a management services 
agreement with Watt Power. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company 
draws on a depth of experience with a team that has created and delivered over 
10,000 MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the 
globe, of which, 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
 
e. The details of the consultation methodology set out in this document aim to 
explain how MPL will satisfy the community consultation requirements for an 
application for a DCO under the Planning Act 2008 which, if granted, would 
enable the Project to be constructed and operated.  MPL intends to submit an 
application for a DCO which will be examined by the Planning Inspectorate on 
behalf of the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change (SoS). It should be 
noted that the application will be accompanied by an Environmental Statement as 
the development is considered to be an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
Development. A Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) will be 
produced which will describe the preliminary assessment as to the likely 
significant environmental effects of the proposed Power Generation Plant and its 
July 2014                                                  2 
 
 
 
associated infrastructure. The PEIR is expected to be published and made 
available for public scrutiny and consultation in the autumn of this year. 
 
f. MPL requests that CBC and BBC, as the planning authorities, review the 
accompanying draft Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) to this 
document, and respond with comments within 28 days so that MPL can have 
regard to the comments before MPL commences its Section 47 consultation 
activities. Once any comments have been received and considered, MPL will 
publish notice of the SoCC, a draft of which can also be found in Appendix 1, in 
the local press and make the SoCC available for inspection. Copies of the SoCC 
will be placed in local libraries and on the Millbrook Power website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  
 
g. As part of the DCO application, MPL is required to produce a Consultation Report 
explaining how the three strands of consultation required under the Planning Act 
2008 (s421, s47 and s482) have been complied with.  MPL intends that its 
Consultation Report will include an explanation of how the relevant local 
authorities were consulted about the content of the draft SoCC and what the local 
authorities’ comments were.  The Consultation Report will demonstrate that the 
local authorities were given sufficient time to provide comments, explain how 
MPL had regard to those comments and provide evidence that the SoCC was 
made available and notified in the correct manner.  
 
h. The Consultation Report will also explain what activities were undertaken to 
enable consultation with the local community, how those consulted responded 
and how MPL had regard to representations received in the development of the 
Project and the DCO application, prior to its submission to the SoS.  
 
i. This document does not set out how MPL intends to undertake the other strands 
of statutory consultation required by Sections 42 and 48 of the Planning Act 
2008. 
1 Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 requires consultation with certain local authorities, listed statutory consultees and those 
with an interest in the land on which the proposed Project will be built and operated or who may be particularly affected by it 
2 Section 48 sets out publicity requirements on a national basis 
July 2014                                                  3 
 
                                         
 
 
 
 
2.0 THE PROPOSED SITE 
 
a. The site for the proposed Power Generation Plant (which comprises part of the 
Project) is located on land located within Rookery South Pit, a former clay pit and 
designated as Rookery Clay Pits County Wildlife Site (CWS). The site is adjacent 
to the proposed Covanta Energy from Waste project, which has been consented 
but has not yet been constructed.  
 
a. The site is located mostly within the local authority administrative area of Central 
Bedfordshire Council and in part within the administrative area of Bedford 
Borough Council. The proposed routes of the electrical and gas connections as 
well as the generating equipment site would be located in farmland to the south 
and/or east of Rookery South Pit within Central Bedfordshire, whilst part of the 
proposed access route, subject to consultation, environmental and technical 
studies, resides within the administrative area of Bedford Borough Council. 
 
 
 
 
3.0 THE PROJECT 
 
The Project would comprise: 
• A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by natural gas and 
with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW) 
comprising: 
o The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine Generators and 
balance of plant, which are located within the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
o A new purpose built Access Road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site; and 
o During construction a temporary construction compound (the Laydown 
Area). 
July 2014                                                  4 
 
 
 
• A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from 
the National Transmission System (NTS) which is located within the Gas 
Connection Opportunity Area; and 
• A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) for distribution to 
homes and businesses which is located within the Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Area. 
 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as 
the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power Generation Plant Site. 
 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, are all 
integral to the generation of electricity and together are referred to as the ‘Project’. 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in 
order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  
 
4.0 CONSULTATION BACKGROUND 
 
a. MPL is committed to open and responsive consultation with local communities 
and interested parties.  The programme recommended within this document sets 
out a framework for a formal and inclusive consultation process.  
 
b. The draft SoCC appended to this document is designed to meet the legal 
requirements set out in section 47 of the Planning Act 2008 and follows a range 
of advice and guidance set out by the Planning Inspectorate and the Department 
for Communities & Local Government.  The consultation process is designed to 
enable informed, detailed and two-way communication. Through this process, 
relevant matters identified during consultation will be taken into account during 
the development of the proposal and before submission of the application for a 
DCO. 
 
c. Since May 2014, MPL has proactively communicated its intentions with elected 
representatives and directly within the local community, in order to introduce and 
discuss aspects of the Project.  These non-statutory information activities and 
July 2014                                                  5 
 
 
 
other forthcoming initiatives will also be captured in the Consultation Report. On 
the 5th, 6th and 7th of June a series of non-statutory public exhibitions were held in 
the villages of Lidlington, Marston Moreteyne and Stewartby. The choice of 
location for these and future events was decided upon after initial consultation 
with members of CBC and BBC. 
 
 
4.1 CONSULTATION AREAS 
 
a. MPL proposes to carry out its consultation in two areas: a core consultation zone 
(CCZ) that equates to an approximate 5 km radius from the site of the Power 
Generation Plant (see map overleaf), and an outer consultation zone (OCZ) that 
equates to a radius of 10 km.  The CCZ is defined by parish council boundaries 
closest to the 5 km radius. These consultation zones were chosen following 
feedback from various elected representatives with whom MPL has been liaising 
and would be in accordance with those used by Covanta for the Rookery South 
Energy from Waste Generating Station, even though the impact of the Project is 
expected to be considerably less than that of the Covanta scheme.  
  
 
b. The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity 
of the Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the 
Project’s construction and operation and expected to have the greatest interest in 
the Project. These include the villages of Stewartby, Marston Moreteyne and 
Millbrook, as well as other settlements within the CCZ.  Whilst a 5 km buffer has 
been used as a guide, where settlements fall only partially within this area 
discretion has been exercised.

Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
 
c. Whilst the site is located directly within the CBC ward of Cranfield and Marston 
Moreteyne the following neighbouring wards also fall within the proposed CCZ: 
 
o Houghton Conquest and Haynes  
o Ampthill  
d) The proposed CCZ also includes wards within the neighbouring local authority - 
BBC. The following BBC wards fall within the CCZ:

    The CCZ will be MPL’s primary focus of activity when consulting about its plans.  
 
f) Communities in the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with parish councils and 
other relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and will have the opportunity to 
comment on the plans.  The OCZ includes the main population area of Bedford. 
MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the 
OCZ will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation 
although MPL recognises that they may be interested in it.  
 
g) Communities outside the OCZ will be informed about the Project as the 
circulation areas and reach of the media (TV, radio, printed media) that will be 
used to communicate details of the Project and the consultation activities are far 
greater than the boundaries of the OCZ. 
 
 
5.0 INTRODUCTORY 
INFORMATION 
PERIOD/NON-STATUTORY 
CONSULTATION 
 
As an introduction to the Project, MPL undertook an introductory information 
programme and non-statutory consultation exercise in May/June 2014. This 
included:  
 
July 2014                                                  9 
 
 
 
a. Discussions with officers and councillors at CBC and BBC about our plans and 
proposed non-statutory consultation plans, including exhibition venues and 
organisations that should be invited. 
 
b. As every home and business in the CCZ is represented by both a CBC councillor 
or a BBC councillor, and a Parish councillor, MPL communicated its plans (and 
information regarding the public exhibitions that were held between June 5th – 7th 
2014) to the CBC and BBC, as well as the local MP Nadine Dorries, and Richard 
Fuller MP (whose constituency partially falls within the CCZ).  MPL met Nadine 
Dorries MP on June 25th to discuss the Project and answer her questions. 
 
c. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a Project website was launched to 
coincide with the Project being introduced to the local community. The website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) provides information on the Project and enables 
people to ask questions and provide feedback to MPL about the Project.   
 
d. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a letter of introduction about the Project 
was sent to approximately 10,000 households and businesses within a 5 km 
radius of the site (i.e an area very closely aligned with the CCZ). The letter 
contained details about the Project and an invitation to attend information 
exhibitions near the Project site. The letter was sent and distributed by Royal Mail 
a week prior to the first exhibition date. 
 
e. As part of the non-statutory consultation, exhibitions were held at the following 
locations to give local people the maximum opportunity to attend:  
 
 
o Thursday, June 5th - Lidlington Village Hall (4.00pm till 7.30pm) 
o Friday, June 6th - Stewartby Village Hall (3.00pm till 7.00pm) 
o Saturday, June 7th - Marston Moreteyne Village Hall (10.00am till 1.00pm) 
 
f. 
Exhibition locations were chosen because they were considered convenient to 
those communities within the CCZ that surrounds the proposed Power 
Generation Plant Site These events featured relevant information that was 
July 2014                                                  10 
 
 
 
known at the time in a variety of formats (display panels, maps, plans, leaflet etc) 
about the proposal.  Members of the MPL project team were available to discuss 
the proposal, answer questions and to receive feedback from members of the 
public. Feedback as to whether MPL should do anything differently during the 
statutory consultation process was sought during the informal information 
period/non-statutory consultation about the Project. 
 
g. MPL used venues that met Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
upon a reasonable and timely request had provisions in place for those with 
special requirements who were unable to attend or access a consultation event 
(for example, private transport to the exhibition event).  
 
h. More than 250 people attended the exhibitions, including local councillors.  The 
local media (print, TV, radio and social media) published news reports about the 
exhibitions in advance of them being held as well as afterwards.  
 
i. 
MPL issued press releases before and after the exhibitions were held, and these 
were posted on the MPL website.  The press releases were issued to the local 
media including parish council newsletters, and news reports were published in 
the media as a result of receiving them from MPL.  
 
j. 
MPL advertised the informal information/non-statutory consultation exhibitions 
via a display advertisement in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper, published 
on June 1st2014.  
 
k. A leaflet about the Project was produced for people who attended the exhibition, 
and additional copies were provided to local councilors and others for wider 
dissemination. The leaflet contained details of the Project, the consultation 
process, an indicative timeframe for the Project’s development and the Millbrook 
Power website address and contact details.  In addition, a Feedback form was 
available for people to fill in on the day or to return via Freepost to MPL.  
 
July 2014                                                  11 
 
 
 
l. 
Posters advertising the non-statutory consultation events were displayed on 
parish noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ, for example 
local libraries, local shops and post offices and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
m. The MPL website carries the latest information about the project (technical, 
environmental and communications), contact details and a mechanism to enable 
people to ask questions and provide feedback.  The website address was 
provided to CBC, BBC and parish councils for inclusion on parish websites, 
newsletters and other local information material. 
 
n. MPL will consider the provision, upon request, of written materials about the 
Project in different formats (for example, large print or braille). 
 
o. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) were 
accepted following the launch of the non-statutory period of consultation.  
 
p. In summary, the Project has been introduced to the local community which is now 
broadly aware of the Project.  The proposed statutory consultation process 
detailed in section 6.0 will therefore build upon this awareness with a view to 
gaining formal feedback from local people and interested stakeholders before the 
application for the DCO is submitted in 2015. 
 
6.0 STATUTORY CONSULTATION METHODOLOGY & ACCESSIBILITY 
Following the introductory information period/non-statutory consultation described in 
section 5.0, the statutory consultation programme will be conducted according to the 
following methodology: 
 
a. MPL will consult with officers at CBC and BBC on the content of the draft SoCC. 
 
b. MPL will begin engagement with elected members of CBC, BBC, parish councils, 
the local MP Nadine Dorries and Richard Fuller MP whose constituency lies 
within the CCZ, as it develops its plans. 
 
July 2014                                                  12 
 
 
 
c. MPL will use elected members of CBC, BBC and parish councils as 
communication channels, via meetings and correspondence, to share information 
and seek community feedback during the period of statutory consultation.   
 
d. Exhibitions/consultation events will be held at the following locations: 
 
• 
Lidlington Village Hall  
• 
Stewartby Village Hall  
• 
Marston Moreteyne Village Hall  
• 
Parkside Community Hall, Ampthill 
After consideration of the outcomes of the non-statutory consultation process 
these venues are considered the most convenient to those communities within 
the CCZ that surround the proposed Power Generation Plant Site. These events 
will feature relevant information in a variety of formats (display panels, plans, 
leaflet etc) about the proposal and copies of the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) will be made available.  Members of the MPL project 
team will be available to discuss the proposal, answer questions and to receive 
feedback from members of the public. 
 
e. In order to ensure that people have the maximum opportunity to attend the 
exhibitions, MPL will arrange for them to be held at the above convenient 
locations and at a variety of times. An event will be held on a Saturday for those 
unable to visit during the working week. 
 
f. MPL will use venues that meet Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements 
and upon a reasonable and timely request will make provision for those with 
special requirements who are unable to attend or access a consultation event (for 
example, private transport to a consultation event).  
 
g. In consultation with CBC and BBC, MPL will share information about the Project 
with those “hard to reach groups” living and working within the CCZ. These 
groups are likely to be accessed through informal and formal channels - via 
council services (for example, Central Bedfordshire Together, Bedford Borough 
July 2014                                                  13 
 
 
 
Partnership, [xxxxxx]) and relevant specialist organisations (for example the 
Marston Moreteyne Action Group, local branches of the Women’s Institute, and 
local business representative groups such as the Bedfordshire Chamber of 
Commerce).   
 
h. Posters in colleges, schools, youth clubs and awareness through social media 
may be used to reach the younger members of the community, whilst 
consideration will be given to presentations at local schools and colleges about 
the Project. Local schools and colleges will be notified of the consultation events. 
 
i. MPL will advertise the consultation events via local and regional newspapers 
(Bedfordshire on Sunday, Bedford Borough Times & Citizen and the Luton & 
Dunstable Express), for two weeks prior to the first event taking place.  In 
addition MPL will announce via the issue of one or more press releases to parish, 
local and regional news publications, the local radio and TV stations (and via 
online media) that the events are taking place.  The newspaper advertisements 
(and media coverage), will reach the CCZ, the OCZ and further afield. The 
content will give information on MPL’s proposals and details of the consultation 
events, including contact information.   
 
j. A leaflet or letter about the Project and the consultation programme will be 
distributed to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ some two 
weeks in advance of the first consultation event, informing them of the 
consultation events taking place. The leaflet will include details of the Project, the 
location and dates of the consultation events, the MPL website address, and a 
comments/questions card that can be returned Freepost.    
 
k. Posters advertising the consultation events will be displayed on parish 
noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ and the OCZ, for 
example local libraries, local shops and post offices, local schools and colleges 
and doctors’ surgeries.

l. MPL will inform those parish councils within the OCZ about the Project and the 
exhibition/consultation event via email. 
 
m. The MPL team will proactively and reactively meet with individuals and interested 
groups in the local area as part of the formal consultation period to answer 
questions and provide updates about the Project.  
 
n. The MPL website will carry the latest information about the Project (technical, 
environmental and communications), contact details and a mechanism to enable 
people to ask questions and provide feedback.  The website address has 
previously been provided to CBC, BBC and parish councils for inclusion on parish 
websites, newsletters and in other local information material. 
 
o. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) will be 
considered and addressed where possible, as well as comments noted.  The 
statutory consultation will last for a period of 35 days . Relevant responses will be 
collated, had regard to and referred to in the Consultation Report that will 
accompany the DCO application.   
 
p. MPL may choose to undertake additional consultation and information activities. 
In addition, MPL will consider the provision, upon request, of written materials 
about the Project in different formats (for example, large print or braille). 
 
q. Statutory and non-statutory consultation activities and efforts will be detailed in 
the Consultation Report which will accompany the DCO application. This will 
detail the consultation activities, the feedback received and MPL’s response to 
the issues that are raised during the process.

APPENDIX 
 
DRAFT: Statement of Community Consultation  
[to be placed in local libraries, council offices and on the Millbrook Power website.  
Local press will publish an abbreviated version of the SoCC, subject to the 
agreement of CBC and BBC; this is referred to as the SoCC Notice and a draft of the 
SoCC notice is included here.] 
 
This Statement of Community Consultation ("SoCC") is published in connection with 
a proposed up to 299MW gas-fired power station, its integral gas and electrical 
connections and other related infrastructure at Rookery South Pit in Central 
Bedfordshire (the "Project").   
 
The capacity of the Project will be in excess of 50 MW of electricity. As such, it is 
classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project under the Planning Act 
2008. The Project therefore requires a Development Consent Order ("DCO") in order 
for it to be built. Any DCO would be made by the Secretary of State for Energy & 
Climate Change. 
 
This SoCC is part of a consultation process, required by the Planning Act 2008. This 
SoCC explains how Millbrook Power Limited (the promoter of the Project) proposes 
to consult people living in the vicinity of the Project, businesses and other 
organisations about the Project, in advance of submitting an application for a DCO 
for the Project in 2015.   
 
 
 
Comment [s3]: BBC and 
CBC to advise if there are 
any other NSIPs in the area 
that are at the pre-
submission stage that we 
should be expressly 
considering dovetailing with. 
AN16 states "If relevant, the 
SOCC should also take 
account of any other major 
consultation exercises being 
undertaken in the area, for 
example in relation to 
planning applications or 
development plans 
proceeding under different 
legislation. The aim should 
be to achieve a programme 
that minimises confusion 
and possible “consultation 
fatigue”.

MPL has consulted Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedfordshire Borough Council, 
as the local planning authorities, about the content of this Statement of Community 
Consultation and has had regard to their responses.   
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is a company established by Watt Power Limited. 
Watt Power Limited is seeking to develop gas fired power stations at Rookery South 
Pit and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon 
economy. 
  
 
 
 
A consultation/communication plan has previously been developed and is available 
from MPL or via its website www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
 
This SoCC explains: 
• some details about the Project ; 
• how MPL is publishing preliminary environmental information about the Project; 
• how MPL is going to consult local people and communities about the Project and 
what activities will be undertaken to give them access to information about the 
proposal and help them to understand what particular aspects of the proposal 
may mean to them, enabling them to provide informed feedback; 
• how people can become involved in shaping the Project before a DCO 
application is submitted by putting forward their views to influence the Project, 
particularly regarding specific options under consideration; and 
• how people can provide feedback to MPL from consultation activities and ensure 
that they are informed about the Project.  
 
The Project 
The key details of the proposed Project are: 
July 2014                                                  17 
 
 
 
• the construction of a Power Generation Plant with a rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 MW of electricity. The plant will have up to 5 stacks each up 
to [60 m] in height. It will include a new purpose built access road from Green 
Lane to the site of the generating element of the Project;  
• the site for the Power Generation Plant covers an area of approximately 8 ha;  
• the Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas. As such, fuel 
for the Power Generation Plant will be provided by an underground pipeline 
connection and will not be delivered by road to the site; 
• it will include the construction of a new underground or overhead electrical 
connection  (up to 500 m in length) to the National Grid and the construction of a 
new underground pipeline (up to 1300 m in length) to bring natural gas to the 
Power Generating Plant from the National Transmission System;  
• it will create approximately 150 jobs during a construction period lasting two 
years and create up to 15 permanent jobs once commercial operations have 
begun;    
• it responds to the UK Government’s need for new gas generation in order to 
underpin the country’s energy security and its transition to a low-carbon 
economy; 
• the station would emit about 50% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than an equivalent 
sized coal-fired power plant, and is designed to operate flexibly so that it can 
respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variation in customer demand and 
intermittent output from wind power generation; and 
• it is acknowledged that during construction and operation there is potential for 
negative impacts on some local communities and the environment, for example 
noise from the operation of the Power Generation Plant, the visual impact of the 
stacks and impacts on the local and regional transport network as a result of 
construction traffic. An Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") is being 
undertaken to understand and seek to reduce these and other potential effects of 
the Project’s construction and operation. An Environmental Statement will be 
submitted as part of the application for a DCO for the Project. More information 
on this process is provided below. The EIA process is also considering the 
potential positive effects of the operation of the Project.

The Planning Process 
DCO applications for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are submitted to 
the Planning Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before 
making a recommendation on that application to the relevant Secretary of State. The 
final decision on the application is made by the Secretary of State and if it is 
successful, a DCO will be made.  
 
The Government's policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects 
are set out in National Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been 
developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-
2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Networks 
Infrastructure) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  EN-1 states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility 
to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of 
supply."   
 
When determining a DCO application, the Secretary of State must have regard to the 
relevant NPSs and must make a decision in accordance with these unless other 
considerations apply, including where she/he is satisfied that the adverse impact of a 
proposed development would outweigh its benefits.  
  
When considering whether to accept an application for examination, the Planning 
Inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has undertaken effective pre-
application consultation.  Pre-application consultation is essential in allowing MPL to 
understand and minimise the impacts of the Project and to allow a thorough 
examination by the Planning Inspectorate. MPL is required to submit a Consultation 
Report with its application for a DCO.  This report will include details of the local 
community feedback received, explain how MPL has had regard to relevant 
feedback and will detail how MPL has complied with the consultation requirements of 
the Planning Act 2008. 
 
The community consultation described in this statement is carried out under Section 
47 of the Planning Act 2008. It is in addition to consultation that will be carried out 
July 2014                                                  19 
 
 
 
with specific statutory consultees (such as nature conservation bodies) and those 
with relevant interests in land (including owners and occupiers within the Project 
boundary) under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. It is also in addition to wider 
notification of the Project under Section 48 of the Planning Act 2008.  
 
Information on the planning process for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects 
and the NPSs can be found at:

Environmental Information & Impacts 
The Project will be designed and developed to meet or exceed current quality, safety 
and environmental standards and efforts will be made to minimise its impact on the 
local environment, both during its construction and its operation.  The extent and 
scale of the development and MPL’s proposals to mitigate its impacts will be 
consulted upon locally and will be amongst the issues considered by the Planning 
Inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of State. 
 
Because of the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an EIA pursuant 
to the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. 
Therefore, the Project is classed as an EIA development. The EIA considers the 
likely significant environmental effects of the Project including those on air and water 
quality, noise, visual and cumulative impact, traffic, local ecology, archaeology and 
heritage and socio-economics.   
 
MPL has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the scope of the EIA, 
including local authorities, the Environment Agency, the Highways Agency, Natural 
England and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate on June 20th 2014, accompanied by a Scoping Report. The 
July 2014                                                  20 
 
 
 
Scoping Report outlines which environmental topics will be covered by the EIA and 
how the assessments will be undertaken. The Planning Inspectorate issued its 
formal Scoping Opinion on July 28th 2014.  
 
These 
documents 
are 
available 
on 
the 
Millbrook 
Power 
website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) and via the dedicated section on the Planning 
Inspectorate’s website:  
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/eastern/millbrook-power/ 
 
As part of the pre-application consultation materials on the proposed Project, MPL 
will publish a Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") and a non-
technical summary ("NTS") of the same.  The PEIR presents the information 
gathered to date and provides the results of MPL’s preliminary assessments as to 
the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.   It does not set out the final 
findings but will include information on provisional mitigation measures.  During 
consultation, MPL will make available details on landscaping proposals and other 
measures to mitigate the Project’s impact.  MPL will provide copies of the PEIR and 
the NTS to Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local 
planning authorities. Both documents will also be made available at: the main office 
of Central Bedfordshire Council in Chicksands, Shefford; at the main office of 
Bedford Borough Council in Bedford; local libraries; at public exhibitions and on the 
MPL website.  
 
When the EIA process is complete and MPL submits its application for a DCO, it will 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement. This will report on the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project identified in the EIA and will explain 
the mitigation measures to avoid or reduce these.  
 
Public Consultation 
The views of the local community about the Project are important.  In June 2014, 
MPL carried out a non-statutory consultation process sharing its initial plans with the 
public at three exhibitions held in Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston Moreteyne.  At 
the exhibitions and since, MPL has received and responded to comments on the 
July 2014                                                  21 
 
 
 
proposed Project and its impact on the environment, local communities and the local 
economy.    
 
a. What are we now consulting on and when? 
In the statutory phase of consultation commencing on xxxx 2014, MPL will seek 
views on the overall scope and impact of the Project, including the electrical 
connection and the gas connection and their respective route corridors, and the 
Project’s visual impact. Only after responses have been considered will designs be 
finalised and the application for a DCO be submitted.  
 
Responses will be invited on: 
 
• The layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project Site; 
• Route option(s) for accessing the gas and electricity connection infrastructure 
during construction and maintenance; 
• Route options for the gas connection; 
• Findings of the preliminary assessment for construction and operational 
phases of the project, as set out in the PEIR. 
 
The consultation explained in this Statement will run for 35 days ending on xxxx 
2014. Comments about the project must be received by MPL by this date.   
 
b. Who will we consult with? 
The Planning Act 2008 states that those ‘living in the vicinity of the land’ should be 
consulted.  We have discussed the scope of our consultation with Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities, 
and have identified and agreed the Consultation Zones that form the basis of our 
community consultation.  
 
MPL will carry out its community consultation activities in two areas: a Core 
Consultation Zone (CCZ) that equates to a 5 km radius from the Power Generation 
Plant Site and an Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ) that equates to a radius of 10 km. 
Comment [NJ5]: These 
consultation questions are still 
provisional at this stage 
July 2014                                                  22 
 
 
 
These consultation zones were chosen following feedback from local elected 
representatives and are in accordance with those used by Covanta for the Rookery 
South Energy from Waste Generating Station, even though the impact of the Project 
is expected to be considerably less than the Energy from Waste scheme. 
 
The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of 
the Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the 
Project and expected to have the greatest interest in the Project   The zone includes 
all or parts of the following parish council areas: Marston Moreteyne, Millbrook, 
Houghton Conquest, Ampthill, Maulden, Lidlington, Stewartby, Wootton. An 
information leaflet will be sent to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ 
and the CCZ will be the focus of public exhibitions.  
 
 
Proposed CCZ – approx. 5 km radius from the Power Generation Plant 
Site 
July 2014                                                  23 
 
 
 
 
Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
Communities within the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with parish councils and other 
relevant local organisations in the OCZ ) and given the opportunity to comment on 
our plans for the Project.  The outer zone includes the main population area of 
Bedford.   
 
MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the OCZ 
will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation although 
MPL recognises that those living and working within the OCZ may be interested in

advertising and media coverage (print, broadcast and social media). Feedback that 
is received within the consultation period will be considered by MPL as it finalises its 
proposals for the Project. 
 
c.  How will we consult?  
MPL will seek and receive people’s views through a number of activities: 
• Public exhibitions will be held at Lidlington, Marston Moreteyne, Stewertby and 
Ampthill within the CCZ (see the table below for locations and dates of the public 
exhibitions);  
• An information leaflet will be sent to households, businesses and institutions in 
the CCZ, and made available at local council offices, local libraries and other civic 
community venues in the area. The leaflet will also be sent to those groups that 
are defined as “hard to reach” (for example, the elderly, the young and minority 
groups). It will give background on the Project, the consultation process and how 
individuals can engage in the consultation.  The leaflet will be made available at 
libraries and council offices in the OCZ; 
• Copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, The Preliminary Environmental Information 
Report and the Non-Technical Summary  as well as other information about the 
Project will be available (in addition to the main council offices of Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council) at Marston Vale Forest

DRAFT: Abbreviated Statement of Community Consultation Notice 
[to be published in local press] 
 
Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL) proposes to construct and operate a gas-fired power generation plant 
and connections to the gas and electricity networks in land adjacent to and within Rookery South Pit, 
situated in the Marston Vale, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill and 7 km south-west of Bedford.  
The project includes a power generation plant, a gas connection and an electrical connection 
(including a sub-station) that would connect the power generation plant to the existing nearby 
overhead transmission line. 
The power generation plant would have rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 MW of 
electricity.  Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, it could enter commercial 
operation in 2019.  
The Project is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project under the Planning Act 2008 
which means a Development Consent Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it.   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA). Therefore the Project is classified as EIA development.  The EIA will consider the potential 
impacts, both positive and negative, of the Project on topics including air and water quality, noise, 
landscape and visual impact, traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. 
 
The DCO application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate who will make a 
recommendation to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. The final decision on the 
application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and other organisations is an essential part of the DCO 
application process and will help to influence the final design of the project.   Only after all inputs 
have been considered will designs be finalised and the application for a DCO be submitted. 
 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out in 
National Policy Statements (NPSs).  NPS EN-1 (Energy) states that "gas will continue to play an 
important role in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of 
low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply."  The need for the Project is established 
through NPSs and is therefore not a topic of consultation. 
 
MPL has prepared a statement setting out how it proposes to consult people living and working in 
the vicinity of the site about the proposed DCO application; this is the Statement of Community 
Consultation.  It is available for inspection at www.millbrookpower.co.uk , at council offices (TBA 
with contact details), at Marston Vale Forest Centre, Marston Moretaine, MK43 0PR and at these 
local libraries (opening times vary).

Dear Mr Johnson 
 
This letter is confirmation that I have reviewed the Draft Statement of Community 
Consultation, as sent on 30th July 2014. 
 
I can confirm that I have not got any further comments to make, other then those 
discussed at the meeting we had with Chris McKerrow prior to the submission of this 
document. There are obviously areas to be tidied up within the statement, and I shall 
forward to you separately a couple of additional hard to reach group contacts which 
could be useful in the section 6 “statutory consultation methodology and 
accessibility”. Other than these slight tweaks to the submitted document it appears to 
outline a thorough consultation process to be undertaken prior to the DCO being 
submitted next year. 
 
 
Kind Regards,  
 
 
 
 
Annabel Robinson 
Senior Planning Officer

Dear Mr Johnson, 
 
Millbrook Power Limited Statement of Community Consultation 
 
I write in reply to your letter dated 20th July 2014 concerning the above matter and 
your request for Bedford Borough Council’s opinion on the draft Statement of 
Community Consultation.  
 
I note that you have taken into account the comments made by my colleague 
Michael Robinson in his email to you dated 30th July.  This Council has an up to 
date Statement of Community Involvement which sets down how and when the 
Bedford Borough Community can expect to be engaged when gathering views 
about planning applications.  I note that the contents of this document have been 
taken into account in the preparation of your draft consultation plan. 
 
Your draft plan is comprehensive and demonstrates the intention for a significant 
level of public consultation and involvement to at least the level specified in the 
Council’s Statement of Community Involvement.   
 
In your draft, you ask for advice in seeking out ‘hard to reach’ groups.  The 
Council’s Equality and Diversity officer is named Joella Hazel and she should be 
able to offer advice in this regard.  Her email address is 
Joella.Hazel@bedford.gov.uk 
 
I can also confirm that to my knowledge there are no other significant public 
consultation exercises planned for the October/November timescale within this part 
of the Borough.   
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
 
Michael Robinson

Dear Annabel and Michael, 
 
It is our intension to publish the Statement of Community Consultation for the Millbrook Power Project next week. I 
wanted to inform you of a couple of minor changes that have been made since you singed it off last month; 
 
1. The Project Redline Boundary has been revised slightly which is reflected in the maps showing the 
consultation zones. The changes reflect a reduction in the size of the gas connection opportunity area as the 
gas connection design has been refined, an extension of the redline around the junction onto Green Lane 
following consultation with your highways officials and the Highways Authority (this will allow us to build a 
safe junction) and a small extension into Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground to allow for temporary works for 
construction of the electrical connection; 
2. Exhibition venues, dates and times have been finalised with minor changes to timing; and 
3. Specific consultation questions have been finalised 
 
I attach here our finalised SoCC – if you have any questions don’t hesitate to get in touch, 
 
Best regards, 
 
Nick

Dear Sirs, 
 
Millbrook Power Limited Statement of Community Consultation 
 
Please find enclosed a draft consultation plan together with a draft Statement of Community 
Consultation (SoCC) and Abbreviated SoCC Notice in respect of Millbrook Power Limited’s 
proposals to construct and operate a gas fired power station and associated gas and 
electrical connections (the Project) at Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. These describe how 
Millbrook Power Limited intends to consult people living in the vicinity about a proposed 
application for a development consent order under the Planning Act 2008 for the Project. 
 
As you will be aware, the Project was initially taken through the first stages of the DCO 
planning application process in 2014. However, in March 2015, the project was put on hold 
due to market and political uncertainty. Under new ownership the Project is now once again 
being taken forward.   
 
Pursuant to section 47(2) of the Planning Act 2008, Millbrook Power Limited must consult 
the Councils about what is to be in the SoCC and so MillbrookPower Limited requests that 
the Councils provide comments on the draft SoCC and consultation plan.  
 
The deadline for the receipt by Millbrook Power Limited of each Council’s response is the 
end of the period of 28 days that begins with the day after the day on which the Council 
receives the enclosed documents. Following this consultation period, Millbrook Power 
Limited will have regard to any comments received from the Councils in preparing the final 
SoCC. The SoCC will then be published in accordance with section 47(6) of the Planning Act 
2008 and Millbrook Power Limited will subsequently carry out consultation in accordance 
with the proposals set out in the SoCC.  
 
Yours Faithfully,

Statement of Community Consultation

May 2017                                                  1 
 
This Statement of Community Consultation ("SoCC") is published in connection with 
a proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power station, its associated gas and electrical 
connections and other related infrastructure at Rookery South Pit situated in the 
Marston Vale, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill and 7 km south-west of Bedford 
in Central Bedfordshire (the "Project").   
 
The capacity of the gas-fired power station will be in excess of 50 MW. As such, it is 
classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under the Planning 
Act 2008. The Project therefore requires a Development Consent Order ("DCO") in 
order for it to be built. Any DCO would be made by the Secretary of State for Business, 
Energy & Industrial Strategy. 
 
The Project was initially taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application 
process in 2014. However in March 2015, the project was put on hold due to market 
and political uncertainty. Under new ownership (see below) the Project is now once 
again being taken forward.   
 
This SoCC is part of a consultation process, required by the Planning Act 2008. This 
SoCC explains how Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL”), the promoter of the Project, 
proposes to consult people living in the vicinity of the Project, businesses and other 
organisations about the Project, in advance of submitting an application for a DCO for 
the Project before the end of 2017.   
 
MPL carried out both statutory and non-statutory consultation as part of its work in 
2014. As part of the 2014 statutory consultation, a SoCC was published after having 
been consulted on with the local planning authorities and this SoCC is closely 
modelled on the 2014 SoCC. MPL have had regard to the responses received as part 
of the 2014 non-statutory and statutory consultation and these have influenced the 
further iteration of the Project design that is now being consulted on in 2017. 
 
MPL has consulted Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedfordshire Borough Council, 
as the local planning authorities, about the content of this Statement of Community 
Consultation and has had regard to their responses.

As noted above, a consultation/communication plan was published in 2014 and this 
plan has been updated and revised. Both documents are  available from MPL or via 
its website www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
MPL is a company owned by Drax Group plc ("Drax") (acquired in December 2016). 
Drax is seeking to develop gas fired power stations at Rookery South Pit and 
elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy 
and its gas generation strategy. 
 
This SoCC explains: 
 key details about the Project; 
 how MPL is publishing preliminary environmental information about the Project; 
 how MPL is going to consult local people and communities about the Project and 
what activities will be undertaken to give them access to information about the 
proposal and help them to understand what particular aspects of the proposal may 
mean to them, enabling them to provide informed feedback; 
 how people can become involved in shaping the Project before a DCO application 
is submitted by putting forward their views to influence the Project; and 
 how people can provide feedback to MPL from consultation activities and ensure 
that they are informed about the Project.  
 
The Project 
The key details of the proposed Project are: 
 the construction of a Power Generation Plant with a rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 MW of electricity. The plant will have one stack, of up to 35 m 
in height. It will include a new purpose built access road which will either be from 
Green Lane to the site of the generating element of the Project or will connect from 
the site of the generating element of the Project to an access road constructed for 
the Rookery South project from Green Lane to the Rookery South Pit;  
 the site for the Generating Equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha;  
 
 
May 2017                                                  3 
 
 the Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas. As such, fuel 
for the Power Generation Plant will be provided by an underground pipeline 
connection and will not be delivered by road to the site; 
 it will include the construction of a new electrical connection  (including up to 500 
m of underground cable) to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System and 
the construction of a new underground pipeline (up to 1.8 km in length) to bring 
natural gas to the Power Generating Plant from the National Transmission System;  
 it will create approximately 150 jobs during a construction period lasting two years 
and create up to 15 permanent jobs once commercial operations have begun;    
 it responds to the UK Government’s need for new gas generation in order to 
underpin the country’s energy security and its transition to a low-carbon economy; 
and 
 the station would emit about 50% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than an equivalent 
sized coal-fired power plant, and is designed to operate flexibly so that it can 
respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variation in customer demand and 
intermittent output from wind power generation. 
 
It is acknowledged that during construction and operation there is potential for negative 
impacts on some local communities and the environment, for example noise from the 
operation of the Power Generation Plant, the visual impact of the stack and impacts 
on the local and regional transport network as a result of construction traffic. An 
Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") is being undertaken; the EIA helps to 
understand and seeks to reduce the potential effects of the Project’s construction and 
operation. An Environmental Statement will be submitted as part of the application for 
a DCO for the Project. More information on this process is provided below. The EIA 
process is also considering the potential positive effects of the operation of the Project. 
 
The Planning Process 
DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning Inspectorate which will 
process and examine the application before making a recommendation on that 
application to the relevant Secretary of State. The final decision on the application is 
made by the Secretary of State and if it is successful, a DCO will be made.  
 
 
 
May 2017                                                  4 
 
The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the 
relevant Energy NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Networks Infrastructure) and EN-5 (Electricity 
Networks Infrastructure).  EN-1 states that "gas will continue to play an important role 
in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of 
low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply."   
 
When determining a DCO application, the Secretary of State must have regard to the 
relevant NPSs and must make a decision in accordance with these unless other 
considerations apply, including where she/he is satisfied that the adverse impact of a 
proposed development would outweigh its benefits.  
  
When considering whether to accept an application for examination, the Planning 
Inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has undertaken effective pre-
application consultation.  Pre-application consultation is essential in allowing MPL to 
understand and minimise the impacts of the Project and to allow a thorough 
examination by the Planning Inspectorate. MPL is required to submit a Consultation 
Report with its application for a DCO.  This report will include details of the local 
community feedback received (both in 2014 and in 2017), explain how MPL has had 
regard to relevant feedback and will detail how MPL has complied with the consultation 
requirements of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
The community consultation described in this statement is carried out under Section 
47 of the Planning Act 2008. It is in addition to consultation that will be carried out with 
specific statutory consultees (such as nature conservation bodies) and those with 
relevant interests in land (including owners and occupiers within the Project boundary) 
under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. It is also in addition to wider notification of 
the Project under Section 48 of the Planning Act 2008.

Environmental Information & Impacts 
The Project will be designed and developed to meet or exceed current quality, safety 
and environmental standards and efforts will be made to minimise its impact on the 
local environment, both during its construction and its operation.  The extent and scale 
of the development and MPL’s proposals to mitigate its impacts will be consulted upon 
locally and will be amongst the issues considered by the Planning Inspectorate on 
behalf of the Secretary of State. 
 
Because of the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an EIA pursuant to 
the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. 
Therefore, the Project is classed as an EIA development. The EIA considers the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project including those on air and water quality, 
noise, visual and landscape,, traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, socio-
economics and cumulative impacts of the Project considerd together with other 
development.   
 
MPL has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the scope of the EIA, 
including local authorities, the Environment Agency, Highways England, Natural 
England and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate on June 20th 2014, accompanied by a Scoping Report. The 
Scoping Report outlined which environmental topics would be covered by the EIA and 
how the assessments would be undertaken. The Planning Inspectorate issued its 
formal Scoping Opinion on July 28th 2014.

As part of the pre-application consultation materials on the proposed Project, MPL will 
publish a Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") and a non-technical 
summary ("NTS") of the same.  The PEIR presents the information gathered to date 
and provides the results of MPL’s preliminary assessments as to the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project.   It does not set out the final findings but will 
include information on provisional mitigation measures.  During consultation, MPL will 
make available details on landscaping proposals and other measures to mitigate the 
Project’s impact.  MPL will provide copies of the PEIR and the NTS to Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities. 
Both documents will also be made available at: the main office of Central Bedfordshire 
Council in Chicksands, Shefford; at Bedford Borough Council’s Customer Service 
Centre in Bedford; at the Marston Vale Forest Centre; local libraries; at public 
exhibitions and on the MPL website.  
 
When the EIA process is complete and MPL submits its application for a DCO, it will 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement. This will report on the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project identified in the EIA and will explain the 
mitigation measures to avoid or reduce these.  
 
Public Consultation 
The views of the local community about the Project are important.  In June 2014, MPL 
carried out a non-statutory consultation process sharing its initial plans with the public 
at three exhibitions held in the local area. In October/November 2014, a 35 day period 
of statutory public consultation was carried out, with four public exhibitions held in the 
local area – at Marston Moretaine, Stewartby, Lidlington and Ampthill. During 2014, 
MPL received and responded to comments on the proposed Project and its impact on 
the environment, local communities and the local economy.    
 
a. What are we now consulting on and when? 
In March 2015, MPL chose to put on hold its plans for the Project and notified 
interested parties by letter and information posted on the Project website that this was 
the case. Under the ownership of Drax, MPL now wishes to resume the DCO 
application process for the Project.  Accordingly, and given MPL’s open and engaged 
 
 
May 2017                                                  7 
 
approach to consultation in 2014, MPL wishes to commence a second phase of 
statutory consultation commencing on 29th May 2017 (and finishing on 2nd July 2017), 
seeking views on the overall scope and impact of the Project, including the integral 
electrical connection and gas connection. Only after MPL has had regard to the 
consultation responses received will the application for a DCO for the Project be 
finalised and submitted.  
 
Responses will, in particular, be invited on: 
 
• The Project, as currently proposed, including changes since the 2014 
consultation; 
• The layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project Site; 
• Proposed amendments to The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 201; and 
• The findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project during construction and operation, as set 
out in the PEIR. 
The consultation explained in this Statement will run for 35 days ending on 2nd July 
2017. Comments about the project must be received by MPL by this date.   
 
b. Who will we consult with? 
The Planning Act 2008 states that those ‘living in the vicinity of the land’ should be 
consulted.  We have discussed the scope of our consultation with Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities, and have 
identified and agreed the Consultation Zones that form the basis of our community 
consultation.  
 
MPL will carry out its community consultation activities in two areas: a Core 
Consultation Zone (CCZ) that equates to a 5 km radius from the Power Generation 
Plant Site (Figure 1) and an Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ) that equates to a radius 
of 10 km (Figure 2). These consultation zones were chosen following feedback from 
local elected representatives and are the same as those used by MPL during 2014. 
 
 
May 2017                                                  8 
 
 
The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of the 
Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the Project and 
expected to have the greatest interest in the Project   The zone includes all or parts of 
the following parish council areas: Marston Moreteyne, Millbrook, Houghton Conquest, 
Ampthill, Maulden, Lidlington, Stewartby and Wootton. An information leaflet will be 
sent to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ and the CCZ will be the 
focus of public exhibitions (see below).

Figure 2 - Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
Communities within the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with parish councils and other 
relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and given the opportunity to comment on our 
plans for the Project.  The outer zone includes the main population area of Bedford.   
 
MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the OCZ 
will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation although MPL 
recognises that those living and working within the OCZ may be interested in the 
Project.  Outside the two zones, there may well be others interested in MPL’s plans. 
These people will also be reached through local/regional newspaper advertising and 
media coverage (print, broadcast and social media). Feedback that is received within

the consultation period will be considered by MPL as it finalises its proposals for the 
Project. 
 
c.  How will we consult?  
MPL will seek and receive people’s views through a number of activities: 
 Public exhibitions will be held at Lidlington, Marston Moretaine, Stewartby and 
Ampthill within the CCZ (see the table below for locations and dates of the public 
exhibitions);  
 An information leaflet will be sent to households, businesses and institutions in the 
CCZ, and made available at local council offices, local libraries and other civic 
community venues in the area. The leaflet will also be sent to those groups that 
are defined as “hard to reach” (such as the Community Engagement Network, the 
Older People’s Reference Group and the Youth Parliament). It will give background 
on the Project, the consultation process and how individuals can engage in the 
consultation.  The leaflet will be made available at libraries and council offices in 
the OCZ; 
 Copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, a Consultation Document that will explain the 
Project as well as the proposed amendments to the Rookery South (Resource 
Recovery Facility) Order 2011, the Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
and the Non-Technical Summary as well as other information about the Project will 
be available (in addition to the main council offices of Central Bedfordshire Council 
and Bedford Borough Council’s Customer Service Centre) at Marston Vale Forest

Notice as to where and when the Statement of Community Consultation (2017) for the 
Millbrook Power Project can be inspected – s47 Planning Act 2008 
 
Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL) proposes to construct and operate an up to 299 megawatt (MW)  gas-
fired power generation plant (and associated connections to the gas and electricity networks) on 
land adjacent to and within Rookery South Pit, situated in the Marston Vale, approximately 3 km 
north of Ampthill and 7 km south-west of Bedford (the "Project").  Subject to public consultation, 
planning and financing, the Project could enter commercial operation in 2022.  
The gas-fired power generation plant element of the Project is classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project under the Planning Act 2008 which means that a Development Consent Order 
(DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it.  MPL intends to submit an application for a DCO 
for the Project by the end of 2017.  
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of the DCO planning 
application process in 2014. However in March 2015, the project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. Under new ownership, the Project is now once again being taken forward.   
Once submitted, the DCO application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate 
who will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial 
Strategy as to whether or not the application should be granted and a DCO made. The final decision 
on the application is made by the Secretary of State, rather than the local planning authority. 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 to undertake an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). This EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and 
negative, of the Project on topics including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
will be submitted with the application for a DCO for the Project in 2017.  
 MPL is required under section 47 of the Planning Act 2008 to consult with those living in the vicinity 
of the land to which the proposed application for the Project relates. This consultation with local 
people, businesses, and other organisations is an essential part of the DCO application process and 
will help to influence the design of the Project as at submission of the DCO application. Only after 
MPL has had regard to the consultation responses that it has received (including those received as 
part of the consultation undertaken in 2014) will the design for the Project be finalised and the 
application for a DCO be submitted. 
MPL has prepared a statement setting out how it proposes to consult people living and working in 
the vicinity of the land to which the proposed application for the Project relates about the proposed 
DCO application. This statement is called the "Statement of Community Consultation" (SoCC).   
MPL carried out both statutory and non-statutory consultation as part of its work in 2014. As part of 
the 2014 statutory consultation, a SoCC was published after consultation with the relevant local

planning authorities and the current SoCC is closely modelled on the 2014 SoCC. MPL have had 
regard to the responses received as part of the 2014 non-statutory and statutory consultations and 
these have influenced the Project design that is now being consulted on in 2017. 
MPL's SoCC is available for inspection online at www.millbrookpower.co.uk . It is also available for 
inspection in hard copy at Central Bedfordshire Council Office (Priory House, Monks Walk,

The Government’s policy in relation to energy related Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects is 
set out in a series of National Policy Statements (NPSs).  NPS EN-1 (Energy) states that "Gas will 
continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to support an 
increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply".  The need for the 
Project is established through these NPSs and is therefore not proposed by MPL as a topic of 
consultation.

MILLBROOK POWER PROJECT 
 
S47 LOCAL COMMUNITY CONSULTATION PLAN, 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”) proposes to develop a gas-fired power generation 
plant and connections to the electricity and gas networks on land located in Rookery 
South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Lidlington, Millbrook and Marston Moretaine 
in Bedfordshire. 
 
The proposed power generation plant would have a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW of electricity. Using the latest and most efficient power generating technology, it 
will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. Due 
to its size, the gas-fired power station would be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project and as such it would require a Development Consent Order (DCO).  
 
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  
The community consultation described is carried out under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008; the Act sets out requirements for formal pre-application consultation for 
those applications that are considered by the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the 
relevant Secretary of State.   
 
Section 47(1) of the Planning Act 2008 states that the applicant must prepare a 
statement setting out how it proposes to consult those people, who are living in the 
vicinity of all or part of the land to which the proposed application relates, about the 
proposed application. 
  
Furthermore, MPL is required to consult Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and 
Bedford Borough Council (BBC) on its proposed Statement of Community 
Consultation ("SoCC").  Once MPL has finalised its SoCC, it is required to make the 
same available to the public in a way that is reasonably convenient and must also 
publish a notice in the local press as to where and when the SoCC can be inspected. 
This plan sets out how Millbrook Power Limited intends to meet these s47 consultation 
requirements. This plan is not itself required pursuant to the Planning Act 2008.  
 
2014 CONSULTATION 
MPL first announced its proposals for its power generation project in May 2014 and 
conducted its consultation activities in two phases:  an initial phase of consultation 
between May and September 2014 that included mailing of an introductory leaflet to 
c10,500 homes and businesses in the area surrounding the site, public exhibitions at 
three locations in the vicinity of the site (Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston Moretaine), 
meetings with CBC and BBC councillors as well as meetings with those parish councils 
that were within the project’s Core Consultation Zone (CCZ).  MPL also shared its 
plans to the wider community via Parish Councils further afield, the two local 
constituency MPs, via social media and the internet, newspaper advertising and 
articles/broadcast reports, and via organisations that were a conduit to “hard to reach 
groups” in the area.  Among the highlights of its work, MPL representatives addressed 
sixth form students at the Kimberley STEM College. 
 
 
March 2017                                                  2 
 
 
Having agreed its Consultation Plan and Statement of Community Consultation with 
CBC and BBC,  MPL conducted a period of statutory consultation between 13th 
October and 16th November 2014.  An information leaflet was distributed to homes 
and businesses in the CCZ, four public exhibitions were held and there was once again 
local advertising and a series of media reports (print, TV, radio and social media). 
 
The choice of location for the exhibitions (in both phases of consultation) was decided 
upon following discussions with members of CBC and BBC. 
 
In addition, local councilors from CBC, BBC and eight parish councils attended an 
“outreach meeting” with the Planning Inspectorate which was organised and attended 
by MPL. 
 
The various consultation activities during 2014 helped inform the Project’s 
development and led to MPL’s decision to underground the electrical connection rather 
than connect the power generation plant to the National Grid via overhead lines and 
additional transmission towers. 
 
In March 2015, the Millbrook Power Project was put on hold due to market and political 
uncertainty and both CBC and BBC were informed as were the parish councils in the 
area. Since the 2014 Consultation, MPL has had little contact with local members of 
the public. However, MPL has recently re-started its work to secure planning 
permission for the Project and as such has decided to conduct another phase of 
statutory consultation.  
 
1.0 PURPOSE 
a. This document explains how MPL once more intends to consult people living and 
working in the vicinity of the proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power station, its 
associated gas and electrical connections and other related infrastructure (the 
“Project”) on land located in and adjacent to Rookery South Pit. The land is situated 
in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, approximately 3 km north 
of Ampthill, a local market town, and 7 km south west of Bedford in Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough. 
 
b. The Project’s infrastructure that is associated with a power generation plant 
includes a new purpose built access road, an underground gas pipeline connection 
and a new electrical connection (including underground cables) that will facilitate 
the export of power to the National Grid for distribution to homes and businesses.   
 
 
 
March 2017                                                  3 
 
c. Since December 2016, MPL, the development company for the Project at Rookery 
South Pit, has been a subsidiary company of Drax Group plc.  Drax Group is 
seeking to develop flexible gas fired power generation assets at three further sites 
in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive towards a low carbon economy: 
one at Eye Airfield in Suffolk, one near Aberdare in south Wales and the third near 
Felindre, also in south Wales. 
 
d. Stag Energy provides the resources to MPL through a management services 
agreement with Drax Group. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company 
draws on a depth of experience with a team that has created and delivered over 
10,000 MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the 
globe, of which, 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
 
e. The details of the consultation methodology set out in this document aim to explain 
how MPL will satisfy the community consultation requirements for an application 
for a DCO under the Planning Act 2008 which, if granted, would enable the Project 
to be constructed and operated.  MPL intends to submit an application for a DCO 
which will be examined by the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of 
State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (SoS). It should be noted that the 
application will be accompanied by an Environmental Statement as the 
development is considered to be an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
Development. A Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR), reviewed 
and updated from 2014, will be produced which will describe the likely significant 
environmental effects of the proposed Power Generation Plant and its associated 
infrastructure. The PEIR will be published and made available for public scrutiny 
and consultation in May of  this year. 
 
 
f. As part of the DCO application, MPL is required to produce a Consultation Report 
explaining how the three strands of consultation required under the Planning Act 
2008 (s421, s47 and s482) have been complied with.  MPL intends that its 
                                         
1 Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 requires consultation with certain local authorities, listed statutory consultees and those 
with an interest in the land on which the proposed Project will be built and operated or who may be particularly affected by it 
2 Section 48 sets out publicity requirements on a national basis 
 
 
March 2017                                                  4 
 
Consultation Report will include an explanation of how the relevant local authorities 
were consulted about the content of the SoCC and what the local authorities’ 
comments were.  The Consultation Report will demonstrate that the local 
authorities were given sufficient time to provide comments, explain how MPL had 
regard to those comments and provide evidence that the SoCC was made 
available and notified in the correct manner.  
 
g. The Consultation Report will also explain what activities were undertaken (in 2014 
and in 2017) to enable consultation with the local community, how those consulted 
responded and how MPL had regard to representations received in the 
development of the Project and the DCO application, prior to its submission to the 
SoS.  
 
h. This document does not set out how MPL intends to undertake the other strands 
of statutory consultation required by Sections 42 and 48 of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
 
2.0 THE PROPOSED SITE 
 
a. The site for the proposed Power Generation Plant (which comprises part of the 
Project) is located on land located within Rookery South Pit, a former clay pit and 
designated as Rookery Clay Pits County Wildlife Site (CWS). The site is adjacent 
to the proposed Covanta Energy from Waste project, which has been consented 
but has not yet been constructed.  
 
a. The site is located mostly within the local authority administrative area of Central 
Bedfordshire Council and in part within the administrative area of Bedford Borough 
Council. The proposed routes of the electrical and gas connections would be 
located in farmland to the south of Rookery South Pit within Central Bedfordshire, 
whilst part of the proposed access route, subject to consultation, environmental and 
technical studies, resides within the administrative area of Bedford Borough 
Council.

3.0 THE PROJECT 
 
The Project would comprise: 
 A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by natural gas and 
with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW) 
comprising: 
o The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine Generators and 
balance of plant, which are located within the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
o A new purpose built Access Road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site; and 
o During construction, a temporary construction compound (the Laydown 
Area). 
 A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS) which is located to 
the South of Rookery South Pit. The Gas Connection includes an underground 
pipeline of length approximately 1.8 km.; and 
 A new Electrical Connection (including underground cables) to export power 
from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission 
System (NETS) for distribution to homes and businesses and which is also 
located to the South of Rookery South Pit. . 
 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as 
the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power Generation Plant Site. 
 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are all 
integral to the generation of electricity and together are referred to as the ‘Project’. The 
land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order 
to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  
 
4.0 CONSULTATION BACKGROUND 
 
 
March 2017                                                  6 
 
 
a. MPL is committed to and has demonstrated an open and responsive consultation 
with local communities and interested parties.  Taking note of the 2014 
Consultation, the programme recommended within this document sets out a 
framework for a formal and inclusive consultation process.  
 
b. The draft SoCC appended to this document is designed to meet the legal 
requirements set out in section 47 of the Planning Act 2008 and follows a range of 
advice and guidance set out by the Planning Inspectorate and the Department for 
Communities & Local Government, as well as previous dialogue about public 
consultation with CBC and BBC (and feedback from local people) in 2014.  The 
consultation process is designed to enable informed, detailed and two-way 
communication. Through this process, relevant matters identified during 
consultation will be taken into account during the development of the proposal and 
before submission of the application for a DCO. 
 
c. Between May 2014 and March 2015, MPL has proactively communicated its 
intentions with elected representatives and directly within the local community, in 
order to introduce and discuss aspects of the Project.  These non-statutory 
information activities, the 2014 period of statutory public consultation and  
forthcoming initiatives will be captured in the Consultation Report that will form part 
of the DCO application.  
 
 
4.1 CONSULTATION AREAS 
 
a. MPL proposes to carry out its consultation in two areas: a core consultation zone 
(CCZ) that equates to an approximate 5 km radius from the site of the Power 
Generation Plant (see map overleaf), and an outer consultation zone (OCZ) that 
equates to a radius of 10 km.  The CCZ is defined by parish council boundaries 
closest to the 5 km radius. These consultation zones were chosen in 2014 following 
feedback from various elected representatives with whom MPL had been liaising 
and was in accordance with those used by Covanta for the Rookery South Energy 
 
 
March 2017                                                  7 
 
from Waste Generating Station, even though the impact of the Project is expected 
to be considerably less than that of the Covanta scheme.    
 
b. The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of 
the Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the 
Project’s construction and operation and expected to have the greatest interest in 
the Project. These include the villages of Stewartby, Marston Moretaine and 
Millbrook and the town of Ampthill, as well as other settlements within the CCZ.  
Whilst a 5 km buffer has been used as a guide, where settlements fall only partially 
within this area, discretion has been exercised.  
 
 
 
 
Proposed CCZ – approx. 5 km radius from the Power Generation Plant 
Site 
 
 
March 2017                                                  8 
 
 
Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
 
c. Whilst the site is located directly within the CBC ward of Cranfield and Marston 
Moreteyne the following neighbouring wards also fall within the proposed CCZ: 
 
o Houghton Conquest and Haynes  
o Ampthill  
d) The proposed CCZ also includes wards within the neighbouring local authority - 
BBC. The following BBC wards fall within the CCZ: 
o Elstow and Stewartby  
o Wootton  
 
e) The CCZ would include all or parts of the following parish council areas: 
 
 
March 2017                                                  9 
 
o 
Marston Moreteyne (CBC)    
o 
Houghton Conquest (CBC) 
o 
Millbrook (CBC) 
o 
Ampthill (CBC) 
o 
Maulden (CBC) 
o 
Lidlington (CBC) 
o 
Stewartby (BBC) 
o 
Wootton  (BBC) 
 
    The CCZ will be MPL’s primary focus of activity when consulting about its plans.  
 
f) As in 2014, communities in the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via 
newspaper advertisements, posters, media coverage and direct contact with parish 
councils and other relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and will have the 
opportunity to comment on the plans.  The OCZ includes the main population area 
of Bedford. MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie 
within the OCZ will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and 
operation although MPL recognises that they may be interested in it. In 2014, there 
was little interest or comment about the Project from elected representatives or from 
the general public within the OCZ.  
 
g) Communities outside the OCZ will be informed about the Project as the circulation 
areas and reach of the media (TV, radio, printed media) that will be used to 
communicate details of the Project and the consultation activities are far greater 
than the boundaries of the OCZ. 
 
 
5.0 2014 NON-STATUTORY AND STATUTORY CONSULTATION 
 
As an introduction to the Project, MPL undertook an introductory information 
programme and non-statutory consultation exercise in May/June 2014. This included:  
 
 
 
March 2017                                                  10 
 
a. Discussions with officers and councillors at CBC and BBC about our plans and 
proposed non-statutory consultation plans, including exhibition venues and 
organisations that should be invited. 
 
b. As every home and business in the CCZ is represented by both a CBC councillor 
or a BBC councillor, and a Parish councillor, MPL communicated its plans (and 
information regarding the public exhibitions that were held between June 5th – 7th 
2014) to the CBC and BBC, as well as the local MP Nadine Dorries, and Richard 
Fuller MP (whose constituency partially falls within the CCZ).  MPL met Nadine 
Dorries MP on two occasions to discuss the Project and answer her questions. 
 
c. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a Project website was launched to 
coincide with the Project being introduced to the local community. The website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) provides information on the Project and enables 
people to ask questions and provide feedback to MPL about the Project.   
 
d. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a letter of introduction about the Project 
was sent to approximately 10,000 households and businesses within a 5 km radius 
of the site (i.e an area very closely aligned with the CCZ). The letter contained 
details about the Project and an invitation to attend information exhibitions near the 
Project site. The letter was sent and distributed by Royal Mail a week prior to the 
first exhibition date. 
 
e. As part of the non-statutory consultation in 2014, exhibitions were held at the 
following locations to give local people the maximum opportunity to attend:  
 
 
o Thursday, June 5th - Lidlington Village Hall (4.00pm till 7.30pm) 
o Friday, June 6th - Stewartby Village Hall (3.00pm till 7.00pm) 
o Saturday, June 7th - Marston Moreteyne Village Hall (10.00am till 1.00pm) 
 
f. 
Exhibition locations were chosen because they were considered convenient to 
those communities within the CCZ that surrounds the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site. These events featured relevant information that was known at the time 
 
 
March 2017                                                  11 
 
in a variety of formats (display panels, maps, plans, leaflet etc) about the proposal.  
Members of the MPL project team were available to discuss the proposal, answer 
questions and to receive feedback from members of the public. Feedback as to 
whether MPL should do anything differently during the statutory consultation 
process that followed in October/November 2014 was sought during the informal 
information period/non-statutory consultation about the Project. 
 
g. MPL used venues that met Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
upon a reasonable and timely request had provisions in place for those with 
special requirements who were unable to attend or access a consultation event 
(for example, private transport to the exhibition event).  
 
h. More than 250 people attended the exhibitions, including local councillors.  The 
local media (print, TV, radio and social media) published news reports about the 
exhibitions in advance of them being held as well as afterwards.  
 
i. 
MPL issued press releases before and after the exhibitions were held, and these 
were posted on the MPL website.  The press releases were issued to the local 
media including parish council newsletters, and news reports were published in 
the media as a result of receiving them from MPL.  
 
j. 
MPL advertised the informal information/non-statutory consultation exhibitions via 
a display advertisement in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper, published on 
June 1st 2014.  
 
k. A leaflet about the Project was produced for people who attended the exhibition, 
and additional copies were provided to local councilors and others for wider 
dissemination. The leaflet contained details of the Project, the consultation 
process, an indicative timeframe for the Project’s development and the Millbrook 
Power website address and contact details.  In addition, a Feedback form was 
available for people to fill in on the day or to return via Freepost to MPL.  
 
 
 
March 2017                                                  12 
 
l. 
Posters advertising the non-statutory consultation events were displayed on 
parish noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ, for example 
local libraries, local shops and post offices and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
m. Since May 2014, the MPL website has carried information about the project 
(technical, environmental and communications), contact details and a mechanism 
to enable people to ask questions and provide feedback.  The website address 
was provided to CBC, BBC and parish councils for inclusion on parish websites, 
newsletters and other local information material. 
 
n. MPL will once again consider the provision, upon request, of written materials 
about the Project in different formats (for example, large print or braille). 
 
o. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) were 
accepted during the periods of non-statutory and statutory consultation in 2014.  
 
 
6.0 2014 STATUTORY CONSULTATION METHODOLOGY & ACCESSIBILITY 
The period of statutory consultation was conducted between October 13th and 16th 
November 2014 (a 35 day period): 
 
a. MPL consulted officers at CBC and BBC on the content of the SoCC. 
 
b. MPL engaged with elected members of CBC, BBC, parish councils, the local MP 
Nadine Dorries and Richard Fuller MP whose constituency lies within the CCZ. 
 
c. MPL used elected members of CBC, BBC and parish councils as communication 
channels, via meetings and correspondence, to share information and seek 
community feedback during the period of statutory consultation.   
 
d. Exhibitions/consultation events were held at the following locations: 
 
• 
Marston Moretaine Village Hall, 31st October (1500 to 1900hrs)  
 
 
March 2017                                                  13 
 
• 
Stewartby Village Hall, 1st November (0900 to 1300hrs)  
• 
Ampthill Masonic Centre, Ampthill, 3rd November (1600 to 2000hrs) 
• 
Lidlington Village Hall, 4th November (1100 to 1500hrs)   
 
After consideration of the outcomes of the non-statutory consultation process these 
venues were considered the most convenient to those communities within the CCZ 
that surround the proposed Power Generation Plant Site. These events featured 
relevant information in a variety of formats (display panels, plans, leaflet etc) about 
the proposal and copies of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(PEIR) were made available.  Members of the MPL project team were available to 
discuss the proposal, answer questions and to receive feedback from members of 
the public.  About 175 people attended the public exhibitions. 
 
e. In order to ensure that people had the maximum opportunity to attend the 
exhibitions, MPL arranged for them to be held at the above convenient locations 
and at a variety of times. An event was held on a Saturday (at Stewartby) for those 
unable to visit during the working week. 
 
f. MPL used venues that met Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
made provision for those with special requirements who were unable to attend or 
access a consultation event (for example, private transport to a consultation event).  
 
g. In consultation with CBC and BBC, MPL shared information about the Project with 
those “hard to reach groups” living and working within the CCZ. These groups were 
accessed through informal and formal channels - via council services (for example, 
Central Bedfordshire Together, Bedford Borough Partnership, and others) and 
relevant specialist organisations (for example the Marston Moreteyne Action 
Group, local branches of the Women’s Institute, and local business representative 
groups such as the Bedfordshire Chamber of Commerce).   
 
h. Social media was used to reach the younger members of the community, whilst 
MPL gave one presentation to a local college about the Project. Local schools and 
colleges were notified of the consultation events. 
 
 
March 2017                                                  14 
 
 
i. MPL advertised the consultation events via local and regional newspapers 
(Bedfordshire on Sunday, Bedford Borough Times & Citizen), for two weeks prior 
to the first event taking place.  In addition MPL announced via the issue of press 
releases to parish, local and regional news publications, the local radio and TV 
stations (and via online media) that the events were taking place.  The newspaper 
advertisements (and media coverage) reached the CCZ, the OCZ and further 
afield. The content gave information on MPL’s proposals and details of the 
consultation events, including contact information.   
 
j. A leaflet about the Project and the consultation programme was distributed to 
households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ some two weeks in advance 
of the first consultation event, informing them of the consultation events taking 
place. The leaflet included details of the Project, the location and dates of the 
consultation events, the MPL website address, and a comments/questions card 
that could be returned Freepost.    
 
k. Posters advertising the consultation events were displayed on parish noticeboards 
and other community venues within the CCZ and the OCZ, for example local 
libraries, local shops and post offices, local schools and colleges and doctors’ 
surgeries. 
 
l. MPL informed those parish councils within the OCZ about the Project and the 
exhibition/consultation event via email. 
 
m. The MPL team proactively and reactively met with individuals and interested 
groups in the local area as part of the formal consultation period to answer 
questions and provide updates about the Project.  
 
 
n. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) were 
considered and addressed where possible, as well as comments noted.  The 
statutory consultation lasted for a period of 35 days. Relevant responses during 
 
 
March 2017                                                  15 
 
the 2014 Statutory Consultation have been filed, had regard to and will be referred 
to in the Consultation Report that will accompany the DCO application.   
 
 
7.0 2017 CONSULTATION 
 
a. Taking note of the comments and feedback that were received about the 
Project during the 2014 consultations, MPL proposes a series of meetings with 
elected members of CBC and BBC, meetings with the parish councils that are 
located in the CCZ and the local MPs, followed by a single phase of public 
consultation about the Project. This period of Statutory Consultation will follow 
similar lines to the consultation activities that were carried out in 2014 namely: 
 
b. MPL will use elected members of CBC, BBC and parish councils in the CCZ 
and OCZ as communication channels to share information and seek community 
feedback during the period of statutory consultation.   
 
c. Subject to booking confirmation, exhibitions/consultation events will be held 
between June 8th and June 13th at the following locations: 
 
a. Marston Moretaine Village Hall  
b. Stewartby Club  
c. Ampthill Baptist Chuch Hall  
d. Lidlington Village Hall 
  
d. These events will feature relevant information in a variety of formats (display 
panels, plans, photomontages etc) about the proposal and copies of the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) will be made available.  
Members of the MPL project team will be available to discuss the proposal, 
answer questions and to receive feedback from members of the public, 
 
e. In order to ensure that people have the maximum opportunity to attend the 
exhibitions, MPL will once again arrange for them to be held at the above 
 
 
March 2017                                                  16 
 
convenient locations and at a variety of times. An event will be held on a 
Saturday for those unable to visit during the working week. 
 
f. The venues meet Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and MPL will 
make provision for those with special requirements who are unable to attend or 
access a consultation event (for example, private transport to a consultation 
event).  
 
g. MPL will again share information about the Project with those “hard to reach 
groups” living and working within the CCZ.  
 
h. Social media will again be used to reach the younger members of the 
community, whilst MPL will be willing to give presentations about the Project to 
local colleges and schools. Local schools and colleges will again be notified of 
the consultation events. 
 
i. MPL will advertise the consultation events via local and regional newspapers 
(Bedfordshire on Sunday, Bedford Borough Times & Citizen), for two weeks 
prior to the first event taking place.  In addition MPL will issue press releases to 
parish, local and regional news publications, the local radio and TV stations 
(and via online media) to give additional publicity to the events taking place.  
The newspaper advertisements (and media coverage) will reach the CCZ, the 
OCZ and further afield. The content will be key information on MPL’s proposals 
and details of the consultation events, including contact information.   
 
j. A leaflet about the Project and the consultation programme will be distributed 
to c13,000 households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ some two weeks 
in advance of the first consultation event, informing them of the consultation 
events taking place. The leaflet will include details of the Project, the location 
and dates of the consultation events, the MPL website address, and a 
comments/questions card that could be returned Freepost.    
 
k. Posters advertising the consultation events will be displayed on parish 
noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ and the OCZ, for 
 
 
March 2017                                                  17 
 
example local libraries, local shops and post offices, local schools and colleges 
and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
l. MPL will inform those parish councils within the OCZ about the Project and the 
exhibition/consultation events via  email. 
 
m. MPL will meet with individuals and interested groups in the local area as part of 
the formal consultation period to answer questions and provide updates about 
the Project.  
 
n. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post or email) will be  
considered and addressed where possible, as well as comments noted.  The 
2017 period of statutory consultation will last for a period of 35 days, and the 
outcomes (along with the outcomes of the 2014 Statutory Consultation) will be 
referred to in the Consultation Report that will accompany the DCO application.

PROJECT 
Millbrook, 
Bedfordshire 
Statement of Community Consultation 
September 2014

September 2014                                                  1 
 
This Statement of Community Consultation ("SoCC") is published in connection with 
a proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power station, its integral gas and electrical 
connections and other related infrastructure at Rookery South Pit situated in the 
Marston Vale, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill and 7 km south-west of Bedford 
in Central Bedfordshire (the "Project").   
 
The capacity of the Project will be in excess of 50 MW of electricity. As such, it is 
classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project under the Planning Act 
2008. The Project therefore requires a Development Consent Order ("DCO") in order 
for it to be built. Any DCO would be made by the Secretary of State for Energy & 
Climate Change. 
 
This SoCC is part of a consultation process, required by the Planning Act 2008. This 
SoCC explains how Millbrook Power Limited (the promoter of the Project) proposes to 
consult people living in the vicinity of the Project, businesses and other organisations 
about the Project, in advance of submitting an application for a DCO for the Project in 
2015.   
 
MPL has consulted Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedfordshire Borough Council, 
as the local planning authorities, about the content of this Statement of Community 
Consultation and has had regard to their responses.   
 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is a company established by Watt Power Limited. Watt 
Power Limited is seeking to develop gas fired power stations at Rookery South Pit and 
elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. 
 
A consultation/communication plan has previously been developed and is available 
from MPL or via its website www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
 
 
This SoCC explains: 
 some details about the Project ; 
 
 
September 2014                                                  2 
 
 how MPL is publishing preliminary environmental information about the Project; 
 how MPL is going to consult local people and communities about the Project and 
what activities will be undertaken to give them access to information about the 
proposal and help them to understand what particular aspects of the proposal may 
mean to them, enabling them to provide informed feedback; 
 how people can become involved in shaping the Project before a DCO application 
is submitted by putting forward their views to influence the Project, particularly 
regarding specific options under consideration; and 
 how people can provide feedback to MPL from consultation activities and ensure 
that they are informed about the Project.  
 
The Project 
The key details of the proposed Project are: 
 the construction of a Power Generation Plant with a rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 MW of electricity. The plant will have up to 5 stacks, each up 
to 40 m in height. It will include a new purpose built access road from Green Lane 
to the site of the generating element of the Project;  
 the site for the Generating Equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha;  
 the Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas. As such, fuel 
for the Power Generation Plant will be provided by an underground pipeline 
connection and will not be delivered by road to the site; 
 it will include the construction of a new electrical connection  (up to 500 m in length) 
to the National Grid and the construction of a new underground pipeline (up to 1600 
m in length) to bring natural gas to the Power Generating Plant from the National 
Transmission System;  
 it will create approximately 150 jobs during a construction period lasting two years 
and create up to 15 permanent jobs once commercial operations have begun;    
 it responds to the UK Government’s need for new gas generation in order to 
underpin the country’s energy security and its transition to a low-carbon economy; 
 the station would emit about 50% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than an equivalent 
sized coal-fired power plant, and is designed to operate flexibly so that it can 
respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variation in customer demand and 
intermittent output from wind power generation; and 
 
 
September 2014                                                  3 
 
 it is acknowledged that during construction and operation there is potential for 
negative impacts on some local communities and the environment, for example 
noise from the operation of the Power Generation Plant, the visual impact of the 
stacks and impacts on the local and regional transport network as a result of 
construction traffic. An Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") is being 
undertaken to understand and seek to reduce these and other potential effects of 
the Project’s construction and operation. An Environmental Statement will be 
submitted as part of the application for a DCO for the Project. More information on 
this process is provided below. The EIA process is also considering the potential 
positive effects of the operation of the Project. 
 
The Planning Process 
DCO applications for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before making 
a recommendation on that application to the relevant Secretary of State. The final 
decision on the application is made by the Secretary of State and if it is successful, a 
DCO will be made.  
 
The Government's policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects 
are set out in National Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been 
developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-
2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Networks 
Infrastructure) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  EN-1 states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility 
to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of 
supply."   
 
When determining a DCO application, the Secretary of State must have regard to the 
relevant NPSs and must make a decision in accordance with these unless other 
considerations apply, including where she/he is satisfied that the adverse impact of a 
proposed development would outweigh its benefits.  
  
 
 
September 2014                                                  4 
 
When considering whether to accept an application for examination, the Planning 
Inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has undertaken effective pre-
application consultation.  Pre-application consultation is essential in allowing MPL to 
understand and minimise the impacts of the Project and to allow a thorough 
examination by the Planning Inspectorate. MPL is required to submit a Consultation 
Report with its application for a DCO.  This report will include details of the local 
community feedback received, explain how MPL has had regard to relevant feedback 
and will detail how MPL has complied with the consultation requirements of the 
Planning Act 2008. 
 
The community consultation described in this statement is carried out under Section 
47 of the Planning Act 2008. It is in addition to consultation that will be carried out with 
specific statutory consultees (such as nature conservation bodies) and those with 
relevant interests in land (including owners and occupiers within the Project boundary) 
under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. It is also in addition to wider notification of 
the Project under Section 48 of the Planning Act 2008.  
 
Information on the planning process for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects 
and the NPSs can be found at: 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/ 
www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/consents_planning/nps_en_infra/
nps_en_infra.aspx 
 
Environmental Information & Impacts 
The Project will be designed and developed to meet or exceed current quality, safety 
and environmental standards and efforts will be made to minimise its impact on the 
local environment, both during its construction and its operation.  The extent and scale 
of the development and MPL’s proposals to mitigate its impacts will be consulted upon 
locally and will be amongst the issues considered by the Planning Inspectorate on 
behalf of the Secretary of State. 
 
Because of the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an EIA pursuant to 
the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. 
 
 
September 2014                                                  5 
 
Therefore, the Project is classed as an EIA development. The EIA considers the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project including those on air and water quality, 
noise, visual and cumulative impact, traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage 
and socio-economics.   
 
MPL has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the scope of the EIA, 
including local authorities, the Environment Agency, the Highways Agency, Natural 
England and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate on June 20th 2014, accompanied by a Scoping Report. The 
Scoping Report outlines which environmental topics will be covered by the EIA and 
how the assessments will be undertaken. The Planning Inspectorate issued its formal 
Scoping Opinion on July 28th 2014.  
 
These 
documents 
are 
available 
on 
the 
Millbrook 
Power 
website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) and via the dedicated section on the Planning 
Inspectorate’s website:  
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/eastern/millbrook-power/ 
 
As part of the pre-application consultation materials on the proposed Project, MPL will 
publish a Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") and a non-technical 
summary ("NTS") of the same.  The PEIR presents the information gathered to date 
and provides the results of MPL’s preliminary assessments as to the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project.   It does not set out the final findings but will 
include information on provisional mitigation measures.  During consultation, MPL will 
make available details on landscaping proposals and other measures to mitigate the 
Project’s impact.  MPL will provide copies of the PEIR and the NTS to Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities. 
Both documents will also be made available at: the main office of Central Bedfordshire 
Council in Chicksands, Shefford; at the main office of Bedford Borough Council in 
Bedford; local libraries; at public exhibitions and on the MPL website.  
 
When the EIA process is complete and MPL submits its application for a DCO, it will 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement. This will report on the likely 
 
 
September 2014                                                  6 
 
significant environmental effects of the Project identified in the EIA and will explain the 
mitigation measures to avoid or reduce these.  
 
Public Consultation 
The views of the local community about the Project are important.  In June 2014, MPL 
carried out a non-statutory consultation process sharing its initial plans with the public 
at three exhibitions held in Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston Moretaine.  At the 
exhibitions and since, MPL has received and responded to comments on the proposed 
Project and its impact on the environment, local communities and the local economy.    
 
a. What are we now consulting on and when? 
In the statutory phase of consultation commencing on 13th October 2014 (and finishing 
on 16th November 2014), MPL will seek views on the overall scope and impact of the 
Project, including the integral electrical connection and gas connection. Only after MPL 
has had regard to the consultation responses received will the application for a DCO 
for the Project be finalised and submitted.  
 
Responses will, in particular, be invited on: 
 
• The layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project Site; 
• Route option(s) for accessing the gas and electricity connection infrastructure 
during construction and maintenance; 
• The preferred route option for the gas connection; and 
• The proposed electrical connection 
• The findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project during construction and operation, as set 
out in the PEIR. 
The consultation explained in this Statement will run for 35 days ending on 16th 
November 2014. Comments about the project must be received by MPL by this date.   
 
b. Who will we consult with? 
 
 
September 2014                                                  7 
 
The Planning Act 2008 states that those ‘living in the vicinity of the land’ should be 
consulted.  We have discussed the scope of our consultation with Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities, and have 
identified and agreed the Consultation Zones that form the basis of our community 
consultation.  
 
MPL will carry out its community consultation activities in two areas: a Core 
Consultation Zone (CCZ) that equates to a 5 km radius from the Power Generation 
Plant Site and an Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ) that equates to a radius of 10 km. 
These consultation zones were chosen following feedback from local elected 
representatives and are in accordance with those used by Covanta for the Rookery 
South Energy from Waste Generating Station, even though the impact of the Project 
is expected to be considerably less than the Energy from Waste scheme. 
 
The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of the 
Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the Project and 
expected to have the greatest interest in the Project   The zone includes all or parts of 
the following parish council areas: Marston Moreteyne, Millbrook, Houghton Conquest, 
Ampthill, Maulden, Lidlington, Stewartby and Wootton. An information leaflet will be 
sent to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ and the CCZ will be the 
focus of public exhibitions.  
 
 
September 2014                                                  8 
 
Proposed CCZ – approx. 5 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site

Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
Communities within the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with parish councils and other 
relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and given the opportunity to comment on our 
plans for the Project.  The outer zone includes the main population area of Bedford.   
 
MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the OCZ 
will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation although MPL 
recognises that those living and working within the OCZ may be interested in the 
Project.  Outside the two zones, there may well be others interested in MPL’s plans. 
These people will also be reached through local/regional newspaper advertising and 
media coverage (print, broadcast and social media). Feedback that is received within 
 
 
September 2014                                                  10 
 
the consultation period will be considered by MPL as it finalises its proposals for the 
Project. 
 
c.  How will we consult?  
MPL will seek and receive people’s views through a number of activities: 
 Public exhibitions will be held at Lidlington, Marston Moretaine, Stewartby and 
Ampthill within the CCZ (see the table below for locations and dates of the public 
exhibitions);  
 An information leaflet will be sent to households, businesses and institutions in the 
CCZ, and made available at local council offices, local libraries and other civic 
community venues in the area. The leaflet will also be sent to those groups that 
are defined as “hard to reach” (such as the Community Engagement Network, the 
Older People’s Reference Group and the Youth Parliament). It will give background 
on the Project, the consultation process and how individuals can engage in the 
consultation.  The leaflet will be made available at libraries and council offices in 
the OCZ; 
 Copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, The Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
and the Non-Technical Summary as well as other information about the Project will 
be available (in addition to the main council offices of Central Bedfordshire Council 
and Bedford Borough Council) at Marston Vale Forest Centre, Marston Moretaine, 
MK43 0PR which is open seven days a week between 10.00am and 4.00pm, as

coverage;  
 In addition, MPL will contact a broad spectrum of local stakeholders. These will 
include elected representatives, local community, special interest groups (including 
those “hard to reach groups” such as the Community Engagement Network, the 
Older People’s Reference Group and the Youth Parliament), and local business 
groups. MPL will provide them with information on the Project and undertake 
briefings where appropriate. 
 
Individuals and organisations wishing to respond should include their name and an 
address where correspondence about the response can be sent. Responses may be 
made public, subject to data protection laws. 
 
Comments made at any stage of the consultation process will be recorded and 
carefully considered by MPL as part of the process of preparing the final proposals for 
its application to the Planning Inspectorate.

MILLBROOK POWER PROJECT 
 
S47 LOCAL COMMUNITY CONSULTATION PLAN, 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”) proposes to develop a gas-fired power generation 
plant and connections to the electricity and gas networks on land located in Rookery 
South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Lidlington, Millbrook and Marston Mortaine 
in Bedfordshire. 
 
The proposed power generation plant would have a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW of electricity. Using the latest and most efficient power generating technology, it 
will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. Due 
to its size, the Millbrook Power project would be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project and as such it would require a Development Consent Order (DCO).  
 
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  
The community consultation described is carried out under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008; the Act sets out requirements for formal pre-application consultation for 
those applications that are considered by the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the 
relevant Secretary of State.   
 
Section 47(1) of the Planning Act 2008 states that the applicant must prepare a 
statement setting out how it proposes to consult those people, who are living in the 
vicinity of all or part of the land to which the proposed application relates, about the 
proposed application. 
  
Furthermore,  MPL is required to consult Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and 
Bedford Borough Council (BBC) on its proposed  Statement of Community 
Consultation ("SoCC").  Once MPL has finalised its SoCC, it is required to make the 
same available to the public in a way that is reasonably convenient and must also 
publish a notice in the local press as to where and when the SoCC can be inspected. 
This plan sets out how Millbrook Power Limited intends to meet these s47 consultation 
requirements. This plan is not itself required pursuant to the Planning Act 2008.  
 
1.0 PURPOSE 
a. This document explains how MPL intends to consult people living and working in 
the vicinity of the proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power station, its integral gas 
and electrical connections and other related infrastructure (the “Project”) on land 
located in and adjacent to Rookery South Pit. The land is situated in the Marston 
Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill, a 
local market town, and 7 km south west of Bedford in Central Bedfordshire and 
Bedford Borough. 
 
 
July 2014                                                  2 
 
 
b. The Project’s infrastructure that is integral to the power generation plant includes 
a new purpose built access road, a gas pipeline connection and a new electrical 
connection that will facilitate the export of power to the National Grid for distribution 
to homes and businesses.   
 
c. MPL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit.  Watt Power is seeking to develop flexible gas fired power 
generation assets at three further sites in the UK to support the UK Government’s 
drive towards a low carbon economy: one at Eye Airfield in Suffolk, one near 
Aberdare in south Wales and the third near Felindre, also in south Wales. 
 
d. Stag Energy provides the resources to MPL through a management services 
agreement with Watt Power. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company 
draws on a depth of experience with a team that has created and delivered over 
10,000 MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the 
globe, of which, 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
 
e. The details of the consultation methodology set out in this document aim to explain 
how MPL will satisfy the community consultation requirements for an application 
for a DCO under the Planning Act 2008 which, if granted, would enable the Project 
to be constructed and operated.  MPL intends to submit an application for a DCO 
which will be examined by the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of 
State for Energy & Climate Change (SoS). It should be noted that the application 
will be accompanied by an Environmental Statement as the development is 
considered to be an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Development. A 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) will be produced which will 
describe the preliminary assessment as to the likely significant environmental 
effects of the proposed Power Generation Plant and its associated infrastructure. 
The PEIR is expected to be published and made available for public scrutiny and 
consultation in the autumn of this year. 
 
 
 
 
July 2014                                                  3 
 
f. As part of the DCO application, MPL is required to produce a Consultation Report 
explaining how the three strands of consultation required under the Planning Act 
2008 (s421, s47 and s482) have been complied with.  MPL intends that its 
Consultation Report will include an explanation of how the relevant local authorities 
were consulted about the content of the SoCC and what the local authorities’ 
comments were.  The Consultation Report will demonstrate that the local 
authorities were given sufficient time to provide comments, explain how MPL had 
regard to those comments and provide evidence that the SoCC was made 
available and notified in the correct manner.  
 
g. The Consultation Report will also explain what activities were undertaken to enable 
consultation with the local community, how those consulted responded and how 
MPL had regard to representations received in the development of the Project and 
the DCO application, prior to its submission to the SoS.  
 
h. This document does not set out how MPL intends to undertake the other strands 
of statutory consultation required by Sections 42 and 48 of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
 
2.0 THE PROPOSED SITE 
 
a. The site for the proposed Power Generation Plant (which comprises part of the 
Project) is located on land located within Rookery South Pit, a former clay pit and 
designated as Rookery Clay Pits County Wildlife Site (CWS). The site is adjacent 
to the proposed Covanta Energy from Waste project, which has been consented 
but has not yet been constructed.  
 
a. The site is located mostly within the local authority administrative area of Central 
Bedfordshire Council and in part within the administrative area of Bedford Borough 
Council. The proposed routes of the electrical and gas connections would be 
located in farmland to the south and/or east of Rookery South Pit within Central 
                                         
1 Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 requires consultation with certain local authorities, listed statutory consultees and those 
with an interest in the land on which the proposed Project will be built and operated or who may be particularly affected by it 
2 Section 48 sets out publicity requirements on a national basis 
 
 
July 2014                                                  4 
 
Bedfordshire, whilst part of the proposed access route, subject to consultation, 
environmental and technical studies, resides within the administrative area of 
Bedford Borough Council. 
 
 
 
 
3.0 THE PROJECT 
 
The Project would comprise: 
 A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by natural gas and 
with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW) 
comprising: 
o The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine Generators and 
balance of plant, which are located within the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
o A new purpose built Access Road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site; and 
o During construction a temporary construction compound (the Laydown 
Area). 
 A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from 
the National Transmission System (NTS) which is located within the Gas 
Connection Opportunity Area; and 
 A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to 
the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) for distribution to 
homes and businesses which is located within the Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Area. 
 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as 
the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power Generation Plant Site. 
 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, are all 
integral to the generation of electricity and together are referred to as the ‘Project’. The 
 
 
July 2014                                                  5 
 
land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order 
to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  
 
4.0 CONSULTATION BACKGROUND 
 
a. MPL is committed to open and responsive consultation with local communities and 
interested parties.  The programme recommended within this document sets out a 
framework for a formal and inclusive consultation process.  
 
b. The draft SoCC appended to this document is designed to meet the legal 
requirements set out in section 47 of the Planning Act 2008 and follows a range of 
advice and guidance set out by the Planning Inspectorate and the Department for 
Communities & Local Government.  The consultation process is designed to 
enable informed, detailed and two-way communication. Through this process, 
relevant matters identified during consultation will be taken into account during the 
development of the proposal and before submission of the application for a DCO. 
 
c. Since May 2014, MPL has proactively communicated its intentions with elected 
representatives and directly within the local community, in order to introduce and 
discuss aspects of the Project.  These non-statutory information activities and other 
forthcoming initiatives will also be captured in the Consultation Report. On the 5th, 
6th and 7th of June a series of non-statutory public exhibitions were held in the 
villages of Lidlington, Marston Moretaine and Stewartby. The choice of location for 
these and future events was decided upon after initial consultation with members 
of CBC and BBC. 
 
 
4.1 CONSULTATION AREAS 
 
a. MPL proposes to carry out its consultation in two areas: a core consultation zone 
(CCZ) that equates to an approximate 5 km radius from the site of the Power 
Generation Plant (see map overleaf), and an outer consultation zone (OCZ) that 
equates to a radius of 10 km.  The CCZ is defined by parish council boundaries 
closest to the 5 km radius. These consultation zones were chosen following 
 
 
July 2014                                                  6 
 
feedback from various elected representatives with whom MPL has been liaising 
and would be in accordance with those used by Covanta for the Rookery South 
Energy from Waste Generating Station, even though the impact of the Project is 
expected to be considerably less than that of the Covanta scheme.  
  
 
b. The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of 
the Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the 
Project’s construction and operation and expected to have the greatest interest in 
the Project. These include the villages of Stewartby, Marston Moretaine, Ampthill 
and Millbrook, as well as other settlements within the CCZ.  Whilst a 5 km buffer 
has been used as a guide, where settlements fall only partially within this area 
discretion has been exercised.  
 
 
 
 
Proposed CCZ – approx. 5 km radius from the Power Generation Plant 
Site

Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
 
c. Whilst the site is located directly within the CBC ward of Cranfield and Marston 
Moreteyne the following neighbouring wards also fall within the proposed CCZ: 
 
o Houghton Conquest and Haynes  
o Ampthill  
d) The proposed CCZ also includes wards within the neighbouring local authority - 
BBC. The following BBC wards fall within the CCZ: 
o Elstow and Stewartby  
o Wootton  
 
e) The CCZ would include all or parts of the following parish council areas: 
 
 
July 2014                                                  8

o 
Millbrook (CBC) 
o 
Ampthill (CBC) 
o 
Maulden (CBC) 
o 
Lidlington (CBC) 
o 
Stewartby (BBC) 
o 
Wootton  (BBC) 
 
    The CCZ will be MPL’s primary focus of activity when consulting about its plans.  
 
f) Communities in the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with parish councils and 
other relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and will have the opportunity to 
comment on the plans.  The OCZ includes the main population area of Bedford. 
MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the 
OCZ will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation 
although MPL recognises that they may be interested in it.  
 
g) Communities outside the OCZ will be informed about the Project as the circulation 
areas and reach of the media (TV, radio, printed media) that will be used to 
communicate details of the Project and the consultation activities are far greater 
than the boundaries of the OCZ. 
 
 
5.0 INTRODUCTORY 
INFORMATION 
PERIOD/NON-STATUTORY 
CONSULTATION 
 
As an introduction to the Project, MPL undertook an introductory information 
programme and non-statutory consultation exercise in May/June 2014. This included:  
 
a. Discussions with officers and councillors at CBC and BBC about our plans and 
proposed non-statutory consultation plans, including exhibition venues and 
organisations that should be invited. 
 
 
July 2014                                                  9 
 
 
b. As every home and business in the CCZ is represented by both a CBC councillor 
or a BBC councillor, and a Parish councillor, MPL communicated its plans (and 
information regarding the public exhibitions that were held between June 5th – 7th 
2014) to the CBC and BBC, as well as the local MP Nadine Dorries, and Richard 
Fuller MP (whose constituency partially falls within the CCZ).  MPL met Nadine 
Dorries MP on June 25th to discuss the Project and answer her questions. 
 
c. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a Project website was launched to 
coincide with the Project being introduced to the local community. The website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) provides information on the Project and enables 
people to ask questions and provide feedback to MPL about the Project.   
 
d. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a letter of introduction about the Project 
was sent to approximately 10,000 households and businesses within a 5 km radius 
of the site (i.e an area very closely aligned with the CCZ). The letter contained 
details about the Project and an invitation to attend information exhibitions near the 
Project site. The letter was sent and distributed by Royal Mail a week prior to the 
first exhibition date. 
 
e. As part of the non-statutory consultation, exhibitions were held at the following 
locations to give local people the maximum opportunity to attend:  
 
 
o Thursday, June 5th - Lidlington Village Hall (4.00pm till 7.30pm) 
o Friday, June 6th - Stewartby Village Hall (3.00pm till 7.00pm) 
o Saturday, June 7th - Marston Moreteyne Village Hall (10.00am till 1.00pm) 
 
f. 
Exhibition locations were chosen because they were considered convenient to 
those communities within the CCZ that surrounds the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site These events featured relevant information that was known at the time 
in a variety of formats (display panels, maps, plans, leaflet etc) about the proposal.  
Members of the MPL project team were available to discuss the proposal, answer 
questions and to receive feedback from members of the public. Feedback as to 
 
 
July 2014                                                  10 
 
whether MPL should do anything differently during the statutory consultation 
process was sought during the informal information period/non-statutory 
consultation about the Project. 
 
g. MPL used venues that met Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
upon a reasonable and timely request had provisions in place for those with 
special requirements who were unable to attend or access a consultation event 
(for example, private transport to the exhibition event).  
 
h. More than 250 people attended the exhibitions, including local councillors.  The 
local media (print, TV, radio and social media) published news reports about the 
exhibitions in advance of them being held as well as afterwards.  
 
i. 
MPL issued press releases before and after the exhibitions were held, and these 
were posted on the MPL website.  The press releases were issued to the local 
media including parish council newsletters, and news reports were published in 
the media as a result of receiving them from MPL.  
 
j. 
MPL advertised the informal information/non-statutory consultation exhibitions via 
a display advertisement in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper, published on 
June 1st2014.  
 
k. A leaflet about the Project was produced for people who attended the exhibition, 
and additional copies were provided to local councilors and others for wider 
dissemination. The leaflet contained details of the Project, the consultation 
process, an indicative timeframe for the Project’s development and the Millbrook 
Power website address and contact details.  In addition, a Feedback form was 
available for people to fill in on the day or to return via Freepost to MPL.  
 
l. 
Posters advertising the non-statutory consultation events were displayed on 
parish noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ, for example 
local libraries, local shops and post offices and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
 
 
July 2014                                                  11 
 
m. The MPL website carries the latest information about the project (technical, 
environmental and communications), contact details and a mechanism to enable 
people to ask questions and provide feedback.  The website address was provided 
to CBC, BBC and parish councils for inclusion on parish websites, newsletters and 
other local information material. 
 
n. MPL will consider the provision, upon request, of written materials about the 
Project in different formats (for example, large print or braille). 
 
o. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) were 
accepted following the launch of the non-statutory period of consultation.  
 
p. In summary, the Project has been introduced to the local community which is now 
broadly aware of the Project.  The proposed statutory consultation process detailed 
in section 6.0 will therefore build upon this awareness with a view to gaining formal 
feedback from local people and interested stakeholders before the application for 
the DCO is submitted in 2015. 
 
6.0 STATUTORY CONSULTATION METHODOLOGY & ACCESSIBILITY 
Following the introductory information period/non-statutory consultation described in 
section 5.0, the statutory consultation programme will be conducted according to the 
following methodology: 
 
a. MPL will consult with officers at CBC and BBC on the content of the draft SoCC. 
 
b. MPL will begin engagement with elected members of CBC, BBC, parish councils, 
the local MP Nadine Dorries and Richard Fuller MP whose constituency lies within 
the CCZ, as it develops its plans. 
 
c. MPL will use elected members of CBC, BBC and parish councils as communication 
channels, via meetings and correspondence, to share information and seek 
community feedback during the period of statutory consultation.   
 
d. Exhibitions/consultation events will be held at the following locations: 
 
 
July 2014                                                  12 
 
 
• 
Lidlington Village Hall  
• 
Stewartby Village Hall  
• 
Marston Moretaine Village Hall  
• 
Ampthill Masonic Centre, Ampthill 
After consideration of the outcomes of the non-statutory consultation process these 
venues are considered the most convenient to those communities within the CCZ 
that surround the proposed Power Generation Plant Site. These events will feature 
relevant information in a variety of formats (display panels, plans, leaflet etc) about 
the proposal and copies of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(PEIR) will be made available.  Members of the MPL project team will be available 
to discuss the proposal, answer questions and to receive feedback from members 
of the public. 
 
e. In order to ensure that people have the maximum opportunity to attend the 
exhibitions, MPL will arrange for them to be held at the above convenient locations 
and at a variety of times. An event will be held on a Saturday for those unable to 
visit during the working week. 
 
f. MPL will use venues that meet Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
upon a reasonable and timely request will make provision for those with special 
requirements who are unable to attend or access a consultation event (for 
example, private transport to a consultation event).  
 
g. In consultation with CBC and BBC, MPL will share information about the Project 
with those “hard to reach groups” living and working within the CCZ. These groups 
are likely to be accessed through informal and formal channels - via council 
services (for example, Central Bedfordshire Together, Bedford Borough 
Partnership, and others) and relevant specialist organisations (for example the 
Marston Moreteyne Action Group, local branches of the Women’s Institute, and 
local business representative groups such as the Bedfordshire Chamber of 
Commerce).   
 
 
 
July 2014                                                  13 
 
h. Posters in colleges, schools, youth clubs and awareness through social media may 
be used to reach the younger members of the community, whilst consideration will 
be given to presentations at local schools and colleges about the Project. Local 
schools and colleges will be notified of the consultation events. 
 
i. MPL will advertise the consultation events via local and regional newspapers 
(Bedfordshire on Sunday, Bedford Borough Times & Citizen), for two weeks prior 
to the first event taking place.  In addition MPL will announce via the issue of one 
or more press releases to parish, local and regional news publications, the local 
radio and TV stations (and via online media) that the events are taking place.  The 
newspaper advertisements (and media coverage), will reach the CCZ, the OCZ 
and further afield. The content will give information on MPL’s proposals and details 
of the consultation events, including contact information.   
 
j. A leaflet or letter about the Project and the consultation programme will be 
distributed to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ some two weeks 
in advance of the first consultation event, informing them of the consultation events 
taking place. The leaflet will include details of the Project, the location and dates of 
the consultation events, the MPL website address, and a comments/questions card 
that can be returned Freepost.    
 
k. Posters advertising the consultation events will be displayed on parish 
noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ and the OCZ, for 
example local libraries, local shops and post offices, local schools and colleges 
and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
l. MPL will inform those parish councils within the OCZ about the Project and the 
exhibition/consultation event via email. 
 
m. The MPL team will proactively and reactively meet with individuals and interested 
groups in the local area as part of the formal consultation period to answer 
questions and provide updates about the Project.  
 
 
 
July 2014                                                  14 
 
n. The MPL website will carry the latest information about the Project (technical, 
environmental and communications), contact details and a mechanism to enable 
people to ask questions and provide feedback.  The website address has 
previously been provided to CBC, BBC and parish councils for inclusion on parish 
websites, newsletters and in other local information material. 
 
o. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) will be 
considered and addressed where possible, as well as comments noted.  The 
statutory consultation will last for a period of 35 days . Relevant responses will be 
collated, had regard to and referred to in the Consultation Report that will 
accompany the DCO application.   
 
p. MPL may choose to undertake additional consultation and information activities. In 
addition, MPL will consider the provision, upon request, of written materials about 
the Project in different formats (for example, large print or braille). 
 
q. Statutory and non-statutory consultation activities and efforts will be detailed in the 
Consultation Report which will accompany the DCO application. This will detail the 
consultation activities, the feedback received and MPL’s response to the issues 
that are raised during the process.

May 2017                                                               1 
 
This Statement of Community Consultation ("SoCC") is published in connection with 
a proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power station, its associated gas and electrical 
connections and other related infrastructure at Rookery South Pit situated in the 
Marston Vale, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill and 7 km south-west of Bedford 
in Central Bedfordshire (the "Project").   
 
The capacity of the gas-fired power station will be in excess of 50 MW. As such, it is 
classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under the Planning 
Act 2008. The Project therefore requires a Development Consent Order ("DCO") in 
order for it to be built. Any DCO would be made by the Secretary of State for Business, 
Energy & Industrial Strategy. 
 
The Project was initially taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application 
process in 2014. However, in March 2015, the project was put on hold due to market 
and political uncertainty. Under new ownership (see below) the Project is now once 
again being taken forward.   
 
This SoCC is part of a consultation process, required by the Planning Act 2008. This 
SoCC explains how Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL”), the promoter of the Project, 
proposes to consult people living in the vicinity of the Project, businesses and other 
organisations about the Project, in advance of submitting an application for a DCO for 
the Project before the end of 2017.   
 
MPL carried out both statutory and non-statutory consultation as part of its work in 
2014. As part of the 2014 statutory consultation, a SoCC was published after having 
been consulted on with the local planning authorities and this SoCC is closely 
modelled on the 2014 SoCC. MPL have had regard to the responses received as part 
of the 2014 non-statutory and statutory consultation and these have influenced the 
further iteration of the Project design that is now being consulted on in 2017. 
 
MPL has consulted Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedfordshire Borough Council, 
as the local planning authorities, about the content of this Statement of Community 
Consultation and has had regard to their responses.

As noted above, a consultation/communication plan was published in 2014 and this 
plan has been updated and revised. Both documents are available from MPL or via its 
website www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
MPL is a company owned by Drax Group plc ("Drax") (acquired in December 2016). 
Drax is seeking to develop gas fired power stations at Rookery South Pit and 
elsewhere in the UK to support the Government’s drive to a low carbon economy and 
its gas generation strategy. 
 
This SoCC explains: 
 key details about the Project; 
 how MPL is publishing preliminary environmental information about the Project; 
 how MPL is going to consult local people and communities about the Project and 
what activities will be undertaken to give them access to information about the 
proposal and help them to understand what particular aspects of the proposal may 
mean to them, enabling them to provide informed feedback; 
 how people can become involved in shaping the Project before a DCO application 
is submitted by putting forward their views to influence the Project; and 
 how people can provide feedback to MPL from consultation activities and ensure 
that they are informed about the Project.  
 
The Project 
The key details of the proposed Project are: 
 the construction of a Power Generation Plant with a rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 MW of electricity. The plant will have one stack, of up to 35 m 
in height. It will include a new purpose built access road which will either be from 
Green Lane to the site of the generating element of the Project, or will connect from 
the site of the generating element of the Project to an access road constructed for 
the Rookery South Resource Recovery project from Green Lane into Rookery 
South Pit;  
 the site for the Generating Equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha;  
 
 
May 2017                                                               3 
 
 the Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas. As such, fuel 
for the Power Generation Plant will be provided by an underground pipeline 
connection and will not be delivered by road to the site; 
 it will include the construction of a new electrical connection (including up to 500 m 
of underground cable) to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System and the 
construction of a new underground pipeline (up to 1.82 km in length) to bring 
natural gas to the Power Generating Plant from the National Transmission System;  
 it will create approximately 150 jobs during a construction period lasting two years 
and create up to 15 permanent jobs once commercial operations have begun;    
 it responds to the Government’s need for new gas generation in order to underpin 
the country’s energy security and its transition to a low-carbon economy; and 
 the station would emit about 50% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than an equivalent 
sized coal-fired power plant, and is designed to operate flexibly so that it can 
respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variation in customer demand and 
intermittent output from wind power generation. 
 
It is acknowledged that during construction and operation there is potential for negative 
impacts on some local communities and the environment, for example noise from the 
operation of the Power Generation Plant, the visual impact of the stack and impacts 
on the local and regional transport network as a result of construction traffic. An 
Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") is being undertaken; the EIA helps to 
understand and seeks to reduce the potential effects of the Project’s construction and 
operation. An Environmental Statement will be submitted as part of the application for 
a DCO for the Project. More information on this process is provided below. The EIA 
process is also considering the potential positive effects of the operation of the Project. 
 
The Planning Process 
DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning Inspectorate which will 
process and examine the application before making a recommendation on that 
application to the relevant Secretary of State. The final decision on the application is 
made by the Secretary of State and if it is successful, a DCO will be made.  
 
 
 
May 2017                                                               4 
 
The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the 
relevant Energy NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Networks Infrastructure) and EN-5 (Electricity 
Networks Infrastructure).  EN-1 states that "gas will continue to play an important role 
in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of 
low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply."   
 
When determining a DCO application, the Secretary of State must have regard to the 
relevant NPSs and must make a decision in accordance with these unless other 
considerations apply, including where she/he is satisfied that the adverse impact of a 
proposed development would outweigh its benefits.  
  
When considering whether to accept an application for examination, the Planning 
Inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has undertaken effective pre-
application consultation.  Pre-application consultation is essential in allowing MPL to 
understand and minimise the impacts of the Project and to allow a thorough 
examination by the Planning Inspectorate. MPL is required to submit a Consultation 
Report with its application for a DCO.  This report will include details of the local 
community feedback received (both in 2014 and in 2017), explain how MPL has had 
regard to relevant feedback and will detail how MPL has complied with the consultation 
requirements of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
The community consultation described in this statement is carried out under Section 
47 of the Planning Act 2008. It is in addition to consultation that will be carried out with 
specific statutory consultees (such as nature conservation bodies) and those with 
relevant interests in land (including owners and occupiers within the Project boundary) 
under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. It is also in addition to wider notification of 
the Project under Section 48 of the Planning Act 2008.

Environmental Information & Impacts 
The Project will be designed and developed to meet or exceed current quality, safety 
and environmental standards and efforts will be made to minimise its impact on the 
local environment, both during its construction and its operation.  The extent and scale 
of the development and MPL’s proposals to mitigate its impacts will be consulted upon 
locally and will be amongst the issues considered by the Planning Inspectorate on 
behalf of the Secretary of State. 
 
Because of the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an EIA pursuant to 
the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 
2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of 
State under the EIA Regulations 2009 before the commencement of the EIA 
Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements 
at Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue 
to apply to the Project. 
The EIA considers the likely significant environmental effects of the Project including 
those on air and water quality, noise, visual and landscape, traffic, local ecology, 
archaeology and heritage, socio-economics and cumulative impacts of the Project 
considered together with other development.   
 
MPL has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the scope of the EIA, 
including local authorities, the Environment Agency, Highways England, Natural 
England and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate on June 20th 2014, accompanied by a Scoping Report. The 
Scoping Report outlined which environmental topics would be covered by the EIA and 
how the assessments would be undertaken. The Planning Inspectorate issued its 
formal Scoping Opinion on July 28th 2014.  
 
 
 
May 2017                                                               6

(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) and via the dedicated section on the Planning 
Inspectorate’s website:  
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/eastern/millbrook-power/ 
 
As part of the pre-application consultation materials on the proposed Project, MPL will 
publish a Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") and a non-technical 
summary ("NTS") of the same.  The PEIR presents the information gathered to date 
and provides the results of MPL’s preliminary assessments as to the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project.   It does not set out the final findings but will 
include information on provisional mitigation measures.  During consultation, MPL will 
make available details on landscaping proposals and other measures to mitigate the 
Project’s impact.  MPL will provide copies of the PEIR and the NTS to Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities. 
Both documents will also be made available at: the main office of Central Bedfordshire 
Council in Chicksands, Shefford; at Bedford Borough Council’s Customer Service 
Centre in Bedford; at the Marston Vale Forest Centre; local libraries; at public 
exhibitions and on the MPL website. Technical appendices to the PEIR will be 
available in electronic form only at the council offices, libraries and Forest Centre but 
printed copies will be available to view at the exhibitions details of which are given 
below. 
 
When the EIA process is complete and MPL submits its application for a DCO, it will 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement. This will report on the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project identified in the EIA and will explain the 
mitigation measures to avoid or reduce these.  
 
Public Consultation 
The views of the local community about the Project are important.  In June 2014, MPL 
carried out a non-statutory consultation process sharing its initial plans with the public 
at three exhibitions held in the local area. In October/November 2014, a 35 day period 
of statutory public consultation was carried out, with four public exhibitions held in the 
local area – at Marston Moretaine, Stewartby, Lidlington and Ampthill. During 2014, 
 
 
May 2017                                                               7 
 
MPL received and responded to comments on the proposed Project and its impact on 
the environment, local communities and the local economy.    
 
a. What are we now consulting on and when? 
In March 2015, MPL chose to put on hold its plans for the Project and notified 
interested parties by letter and information posted on the Project website that this was 
the case. Under the ownership of Drax, MPL now wishes to resume the DCO 
application process for the Project.  Accordingly, and given MPL’s open and engaged 
approach to consultation in 2014, MPL wishes to commence a second phase of 
statutory consultation commencing on 29th May 2017 (and finishing on 2nd July 2017), 
seeking views on the overall scope and impact of the Project, including the associated 
electrical connection and gas connection. Only after MPL has had regard to the 
consultation responses received will the application for a DCO for the Project be 
finalised and submitted.  
 
Responses will, in particular, be invited on: 
 
• The Project, as currently proposed, including changes since the 2014 
consultation; 
• The layout of the Generating Equipment within the Generating Equipment Site; 
• Proposed amendments to The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011; and 
• The findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project during construction and operation, as set 
out in the PEIR. 
The consultation explained in this Statement will run for 35 days ending on 2nd July 
2017. Comments about the project must be received by MPL by this date.   
 
b. Who will we consult with? 
The Planning Act 2008 states that those ‘living in the vicinity of the land’ should be 
consulted.  We have discussed the scope of our consultation with Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council as the local planning authorities, and have 
 
 
May 2017                                                               8 
 
identified and agreed the Consultation Zones that form the basis of our community 
consultation.  
 
MPL will carry out its community consultation activities in two areas: a Core 
Consultation Zone (CCZ) that equates to a 5 km radius from the Power Generation 
Plant Site (Figure 1) and an Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ) that equates to a radius 
of 10 km (Figure 2). These consultation zones were chosen following feedback from 
local elected representatives and are the same as those used by MPL during 2014. 
 
The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of the 
Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the Project and 
expected to have the greatest interest in the Project   The zone includes all or parts of 
the following parish council areas: Marston Moreteyne, Millbrook, Houghton Conquest, 
Ampthill, Maulden, Lidlington, Stewartby and Wootton. An information leaflet will be 
sent to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ and the CCZ will be the 
focus of public exhibitions (see below).

Figure 2 - Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
Communities within the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with parish councils and other 
relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and given the opportunity to comment on our 
plans for the Project.  The outer zone includes the main population area of Bedford.   
 
MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the OCZ 
will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation although MPL 
recognises that those living and working within the OCZ may be interested in the 
Project.  Outside the two zones, there may well be others interested in MPL’s plans. 
These people will also be reached through local/regional newspaper advertising and 
media coverage (print, broadcast and social media). Feedback that is received within 
the consultation period will be considered by MPL as it finalises its proposals for the 
Project.

c.  How will we consult?  
MPL will seek and receive people’s views through a number of activities: 
 Public exhibitions will be held at Lidlington, Marston Moretaine, Stewartby and 
Ampthill within the CCZ (see the table below for locations and dates of the public 
exhibitions);  
 An information leaflet will be sent to households, businesses and institutions in the 
CCZ, and made available at local council offices, local libraries and other civic 
community venues in the area. The leaflet will also be sent to those groups that 
are defined as “hard to reach” (such as the Community Engagement Network, the 
Older People’s Reference Group and the Youth Parliament). It will give background 
on the Project, the consultation process and how individuals can engage in the 
consultation.  The leaflet will be made available at libraries and council offices in 
the OCZ; 
 Copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, a Consultation Document that will explain the 
Project as well as the proposed amendments to the Rookery South (Resource

MILLBROOK POWER PROJECT 
 
S47 LOCAL COMMUNITY CONSULTATION PLAN, 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”) proposes to develop a gas-fired power generation 
plant and connections to the electricity and gas networks on land located in Rookery 
South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Lidlington, Millbrook and Marston Moretaine 
in Bedfordshire (the "Project"). 
 
The proposed power generation plant would have a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW of electricity. Using the latest and most efficient power generating technology, it 
would burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
Due to its size, the gas-fired power generation plant would be a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project and as such it would require a Development Consent Order 
("DCO").  
 
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  
The community consultation described is carried out under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008; the Act sets out requirements for formal pre-application consultation for 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects before they are submitted to the relevant 
Secretary of State for examination and determination.   
 
Section 47(1) of the Planning Act 2008 states that the applicant must prepare a 
statement setting out how it proposes to consult those people, who are living in the 
vicinity of all or part of the land to which the proposed application relates, about the 
proposed application. 
  
Furthermore, MPL is required to consult Central Bedfordshire Council ("CBC") and 
Bedford Borough Council ("BBC") on its proposed Statement of Community 
Consultation ("SoCC").  Once MPL has finalised its SoCC, it is required to make the 
same available to the public in a way that is reasonably convenient and must also 
publish a notice in the local press as to where and when the SoCC can be inspected. 
This plan sets out how MPL intends to meet these s47 consultation requirements. This 
plan is not itself required pursuant to the Planning Act 2008.  
 
2014 CONSULTATION 
MPL first announced its proposals for its power generation project in May 2014 and 
conducted its consultation activities in two phases:  an initial phase of consultation 
between May and September 2014 that included mailing of an introductory leaflet to 
c10,500 homes and businesses in the area surrounding the site, public exhibitions at 
three locations in the vicinity of the site (Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston Moretaine), 
meetings with CBC and BBC councillors as well as meetings with those parish councils 
that were within the project’s Core Consultation Zone ("CCZ").  MPL also shared its 
plans to the wider community via Parish Councils further afield, the two local 
constituency MPs, via social media and the internet, newspaper advertising and 
articles/broadcast reports, and via organisations that were a conduit to “hard to reach 
 
 
May 2017                                                  2 
 
groups” in the area.  Among the highlights of its work, MPL representatives addressed 
sixth form students at the Kimberley STEM College. 
 
Having agreed its Consultation Plan and Statement of Community Consultation with 
CBC and BBC, MPL conducted a period of statutory consultation between 13th 
October and 16th November 2014.  An information leaflet was distributed to homes 
and businesses in the CCZ, four public exhibitions were held at Stewartby, Lidlington, 
Marston Moretaine and Ampthill and there was once again local advertising and a 
series of media reports (print, TV, radio and social media). 
 
The choice of location for the exhibitions (in both phases of consultation) was decided 
upon following discussions with members of CBC and BBC. 
 
In addition, local councillors from CBC, BBC and eight parish councils attended an 
“outreach meeting” with the Planning Inspectorate which was organised and attended 
by MPL. 
 
The various consultation activities during 2014 helped inform the Project’s 
development and led to MPL’s decision to underground the electrical connection rather 
than connect the power generation plant to the National Grid via overhead lines and 
additional transmission towers. 
 
In March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and political uncertainty and 
both CBC and BBC were informed as were the parish councils and other interested 
parties in the area. However, MPL has recently re-started its work to secure 
development consent for the Project and as such has decided to conduct another 
phase of statutory consultation.  
 
1.0 PURPOSE 
a. This document explains how MPL once more intends to consult people living and 
working in the vicinity of the proposed up to 299 MW gas-fired power generation 
station, its associated gas and electrical connections and other related 
infrastructure on land located in and adjacent to Rookery South Pit. The land is 
situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, approximately 3 
km north of Ampthill, a local market town, and 7 km south west of Bedford in Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough. 
 
b. The Project’s infrastructure includes a new purpose built access road, an 
underground gas pipeline connection and a new electrical connection (including 
underground cables) that would facilitate the export of power to the National Grid 
for distribution to homes and businesses.

c. Since December 2016, MPL, the development company for the Project at Rookery 
South Pit, has been a subsidiary company of Drax Group plc.  Drax Group is 
seeking to develop flexible gas fired power generation assets at three further sites 
in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive towards a low carbon economy: 
one at Eye Airfield in Suffolk, one near Aberdare in south Wales and the third near 
Felindre, also in south Wales. 
 
d. Stag Energy provides the resources to MPL through a management services 
agreement with Drax Group. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company 
draws on a depth of experience with a team that has created and delivered over 
10,000 MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the 
globe, of which, 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
 
e. The details of the consultation methodology set out in this document aim to explain 
how MPL will satisfy the community consultation requirements for an application 
for a DCO under the Planning Act 2008 which, if granted, would enable the Project 
to be constructed and operated.  MPL intends to submit an application for a DCO 
which will be examined by one or more inspectors (known as an Examining 
Authority) who will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy & 
Industrial Strategy (SoS) through the Planning Inspectorate.   It should be noted 
that the application will be accompanied by an Environmental Statement as the 
development is considered to be an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") 
Development. A Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR"), reviewed 
and updated from 2014, will be produced and will describe, at a preliminary level, 
the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The PEIR will be 
published and made available for public scrutiny and consultation in May 2017.   
 
 
f. As part of the DCO application, MPL is required to produce a Consultation Report 
explaining how the three strands of consultation required under the Planning Act 
 
 
May 2017                                                  4 
 
2008 (s421, s47 and s482) have been complied with.  MPL intends that its 
Consultation Report will include an explanation of how the relevant local authorities 
were consulted about the content of the SoCC and what the local authorities’ 
comments were.  The Consultation Report will demonstrate that the local 
authorities were given sufficient time to provide comments, explain how MPL had 
regard to those comments and provide evidence that the SoCC was made 
available and notified in the correct manner.  
 
g. The Consultation Report will also explain what activities were undertaken (in 2014, 
2015 and in 2017) to enable consultation with the local community, how those 
consulted responded and how MPL had regard to representations received in the 
development of the Project and the DCO application, prior to its submission to the 
SoS.  
 
h. This document does not set out how MPL intends to undertake the other strands 
of statutory consultation required by Sections 42 and 48 of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
 
2.0 THE PROPOSED SITE 
 
a. The site for the proposed Generating Equipment (which comprises part of the 
Project including the gas turbine generator) is located on land located within 
Rookery South Pit, a former clay pit and designated as Rookery Clay Pits County 
Wildlife Site (CWS). The site is adjacent to the proposed Covanta Energy from 
Waste project, which has been consented but has not yet been constructed.  
 
a. The site is located mostly within the local authority administrative area of CBC and 
in part within the administrative area of BBC. The proposed routes of the electrical 
and gas connections would be located in farmland to the south of Rookery South 
Pit within Central Bedfordshire, whilst part of the proposed access route, subject to 
                                         
1 Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 requires consultation with certain local authorities, listed statutory consultees and those 
with an interest in the land on which the proposed Project will be built and operated or who may be particularly affected by it 
2 Section 48 sets out publicity requirements on a national basis 
 
 
May 2017                                                  5 
 
consultation, environmental and technical studies, resides within the administrative 
area of BBC. 
 
 
 
 
3.0 THE PROJECT 
 
The Project would comprise: 
 A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fueled by natural gas and 
with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW) 
comprising: 
o The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine Generators and 
balance of plant, which are located within the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
o A new purpose built Access Road from to the Generating Equipment 
Site; and 
o During construction, a temporary construction compound (the Laydown 
Area). 
 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site 
 A new underground Gas pipeline Connection to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS) which is 
located to the South of Rookery South Pit. The Gas Connection includes an 
underground pipeline of length approximately 1.8 km.; and 
 A new Electrical Connection (including underground cables) to export power 
from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission 
System (NETS) for distribution to homes and businesses and which is also 
located to the South of Rookery South Pit.  
 
 
 
 
May 2017                                                  6 
 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are together 
referred to as the ‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or 
which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred 
to as the ‘Project Site’.  
 
 
4.0 CONSULTATION BACKGROUND 
 
a. MPL is committed to and has demonstrated an open and responsive consultation 
with local communities and interested parties.  Taking note of the 2014 
Consultation, the programme recommended within this document sets out a 
framework for a formal and inclusive consultation process.  
 
b. The draft SoCC appended to this document is designed to meet the legal 
requirements set out in section 47 of the Planning Act 2008 and follows a range of 
advice and guidance set out by the Planning Inspectorate and the Department for 
Communities & Local Government, as well as previous dialogue about public 
consultation with CBC and BBC (and feedback from local people) in 2014.  The 
consultation process is designed to enable informed, detailed and two-way 
communication. Through this process, relevant matters identified during 
consultation will be taken into account during the development of the proposal and 
before submission of the application for a DCO. 
 
c. Between May 2014 and March 2015, MPL has proactively communicated its 
intentions with elected representatives and directly within the local community, in 
order to introduce and discuss aspects of the Project.  These non-statutory 
information activities, the 2014 period of statutory public consultation and  
forthcoming initiatives will be captured in the Consultation Report that will form part 
of the DCO application.  
 
 
4.1 CONSULTATION AREAS 
 
 
 
May 2017                                                  7 
 
a. MPL proposes to carry out its consultation in two areas: a core consultation zone 
("CCZ") that equates to an approximate 5 km radius from the site of the Power 
Generation Plant (see map overleaf), and an outer consultation zone ("OCZ") that 
equates to a radius of 10 km.  The CCZ is defined by parish council boundaries 
closest to the 5 km radius. These consultation zones were chosen in 2014 following 
feedback from various elected representatives with whom MPL had been liaising 
and was in accordance with those used by Covanta for the Rookery South Energy 
from Waste Generating Station, even though the impact of the Project is expected 
to be considerably less than that of the Covanta scheme.    
 
b. The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of 
the Power Generation Plant Site that have the potential to be impacted by the 
Project’s construction and operation and expected to have the greatest interest in 
the Project. These include the villages of Stewartby, Marston Moretaine and 
Millbrook and the town of Ampthill, as well as other settlements within the CCZ.  
Whilst a 5 km buffer has been used as a guide, where settlements fall only partially 
within this area, discretion has been exercised.  
 
Proposed CCZ – approx. 5 km radius from the Power Generation Plant 
Site

Proposed OCZ – 10 km radius from the Power Generation Plant Site 
 
c. Whilst the Project Site is located directly within the CBC ward of Cranfield and 
Marston Moreteyne the following neighbouring wards also fall within the proposed 
CCZ: 
 
o Houghton Conquest and Haynes  
o Ampthill  
d) The proposed CCZ also includes wards within the neighbouring local authority - 
BBC. The following BBC wards fall within the CCZ: 
o Elstow and Stewartby  
o Wootton  
 
e) The CCZ would include all or parts of the following parish council areas: 
o 
Marston Moreteyne (CBC)    
o 
Houghton Conquest (CBC) 
o 
Millbrook (CBC) 
 
 
May 2017                                                  9 
 
o 
Ampthill (CBC) 
o 
Maulden (CBC) 
o 
Lidlington (CBC) 
o 
Stewartby (BBC) 
o 
Wootton  (BBC) 
 
    The CCZ will be MPL’s primary focus of activity when consulting about its plans.  
 
f) As in 2014, communities in the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via 
newspaper advertisements, posters, media coverage and direct contact with parish 
councils and other relevant local organisations in the OCZ) and will have the 
opportunity to comment on the plans.  The OCZ includes the main population area 
of Bedford. MPL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie 
within the OCZ will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and 
operation although MPL recognises that they may be interested in it. In 2014, there 
was little interest or comment about the Project from elected representatives or from 
the general public within the OCZ.  
 
g) Communities outside the OCZ will be informed about the Project as the circulation 
areas and reach of the media (TV, radio, printed media) that will be used to 
communicate details of the Project and the consultation activities are far greater 
than the boundaries of the OCZ. 
 
 
5.0 2014 NON-STATUTORY AND STATUTORY CONSULTATION 
 
As an introduction to the Project, MPL undertook an introductory information 
programme and non-statutory consultation exercise in May/June 2014. This included:  
 
a. Discussions with officers and councillors at CBC and BBC about MPL's plans and 
proposed non-statutory consultation plans, including exhibition venues and 
organisations that should be invited. 
 
 
 
May 2017                                                  10 
 
b. As every home and business in the CCZ is represented by both a CBC councillor 
or a BBC councillor, and a Parish councillor, MPL communicated its plans (and 
information regarding the public exhibitions that were held between June 5th – 7th 
2014) to CBC and BBC, as well as the then MP Nadine Dorries for Mid-
Bedforshire, and Richard Fuller MP (whose constituency partially falls within the 
CCZ).  MPL met Nadine Dorries MP on two occasions to discuss the Project and 
answer her questions. 
 
c. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a Project website was launched to 
coincide with the Project being introduced to the local community. The website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) provides information on the Project and enables 
people to ask questions and provide feedback to MPL about the Project.   
 
d. As part of the non-statutory consultation, a letter of introduction about the Project 
was sent to approximately 10,000 households and businesses within an 
approximate 5 km radius of the Project Site (i.e an area very closely aligned with 
the CCZ). The letter contained details about the Project and an invitation to attend 
information exhibitions near the Project site. The letter was sent and distributed by 
Royal Mail a week prior to the first exhibition date. 
 
e. As part of the non-statutory consultation in 2014, exhibitions were held at the 
following locations to give local people the maximum opportunity to attend:  
 
o Thursday, June 5th - Lidlington Village Hall (4.00pm till 7.30pm) 
o Friday, June 6th - Stewartby Village Hall (3.00pm till 7.00pm) 
o Saturday, June 7th - Marston Moreteyne Village Hall (10.00am till 1.00pm) 
 
f. 
Exhibition locations were chosen because they were considered convenient to 
those communities within the CCZ that surrounds the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site. These events featured relevant information that was known at the time 
in a variety of formats (display panels, maps, plans, leaflet etc.) about the 
proposal.  Members of the MPL project team were available to discuss the 
proposal, answer questions and to receive feedback from members of the public. 
Feedback as to whether MPL should do anything differently during the statutory 
 
 
May 2017                                                  11 
 
consultation process that followed in October/November 2014 was sought during 
the informal information period/non-statutory consultation about the Project. 
 
g. MPL used venues that met Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
upon a reasonable and timely request had provisions in place for those with 
special requirements who were unable to attend or access a consultation event 
(for example, private transport to the exhibition event).  
 
h. More than 250 people attended the exhibitions, including local councillors.  The 
local media (print, TV, radio and social media) published news reports about the 
exhibitions in advance of them being held as well as afterwards.  
 
i. 
MPL issued press releases before and after the exhibitions were held, and these 
were posted on the MPL website.  The press releases were issued to the local 
media including parish council newsletters, and news reports were published in 
the media as a result of receiving them from MPL.  
 
j. 
MPL advertised the informal information/non-statutory consultation exhibitions via 
a display advertisement in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper, published on 
June 1st 2014.  
 
k. A leaflet about the Project was produced for people who attended the exhibition, 
and additional copies were provided to local councilors and others for wider 
dissemination. The leaflet contained details of the Project, the consultation 
process, an indicative timeframe for the Project’s development and the Millbrook 
Power website address and contact details.  In addition, a Feedback form was 
available for people to fill in on the day or to return via Freepost to MPL.  
 
l. 
Posters advertising the non-statutory consultation events were displayed on 
parish noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ, for example 
local libraries, local shops and post offices and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
m. Since May 2014, the MPL website has carried information about the Project 
(technical, environmental and communications), contact details and a mechanism 
 
 
May 2017                                                  12 
 
to enable people to ask questions and provide feedback.  The website address 
was provided to CBC, BBC and parish councils for inclusion on parish websites, 
newsletters and other local information material. 
 
n. MPL will once again consider the provision, upon request, of written materials 
about the Project in different formats (for example, large print or braille). 
 
o. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) were 
accepted during the periods of non-statutory and statutory consultation in 2014.  
 
 
6.0 2014 STATUTORY CONSULTATION METHODOLOGY & ACCESSIBILITY 
The period of statutory consultation was conducted between October 13th and 16th 
November 2014 (a 35 day period): 
 
a. MPL consulted officers at CBC and BBC on the content of the SoCC. 
 
b. MPL engaged with elected members of CBC, BBC, parish councils, the then local 
MP Nadine Dorries and Richard Fuller MP whose constituency lies within the CCZ. 
 
c. MPL used elected members of CBC, BBC and parish councils as communication 
channels, via meetings and correspondence, to share information and seek 
community feedback during the period of statutory consultation.   
 
d. Exhibitions/consultation events were held at the following locations: 
 
• 
Marston Moretaine Village Hall, 31st October (1500 to 1900hrs)  
• 
Stewartby Village Hall, 1st November (0900 to 1300hrs)  
• 
Ampthill Masonic Centre, Ampthill, 3rd November (1600 to 2000hrs) 
• 
Lidlington Village Hall, 4th November (1100 to 1500hrs)   
 
After consideration of the outcomes of the non-statutory consultation process these 
venues were considered the most convenient to those communities within the CCZ 
 
 
May 2017                                                  13 
 
that surround the proposed Power Generation Plant Site. These events featured 
relevant information in a variety of formats (display panels, plans, leaflet etc) about 
the proposal and copies of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(PEIR) were made available.  Members of the MPL project team were available to 
discuss the proposal, answer questions and to receive feedback from members of 
the public.  About 175 people attended the public exhibitions. 
 
e. In order to ensure that people had the maximum opportunity to attend the 
exhibitions, MPL arranged for them to be held at the above convenient locations 
and at a variety of times. An event was held on a Saturday (at Stewartby) for those 
unable to visit during the working week. 
 
f. MPL used venues that met Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and 
made provision for those with special requirements who were unable to attend or 
access a consultation event (for example, private transport to a consultation event).  
 
g. In consultation with CBC and BBC, MPL shared information about the Project with 
those “hard to reach groups” living and working within the CCZ. These groups were 
accessed through informal and formal channels - via council services (for example, 
Central Bedfordshire Together, Bedford Borough Partnership, and others) and 
relevant specialist organisations (for example the Marston Moreteyne Action 
Group, local branches of the Women’s Institute, and local business representative 
groups such as the Bedfordshire Chamber of Commerce).   
 
h. Social media was used to reach the younger members of the community, whilst 
MPL gave one presentation to a local college about the Project. Local schools and 
colleges were notified of the consultation events. 
 
i. MPL advertised the consultation events via local and regional newspapers 
(Bedfordshire on Sunday, Bedford Borough Times & Citizen), for two weeks prior 
to the first event taking place.  In addition MPL announced via the issue of press 
releases to parish, local and regional news publications, the local radio and TV 
stations (and via online media) that the events were taking place.  The newspaper 
 
 
May 2017                                                  14 
 
advertisements (and media coverage) reached the CCZ, the OCZ and further 
afield. The content gave information on MPL’s proposals and details of the 
consultation events, including contact information.   
 
j. A leaflet about the Project and the consultation programme was distributed to 
households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ some two weeks in advance 
of the first consultation event, informing them of the consultation events taking 
place. The leaflet included details of the Project, the location and dates of the 
consultation events, the MPL website address, and a comments/questions card 
that could be returned Freepost.    
 
k. Posters advertising the consultation events were displayed on parish noticeboards 
and other community venues within the CCZ and the OCZ, for example local 
libraries, local shops and post offices, local schools and colleges and doctors’ 
surgeries. 
 
l. MPL informed those parish councils within the OCZ about the Project and the 
exhibition/consultation event via email. 
 
m. The MPL team proactively and reactively met with individuals and interested 
groups in the local area as part of the formal consultation period to answer 
questions and provide updates about the Project.  
 
 
n. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post, email or fax) were 
considered and addressed where possible, as well as comments noted.  The 
statutory consultation lasted for a period of 35 days. Relevant responses during 
the 2014 Statutory Consultation have been filed, had regard to and will be referred 
to in the Consultation Report that will accompany the DCO application.   
 
 
7.0 2017 CONSULTATION 
 
 
 
May 2017                                                  15 
 
Taking note of the comments and feedback that were received about the Project 
during the 2014 consultations, MPL proposes a series of meetings with elected 
members of CBC and BBC, meetings with the parish councils that are located in the 
CCZ and the local MPs, followed by a single phase of public statutory consultation 
about the Project. This period of statutory consultation will follow similar lines to the 
consultation activities that were carried out in 2014 namely: 
 
a. MPL will use elected members of CBC, BBC and parish councils in the CCZ 
and OCZ as communication channels to share information and seek community 
feedback during the period of statutory consultation.   
 
b. Exhibitions/consultation events will be held between June 8th and June 13th at 
the following locations: 
 
Friday 9th June        
1500 -1930 
Marston Moretaine Village Hall, Bedford Road, 
Marston Moretaine, MK43 0LD 
Saturday 10th June

c. These events will feature relevant information in a variety of formats (display 
panels, plans, photomontages etc.) about the Project and copies of the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) will be made available.  
Members of the MPL Project team will be available to discuss the proposal, 
answer questions and to receive feedback from members of the public, 
 
d. In order to ensure that people have the maximum opportunity to attend the 
exhibitions, MPL will once again arrange for them to be held at the above 
convenient locations and at a variety of times. An event will be held on a 
Saturday for those unable to visit during the working week. 
 
e. The venues meet Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requirements and MPL will 
make provision for those with special requirements who are unable to attend or

access a consultation event (for example, private transport to a consultation 
event).  
 
f. MPL will again share information about the Project with those “hard to reach 
groups” living and working within the CCZ.  
 
g. Social media will again be used to reach the younger members of the 
community, whilst MPL will be willing to give presentations about the Project to 
local colleges and schools. Local schools and colleges will again be notified of 
the consultation events. 
 
h. MPL will advertise the consultation events via local and regional newspapers 
(Bedfordshire on Sunday, Bedford Borough Times & Citizen), for two weeks 
prior to the first event taking place.  In addition MPL will issue press releases to 
parish, local and regional news publications, the local radio and TV stations 
(and via online media) to give additional publicity to the events taking place.  
The newspaper advertisements (and media coverage) will reach the CCZ, the 
OCZ and further afield. The content will be key information on MPL’s proposals 
and details of the consultation events, including contact information.   
 
i. A leaflet about the Project and the consultation programme will be distributed 
to c13,000 households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ some two weeks 
in advance of the first consultation event, informing them of the consultation 
events taking place. The leaflet will include details of the Project, the location 
and dates of the consultation events, the MPL website address, and a 
comments/questions card that could be returned Freepost.    
 
j. Posters advertising the consultation events will be displayed on parish 
noticeboards and other community venues within the CCZ and the OCZ, for 
example local libraries, local shops and post offices, local schools and colleges 
and doctors’ surgeries. 
 
k. MPL will inform those parish councils within the OCZ about the Project and the 
exhibition/consultation events via email.

l. MPL will meet with individuals and interested groups in the local area as part of 
the formal consultation period to answer questions and provide updates about 
the Project.  
 
m. Comments and queries via telephone (as well as via post or email) will be 
considered and addressed where possible, as well as comments noted.  The 
2017 period of statutory consultation will last for a period of 35 days, and the 
outcomes (along with the outcomes of the 2014 Statutory Consultation) will be 
referred to in the Consultation Report that will accompany the DCO application.   
 
n. Copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, a Consultation Document that will explain the 
Project as well as the proposed amendments to the Rookery South (Resource 
Recovery Facility) Order 2011, the Preliminary Environmental Information 
Report3 (PEIR) and the Non-Technical Summary as well as other information 
about the Project will be available (in addition to the main council offices of 
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council’s Customer Service 
Centre) at Marston Vale Forest Centre, Marston Moretaine, MK43 0PR which

Community benefits:
A £200m project which represents a substantial investment in the area and 
would deliver significant economic benefits for a period of least 25 years: 
Millbrook Power will consult with the local authorities on ways to bring wider 
social and environmental benefits to the surrounding area.

Planning and Consultation:
Given its electrical output exceeds 50 MW, the project is classified as a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project and must therefore submit 
an application for a Development Consent Order. Once submitted, the 
application will be considered over a six month examination period by the 
Planning Inspectorate, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Energy and 
Climate Change. 
The local authorities will be a key consultee along with local parish councils 
and other local and national organisations.
Public consultation is an integral part of the planning process. Local residents, 
businesses and other local interest groups will be consulted before any 
applications are made and their views will help shape the final application.
Prior to submission of any application, there will be a two-stage consultation 
process: non-statutory consultation (Phase 1) followed by a period of 
statutory consultation (Phase 2).
An Environmental Scoping Report is being prepared to identify the scope of 
information required to complete the application for a Development Consent 
Order. It will be available on our website and on the Planning Inspectorate’s 
website.

Proposal to build a 
gas-fired power station
Millbrook Power
Millbrook Power Ltd (‘Millbrook Power’) proposes to develop a gas-fired power 
generation plant and connections to the electricity and gas networks on land located 
in Rookery South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston 
Moreteyne in Bedfordshire (the ‘Millbrook Power project’).
The proposed power generation plant would be capable of generating up to 299 
MW of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes at times of 
greatest demand. Using the latest and most efficient power generating technology, it 
will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. Due 
to its size, the Millbrook Power project would be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project and as such it would require a Development Consent Order (DCO).
Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power generation plant 
could commence operations in 2019/20. It would create approximately 150 jobs 
during construction, 15 full time skilled jobs once operating and contribute to the local 
economy during its 25 year lifetime.
Prior to submission of any DCO application for the Millbrook Power project, there will 
be a two-stage consultation process: non-statutory consultation (Phase 1) followed by 
a period of statutory consultation (Phase 2). This leaflet forms part of the Phase 1 non-
statutory consultation. Statutory consultation is expected to take place in the autumn 
of 2014 and will be advertised well in advance.
Millbrook Power anticipates submitting an application for the Millbrook Power project 
in Q1 2015. If accepted, the application would then be examined by the Planning 
Inspectorate over the course of 2015 with a decision from the Secretary of State likely 
to be issued in early to mid-2016.
in customer demand and the intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. The power generation plant will run no more than 1500 hrs per year.
Modern, gas-fired power generation plants are among the most efficient forms of 
electricity generation. They emit at least 50% less carbon dioxide than existing coal-
fired plants and can therefore make a significant contribution to the reduction of the 
UK’s carbon emissions.
Why Rookery South Pit?
We consider the site to be one of the very best in the UK. It has three key advantages:
1. Proximity to the national gas and electricity transmission networks 
2. Located in National Grid’s strategic area for new electricity generation 
3. Brownfield land allocated for development
Community benefits:
This £200m project would represent a substantial investment in the area and deliver 
significant economic benefits for a period of at least 25 years:
l Creation of approximately 150 jobs during a two year construction period
l  Creation of 15 permanent skilled jobs for on-going operation and maintenance of  
 
the facility 
l  Potential business opportunities for local suppliers and contractors 
Millbrook Power will be discussing how best to bring wider social and environmental 
benefits to the surrounding area with the local authority and other bodies.
Environment:
The Millbrook Power project will help ensure that the UK meets its low carbon emission 
targets and will be designed and constructed to high quality safety and environmental 
standards. Robust efforts will be made to minimise its impact on the local environment, 
both during its construction and operation.  Its design and the steps to mitigate its 
impacts will form a major part of the consultation and planning process. 
An Environmental Scoping Report has been prepared to identify the scope of information 
that Millbrook Power intends to include in the Environmental Impact Assessment for 
the Millbrook Power project. This document will be available on our website, as well as 
on the website of the Planning Inspectorate. 
A detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will be undertaken in accordance 
with legislation, statutory guidance and best practice and will form part of the 
application for development consent for the Millbrook Power project.
The EIA will consider a range of issues:
l air and water quality  
l emissions
l noise  
l landscape and visual impact
l transport 
l local ecology, archaeology and heritage
A preliminary environmental information report will also be published during the Phase 
2 statutory consultation.
Who is Millbrook Power?
Millbrook Power is an energy development company dedicated to the Millbrook Power 
project and is owned by Watt Power Ltd (www.wattpowerltd.co.uk). 
The development team at Watt Power has a long track record of developing successful 
energy infrastructure projects in the UK and overseas. The company aims to develop a 
portfolio of flexible gas-fired power stations in this country that can support the UK’s 
drive to a low carbon economy.  
Watt Power is taking forward two similar power projects elsewhere in the UK: one at 
Hirwaun near Aberdare in South Wales and the other near Eye in Suffolk. Both power 
projects (Hirwaun Power and Progress Power) have had their applications for a DCO 
accepted by the Planning Inspectorate and are entering an examination phase within 
the next few months.
Watt Power has a strong commitment to the environment, safety and the communities 
within which it operates. Millbrook Power wishes to work closely with local communities 
as its proposals for the Millbrook Power project evolve.
The Need For Gas Generation:
Gas is affordable, reliable and flexible and is acknowledged by the Government as 
being essential to the transition to a low-carbon economy and to retain the country’s 
energy security, as many coal and oil-fired power stations in the UK have closed or will 
do so over the next few years. Many ageing nuclear power stations will also close and 
whilst new nuclear stations are proposed, these are not expected to enter operation 
until after 2025.   
In addition, gas provides essential back-up to power generation from renewable 
sources, primarily wind power, which is increasing but intermittent. 
New gas-fired power generation plants, like the one proposed in Rookery South Pit, 
will underpin the UK’s energy security and help ensure there is no shortfall in the 
country’s generating capacity.
The proposed power generation plant will be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not 
“always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variations
Indicative drawing of Watt Power’s proposed project at Eye Airfield, Suffolk
Planning and Consultation:
The proposed power generation plant will require development consent approval under the 
Planning Act 2008. 
Given its electrical output exceeds 50 MW, the project is classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project and must therefore submit an application for a DCO. Once submitted, the 
application will be considered over a six month examination period by the Planning Inspectorate, 
on behalf of the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. The final decision on the 
application will be made by the Secretary of State, following a recommendation made by the 
Planning Inspectorate. The decision on the DCO application will therefore not be made by the 
local authority.  However, local authorities will be a key consultee in the consenting process 
along with local parish councils and other local and national organisations.
Public consultation is an integral part of the planning process. Local residents, businesses and 
other local interest groups will be consulted before a application for the Millbrook Power 
project is made and their views will help shape the final application for development consent.

Public exhibitions about a proposal to build a
gas-fired power station.
Dear Homeowner/Occupier,
I am writing to inform you that Millbrook Power Ltd is investigating the possibility of building a gas-fired 
power station on land known locally as Rookery South Pit. We plan to host public exhibitions about our 
initial plans at the following locations and dates:
Thursday, June 5th (4.00pm till 7.30pm): Lidlington Village Hall, High Street, 
Lidlington MK43 0RT
Friday, June 6th (3.00pm till 7.00pm): Stewartby Village Hall, Stewartby Way, 
Stewartby MK43 9LX
Saturday, June 7th (10.00am till 1.00pm): Marston Moreteyne Village Hall,  
Bedford Road, Marston Moreteyne MK43 0LD
The proposed gas-fired power station will have low emissions and, if permitted and built, would 
help strengthen and secure the UK’s energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that 
is generated from renewable sources (primarily wind and solar). The generating plant and its related 
energy infrastructure would be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not always running) and would produce 
electricity for no more than 1,500 hours per year. It would have the capacity to generate enough 
electricity to power 400,000 homes at times of greatest demand, and would create both skilled and 
unskilled jobs during its construction and operation. The Millbrook power project will contribute to the 
UK’s transition to a low carbon economy.
Millbrook Power is a development company solely focused on taking forward the project at Rookery 
South Pit. It is owned by Watt Power (www.wattpowerltd.co.uk). Neither Watt Power nor Millbrook 
Power has any connection with Covanta Energy, the developers of the proposed Rookery Resource 
Recovery Centre.
As part of our site assessment work, we have spoken with councillors and planning officers at Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council.  Preliminary planning, environmental and technical 
assessments are on-going.

At the forthcoming local exhibitions, we will share information about these studies and other aspects 
of the project, including the planning and statutory public consultation processes. Our project website 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk) provides some additional information. There will be a period of formal 
consultation including local exhibitions which will be held in the autumn.
The footprint of our proposed generation plant, sited on brownfield land allocated by Central Bedfordshire 
Council for development use, will be a third smaller in size than Covanta’s Energy from Waste project, 
which is permitted but not built. Our buildings and chimney stacks, if consented, would be far smaller 
than those at the Covanta project. Once up and running the project’s traffic requirements would be 
minimal.  
If you would like to know more about our project, please visit one of the exhibitions, where members of 
the Millbrook Power team will be on hand to answer any questions you may have. You can also contact 
us by phone or in writing, see details below.

Press Release - Friday, May 30th 2014  
Plans for gas-fired power station proposed in Central Bedfordshire 
 Public exhibitions to be held June 5th to June 7th 
  
Millbrook Power Ltd, a UK energy developer, today announces proposals to build a gas-fired 
power station on land known as Rookery South Pit, and which is located near the villages of 
Marston Moreteyne, Stewartby, Millbrook and Lidlington.  The proposed project will invest 
tens of millions of pounds into the local economy, support 150 jobs during construction and 
create 15 new full-time, skilled jobs when operational.    
 
Next week (June 5th - 6th - 7th), Millbrook Power will host exhibitions in surrounding villages 
to introduce its proposals to the local communities. 
 Thursday, June 5th   
Lidlington Village Hall, High Street, Lidlington, MK43 0RT

 Saturday, June 7th   
Marston Moreteyne Village Hall, Bedford Road, Marston Moreteyne, MK43 0LD 
10.00am till 1.00pm 
 
At the exhibitions, members of the Millbrook Power project team will explain how the 
proposals will be taken forward and how the public consultation process will evolve.  
Consultation with local communities and organisations, including Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council as well as the parish councils in the vicinity of the site, 
will be a part of the consenting process for the project, alongside the detailed 
environmental impact assessments and technical studies that will be undertaken over the 
coming months. 
 
People and local businesses in the area are being notified of the exhibitions by letter this 
week and via an advertisement in the local press.  Information about the project and 
Millbrook Power can also be viewed online via www.millbrookpower.co.uk 
 
Rookery South Pit is a brownfield site allocated for development by Central Bedfordshire 
Council.  The site was formerly a clay pit that was used for the nearby and now redundant 
Stewartby Brickworks. 
 
The proposed power generation plant will take gas from the nearby National Gas 
Transmission System and use it to produce electricity.  This electricity will feed into the 
National Grid, which also runs very close to the site. The power station will produce up to 
299 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to supply the equivalent of around 400,000 
homes, at times when demand is highest.   
 
It will have low emissions and, if permitted and built, would help strengthen and secure the 
UK’s energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from 
renewable sources (primarily wind and solar).  The Government has recognised that the 
type of power station being proposed will be essential to support the UK’s transition to a 
low carbon economy. The generating plant and its related energy infrastructure would be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not always running) and would produce electricity for no 
more than 1500 hours per year.  Once operational, there would be minimal traffic to and 
from the site. 
 
Chris McKerrow, Director at Millbrook Power said: “This will be an ultra-modern and clean 
facility and a very significant investment in the local economy.  The cost of the power 
project is in the region of £200m.  We will do our very best to ensure that our project will 
cause the minimum disturbance locally, both during its construction and its operation.  Its 
operation will be subject to stringent environmental and emission regulations.”   
 
Speaking about the forthcoming exhibitions, Chris McKerrow said: “The exhibitions are just 
the start of the information sharing and public consultation process that will help shape our 
plans.” 
 
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council have been briefed on the 
proposal, which given its size, is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project.  
It therefore means that Millbrook Power will submit an application for a Development 
Consent Order to the UK’s Planning Inspectorate, with a final decision to be taken by the 
Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change.  The local authorities and the local Parish 
Councils will be consultees in the consenting process.  
 
An application to the Planning Inspectorate is likely to be made by Millbrook Power in the 
first quarter of 2015, and subject to the outcomes of the consenting process as well as 
financing, the power project could commence operations in 2019/20.

CBC were updated on Watt Power Limited’s (WPL) progress with respect to the project. DL stated that the 
project would be dealt with by the major projects department rather than his own division. The Major 
projects team, which operates under Andrew Davie, currently has no manger due to planned absence.  
DL gave the name of the CBC Planning Department ecologist (Liz Anderson) and agreed that informal 
consultation with her on the scope of phase two species surveys would be beneficial.  
PT broadly explained the approach that WPL intend to take towards public consultation (statutory and non-
statutory). PT also explained that WPL would like to brief council members prior to the project going live at 
the submission of a scoping report (expected May 2014). DL agreed that this would be important and that 
CBC planners would want to be involved in the briefings. DL suggested that the best approach would be to 
arrange a meeting of key Council Members from the Development Management Committee. DL said that 
finding dates for such meeting could be tricky (at least three week lead time) and that another option 
would be to try to brief them at one of the monthly committee meetings. DL stated that parish councils 
would not normally expect to be briefed prior to such a project going live. 
CBC had mentioned at a previous meeting that they often enter into a planning performance agreement 
(PPA) for larger projects. It was acknowledged that this would be appropriate for this project and WPL 
agreed to provide the format of PPA that they have used previously with similar projects elsewhere for 
CBC’s review.         
Actions: 
DL to introduce the project to Liz Anderson and to let her know to expect WPL to be in touch 
DL to provide dates of upcoming committee meetings or other options for a meeting with key members. 
WPL to provide draft PPA 
WPL to provide schedule for scoping submission and non-statutory exhibitions. 
DL to give Andrew Davie a summary of meeting on his return

Summary 
CBC members and officers were briefed on the MPL project proposal by WPL. The main comments and 
concerns that arose from discussion were as follows; 
SC’s opinion was that a consultation zone of 3 km was not big enough and that WPL should be using the 
same zone as Covanta used (5 km). WPL explained that the proposed project is much smaller with 
considerably lesser impacts but SL’s opinion was that local people should decide if the impacts were 
smaller. SC suggested that there would be visual impacts from the town of Ampthill who should be 
included in the consultation. She suggested that Lidlington should be used as one of the exhibition venues. 
NY was interested in the economics of WPL's project and the capacity that it provides – its was asked if it is 
likely that would we end up running more than 1500 hrs per year – WPL explained that the environmental 
permit would limit run hours to 1500 per year and that the technology (SCGT) was not designed to run 
baseload. 
SC was concerned about the height and number of stacks and what type of plant was being used (i.e. CCGT 
vs SCGT). WPL explained that the DCO would be technology specific and that only SCGT plant were being 
considered. WPL explained that for scoping a stack height of 60 m from base of pit (i.e. 45 m above 
‘normal’ ground level) was assumed as a worst case scenario and that the height above ground level was 
expected to be more like 30-35 m as per WPL sister projects Hirwaun Power Limited and Progress Power 
Limited. The final stack heights would be confirmed after air quality modelling. 
SL confirmed that the brickwork stack heights were between 55 and 80 m 
SC suggested that it might be better in terms of visual impact if the project was located in the north of the 
pit where Covanta are and that WPL should consider waiting until their option expired. WPL explained that 
timing was critical due to the capacity auction and ‘capacity crunch’ that is expected at the end of this 
decade. Furthermore it was explained that because MPL’s transport needs are so small once operating that 
O and H were keen to locate us at the back of the pit and more importantly that, unlike Covanta, all of 
MPL’s connections are to the south.     
AB asked if we were aware of the EW rail plans (due to be operational by 2019) and the Milton Keynes to 
Bedford Canal – WPL stated that they were aware of EW rail but not the canal. This prompted AB to 
mention that as part of a s106 agreement Covanta has agreed to give £3mm to build two culverts that 
were necessary for the development of the canal.

Summary 
BBC members and officers were briefed on the MPL project proposal by WPL. The main comments and 
concerns that arose from discussion were as follows; 
TH suggested that Stewartby Power may be a better name given that so many more people live in 
Stewartby over Millbrook. Discussions followed in which WPL explained that Millbrook was chosen as the 
name for the Project, and not the name of any of the other nearby villages or towns, as it was the closest to 
the Project Site. 
AG was concerned about emissions saying that we should be aiming to improve air quality rather than 
doing anything that may make it worse. WPL explained that the design of the stacks would be such that 
there is no impact to human health from emissions from the plant.  
CR asked if there would be any gas storage on site and whether local gas distribution network would be 
affected by MPL’s gas offtake. WPL confirmed that there would be no gas storage on site and there would 
be no impact on the local gas distribution network due to the MPL Project.  
TH reminded WPL that local and national elections would be taking place soon after WPL’s proposed 
statutory consultation period 
 TH asked if we had given any thought to S106 provisions. WPL stated that these are being considered for 
sister Projects Progress Power Limited and Hirwaun Power Limited but that until the environmental impact 
assessment for MPL has been undertaken, suitable s106 provisions remained unknown.  
TH suggested that the STEM college near Stewartby might be interested in following the project through 
and using it as a case study for students. 
CR asked if CHP technology would be considered here as it was with Covanta. WPL explained that CHP was 
not compatible with SCGT peaking plant. 
TH asked about bringing bills down for residents who had high electricity bills. WPL explained that it was 
not an electricity supplier. 
PR asked about gas pressure – would the pressure of domestic users be affected when the Power 
Generation Plant was operating. WPL explained that this wouldn’t happen. 
In terms of environmental impacts CR was interested in light pollution, noise and water use. WPL stated 
that they would be able to provide information on this shortly. IJ asked about impacts on Heritage.  
The Council members all made it clear that they had been unimpressed with Covanta’s approach to 
consultation but they seemed reassured that the WPL approach would be different. TH suggested that WPL 
shouldn’t call the initial round of exhibitions ‘consultation’ in order that local people do not get the 
impression that this would be their only chance to have their say.

Re: 
 
Meeting with Nadine Dorries MP, constituency MP for Rookery South Pit 
================================================================================== 
MPL’s George Grant and TKC’s Paul Taylor met Nadine and her parliamentary assistant William Joce 
in the House of Commons on June 25th.  The meeting was arranged following MPL’s announcement 
that it was seeking to develop its power station project in Nadine’s constituency of Mid-
Bedfordshire.  MPL had written to Nadine when it first announced the project on May 30th and had 
offered to meet her. 
On May 30th, Nadine had posted a blog about the project:   
The new proposal to build a gas-fired power station in Rookery Pit will receive the same scrutiny and 
analysis as did Covanta and, quite possibly, the same opposition. 
The plans have not yet been submitted to Central Bedfordshire Council. The press release today is just 
an expression of intent and they haven’t yet held any of the public exhibitions. I will make sure that 
local people know about these exhibitions and can go along to investigate the plans for themselves. 
It is not for me to decide on planning matters as that is the responsibility of the council. But it is my 
responsibility to represent local people and if those affected by the plans ask me to oppose them then 
I will do so, with the same degree of vigorous opposition I have deployed in the past against Covanta, 
NIRAH, the shambolic Eco town proposal and every other inappropriate planning development 
suggested for the area - all of which ignored in a spectacular manner the needs, wishes or 
environmental considerations of local people. 
The purpose of the meeting at the House of Commons was to provide additional information on the 
project, inform her of the initial local reaction to the project and highlight the main issues that were 
raised at MPL’s public exhibitions in early June. 
Nadine told MPL that she recognised that there should be development on the site, noted that the 
scheme was very different to the Covanta project, would monitor local reaction and asked to be kept 
informed of the project’s progress.  Nadine specifically asked MPL about stack heights, emissions 
and the plant’s efficiency.

Note of Meeting and Site Visit with Centre Parcs 
01/08/14 13:30 Marston Vale Forest Centre 
Present; Raj Singh Dehal (Center Parcs), Nick Johnson (MPL), Paul Wormald (PBA) 
Background 
Centre Parcs have recently (2014) opened a new holiday park at Woburn Forest which is to the south of 
MPL’s Project Site and within the core consultation zone (CCZ). MPL had contacted Centre Parcs to discuss 
the implications of one another’s interests in the area.   
Summary 
After introductions had been made, NJ and PW briefly introduced the project with reference to the Scoping 
Report figures. RSD explained that his concerns were largely centred on visual impact from Woburn forest 
and the approach to it. He was also interested in the route that would be used by construction traffic. After 
discussion and a visit to the Southern end of the MPL Site around the existing 400 kV line, it was mutually 
agreed that neither visual impacts nor the impact of construction traffic would have any implications for 
Centre Parcs Woburn facility.  
RSD was grateful to MPL for the opportunity to discuss the Project and MPL agreed to send a copy (or link 
to) the PEIR directly to RSD once it is published. 
Whilst on site PW and NJ noted considerable noise being emitted from testing at Milbrook Vehicle Proving 
Ground.

Present; Will Fletcher (English Heritage), Nick Johnson (MPL), Paul Wormald (PBA) 
Background 
English Heritage have a remit to protect Grade I and II* Listed buildings and ancient monuments. MPL had 
contacted English Heritage to discuss potential implications in the area.   
Summary 
After introductions had been made, NJ and PW briefly introduced the project with reference to the Scoping 
Report figures.  
Will Fletcher explained that the nearby Stewartby Chimneys were listed and that his chief issue to be 
addressed was really visual impact due to their setting, in addition to this the vista from Houghton House 
was also a potential issue. Clearly the usual approach to assessing significance and harm would be taken. 
He was also keen to ensure that Ampthill Park and Garden were addressed. 
He was interested to know if photomontages would show development through time e.g. 1 year 5 year etc. 
WF was grateful to MPL for the opportunity to discuss the Project and MPL agreed to send a copy (or link 
to) the PEIR directly to WF once it is published.

Note of Meeting between Natural England (NE) and Millbrook Power (MPL)  
12/08/14 14:30 Norwich 
Present; John Jackson (NE), Nick Johnson (MPL), Chris Leach (PBA) 
Summary 
This meeting was requested by NE following receipt of the scoping report for the Millbrook Power Project 
(the Project). JJ stated that NE had no major concerns with the proposals but that he was keen to meet the 
MPL team to better understand the Project given that he has little experience of power generation 
projects. NJ and CL presented a set of slides fully describing the Project and it latest developments. Of 
particular interest to JJ were; 
 
The proximity of the nearest SAC or other European or nationally designated site which CL 
explained were beyond the limits within which impacts are usually considered. JJ thought that 
Beach Oakwood SAC was nearby and that MPL should make sure that there was no need to 
consider environmental impacts there.  
 
JJ was reassured that all of the work connected to the LLRS, in particular mitigation schemes 
requiring an environmental licence, had already been agreed with NE and other relevant 
authorities.  
 
JJ asked about AONBs, NJ and CL confirmed that the Chiltern Hills for the closest site to the Project 
and that this had been raised in the scoping repose and would therefore be further checked.     
 
JJ encouraged MPL to seek pre application advice for species licences if we need them

Introduction 
 
This meeting was arranged to scope the planning and highway authorities’ 
requirements for a transport assessment to support the Development Consent 
Order (DCO) application to be made by Millbrook Power Ltd. This meeting 
follows the issue of the DCO EIA Scoping Report in June 2014 to all relevant 
consultees.  
 
It is intended that this technical assessment process would progress together 
with the authorities to ensure that all matters arising be discussed and dealt 
with together in a mutually acceptable manner as the assessment work 
proceeds.    
 
Whilst there were no Network Rail (NR) representatives at this meeting, they 
had been invited. Copies of these Notes will be circulated to NR, the intention 
is that they be invited to future meetings.

Project Description and Historical / Background Planning Context 
 
The Project Applicant is Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL), an energy development 
company established for the Project by Watt Power Limited. 
 
As detailed in the EIA Scoping Report, and shown on the attached 
presentation and draft Figures 12.1 and 12.2 of the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) circulated to the attendees, the Project would 
comprise:  
 
i) 
a new Power Generation Plant, a gas fired peaking 299MW power 
generating station fuelled by natural gas. The Generation Plant would be 
accessed via a new purpose built access road from Green Lane, 
Stewartby; 
 
ii) 
a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System;

iii) 
a new Electrical Connection to export power from the Power Generation 
Plant to the National Grid Electricity Transmission system for distribution;  
 
iv) 
a temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site;  
 
v) 
a new purpose-built 1.7km access road constructed from Green Lane to 
the Generating Equipment; 
 
vi) 
the route of the access road would follow the existing track which borders 
the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery South Pit, the 
Access Road would descend the ramp to enter into the Pit, and cross 
through the Pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site along the 
alignment shown on Figure 12.1.   
 
The Generating Equipment within the Project would run during periods of high 
electricity demand to support the high-output “base” suppliers such as nuclear 
and coal-fired power stations, as well as to complement the output from 
renewable energy sources.  As such, this plant will not operate constantly - an 
environmental permit limited to 1,500 hours operation per year is being sought. 
 
There are a series of extant consents for Rookery South Pit that could be 
implemented concurrently with the Project:  
 
i) 
the “Low Level Restoration Scheme” to restore the Rookery South Pit, 
including drainage, landscaping, and earthworks to ensure the long-term 
stability of the area (this will be fundamentally completed before the MPL 
works commence); 
 
ii) 
Covanta has an extant DCO for an Energy from Waste (EfW) plant, with 
an annual throughput of 580,000t of refuse passing into the Site for 
incineration. The IPCC order was published in March 2013 – although 
there is currently some uncertainty as to delivery timetables for this 
though; and 
 
iii) 
an Integrated Waste Management Facility associated with this EfW – 
albeit this facility would be entirely dependent upon the EfW facility.  
 
The design of the Gas and Electrical Connection is on-going, hence the lack of 
certainty at this point and why the redline boundary in the EIA Scoping Report 
covers a significant area of land. In particular: 
 
i) 
the Gas Connection will consist of an Above Ground Installation (AGI) on 
the existing gas main, connecting the existing pipeline apparatus to the 
Generating Equipment; 
 
ii) 
a sub-station would be located adjacent the Generating Equipment Site 
within the Rookery South Pit - and will transform the Plant output to a 
voltage compatible with the National Grid network voltage.

Likely Vehicle Trip Generation 
 
An average vehicle trip generation estimate for the 18 month construction 
period has been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, based on observations at 
other similar facilities. This is attached. This would inform the traffic impact 
assessment on the surrounding highway network. 
 
It was agreed that a further sensitivity test would be provided, identifying the 
very occasional worst case daily construction trip generation – likely to be the 
casting of the concrete foundation for the facility. These sensitivity test flows 
would also be applied in demonstrating the impact of the proposals on the local 
network from this generation.  
 
During operation of the Generating Equipment - and unlike the earlier 
approved Covanta DCO - the trip generation would be minimal – it is likely to 
consist of a maximum 4 staff attending each shift.  
 
The Generating Equipment would be subject to periodical maintenance during 
operation, undertaken by a specialist maintenance contractor. The frequency 
of the maintenance operation would be determined by the number of hours the 
Project would be running, but is likely to occur no more frequently than 
annually. During this maintenance period, the numbers of vehicles accessing 
the site would increase. Further details will be provided within the TA.

Proposed Access Arrangements and Highway Authority requirements 
 
To the Generation Equipment area from Green Lane 
 
The Covanta DCO included for an approved ghost island priority junction to 
Green Lane.  If Covanta delivers this arrangement, it would have sufficient 
spare capacity to accommodate the MPL application trip generation without 
amendment.  
 
It was noted and acknowledged that this ghost island access arrangement was 
derived to accommodate a significantly higher daily operational trip generation 
than is being proposed by the MPL application, and is therefore considered to 
be excessive.   
 
In the event that Covanta did not deliver this ghost island priority junction, a 
more suitably scaled alternative for this application is being considered by 
MPL. 
 
A simple priority junction, possibly similar to the attached PBA drawing 
reference 31116/3010/003, is proposed as the site access. In capacity terms, 
this will be tested and reported with the peak hour sensitivity test construction 
movements as a worst case to demonstrate its suitability.  
 
The forward visibility from the north-east (i.e., from Stewartby) to the vehicles 
turning right into the site would be marginally below the desirable minimum 
stated within the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, albeit within the 
requirements stated within the Manual for Streets. CBC confirmed that they 
would accept this situation subject to the provision of traffic calming on Green 
Lane to control speeds and provide advance notice of the potential turning 
movements.

The proposed construction access route, and any further HGV movements 
during operation and maintenance, would be from the A421 dual carriageway, 
and from either the Marston Moretaine (A421 / Beancroft Road) junction to the 
south, or the A421 / Woburn Road junction to the north.  This is shown on the 
attached Figure 12.2, tabled at the meeting. 
 
It was noted that the STEM College development off Green Lane included a 
commitment to implement a quality footway along Green Lane. 
 
To the Gas Connection area  
 
Whilst subject to confirmation of the connection location, the temporary 
construction site access junctions would be likely to be formed at a suitable 
point on Millbrook Road. This is likely to consist of two accesses from either 
side of Millbrook Road. 
 
The number of deliveries to the Gas Connection area would be limited to the 
temporary site accommodation, the necessary plant and machinery, the AGI 
housing and apparatus, and the 200mm dia. gas pipes. 
 
Four temporary construction routes are being considered – these are also 
shown on Figure 12.2. The adopted route will respond to the existing local 
weight and height restrictions. 
 
Further details of the likely trip generation relating to the Gas Connection area 
will be provided in the TA. 
 
It is more likely that the connecting gas main would be the one located to the 
west of the Midland Main Rail Line – thus, no new under-rail connection would 
be required. Notwithstanding, a connection under Millbrook Road will be 
required. This could be implemented either by directional drilling, or by a cut-
and-cover trench. MPL to contact Martin Freeman, the CBC Watchman-in-
Chief for this area to confirm details, CBC to provide the contact details.  
 
To the Electrical Connection area 
 
Whilst subject to confirmation of the Sub Station and connection location, the 
temporary construction site access junction could be formed from one of: 
 
i) 
the Green Lane Site Access; 
 
ii) 
Station Road – from the west; or 
 
iii) 
a suitable point on Millbrook Road.  
 
Again, the number of deliveries to the Electrical Connection area would be 
limited to the temporary site accommodation, the necessary plant and 
machinery, the sub-station transformer housing and apparatus, the towers and 
the cables. 
 
The same temporary construction routes as are being proposed for the Gas 
Connection area are being considered for the Electrical Connection area. The 
adopted route will respond to the existing local weight and height restrictions. 
 
Further details of the likely trip generation relating to the Electrical Connection 
area will be provided in the TA.

Abnormal and Hazardous loads  
 
Abnormal loads will be required, the weight of these would be determined by 
the precise form of the Generating Equipment. These abnormal loads would be 
either several 80t loads, or a single 200t load. Further details will be provided 
within the DCO process. 
 
No Hazardous loads are anticipated.

Report Work 
 
As part of the DCO application submission, a series of documents detailing the 
transport assessment will be produced: 
 
i) 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report; 
 
ii) 
a Transport  Assessment;   
 
iii) 
a Route Management Strategy; and a  
 
iv) 
Travel Plan.  
 
The list of suggested contents was circulated – these are attached.  It was 
commented that: 
 
i) 
a Non-Technical Summary is required for all documents, especially the 
PEIR; 
 
ii) 
despite the operational flow of the MPL being very low, the Joint 
Authorities will require a Transport Assessment rather than a Transport 
Statement. This would include an assessment of the MPL impact, and a 
further Sensitivity Test assessing the MPL impact in the context of the 
Covanta proposal flows within the base line flows. It was acknowledged 
that the TA would be sought mainly for the Construction phase rather 
than for the Operational phase; 
 
iii) 
the TP is to consider both the Construction and Operational Phases.

this MPL application is within the Pre-Application stage, the timescale is 
dictated by the applicant needing to complete satisfactorily all elements 
of the application;  
 
ii) 
the PEIR will be submitted in late September / early October; 
 
iii) 
a formal consultation process will then commence, the assessment work 
would then include the comments from this public engagement process; 
 
iv) 
the final DCO submission  would be made to the Planning Inspectorate 
around January / February; 
 
v) 
once the submission is made, the application would then proceed 
through a statutory defined programme as summarised in Section 3 of 
these Notes;

Highways Agency comments: 
 
The HA confirmed that they did not anticipate there being significant impacts 
from the MPL application, but sought clarity that the application would not 
impact upon the strategic highway network.

assist HA, PBA is to forward the email received from the HA earlier. 
 
Bedford Borough Council comments 
 
BBC confirmed their issues had been addressed earlier within the meeting. 
 
Central Bedfordshire comments 
 
It was suggested that a mini-roundabout access option be considered at the 
Green Lane access. 
 
Luton Borough Council comments 
 
LBC commented that a Stewartby Chord railway link option considered was to 
align a new rail on the bund between the Rookery North and South Pits. NR 
has recently confirmed that work started in September 2014 to consider 
potential Eat-West Rail options, but was not due to report with their preferred 
options until 2016.  
 
The Covanta DCO consent approved an access route that would cross the 
potential rail link, this MPL scheme would use the same access. As such, it 
would be incumbent upon the promoter of the rail scheme to resolve any 
crossing issues should this rail option progress.   
 
LBC to circulate the indicative plans of the potential rail alignment from 
Network Rail.

Re: 
 
Briefing meetings with Parish Councils in the CCZ 
Following MPL’s publication of its PEIR document and in advance of the period of statutory 
consultation, MPL offered to meet each of the parish councils in the project’s Core Consultation 
Zone.  It would be an opportunity to highlight how the project had evolved in the preceding months, 
highlight key points from the PEIR and outline MPL’s plans to statutorily consult local people. 
Meetings were held with: 
Lidlington Parish Council

Wootton PC, Maulden PC and Millbrook Parish Meeting did not take up MPL’s offer of a meeting. 
The MPL representatives at the meetings (two at each meeting) were pooled from MPL’s Nick 
Johnson, Chris McKerrow and George Grant, Paul Wormald of PBA and Paul Taylor of Taylor Keogh 
Communications. 
MPL gave a slide presentation at each meeting, copies of which were given to the Parish Councils. 
The main issues raised by the parish councillors at the meetings were:  the scheme’s visual impact, 
emissions and transport/access.  Among the questions raised were the scheme’s fuel source, the 
plant’s efficiency, the turbine options and community benefits. 
The Parish Councils were happy with MPL’s plans for statutory consultation, and two councils 
(Houghton Conquest and Stewartby) offered MPL the opportunity to submit an article that could be 
published in their parish newsletters and/or websites.  This will be actioned by TKC’s Paul Taylor.

Summary 
WPL gave a brief update on the project with emphasis on the forthcoming consultation period. WPL 
explained how the Project Redline Boundary has been altered since publication of the scoping report 
including the additional provision into the perimeter of the Proving Ground. WPL explained that this 
was to allow National grid to erect a temporary tower to divert the existing line whilst the new 
connection for the Project was constructed. MH stated that security at their site was a top priority 
and that having workmen up pylons would not be tolerable. WPL explained that there may be an 
option to construct the diversion such that temporary conductors did not overhang the proving 
ground but that National Grid would still be carrying out work up their existing towers (for which 
they already have permission).   
WPL explained that the works would take approximately 3 months to complete but that work up the 
pylons close to their site would probably be limited to a small number of days at the beginning and 
end. All agreed that the next sensible course of action would be to produce an indicative schedule of 
works indicating the number of days when security might be threatened. WPL agreed to discuss this 
with National Grid. 
Overall this was an amicable meeting. All agreed that early engagement for forward planning were 
helpful.

1. O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-95 / O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-98 mentioned they did not think the LIQ and 
follow up with TQ was helpful enough. Too official initially and quick to ask for more info 
that had already been provided. 
2. WPL presented the suggested route designed by PB showing permanent easement location 
and working area.  
3. O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-95 / O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-98 feedback: no issue with Pipeline route but 
large area of good farmland severed and affected by the AGI location. Asked for this to be 
moved further south on their land alongside a track they also own so access would be better 
in their view. This would minimise the effect on farming operations. The AGI would be close 
to a house they own which is rented out but visual impact not bad because of existing local 
trees and further screening/ planting could be included.

Overall this was an amicable meeting as we were able to state these were early thoughts on the 
route and AGI and wanted to get their input to the process before it went further.

17th September 2014 
Present; George Grant & Nick Johnson (Watt Power Limited - WPL), members of Ampthill Town 
Council (ATC) Planning and Highways Committee 
Summary 
WPL introduced the project to the Town Council, then explained the high level preliminary findings 
of the EIA and finally discussed how the different strands of the forthcoming statutory consultation 
phase will be conducted. Specific areas of concern that the council member raised were; 
 
Construction Traffic WPL explained that no construction traffic would be going through 
Ampthill or any other residential areas and a Construction Management Plan would ensure 
that this is enforced. 
 
Emissions As per ATC’s scoping response air quality is a concern for them in particular regard 
to Cooper Hill SSSI. WPL explained that the fuel for the power station is the same as that 
burnt in our homes for cooking and heating and that concentrations of NOx are very low and 
SOx virtually non-existent, especially when considering the very low run hours. Council 
members were concerned about the problems with temperature inversions that were 
experienced with the brick works chimneys – how would our short stacks deal with that? 
WPL explained that very hot exhaust gasses make for high escape velocities hence the short 
stacks. 
 
Visual impact The Town Council are very concerned about visual impact from the 
Greensands Ridge and asked if there was any more info about the electrical connection. WPL 
explained that there were very aware of heritage assets such as Catharine’s Cross and 
Houghton House and had consulted English Heritage who were happy with WPL’s approach 
to assessment of the impact. WPL explained that photomontage images would be available 
for inspection at the forthcoming exhibitions including a viewpoint from Catharine’s Cross. 
WPL explained that it was still unknown what form the electrical connection would take and 
that it is largely in the hand of National Grid and therefore WPL have assumed the worst 
case of an overhead connection for the EIA.

Public consultation on plans for gas-fired 
power station at Rookery South Pit
Proposals to build a gas-fired power station on land at Rookery South Pit, near Marston Moreteyne, Stewartby, Millbrook 
and Lidlington, have been unveiled by Millbrook Power Ltd, a UK energy project developer.
The proposed project will invest tens of millions of pounds into the local economy, support 150 jobs during construction and create 15 
new full-time, skilled jobs when operational, says the developer.
Next week (June 5th - 6th - 7th), Millbrook Power will host exhibitions in surrounding villages to introduce its proposal to the local 
communities on June 5, 6 and 7.
These will be:
Thursday, June 5,at Lidlington Village Hall, 4pm until 7.30pm.
Friday, June 6 at Stewartby Village Hall, 3pm until 7pm.
Saturday, June 7, Marston Moreteyne Village Hall, 10am until 1pm.

Public consultation on plans for gas-fired power station at Rookery South Pit - Bedfor...
http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/news/local/public-consultation-on-plans-for-gas-fired-... 26/11/2014
At the exhibitions, members of the Millbrook Power project team will explain how the proposals will be taken forward and how the public 
consultation process will evolve. Consultation with local communities and organisations, including Central Bedfordshire Council and 
Bedford Borough Council as well as the parish councils in the vicinity of the site, will be a part of the consenting process for the project, 
alongside the detailed environmental impact assessments and technical studies that will be undertaken over the coming months.
People and local businesses in the area are being notified of the exhibitions by letter this week and via an advertisement in the local 
press. Information about the project and Millbrook Power can also be viewed online via www.millbrookpower.co.uk
Rookery South Pit is a brownfield site allocated for development by Central Bedfordshire Council. The site was formerly a clay pit that was 
used for the nearby and now redundant Stewartby Brickworks.
The proposed power generation plant will take gas from the nearby National Gas Transmission System and use it to produce 
. 
This electricity will feed into the National Grid, which also runs very close to the site. The power station will produce up to 299 megawatts 
(MW) of electricity, enough to supply the equivalent of around 400,000 homes, at times when demand is highest. 
The company says it will have low emissions and, if permitted and built, would help strengthen and secure the UK’s energy supply by 
providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from renewable sources (primarily wind and solar). The Government has 
recognised that the type of power station being proposed will be essential to support the UK’s transition to a low carbon economy. 
The generating plant and its related energy infrastructure would be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not always running) and would 
produce 
for no more than 1500 hours per year. Once operational, there would be minimal traffic to and from the site, they say.
Chris McKerrow, Director at Millbrook Power said: “This will be an ultra-modern and clean facility and a very significant investment in the 
local economy. The cost of the power project is in the region of £200m. We will do our very best to ensure that our project will cause the 
minimum disturbance locally, both during its construction and its operation. Its operation will be subject to stringent environmental and 
emission regulations.” 
Speaking about the forthcoming exhibitions, Mr McKerrow said: “The exhibitions are just the start of the information sharing and public 
consultation process that will help shape our plans.”
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council have been briefed on the proposal, which given its size, is classified as a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project. It therefore means that Millbrook Power will submit an application for a Development 
Consent Order to the UK’s Planning Inspectorate, with a final decision to be taken by the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change. 
The local authorities and the local Parish Councils will be consultees in the consenting process. 
An application to the Planning Inspectorate is likely to be made by Millbrook Power in the first quarter of 2015, and subject to the 
outcomes of the consenting process as well as financing, the power project could commence operations in 2019/20.

Gas power station plan for Stewartby incinerator site
A £200m gas-fired power station has been proposed for former industrial land in Bedfordshire where a planned 
incinerator was never built.
Millbrook Power Ltd said it was due to make a planning application in early 2015 for a new plant at Rookery Pit.
A proposed energy-from-waste facility was not built there after its American developers pulled out of the UK.
Rookery South Pit is a brownfield site near the villages of Marston Moretaine, Stewartby, Millbrook and Lidlington. 
The former clay pit, used for the nearby and now redundant Stewartby Brickworks, has been allocated for development by Central 
Bedfordshire Council.
'Minimum disturbance'
A Millbrook spokesman said the facility would use gas from the National Gas Transmission System to produce electricity.
It would provide back-up to renewable resources like wind and solar power and run no more than 1,500 hours per year.
Director Chris McKerrow said: "We will do our very best to ensure that our project will cause the minimum disturbance locally, 
both during its construction and its operation."
Consultations and exhibitions will be held before an application for a Development Consent Order will be made to the Planning 
Inspectorate.
A final decision will be made by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.
It could begin operating in 2019/20. 
Permission to develop an energy-from-waste incinerator on the site was granted to Covanta Energy by parliament in 2012 but 
not built after the US company put its UK interests up for sale.
Millbrook Power, which is owned by Watt Power, said neither had any connection with Covanta.

A SITE next to that previously earmarked for a highly controversial waste incinerator could now be
 turned into a gas-fired power station, it has emerged today, meaning the area could end up with
 both.
Millbrook Power Ltd, a UK energy project developer, has today announced its plan to build a power
 station at Rookery South Pit near Stewartby claiming it will invest tens of millions of pounds into the
 local economy, support 150 jobs during construction and create 15 new full-time, skilled jobs when
 operational.
This month the company will be holding public consultation exhibitions in the villages surrounding
Stewartby site next to one marked for Covanta's
 waste incinerator could now become a gas-fired
 power station

 the site (full details below).
Covanta Energy, which is not connected to Millbrook Power, were granted permission by a specially
 convened Parliamentary committee in 2012 to build an energy from waste incinerator at the
 Stewartby site but it has never come to fruition. Last year the firm announced it was seeking a
 buyer for its UK operations.
At the exhibitions, members of the Millbrook Power project team will explain how the proposals will
 be taken forward and how the public consultation process will evolve.
It is thought the proposed power generation plant will take gas from the nearby National Gas
 Transmission System and use it to produce electricity. This electricity will then feed into the
 National Grid, which also runs very close to the site. The power station will produce up to 299
 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to supply the equivalent of around 400,000 homes.
Chris McKerrow, Director at Millbrook Power, said: “This will be an ultra-modern and clean facility
 and a very significant investment in the local economy. The cost of the power project is in the
 region of £200m. We will do our very best to ensure that our project will cause the minimum
 disturbance locally, both during its construction and its operation. Its operation will be subject to
 stringent environmental and emission regulations.”
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council have both been informed of the
 proposal, which given its size, is classified as a 'nationally significant infrastructure project'. It
 therefore means that Millbrook Power will submit an application for a development consent order to
 the planning inspectorate, with a final decision to be taken by the Secretary of State for Energy &
 Climate Change.
The application to the planning inspectorate is likely to be made early next year, and if given the go
 ahead, could open in 2019/20.
MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, Nadine Dorries, who fiercely opposed Covanta’s incinerator previously,
 said: “The proposal to build a gas-fired power station in Rookery Pit will receive the same scrutiny
 and analysis as did Covanta and, quite possibly, the same opposition.
“The plans have not yet been submitted to Central Bedfordshire Council. The news today is just an
 expression of intent and they haven’t yet held any of the public exhibitions. I will make sure that
 local people know about these exhibitions and can go along to investigate the plans for themselves.
“It is not for me to decide on planning matters as that is the responsibility of the council. But it is my
 responsibility to represent local people and if those affected by the plans ask me to oppose them
 then I will do so, with the same degree of vigorous opposition I have deployed in the past against
 Covanta, NIRAH, the shambolic Eco town proposal and every other inappropriate planning
 development suggested for the area - all of which have ignored in a spectacular manner the needs,
 wishes or environmental considerations of local people.”

Gas power station plan for Stewartby 
incinerator site 
Category: England
Published: 30th May 2014 15:18:14 
A £200m gas-fired power station has been proposed 
for former industrial land in Bedfordshire where a 
planned incinerator was never built.
Millbrook Power Ltd said it was due to make a 
planning application in early 2015 for a new plant at 
Rookery Pit.
A proposed energy-from-waste facility was not built 
there after its American developers pulled out of the 
UK.

Rookery South Pit is a brownfield site near the villages of Marston Moretaine, Stewartby, 
Millbrook and Lidlington. 
The former clay pit, used for the nearby and now redundant Stewartby Brickworks, has been 
allocated for development by Central Bedfordshire Council.
A Millbrook spokesman said the facility would use gas from the National Gas Transmission System 
to produce electricity.
It would provide back-up to renewable resources like wind and solar power and run no more 
than 1,500 hours per year.
Director Chris McKerrow said: "We will do our very best to ensure that our project will cause the 
minimum disturbance locally, both during its construction and its operation."
Consultations and exhibitions will be held before an application for a Development Consent 
Order will be made to the Planning Inspectorate.
A final decision will be made by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.
It could begin operating in 2019/20. 
Permission to develop an energy-from-waste incinerator on the site was granted to Covanta 
Energy by parliament in 2012 but not built after the US company put its UK interests up for sale.
Millbrook Power, which is owned by Watt Power, said neither had any connection with Covanta.

Millbrook Power outlines plans for gas-fired plant, 
Bedfordshire
02 June, 2014
UK energy developer Millbrook Power has announced plans to build a 299MW gas-fired power station 
on land at Rookery South Pit, a brownfield site allocated for development by Central Bedfordshire 
Council. 
The proposed plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine peaking plant, designed to provide 
back up to intermittent energy generated from renewables. The plant would incorporate up to five gas 
turbine generators with up to five exhaust gas flue stacks and an access road from Green Lane, near 
Stewardby.
The plant will also require a new electrical connection to export electricity to the grid and a new gas 
pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the plant. The generating plant and its related energy 
infrastructure would be designed to operate flexibly and would produce electricity for no more than 
1,500 hours per year.
Chris McKerrow, Director, Millbrook Power, said: “This will be an ultra-modern and clean facility and a 
very significant investment in the local economy. The cost of the power project is in the region of £200 
million. Its operation will be subject to stringent environmental and emission regulations.”
An application to the Planning Inspectorate is expected to be submitted in the first quarter of 2015, and 
subject to the outcomes of the consenting process as well as financing, the power project could 
commence operations in 2019/20.

Article for Houghton Conquest Parish Newsletter 
In June of this year, Millbrook Power Ltd announced proposals to build a gas-fired power 
station on land at Rookery South Pit, which is situated about 3 miles to the south-west of 
Houghton Conquest and which is allocated for development by Central Bedfordshire 
Council.  Since then, a series of technical and environmental studies has been undertaken by 
Millbrook Power, and whilst these have not all been completed the company will share the 
results of its preliminary studies with the local community in October and November, and 
will be seeking people’s feedback.  
 
Millbrook Power is considering a range of issues, including the scheme’s visual impact, noise 
and air quality, its potential impact on the local ecology and transport. The company is 
liaising closely with Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Councils on all aspects of the 
proposal in order to minimise its impact during its construction and eventual operation if 
the scheme is given approval.  In light of comments received towards the project, since it 
was announced in June, some changes have already been made to the project, including a 
reduction in the height of the stack(s). 
 
The proposed power generation plant will take gas from the nearby underground National 
Gas Transmission System and use it to produce electricity.  This electricity will feed via a 
sub-station and connection into the National Grid, which runs very close to the site. The 
power station will produce up to 299 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply the 
equivalent of around 400,000 homes, at times when consumer and industrial demand is 
highest.  It will have low emissions and, if permitted and built, would help strengthen and 
secure the UK’s energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated 
from renewable sources (primarily wind and solar).   
 
Between October 13th and November 16th, Millbrook Power will be consulting people in the 
area about the project as well as Central Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Council and 
other interested organisations; this is a statutory requirement of the planning process for 
large-scale infrastructure projects in the UK.  It’s an opportunity for Houghton Conquest 
Parish Council, individual residents living in the village and the surrounding area, as well as 
other local parish councils and communities, to express their views and influence the final 
designs of the project before an application for a Development Consent Order is made by 
Millbrook Power to the Planning Inspectorate. 
 
Last month, members of the project team at Millbrook Power visited Houghton Conquest 
Parish Council to brief it on the status of project and the steps Millbrook Power will take to 
alert people to the consultation.  Exhibitions will be held on these days:

POWER STATION UPDATE – January 2015 (for publication on or around February 1st) 
 
Last year, Millbrook Power announced plans to construct a gas-fired power station on land 
within Rookery South Pit, south-west of Houghton Conquest. The power station site, which 
is allocated for development by Central Bedfordshire Council, is towards the southern end 
of the Pit, close to the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground. 
 
Over the past 8-10 months, we have shared our plans and how they have evolved with 
Houghton Conquest Parish Council, with other parish councils in the area, as well as with 
Bedford and Central Bedfordshire councillors. The views of your councillors have fed into 
our work.  We have also spoken with Nadine Dorries MP, in whose constituency our project 
lies.   
 
We have also sought the views of people living and working in the area to help inform our 
plans.   We have held two series of exhibitions about the project (in June and October 2014), 
and made available information about the project in a leaflet, at local libraries, council 
offices, the Marston Vale Forest Centre and via our website.  The local press has also 
reported on our project at various times.   
 
We are close to finalising our plans and thereafter our application will be submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate for examination.   We are likely to do this in within the next 6-8 
weeks, and if it is accepted, a detailed examination of our application by an independent 
inspector will commence in the summer. This is an open process where the local councils 
and the general public can register their views towards the project.  To follow this process, 
please visit: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/eastern/millbrook-power/  
 
Over the past few months, we have carried out a large number of technical and 
environmental studies to inform and guide our work.  A range of issues have been looked at, 
including the project’s visual impact, noise and air quality, its potential impact on the local 
ecology and transport. And we have consulted and met with a range of interests in addition 
to the local councils and local landowners: organisations such as the Environment Agency, 
English Heritage and Network Rail.  In November, we had the opportunity to speak about 
the project to “A Level” students at the Kimberley STEM Sixth Form College. 
 
Our studies and our consultations are leading us towards these key elements: 
o A reduction in the height of the stack(s) to no more than 35m from the base of the Pit; 
o Location of the generating equipment approximately 400 metres from the nearest 
dwelling, thereby reducing the noise impact; 
o A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the power station site; 
o An overhead electrical connection to the National Grid with between three and six 
additional transmission towers: we are looking to keep the number of towers to a 
minimum.  Our application will also likely include options for an underground cable 
connection;   
o An underground gas pipeline and above-ground connection equipment located next to 
an existing farm track thereby reducing their impact on local agriculture. 
 
In addition, we are in discussions with Central Bedfordshire Council to bring wider economic 
benefit to the local area, on top of the direct and indirect jobs that the £200m scheme will 
create during its construction and operation.   
 
We will provide another update when we submit our application, and will continue to 
engage with your parish council as well councillors at Bedford and Central Bedfordshire. In 
the meantime, if you have any questions about our project, please visit

Project Overview: the proposed power generation plant will take natural gas from the nearby underground 
National Gas Transmission System and use it to produce electricity.  This electricity will feed via a sub-station 
and connection into the National Grid, which runs close to the site. The power station will produce up to 299 
megawatts of electricity, enough to supply the equivalent of around 400,000 homes, at times when consumer 
and industrial demand is highest.  It will have low emissions and, if permitted and built, would help strengthen 
and secure the UK’s energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from 
renewable sources (primarily wind and solar).  A permit issued by the Environment Agency will limit the 
operation of the plant to no more than 1500 hours per year (17 % of the time). If permitted and financed, the 
project could enter operation in 2019/20.

POWER STATION UPDATE – January 2015 
 
Last year, Millbrook Power announced plans to construct a gas-fired power station on land 
within Rookery South Pit, south of Stewartby. The power station site, which is allocated for 
development by Central Bedfordshire Council, is towards the southern end of the Pit, close 
to the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground. 
 
Over the past 8-10 months, we have shared our plans and how they have evolved with 
Stewartby Parish Council, with other parish councils in the area, as well as with Bedford and 
Central Bedfordshire councillors. The views of your councillors have fed into our work.  We 
have also spoken with Nadine Dories MP, in whose constituency our project lies.   
 
We have also sought the views of people living and working in the area to help inform our 
plans.   We have held two series of exhibitions about the project (in June and October 2014), 
and made available information about the project in a leaflet, at local libraries, council 
offices, the Forest Centre and via our website.  The local press has also reported on our 
project at various times.   
 
We are close to finalising our plans and thereafter our application will be submitted to the 
Planning Inspectorate for examination.   We are likely to do this in within the next 6-8 
weeks, and if it is accepted, a detailed examination of our application by an independent 
inspector will commence in the summer. This is an open process where the local councils 
and the general public can register their views towards the project.  To follow this process, 
please visit: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/eastern/millbrook-power/  
 
Over the past few months, we have carried out a large number of technical and 
environmental studies to inform and guide our work.  A range of issues have been looked at, 
including the project’s visual impact, noise and air quality, its potential impact on the local 
ecology and transport. And we have consulted and met with a range of interests in addition 
to the local councils and local landowners: organisations such as the Environment Agency, 
English Heritage and Network Rail.  In November, we had the opportunity to speak about 
the project to “A Level” students at the Kimberley STEM Sixth Form College.

Purpose of Meeting  
The purpose of the meeting was to allow introductions to be made between Millbrook Power and 
Covanta both of whom have nationally significant energy projects at different stages of development 
within Rookery South Pit. Both parties are currently in active phases of development with the 
Covanta Project due to commence construction within the next year and the Millbrook Power 
Project due to submit an application for development consent later this year. It is important for both 
parties to understand one another’s programmes and co-operate to ensure that both projects are 
realised. 
Note of Meeting 
Following introductions, TK gave a broad summary of the status of the Rookery South RRF project 
highlighting the following key milestones in the months to come; 
 
Covanta have applied for an Environmental Permit from the Environment Agency, which is 
currently being consulted upon. The consultation period finishes on 18th April.  
 
Covanata will commence the LLRS works in April 2017 (to the extent that they are required 
to enable their project) 
 
The main construction works are due to commence in early 2018 and continue for 3 years 
 
The parameters of the project have not changed beyond those of the DCO and the design 
is substantially the same as that shown in the DCO. 
CM and NJ gave an update on the MPL project explaining that, after almost two years of reduced 
activity the project was purchased by the Drax Group in December 2016, along with three other 
OCGT projects. Drax are now pushing ahead with the aim of submitting and application for 
development consent in Q4 2017. Based on this, a decision is due from the Secretary of State mid-
2019, allowing the project to be bid into the December 2019 Capacity Auction which would then 
require power delivery in 2023. Under these circumstances Drax may decide to build the plant early 
to capture market revenue or T-1 auction revenue in 2022, following a 2 year construction 
programme. Note that Drax have retained the services of Stag Energy to manage the project through 
the consenting process.      
Both parties agreed to share any data that is required by both parties, for example traffic count data, 
topo data etc.  
Next steps  
TK to discuss MPL’s 2017 development programme with planning/permitting team to understand 
their concerns more fully – follow up meeting with Millbrook Power to be arranged to discuss 
interface agreement, protective provisions, statement of common ground etc.  
MPL to consider how the Covanta access road location can be locked down in such a way that it can 
be relied upon for the purposes of drafting the Millbrook Power DCO, and reducing the amount of 
land within the redline boundary.

Purpose of Meeting  
The purpose of the meeting was to update Central Bedfordshire Council planning department on 
recent developments with the Millbrook Power project, and discuss the programme of work up to 
submission of the DCO application. The agenda for the meeting was as follows; 
1. Project Ownership 
2. Project Update  
2.       Programme to Submission of DCO Application 
3.       Consultation Strategy and review of SoCC 
(i) Local councillor / parish council liaison 
4.       CBC review of ES and other Docs 
5.       Rookery South RRF Interface 
6.       PPA 
 
Note of Meeting 
NJ and PT gave explained the new project ownership and management structure and discussed why 
the project had been dormant for the previous two years. NJ explained the schedule of work this 
year with a period of Statutory Consultation programmed for June and submission of the DCO 
application in early December.  
It was agreed that NJ would prepare a draft PPA, taking the form of the previously agreed PPA, 
which would cover the work required by CBC in reviewing various documents including the 
Statement of Community Consultation and Draft Environmental Statement. All agreed that the 
amount of work involved would be considerably less given that the revised documents will be very 
similar to those previously reviewed by CBC. 
NJ explained that the consultation document (the Preliminary Environmental Information Report – 
PEIR) would take the form of a draft ES which will be very similar to that seen previously by CBC. The 
main change to the project will be a reduction in the required plant design flexibility such that only 
one turbine with one flue stack will be used (this will have a lower environmental impact and the 
flexibility to build up to 5 turbines/stacks which was consulted on previously was causing 
considerable concern among the local population). It was agreed that CBC will only be required to 
review the new ES once, probably best done prior to consultation.  
AR agreed to contact the relevant Ward Councillors once MPL are ready to re-engage with them and 
the Parish Councils – expected to be mid-April.

Summary of key points discussed and advice given: 
 
Introduction 
 
The Applicant and the Planning Inspectorate (the Inspectorate) team introduced 
themselves and their respective roles. The Inspectorate continued by outlining its 
openness policy and ensured those present understood that any issues discussed and 
advice given would be recorded and placed on the Inspectorate’s website under s51 of 
the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (PA2008). Further to this, it was made clear that 
any advice given did not constitute legal advice upon which the Applicant (or others) 
can rely. 
 
Project overview and update 
 
The Applicant gave a brief update about the project and the changes to the project 
since the last meeting which was held on the 23 April 2015. The Applicant informed 
the Inspectorate that previous owners Watt Power Limited have now sold the project 
 
2 
 
to Drax Developments Limited, together with Abergelli Power Limited and the 
consented Hirwaun Power and Progress Power schemes. They confirmed that the 
Millbrook project would still be managed by Stag Energy.  
 
The main changes to the project since the last meeting are:   
 
 
rather than seeking consent for up to five turbines and up to five stacks, a 
decision has been made to limit the number to a single turbine unit only with 
one exhaust stack 
 
there are two options for the electrical connection either using two sealing end 
compounds (one on each side of the existing 400kV line) or using a single 
larger sealing end compound which could be located on either side of the 
existing line. 
 
The Applicant informed the Inspectorate that unless National Grid (NG) makes a 
decision on their preferred connection option before the application is submitted, the 
draft Development Consent Order (DCO) will contain two options for the connection to 
the electricity grid. The rationale for proposing the options is that NG can implement 
the best available technology for the connection at the time of construction and for 
technical reasons yet to be determined; one option may be preferable over the other. 
The Applicant clarified that the options were there to provide flexibility for the benefit 
of NG and that they would not be seeking for the Examining Authority (ExA) or the 
Secretary of State to recommend/ make a decision, respectively, on a preferred 
option.  Rather the Applicant is seeking consent for both options.  
 
Programme 
 
The Applicant intends to submit the application to the Inspectorate in late 
November/early December 2017. The Inspectorate advised that a December 
submission could impact on the local authorities’ ability to submit an ‘adequacy of 
consultation’ response due to the Christmas holiday period. 
 
The Applicant intends to carry out statutory consultation for 35 days in June 2017. 
Prior to this the Applicant intends to hold non-statutory consultation with key 
stakeholders. It was explained that reasons for re-consulting on the project are the 
increase in new housing in the area and the time that has lapsed since the previous 
activity on this project.  
 
The Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) will be based on the 
previously prepared draft Environmental Statement (ES). The Applicant will update 
the Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) after it has conducted its statutory 
consultation on the draft SoCC with the host local authorities 
 
The Applicant clarified that they will not be requesting a new Scoping Opinion as the 
project had not gone through any material changes since the Scoping Opinion was 
issued. In addition, the previous Scoping Request covered between one and five 
turbines and one and five stacks, and therefore there is no real change in that regard.    
 
It was clarified that the Inspectorate would not produce a Regulation 9 consultee list 
unless it was notified under Regulation 6 of the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended), which must be 
done prior to s42 consultation, and that it was for the Applicant to ensure they had 
 
3 
 
consulted all relevant statutory consultees. It was explained that the Regulation 9 list 
was prepared only for the purposes of scoping and the Applicant’s consultation may 
have to go wider.  
 
The Inspectorate advised that it was unlikely that it would be able to accommodate 
the request for an Outreach meeting as the local authority and the local communities 
have benefitted from a previous outreach event for this project and have experience 
of the DCO process from the Rookery South Resource Recovery Facility (Rookery 
South) examination. It was considered that the local community and consultees would 
therefore hopefully be familiar with the key elements of the Planning Act process. In 
addition to this, there is a lot of information available to view on the Inspectorate 
website with regard to the process.  
 
Interactions with the Rookery South project 
 
Rookery South and the proposed Millbrook Power project are situated in the old 
Rookery South Pit and will have overlapping order land and be situated next to each 
other. The Rookery South facility is being brought forward as a joint venture between 
Covanta and Veolia. Construction needs to commence before February 2018, when 
the Rookery South DCO expires. The Applicant understands that construction of 
Rookery South is likely to commence in Q4 2017. 
 
The Applicant informed the Inspectorate that it understood that Rookery South’s 
compulsory acquisition powers over the pit have expired.  The Applicant is working 
with Covanta/Veolia on the location of the access road that both projects will be using 
and intends to resolve any potential issues with the access road with an Interface 
Agreement and protective provisions. 
 
To resolve the issue around the overlapping order land the Applicant intends to use 
s120 of PA2008 to insert a new protective provision in the Rookery South DCO for the 
protection of the Millbrook Power project. The Millbrook Power DCO will contain similar 
protection for Rookery South. The principles of the proposed protective provisions will 
be covered in the statutory consultation scheduled for June 2017. 
 
The Applicant set out its reasoning as to why it intended to use s120 rather than 
Schedule 6 of PA2008. The Inspectorate advised that such an approach needed to be 
robustly justified in the Millbrook Power application as s120 had not yet been relied on 
to allow one DCO to change another.  The Applicant explained its view that s120 was 
not restrictive and that it would be discussing the approach with Covanta/Veolia.  The 
Inspectorate raised concerns that a significant amount of examination time may be 
spent debating the use of s120. The Applicant was therefore advised to ensure that 
the application contained robust justification for the approach (including as necessary 
disclosing legal opinion) and to provide Statements of Common Ground with Covanta 
regarding changes to the Rookery South DCO and with the planning authority so that 
the ExA could deal with the matter as efficiently as possible in the early stages of the 
examination process. The Planning Inspectorate also suggested that the Applicant 
may wish to consider the Hinkley Point C Connection decision letter in which the 
Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) indicated the 
possibility of one DCO changing another. Nonetheless, it was highlighted that it would 
be for the BEIS, taking legal advice, to determine the approach that the Millbrook 
Power application takes with regard to the overlap between the Rookery South DCO 
and any DCO granted for Millbrook Power.   
 
4 
 
  
Environmental Permit 
 
The Applicant intends to submit the environmental permit application before the 
application is submitted (Q3 2017) in an effort to obtain the permit before the 
examination of the DCO application starts. The Applicant further clarified that it 
expected noise to be one of the main considerations for the permit. 
 
Contact plan 
 
It was clarified that if a contact plan was produced it would not be published. 
 
Draft documents review 
  
The Inspectorate clarified that it does not usually review technical chapters of the ES 
at the draft documents stage of the pre-application, but could review the chapters 
that set out the approach to the EIA, and the draft Habitats Regulation Assessment 
Report (HRAR). The Inspectorate informed the Applicant that it may be beneficial to 
the Applicant to include the draft DCO and Explanatory Memorandum and the updated 
Consultation Report. It was agreed that the Applicant would produce a list of draft 
documents they may wish the Inspectorate to review. It was agreed that the Applicant 
would also produce a draft s55 checklist prior to submitting the draft documents.  
 
It was agreed that the Applicant would produce a plan showing how the two projects 
overlap with each other and complete a draft s55 checklist prior to submitting the 
draft documents. 
 
The timescale for draft documents review is normally 4 weeks with a face to face 
meeting at Temple Quay House to discuss the comments. 
 
Any Other Business 
 
The Applicant was advised to review the Richborough Connection Project’s ‘Guide to 
the Application’. It was confirmed that the Applicant will produce a final guide to the 
application. 
 
The Applicant confirmed that it was aware of the new Fees Regulations that will come 
into effect in April 2017 and was advised to consult the Inspectorate’s Advice Notes, 
available on the Inspectorate’s website, regarding the fee changes. 
 
It was agreed that the Applicant would submit a Statutory Instrument Validation 
Report with the application and final draft DCO 
 
The Applicant confirmed that there were no issues around the Habitats Regulations 
Assessment.

Purpose of Meeting  
The purpose of the meeting was to update Bedford Borough Council planning department on recent 
developments with the Millbrook Power project, and discuss the programme of work up to 
submission of the DCO application. The agenda for the meeting was as follows; 
1. Introductions and project background 
2. Project ownership 
3. Changes to project since 2015  
4. Programme to submission of DCO application 
5. Consultation Strategy and review of SoCC 
a. Local councillor & parish council liaison 
6. BBC review of submission documents 
7. Rookery South RRF Interface 
 
Note of Meeting 
NJ and CM explained the new project ownership and management structure and discussed why the 
project had been dormant for the previous two years. NJ explained the schedule of work this year 
with a period of Statutory Consultation programmed for June and submission of the DCO application 
in early December.  
NJ explained that the consultation document (the Preliminary Environmental Information Report – 
PEIR) would take the form of a draft ES which will be very similar to that seen previously by BBC. The 
main change to the project will be a reduction in the required plant design flexibility such that only 
one turbine with one flue stack will be used (this will have a lower environmental impact and the 
flexibility to build up to 5 turbines/stacks which was consulted on previously was causing 
considerable concern among the local population).  
AW agreed to contact the relevant Ward Councillors (Tim Hill and one other) once MPL are ready to 
re-engage with them and the Parish Councils – expected to be mid-April. NJ stressed that MPL have 
not yet put themselves back in the public eye and are not yet ready to formally re-launch the project 
– this is expected to be mid-late April. 
The Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) will need to be reviewed again by BBC, although 
the format and content will be the same as the 2014 SoCC. There is a statutory timeframe of 28 days 
for the Local Planning Authority to review the SoCC and revert with comments. MPL will issue the 
SoCC for review by then end of w/c 03rd April.  
AR and PL mentioned a number of local developments or ongoing issues that they thought relevant 
to the MPL project; 
 
Covanta – currently out for consultation for Environmental Permit – much local 
opposition 
 
Black-Cat roundabout is due to be upgraded to spaghetti junction style junction 
 
Bedford Bypass – on going works at Kempston junction are making that junction very 
busy 
 
The review of the 2032 Local Plan is ongoing – Gill Cowie is head of Policy and dealing 
with that 
 
There have been a number of new housing developments near Stewartby – Cllr Hill has 
been expressing concerns regarding the amount of mud on the roads around the 
development sites 
 
East-West Rail link – these plans are moving forward – Greg Logan in the contact within 
BBC for that development.  
 
Finally, AR thought it would be useful for himself to visit the site (Rookery South Pit) – NJ agreed and 
stated that he can arrange this with the landowners and would be happy to accompany the visit.

Note of Meeting 
Following introductions, CM explained the history of the Millbrook Power Project and the project 
ownership/management. NJ then gave an overview of the project in terms of its individual elements, 
the national need and the programme of work for 2017. All agreed that the aim going forward is to 
work together to ensure that both projects can co-exist within Rookery Pit.  
DC stated that they expect to start work on Phase 1 of the low-level restoration schemes (LLRS) in 
the next couple of weeks – completion of Phase 1 of the LLRS is a requirement prior to commencing 
work on the Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) project itself. Phase 1 includes the works shown in the 
following insert; 
 
   
 
EP application -  Iris gave an update on the current situation with Covanta/Veolia’s EP application; 
 
Consultation closed on 18th April 
 
Sch. 5 Request for Further Info was received prior to close of consultation  
o Mostly clarifications rather than new data required.  
o Response must be submitted by 18th May 
 
Draft EP is expected to be issued in Q3 which ties in to financial close for project 
 
A further round of consultation will open for 28 days once the draft EP is published 
 
MPL Public Consultation 
NJ explained that because the project has been on hold for some time, MPL would be carrying out a 
further round of statutory consultation starting on 29th May.  
DCO Overlap Issues 
It was stated and agreed by all that the DCOs for the two project will overlap (for example they both 
cover the area of the access road).  
During the meeting there was some uncertainty regarding which elements of planting shown in 
Appendix 5 of the attached relate to the LLRS scheme and which relate to the Covanta Scheme. The 
plan below illustrates which planting belongs to which project and it appears that all the planting 
shown in Appendix 5 relates to the Covanta scheme; 
      
It was discussed that some areas of the Covanta and LLRS planning will be removed to allow the 
electrical and gas connections for the MPL project to be constructed. The impact of this will be 
assessed in the MPL EIA and additional planting will be proposed elsewhere as required. 
JC mentioned that Covanta/Veolia run quarterly Community Liaison Panel (CLP) meeting, the next 
one being on 12th June. MPL stated that if the CLP wished MPL to attend the following meeting after 
the 12th June they would gladly do so.   
 
Next steps  
MPL would like to meet again prior to the start of their statutory consultation period (starting 29th 
May). MPL to provide detail around the wording to be used in the MPL DCO to amend the Covanta 
Order, with view to meeting again in mid May. 
Covanta / Veolia to liaise with MPL regarding meeting with O&H.

PRE-APPLICATION NON-STATUTORY LOCAL STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION 
Meeting note:  26th April 2017  
 
Location: Bedford Council offices 
 
Attendees: 
 
Bedford Mayor (Dave Hodgson, LibDem)  
 
2.00pm to 2.45pm 
Cllr Tim Hill (Stewartby ward, LibDem) 
 
4.00pm to 5.00pm 
Cllr John Wheeler (Wootton ward, Con) 
 
4.00pm to 5.00pm 
Cllr Graeme Coombes (Wilshamstead ward, Con) 
4.00pm to 5.00pm 
 
Alastair Wren and Paul Lennox (BBC planning officers) attended both meetings. 
 
Nick Johnson (MPL/Stag Energy) 
Paul Taylor (MPL/Taylor Keogh)  
 
The purpose of both meetings was to update the councillors on the MPL project and in the case of Cllr 
Coombes, introduce the MPL project for the first time; his Wilshamstead ward (including the growing Wixams 
housing area) borders the MPL core consultation zone. 
 
Earlier in the day, NJ accompanied the two BBC planning officers on a visit to the Rookery South Pit and 
surrounding area. 
 
NJ and PT walked through the project for the Mayor and, at a later meeting, the three councillors.  They 
highlighted the work carried out by MPL in 2014 (NB the environmental studies had taken account of the 
Covanta scheme), the rationale of the MPL project, the change of ownership to Drax Group and key aspects of 
the project, including the undergrounding of the electrical and gas connections, and the recent decision to 
deploy a single turbine (rather than up to 5). They also outlined MPL’s local consultation activities in 2014/15 
and the plans for future consultation, including meetings taking place in May with local parish councils, the 
leaflet drop to people in the CCZ and the four public exhibitions in June. 
 
The Mayor of Bedford asked about the reasons for the project being put on hold in 2015, the timescale for the 
DCO application, the plant’s hours of operation and likely traffic during construction and operation.  He 
suggested that MPL contact BBC’s PR person (Keiron Fletcher) to help cascade information about the project 
and the period of statutory public consultation. 
 
At the second meeting, Cllr Coombes asked for information about the main environmental impacts of the 
project and the local economic benefits. NJ gave top-line details on each and said that the PEIR would provide 
detailed information once it’s published.  He also asked about local consultation and, after hearing MPL’s 
plans, was happy for MPL to meet his local parish council rather than hosting an exhibition in his ward (PT 
contacted the Wilshamstead Parish Clerk on 27/04/17).  PT told Cllr Wheeler that MPL was meeting Wootton 
Parish Council on May 24th and told Cllr Hill that a date to meet Stewartby Parish Council was to be fixed.  BBC 
needs to revert with comments on MPL’s draft consultation plan w/c May 1st. 
 
The three councillors said that there was a risk that some members of the public would confuse MPL with 
Covanta, and they would now criticise MPL as being part of the re-industrialisation of the area. 
 
Given the expansion of housing in the area, everyone agreed that MPL and the Councils must ensure that new 
residents and prospective house buyers are made aware of the proposed developments at Rookery South Pit.  
BBC officers would provide a list of local housing developers for MPL to contact, in addition to MPL’s own 
outreach communication work.

Millbrook Power     
 
DCO - A formal statutory consultation was undertaken in 2014 but in 
March 2015 the (then) majority stakeholder Noble Group decided 
not to submit, putting the scheme on hold.  
 
The MPL project was purchased by Drax Group in December 2016; 
they have retained Stag Energy to manage the scheme as well as 
the same team of consultants.  
   
The DCO Application, to be submitted in late November 2017, is for 
a 299MW gas fired power station “peaking power plant” to support 
renewable energy supply.  
 
It is envisaged to operate 200-250 hours per year only in order to fill 
in the gaps to meet sudden demand; it can be started in 10 minutes.  
 
The elements of the scheme were described on the tabled Project 
Site Plan.  Construction access was confirmed via Green Lane.  
 
The DCO programme was discussed:

East West Rail  
 
East West Rail Round Two consultation has been halted due to the 
announcement of the snap General Election. A provisional date of 
11th July is envisaged.  
 
It is expected that it will be delivered through the TWA process and 
hoped originally to apply in December 2017, which has now been 
revised to February-April 2018. Objectors are likely. Inquiry most 
likely.  
 
Phase One – Oxford to Bicester is now complete, providing a 
connection to Marylebone avoiding Reading (into Paddington), two 
new stations and line upgrade.  
 
Covanta DCO -  instructed to provide improvements at Green Lane 
to be agreed by Network Rail and the Office of Rail and Road. 
Covanta must trigger ‘commencement’ by 28th February 2018.

The meeting with Millbrook Parish Meeting took place at South Pillinge Farm, beside Rookery South 
Pit.  
 
MPL attendees:  
Nick Johnson (Stag Energy) 
Paul Taylor (Taylor Keogh)  
 
The purpose of the meetings was to update the various councillors on the MPL project and in some 
instances introduce the project to councillors for the first time.  MPL explained the main change to 
the project since 2014 – the decision to apply for consent for one turbine (1 stack), and revisited the 
other main elements of the project, namely the other generation equipment and buildings, and the 
electrical and gas connections.  MPL also outlined their plans for the forthcoming period of statutory 
public consultation (May 29th to July 2nd). 
 
Some attendees were new to the area since 2014/15 when MPL first introduced the project and 
undertook the two phases of public consultation. 
 
The Central Bedfordshire Council meeting at Shefford was attended by: 
o Cllr Robert Morris, ward councillor for Marston Moretaine & Cranfield (and past chairman of the 
Marston Moreteyne Parish Council). 
o Cllr Ken Matthews, ward councillor for Marston Moretaine & Cranfield. 
o Annabel Robinson, CBC planning officer. 
 
The meeting at Central Beds was positive. They were pleased that MPL has listened to their views in 
2014 and had adapted the project (ie undergrounding of the electrical connection). After asking 
questions about traffic management during MPL’s construction and the potential noise of the plant, 
they “wished MPL well” in taking forward the scheme.  They raised the Covanta project, their 
application for an Environmental Permit and the local feeling towards it which might impact upon 
people’s views towards MPL. 
 
This final point was also expressed at the meeting with the four parish councils.  
 
Other issues that were raised at the parish meetings: 
1. Air quality and emissions from the plant: NJ explained the emissions, their low impact and the 
studies undertaken (which are being refreshed). 
2. Cumulative impact of MPL and Covanta: MPL explained that MPL’s assessments in 2014 had 
taken into account the Covanta scheme, and would do so again.  A member of Houghton 
Conquest PC asked whether an independent assessment of the impacts could be undertaken; NJ 
said that the studies were independent.   
3. Industrialisation of the area: MPL said that the site was designated as brownfield land by Central 
Beds Council so it was an appropriate development.  A member of Stewartby PC (new since 
2014/15) said that this was the basis of his objections to MPL (his fellow councillors sought to 
assure him of MPL’s project – its operation, the previous consultations etc). 
4. Timetable (planning, construction and operation); the provisional dates given by MPL were 
noted. 
5. Drax’s ownership of MPL:  an explanation of the Drax Group was given by MPL. 
6. Community benefit:  both Houghton Conquest and Stewartby asked whether Drax would be 
willing to provide support to the local area beyond the construction and operation of the power 
project.  MPL suggested that they could raise the matter directly with Drax. 
 
In addition, MPL raised the growth in the number of new homes in the area and the efforts it will be 
taking to inform people who have moved into the area since 2014/15. 
 
Houghton Conquest, Stewartby and Cranfield asked MPL to provide news articles for their respective 
newsletters.  MPL will do this during w/c 15th May.

The purpose of the two meetings was to update the various councillors on the MPL project and in 
some instances introduce the project to councillors for the first time.  Both meetings had members 
of the public present, who were interested in other items on the Councils’ agendas.  In addition, CBC 
ward councillor, Robert Morris, was present at the Marston Moreteyne meeting. 
 
At both meetings, MPL explained the main change to the project since 2014 – the decision to apply 
for consent for one turbine (1 stack), and revisited the other main elements of the project, namely 
the other generation equipment and buildings, and the electrical and gas connections.  MPL also 
outlined their plans for the forthcoming period of statutory public consultation (May 29th to July 2nd). 
 
The main issues raised at both meetings were air quality and emissions from the plant, and the 
cumulative impact of MPL and Covanta: MPL explained that MPL’s assessments in 2014 had taken 
into account the Covanta scheme, and would do so again.  Whilst welcoming the reduction in stack 
his height, they did question how the high-temperature emissions from MPL would impact upon the 
emissions from the Covanta plant, and how it would impact the Marston Vale which they considered 
experienced particular local meteorological conditions (temperature inversions).  
 
Marston Moreteyne Council do not trust the data provided by Covanta nor were they were happy 
that MPL’s meteorological data would be from Cranfield Airport.  The councillors also questioned 
why MPL had chosen Rookery South Pit; an explanation was provided. 
 
The Chairman of Marston Moreteyne asked what social/financial benefits could the village expect to 
get from MPL/Drax; MPL said that this was a matter for future discussion. 
 
MPL offered both councils to write articles for their respective newsletters; Marston Moreteyne 
wished to reserve judgement, whilst Ampthill thought that their deadline for the next issue had 
passed.  MPL submitted articles regardless.

May 24th 2017
 
Given your housing scheme at Moreteyne Park in Bedfordshire, I am writing to inform you
that Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL) has re-started its work to secure planning consent to build
a  gas-fired  electricity  generation  plant  on  land  located  in  Rookery  South  Pit,  near  the
villages of Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine.
 
In March 2015 it was decided to put MPL’s work “on hold”; the decision was not taken
lightly,  given  the  extensive  work  that  the  MPL  project  team  had  carried  out  over  the
previous 12 months and more.  There however remains a need for new gas-fired power
stations to be built in this country, and acknowledging this national need, the MPL project
was  recently  acquired  by  the  UK  energy  company,  Drax  Group  plc.    Under  Drax’s
stewardship, it is MPL’s intention to submit a Development Consent Order (DCO) to the
Planning Inspectorate before the end of this year; noting the DCO and financing processes,
and a 2-3 year construction period, Drax does not expect the Millbrook project to enter
operation until 2022.
 
Whilst a great amount of work was carried out by the MPL team in 2014/15 (assessing the
project’s various impacts and to gather feedback from the relevant local councils, various
statutory organisations, local landowners and the local community), the project team is 
revisiting  and  refreshing  its  environmental  and  technical  assessments  as  two  years  has
passed since the decision to put the project “on hold”.  
 
Furthermore, the MPL team (the same people are very much involved in the project as
before)  will  again  work  closely  with  local  councils  in  the  area  and  consult  the  local
community before it makes a submission to the Planning Inspectorate.
 
MPL will be hosting a series of public exhibitions between June 9th and 13th (as part of a
period of statutory consultation that will run from May 29th to July 2nd). The exhibitions
are taking place:
•          Friday, 9th June 1500-1930hrs - Marston Moretaine Village Hall, Bedford Road,
Marston Moretaine, MK43 0LD
•          Saturday, 10th June 0900-1300hrs - Stewartby Club, Stewartby Way, Stewartby,
MK43 9NB
•          Monday, 12th June 1600-2000hrs - Wingfield Club, 37 Church Street, Ampthill,
MK45 2PL
•          Tuesday, 13th June 1230-1530hrs - Lidlington Village Hall, High Street, Lidlington,
MK43 0RT
 
Please  note  that  MPL’s  decision,  made  in  February  2015,  to  underground  the  Project’s
electrical connection to the National Grid will not be changed.  It has also been decided
that the proposed generation plant will have just one gas turbine, thereby necessitating a
single  35m  stack  (in  2014/15,  MPL  had  been  considering  up  to  five  stacks)  which  will
further reduce the project’s visual impact.
 
MPL  is  using  its  website  www.millbrookpower.co.uk,  the  public  exhibitions  and  other
channels  to  share  its  plans  with  people  (including  its  Preliminary  Environmental
Information  Report)  as  well  as  flag  any  significant  milestones  between  now  and  the
submission of the application to the Planning Inspectorate.  However, please let me know
(via the contact details below) if you have any immediate questions.  We are keen for your
company and your current and prospective homeowners at Moreteyne Park to be aware
of the Millbrook Power project.

MPL: DRAFT TEMPLATE LETTER TO EXPLAIN PROJECT RE-START (v2 24 March) 
I am writing to advise you that Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL) has re-started its work to secure 
planning consent to build a gas-fired electricity generation plant on land located in Rookery 
South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlingtron and Marston Moretaine. 
If you recall, in March 2015 it was decided to put MPL’s work “on hold” given the then political 
environment and the market conditions for new power generation projects in this country.  
The decision was not taken lightly, given the extensive work that the MPL project team had 
carried out over the previous 12 months and more.   
There however remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this country, 
and acknowledging this national need, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK 
energy company, Drax Group plc.  Under Drax’s stewardship, it is MPL’s intention to submit a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Planning Inspectorate before the end of this year; 
noting the DCO and financing processes, and a 2-3 year construction period, Drax does not 
expect the Millbrook project to enter operation until 2022. 
Whilst a great amount of work was carried out by the MPL team in 2014/15 (assessing the 
project’s various impacts and to gather feedback from the relevant local councils, various 
statutory organisations, local landowners and the local community), we are revisiting and 
refreshing our environmental and technical assessments as two years has passed since the 
decision to put the project “on hold”.    
Furthermore, the MPL team (the same people are very much involved in the project as before) 
will again work closely with local councils and consult the local community; it is our intention 
to host another series of public exhibitions (as part of a second period of statutory 
consultation for the project) before we make our submission to the Planning Inspectorate. 
These exhibitions are likely to be held in early-mid June. 
Please note that MPL’s decision, made in February 2015, to underground the Project’s 
electrical connection to the National Grid will not be changed.  We have also since decided 
that our generation plant will have just one gas turbine, thereby necessitating a single stack 
(in 2014/15, we had been considering up to five stacks). This decision was made after 
reviewing once again the local feedback that we had received during the statutory period of 
consultation that was held in October/November 2014 and after additional technical and 
commercial studies on our part over the past 18 months. 
We will use our website www.millbookpower.co.uk  (which is currently being updated), the 
public exhibitions and other channels to share our plans with people as well as flag any 
significant milestones between now and the submission of our application to the Planning 
Inspectorate. 
In the meantime, if you have any questions please let MPL know via the contact details below 
(they are the same as before). 
Yours sincerely,

details on how you can respond to this consultation. Please note that this consultation will close 
on 16th November 2014 and we therefore invite responses on or before this date. Following 
the end of the consultation period and receipt of consultee responses, Millbrook Power Limited will 
have regard to the comments received when it is finalising its application for the Project for 
submission under the Act. 
1 Introduction 
Millbrook Power Limited proposes to develop an up to 299MW gas fired power plant at Rookery 
South Pit, near to the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.  
It is proposed that the gas fired power plant would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means that it 
would have an intermittent operating regime (i.e. not running continually), designed to provide back-
up generation capacity to respond quickly and efficiently to both short-term variation in customer 
demand and intermittent output from renewable power generation. Subject to public consultation, 
planning and financing the Project could enter commercial operation in 2019/2020. 
1.1 The Applicant 
Millbrook Power Limited ("MILLBROOK POWER LIMITED") has been established by Watt Power 
Limited to develop the Project at Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Watt Power Limited is seeking 
to develop gas fired generation assets at Rookery South Pit and elsewhere in the UK to support the 
3 
UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. For more information, please refer to the NTS 
Section 1. 
1.2 Development Consent Order 
The Project will require a development consent order under the Planning Act 2008. This is because 
the generating capacity of the power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the 
definition of a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the 
Act. Development consent for an NSIP (and any associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a development consent order ("DCO"). The DCO will permit the 
construction, operation and maintenance of the Project.  
The examining authority for any DCO application is the Secretary of State (via the Planning 
Inspectorate) rather than the Local Planning Authority. DCO applications for NSIPs are therefore 
submitted to the Planning Inspectorate - which processes and examines each application before 
making a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change ("SoS") as to 
whether or not an application should be granted. The final decision on an application and whether 
or not to make a DCO in relation to that application is made by the SoS. Millbrook Power Limited 
intends to submit an application for a DCO for the Project in Q1 2015. 
2 The Project 
The Project consists of three main elements: 
A. 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The Power Generation Plant would comprise: 
•
generating equipment, including up to five gas turbine generators, up to five exhaust
gas flue stacks  and balance of plant, which are located within the Generating
Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment");
•
A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site
(the "Access Road");
•
A temporary construction compound required during construction only (the "Laydown
Area");
B. 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"). This will mainly comprise of an 
underground gas pipe; and 
C. 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National 
Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the "Electrical Connection"). The electrical 
connection will include a new substation which is expected to be located next to the 
Generating Equipment within Rookery South Pit, and infrastructure to connect the 
Substation to the existing 400 kV network. 
4 
This may take the form of up to two overhead lines [of 400kV] including up to seven 
transmission towers (one of which will be replacing an existing tower and is likely to be 
located in close proximity to the location of that existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net 
additional towers) to connect to the existing 400 kV overhead line. Please refer to Section 
2.4 of the NTS for further information.  
3 The Need for Gas Generation 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in 
particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy, and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy. As mentioned above, the proposed power 
plant will be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and 
efficiently to short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and 
offshore wind power. 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs mentioned above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation. Please refer to NTS Section 1.4 Need for the Project for 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
4 Environmental Information and likely significant environmental effects of the Project 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, Millbrook Power Limited is undertaking an Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA), as the Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009.  
The EIA considers the likely significant environmental effects of the Project, including impacts on air 
quality, noise and vibration, ecology, water quality and resources, ground conditions, landscape 
and visual impact, traffic and transport, archaeology and cultural heritage, socio-economics and 
cumulative impact with other proposed projects. 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009, Millbrook Power Limited has prepared the PEIR. The PEIR 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of Millbrook 
Power Limited’s preliminary assessment as to the likely significant environmental effects of the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.  This includes the cumulative effects of 
the Project considered together with relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects (such as 
the proposed Covanta Rookery South Limited's Rookery South Energy from Waste Generating 
Station). It also includes the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation measures have 
been taken into account. 
 
 
5 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings, but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed. A full Environmental Statement will be submitted as part of the 
application for the Project in Q1 2015.

5 Options for the Proposed Project 
At this stage the proposed Project design has yet to be finalised (indeed, the design that will form 
the basis of the application in Q1 of 2015 will not be a final, detailed design but rather will be a 
"Rochdale" envelope within which the Project can be constructed (please see Advice Note 9 on the 
Planning Inspectorate's website at http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/ for more information)).   
As such, Millbrook Power Limited is consulting in particular on its preferred option for the Gas 
Connection. A decision on whether or not to progress this preferred option to the submission stage 
will be informed by consultation feedback, as well as additional environmental and technical studies 
being undertaken. 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. The layout of the Power Generation Plant within the 4 ha site is yet to be 
finalised. Insert 2 in the NTS shows an indicative layout within this 4 ha site for the Power 
Generation Plant. The precise position and alignment of the Power Generation Plant will be 
finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to the responses received and the further 
environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your views on the indicative location of the 
Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
 
6 
5.2 Gas Connection 
The preferred route option for the Gas Connection is shown in Figure 1.2 and described in Section 
2.3 of the NTS. However, other options that Millbrook Power Limited believes are less technically 
and environmentally preferable are still potentially deliverable. As such, your views on the preferred 
Gas Connection Route option would be welcome. Millbrook Power Limited is also considering a 
number of options to access the Gas Connection during its construction and maintenance and 
again your views on the options would be welcome.   
5.3 Electrical Connection 
The configuration of the Electrical Connection between the Substation and the 400kV overhead line 
is yet to be finalised and will largely be defined by National Grid technical studies and statutory 
duties. 
As such, Millbrook Power Limited has assumed a realistic worst case scenario of up to two 
overhead line circuits [of 400kV] including up to seven transmission towers (one of which will be 
replacing an existing tower and is likely to be located in close proximity to the location of that 
existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net additional towers). However, Millbrook Power Limited will 
continue to work with National Grid on the indicative design of the connection over the coming 
months. Your comments on the proposed Electrical Connection would be welcome. 
Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
At this stage of the Project's development, Millbrook Power Limited notes that the DCO for the 
Project may seek the compulsory acquisition of land and rights over land (including rights to use 
land) for the Project - together with temporary possession of land during the construction and 
commissioning periods. Millbrook Power Limited is commencing and/or continuing discussions with 
those persons affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to 
submission of the DCO application. 
6 Consultation 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final designs of the proposed Project. In June 2014 , Millbrook Power 
Limited first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held in Stewartby, Lidlington and 
Marston Moretaine. At the exhibitions and since, Millbrook Power Limited has received and 
responded to comments on its plans. Briefing meetings were also held with the Planning 
Inspectorate, Bedford Borough Council (BBC) and Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Parish 
Council members were invited to non-statutory exhibitions prior to opening to the public. 
In addition, Millbrook Power Limited has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the 
scope of the EIA, including local authorities, the Environment Agency, the Highways Agency, 
Natural England, English Heritage and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was 
submitted to the Planning Inspectorate on 20th June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping Report. The 
Planning Inspectorate issued its formal Scoping Opinion on 28th July 2014. These documents can 
be found on the Planning Inspectorate's website (http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/) on the 
Millbrook Power page and on Millbrook Power’s website (www.millbrookpower.co.uk). 
7 
Since the initial stages of consultation, the Project design has evolved with regard to comments 
received during the non-statutory consultation stage, and the Scoping Opinion received from PINS 
and statutory consultees. Several significant changes have occurred since the previous round of 
consultation including:  measures to reduce the visual impact of the Project; reduction of stack 
height from a maximum of 60m to 40m; a preferred gas connection route has been selected; 
Generating Equipment has been arranged to reduce the impact from noise for residential receptors; 
and measures have been taken to reduce the impact of traffic during construction and operation.  
The information within the NTS describes the Project, as well as its potential likely significant 
environmental effects. We wish to seek your views about the Project, including the findings of the 
preliminary environmental studies described in the NTS.

1 Introduction to the Project 
 
MPL proposes to develop a Power Generation Plant in the Rookery South Pit, near the villages of 
Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.   
 
The Power Generation Plant will be capable of generating up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to 
power the equivalent of 150,000 homes. Using the latest and most efficient power generating 
technology, it will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
The Project is intended to provide back-up power to the National Grid and support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. More information on the Project can be found at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/. The Project could enter commercial operation in 2022 subject to 
the outcome of the public consultation exercise, receipt of planning consent and financing.  
 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) planning application process in 2014 and MPL undertook a first phase of statutory 
consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (“Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation”). However, in March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. There remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this 
country, and acknowledging this, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy 
company, Drax Group plc (“Drax”).  
 
Under Drax’s stewardship, it is MPL’s intention to submit an application for a DCO to the Planning 
Inspectorate (“PINS”) in Q4 2017. MPL is undertaking further statutory consultation (“Phase 2 
Statutory Consultation”) accompanied by the 2017 PEIR (CD copy enclosed) which contains 
updated information on the Project, the design parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.    
 
 
 
3 
1.1 The Applicant   
 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited which established MPL to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Drax is seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook 
and elsewhere in the UK to support the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by plugging 
the gaps created by intermittent renewables. For more information, refer to Section 1.3 of the 
enclosed PEIR NTS.  
 
1.2 Development Consent Order   
 
The Project will require a DCO under the Planning Act 2008. This is because the capacity of the 
power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the definition of a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008. Development 
consent for a NSIP (which can include consent for associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a DCO. The DCO will permit the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project.   
 
The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
− 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
− 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
− 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
 
 
4 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
 
 
5 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
− 3.2 Air Quality  
− 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
− 3.4 Ecology  
− 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
− 3.6 Ground Conditions  
− 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
− 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
− 3.9 Historic Environment 
− 3.10 Socio-Economics  
− 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
 
 
6 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
� 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
� 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
� 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
 
 
7 
� 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
� 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
� 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is now undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found 
at www.millbrookpower.co.uk. It is also available for inspection in hard copy at:

1 Introduction to the Project 
 
MPL proposes to develop a Power Generation Plant in the Rookery South Pit, near the villages of 
Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.   
 
The Power Generation Plant will be capable of generating up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to 
power the equivalent of 150,000 homes. Using the latest and most efficient power generating 
technology, it will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
The Project is intended to provide back-up power to the National Grid and support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. More information on the Project can be found at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/. The Project could enter commercial operation in 2022 subject to 
the outcome of the public consultation exercise, receipt of planning consent and financing.  
 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) planning application process in 2014 and MPL undertook a first phase of statutory 
consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (“Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation”). However, in March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. There remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this 
country, and acknowledging this, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy 
company, Drax Group plc (“Drax”).  
 
 
 
3 
Under Drax’s stewardship, it is MPL’s intention to submit an application for a DCO to the Planning 
Inspectorate (“PINS”) in Q4 2017. MPL is undertaking further statutory consultation (“Phase 2 
Statutory Consultation”) accompanied by the 2017 PEIR (CD copy enclosed) which contains 
updated information on the Project, the design parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.    
 
1.1 The Applicant   
 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited which established MPL to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Drax is seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook 
and elsewhere in the UK to support the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by plugging 
the gaps created by intermittent renewables. For more information, refer to Section 1.3 of the 
enclosed PEIR NTS.  
 
1.2 Development Consent Order   
 
The Project will require a DCO under the Planning Act 2008. This is because the capacity of the 
power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the definition of a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008. Development 
consent for a NSIP (which can include consent for associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a DCO. The DCO will permit the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project.   
 
The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
 
 
4 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
 
 
5 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
 3.2 Air Quality  
 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
 3.4 Ecology  
 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
 3.6 Ground Conditions  
 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
 3.9 Historic Environment 
 3.10 Socio-Economics  
 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
 
 
6 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
 
 
7 
 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is now undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found

1 Introduction to the Project 
 
MPL proposes to develop a Power Generation Plant in the Rookery South Pit, near the villages of 
Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.   
 
The Power Generation Plant will be capable of generating up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to 
power the equivalent of 150,000 homes. Using the latest and most efficient power generating 
technology, it will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
The Project is intended to provide back-up power to the National Grid and support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. More information on the Project can be found at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/. The Project could enter commercial operation in 2022 subject to 
the outcome of the public consultation exercise, receipt of planning consent and financing.  
 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) planning application process in 2014 and MPL undertook a first phase of statutory 
consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (“Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation”). However, in March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. There remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this 
country, and acknowledging this, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy 
company, Drax Group plc (“Drax”). It is MPL’s intention to submit an application for a DCO to the 
Planning Inspectorate (“PINS”) in Q4 2017.  
 
MPL is undertaking a further phase of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Statutory Consultation”) on 
the latest Project iteration, details of which can be found via the above-referenced website link, 
which contains updated information on the Project, the design parameters, design evolution and the 
EIA process.    
 
 
 
3 
 
 
1.1 The Applicant   
 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited which established MPL to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Drax is seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook 
and elsewhere in the UK to support the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by plugging 
the gaps created by intermittent renewables. For more information, refer to Section 1.3 of the 
enclosed PEIR NTS.  
 
1.2 Development Consent Order   
 
The Project will require a DCO under the Planning Act 2008. This is because the capacity of the 
power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the definition of a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008. Development 
consent for a NSIP (which can include consent for associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a DCO. The DCO will permit the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project.   
 
The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
− 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
− 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
− 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
 
 
4 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
 
 
5 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
− 3.2 Air Quality  
− 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
− 3.4 Ecology  
− 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
− 3.6 Ground Conditions  
− 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
− 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
− 3.9 Historic Environment 
− 3.10 Socio-Economics  
− 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
 
 
6 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
� 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
� 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
� 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
� 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
 
7 
 
� 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
� 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found 
at www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
7 How to respond 
 
The extended Phase 2 statutory consultation period on the Project will end at 17:00 on 15th 
September 2017, and we would therefore welcome your views on the Project by this date and time.  
 
If you respond to our consultation, please include your name and an address in your response.

The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
 
 
4 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
 
 
5 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
 3.2 Air Quality  
 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
 3.4 Ecology  
 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
 3.6 Ground Conditions  
 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
 3.9 Historic Environment 
 3.10 Socio-Economics  
 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
 
 
6 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
 
 
7 
 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found 
at www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
7 How to respond 
 
The extended Phase 2 statutory consultation period on the Project will end at 17:00 on 15th 
September 2017, and we would therefore welcome your views on the Project by this date and time.

1 Introduction to the Project 
 
MPL proposes to develop a Power Generation Plant in the Rookery South Pit, near the villages of 
Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.   
 
The Power Generation Plant will be capable of generating up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to 
power the equivalent of 150,000 homes. Using the latest and most efficient power generating 
technology, it will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
The Project is intended to provide back-up power to the National Grid and support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. More information on the Project can be found at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/. The Project could enter commercial operation in 2022 subject to 
the outcome of the public consultation exercise, receipt of planning consent and financing.  
 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) planning application process in 2014 and MPL undertook a first phase of statutory 
consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (“Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation”). However, in March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. There remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this 
country, and acknowledging this, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy 
company, Drax Group plc (“Drax”). It is MPL’s intention to submit an application for a DCO to the 
Planning Inspectorate (“PINS”) in Q4 2017.  
 
MPL is undertaking a further phase of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Statutory Consultation”) on 
the latest Project iteration, details of which can be found on the accompanying CD, which contains 
updated information on the Project, the design parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.    
 
 
3 
 
 
1.1 The Applicant   
 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited which established MPL to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Drax is seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook 
and elsewhere in the UK to support the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by plugging 
the gaps created by intermittent renewables. For more information, refer to Section 1.3 of the 
enclosed PEIR NTS.  
 
1.2 Development Consent Order   
 
The Project will require a DCO under the Planning Act 2008. This is because the capacity of the 
power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the definition of a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008. Development 
consent for a NSIP (which can include consent for associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a DCO. The DCO will permit the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project.   
 
The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
 
 
4 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
 
 
5 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
 3.2 Air Quality  
 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
 3.4 Ecology  
 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
 3.6 Ground Conditions  
 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
 3.9 Historic Environment 
 3.10 Socio-Economics  
 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
 
 
6 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
 
7 
 
 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found 
at www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
7 How to respond 
 
The extended Phase 2 statutory consultation period on the Project will end at 17:00 on 22nd 
September 2017, and we would therefore welcome your views on the Project by this date and time.

Act 2008. 
 
1 Introduction to the Project 
 
MPL proposes to develop a Power Generation Plant in the Rookery South Pit, near the villages of 
Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.   
 
The Power Generation Plant will be capable of generating up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to 
power the equivalent of 150,000 homes. Using the latest and most efficient power generating 
technology, it will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
The Project is intended to provide back-up power to the National Grid and support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. More information on the Project can be found at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/. The Project could enter commercial operation in 2022 subject to 
the outcome of the public consultation exercise, receipt of planning consent and financing.  
 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) planning application process in 2014 and MPL undertook a first phase of statutory 
consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (“Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation”). However, in March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. There remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this 
country, and acknowledging this, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy 
company, Drax Group plc (“Drax”). It is MPL’s intention to submit an application for a DCO to the 
Planning Inspectorate (“PINS”) in Q4 2017.  
 
MPL is undertaking a further phase of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Statutory Consultation”) on 
the latest Project iteration, details of which can be found on the accompanying CD, which contains 
updated information on the Project, the design parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.    
 
 
3 
 
 
1.1 The Applicant   
 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited which established MPL to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Drax is seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook 
and elsewhere in the UK to support the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by plugging 
the gaps created by intermittent renewables. For more information, refer to Section 1.3 of the 
enclosed PEIR NTS.  
 
1.2 Development Consent Order   
 
The Project will require a DCO under the Planning Act 2008. This is because the capacity of the 
power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the definition of a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008. Development 
consent for a NSIP (which can include consent for associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a DCO. The DCO will permit the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project.   
 
The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
 
 
4 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
 
 
5 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
 3.2 Air Quality  
 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
 3.4 Ecology  
 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
 3.6 Ground Conditions  
 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
 3.9 Historic Environment 
 3.10 Socio-Economics  
 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
 
 
6 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
 
7 
 
 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found 
at www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
7 How to respond 
 
The extended Phase 2 statutory consultation period on the Project will end at 17:00 on 22nd 
September 2017, and we would therefore welcome your views on the Project by this date and time.

MPL welcomes your comments on the Project. Part 7 of this letter contains describes how you can 
respond to this consultation. Note that the consultation period on the Project will end at 17:00 
on 22nd September 2017 (inclusive). 
 
Following the end of the consultation period and receipt of consultee responses, MPL will have 
regard to the comments received when finalising the application for submission under the Planning 
Act 2008. 
 
1 Introduction to the Project 
 
MPL proposes to develop a Power Generation Plant in the Rookery South Pit, near the villages of 
Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.   
 
The Power Generation Plant will be capable of generating up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to 
power the equivalent of 150,000 homes. Using the latest and most efficient power generating 
technology, it will burn natural gas to generate electricity that is delivered into the National Grid. 
The Project is intended to provide back-up power to the National Grid and support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. More information on the Project can be found at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/. The Project could enter commercial operation in 2022 subject to 
the outcome of the public consultation exercise, receipt of planning consent and financing.  
 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first stages of a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) planning application process in 2014 and MPL undertook a first phase of statutory 
consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (“Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation”). However, in March 2015, the Project was put on hold due to market and 
political uncertainty. There remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this 
country, and acknowledging this, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy 
company, Drax Group plc (“Drax”). It is MPL’s intention to submit an application for a DCO to the 
Planning Inspectorate (“PINS”) in Q4 2017.  
 
MPL is undertaking a further phase of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Statutory Consultation”) on 
the latest Project iteration, details of which can be found on the accompanying CD, which contains 
updated information on the Project, the design parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.

1.1 The Applicant   
 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited which established MPL to develop the Project at 
Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire. Drax is seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook 
and elsewhere in the UK to support the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by plugging 
the gaps created by intermittent renewables. For more information, refer to Section 1.3 of the 
enclosed PEIR NTS.  
 
1.2 Development Consent Order   
 
The Project will require a DCO under the Planning Act 2008. This is because the capacity of the 
power plant will be more than 50 MW and it therefore falls within the definition of a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008. Development 
consent for a NSIP (which can include consent for associated development that the NSIP may 
require) may only be granted by a DCO. The DCO will permit the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project.   
 
The decision-maker for any DCO application is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) rather than the Local Planning Authority.  DCO 
applications are therefore submitted to the Secretary of State via PINS. Once accepted, an 
application will be considered over a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority 
(comprising Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Examining 
Authority will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State as to whether or not an application should be granted development consent. 
Therefore, the final decision on an application is made by the Secretary of State. 
 
MPL anticipates submitting the DCO application for the Project in Q4 2017. The application would 
then be examined over the course of 2018, with a decision from the Secretary of State likely to be 
issued in mid-2019. 
 
2 The Project  
 
The Project consists of three main elements:  
 
A. A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 
299 MW. This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export 
into the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;  
 
a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);   
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’);  
 
B. A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (“NTS”) (the “Gas Connection”). This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (“AGI”) at the point of connection to the NTS. Further 
details of the Gas Connection are provided in Section 2.4 of the enclosed PEIR NTS; and 
 
C. A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS (the 
“Electrical Connection”). This element could be delivered in one of two ways although both 
 
 
4 
options comprise underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. Further details 
of both Electrical Connection options are provided in Section 5 of this letter and Section 2.5 of 
the enclosed PEIR NTS. The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8ha no 
matter which option is used.  
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation   
 
The Government’s policy in relation to NSIPs is set out in a series of National Policy Statements 
(“NPSs”). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy NPSs, in particular 
EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  
 
NPS EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that “Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply”.  
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy.  The proposed power plant will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power. 
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs set out above and is therefore not 
proposed as a topic for this consultation.  PEIR NTS Section 1.4 “Need for the Project” provides 
further discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 Environmental Information   
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘2009 EIA Regulations’) to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
 
The EIA will consider the likely significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the 
Project relating to matters including air and water quality, noise, landscape and visual impact, 
traffic, local ecology, archaeology and heritage, and socio-economics. An Environmental Statement 
(“ES”) will be submitted with the DCO application.  
 
The Project falls under the 2009 EIA Regulations regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (2017 EIA Regulations) regime. This is 
because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 2009 EIA 
Regulations before the commencement of the 2017 EIA Regulations. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the 2017 EIA Regulations, the 
2009 EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 10 of the 2009 EIA Regulations, MPL has prepared the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information gathered to date and provides the results of a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. This includes the cumulative effects of the Project together with 
relevant proposed but not yet implemented projects including the Rookery South RRF Project. The 
Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). The PEIR also 
includes a preliminary assessment of the residual effects of the Project once proposed mitigation 
measures have been taken into account. 
 
 
 
5 
The PEIR does not set out the final findings but does include information on the preliminary 
mitigation measures proposed.  For information on the preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project, the relevant sections of the enclosed PEIR NTS are 
as follows:   
 
 3.2 Air Quality  
 3.3 Noise and Vibration 
 3.4 Ecology  
 3.5 Water Quality and Resources  
 3.6 Ground Conditions  
 3.7 Landscape and Visual Impact 
 3.8 Traffic and Transport  
 3.9 Historic Environment 
 3.10 Socio-Economics  
 3.11 Other Topics Considered 
 
 
5 Options for the Proposed Project  
 
The design that will form the basis of the application in Q4 of 2017 will not be a final, detailed 
design but one developed using the "Rochdale Envelope" approach within which the Project can be 
constructed. A series of design parameters has been incorporated into the Project to provide MPL 
with sufficient flexibility to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured 
from a range of suppliers.  
 
The application is therefore being prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. Further details are provided in Section 3.1 of the enclosed PEIR. Advice 
Note 9 can be accessed via the PINS website at: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.   
 
PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the Project Site and all elements of the Project including the Generating 
Equipment Site, Electrical Connection Site, Gas Connection Site and Power Generation Plant Site.  
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant 
 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is located within Rookery South Pit and covers an area of 
approximately 4 ha. PEIR Figure 1.2 shows the location of the Power Generation Plant Site 
although the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The precise position and alignment 
of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after this consultation has closed, having regard to 
the responses received and the further environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on the indicative location of the Power Generation Plant would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection  
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to be imported to 
the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW. The proposed 
route for the Gas Connection is shown in the PEIR Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described in Section 
2.4 of the PEIR NTS. PEIR Figure 12.2 shows the two options for accessing the Gas Connection. 
As such, your views on the preferred Gas Connection access would be welcome.  
 
5.3 Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable power to be 
exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. There are two connection options which 
 
 
6 
both use underground cables to connect the Substation to the existing 400 kV overhead line. 
Figures 3.1a and 3.1b in the PEIR show an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with Electrical Connection options 1 and 2 respectively, both of which 
include underground cables and no additional transmission towers (pylons). Your comments on the 
proposed Electrical Connection options would be welcome.  
 
5.4 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage of the Project's development, MPL notes that the DCO application may seek the 
compulsory acquisition (“CA”) of land and rights over land (including rights to use land) for the 
Project together with temporary possession of land during the construction and commissioning 
periods. MPL is commencing and/or continuing discussions with those persons who may be 
affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of 
the DCO application.   
 
5.5. The Rookery South RRF Project  
 
The Rookery South RRF Project is another project, promoted by a separate developer, Covanta 
Rookery South Limited (“Covanta”), which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. 
The Rookery South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the “RRF Order”).  
 
The Project sits within part of the application boundary for the RRF Order. This means that there 
would be an overlap between the RRF Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State 
for the Project. MPL has engaged with Covanta through the development of the Project and is 
developing its DCO application for the Project to allow both schemes to successfully coexist. As 
part of this process, MPL intends to submit a draft DCO that would amend the RRF Order. MPL’s 
PEIR takes full account of the Rookery South RRF Project as part of its assessment of potential 
cumulative environmental effects. The Project Overview document provides further details of the 
Rookery South RRF Project and explains how MPL intends to address the interrelationship 
between the two Projects.  
 
6 Consultation 
 
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is a key part of the DCO process and 
will help to influence the final design of the Project. MPL undertook both statutory and non-statutory 
consultation on the Project in 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. Further details of the 
Phase 1 Consultation undertaken with statutory consultees and the local community can be found 
in Section 2 of the enclosed Project Overview document. MPL has had regard to all feedback 
received during this consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the need 
for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); 
 
 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of 5 units 
to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on nearby 
homes; 
 
 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land; and 
 
 
 
7 
 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing during 
construction to minimise impact on the road network. 
 
As described above, the Project design has evolved significantly since the Phase 1 Consultation 
was undertaken in 2014. Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project, as well 
as to inform stakeholders and the public of the principal changes to the Project that have been 
made following consideration of the consultation responses from 2014, MPL is undertaking a 
further round of statutory consultation (“Phase 2 Consultation”).  
 
The information within the enclosed PEIR contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process. We wish to seek your views about the Project, 
including the findings of the preliminary environmental studies described in the PEIR.  
 
You may wish to note that as part of its community consultation under section 47 of the Planning 
Act 2008, MPL has published a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) which can be found 
at www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
 
7 How to respond 
 
The extended Phase 2 statutory consultation period on the Project will end at 17:00 on 22nd 
September 2017, and we would therefore welcome your views on the Project by this date and time.

Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 This document is the non-technical summary (PEIR NTS) of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for the proposed Millbrook Power 
Project (hereafter referred to as the Project). It has been prepared by Peter 
Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) (the 
"Applicant"). 
1.1.2 The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  The boundary of the Project 
Site falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC) areas.  
1.1.3 The location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1 
1.1.4 The Project would comprise: 
• 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 Generating equipment including up to five Gas Turbine Generators, up 
to five exhaust gas flue stacks  and balance of plant, which are located 
within the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating 
Equipment"); 
 A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the "Access Road");  
 A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
• 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"); 
and 
• 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the "Electrical Connection"). 
1.1.5 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  
1.1.6 The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’ and are 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary

all integral to the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that 
electricity to the National Grid. The land upon which the Project would be 
developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of 
the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. 
1.1.7 All elements of the Project are shown on Figure 1.2.  
1.1.8 The Generating Equipment would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means it 
would operate intermittently, with maximum operation not exceeding 1,500 
hours per year. A peaking plant is designed to operate when there is a surge 
in demand for electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. when a large 
number of people boil their kettles following the end of a popular TV 
programme) or when there is a sudden drop in power being generated from 
power stations which are constantly in operation. It will also support 
intermittent forms of renewable energy which are weather dependent (e.g. 
wind and solar). 
1.1.9 The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 which means that a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The proposed DCO 
Application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate who 
will make a recommendation on whether the DCO should be granted to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Secretary of State) with 
whom the final decision lies. It is anticipated that the DCO Application will be 
submitted in the first quarter of 2015.The PEIR and this PEIR NTS have been 
prepared in accordance with Regulation 2 and 10 of the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact) Assessment Regulations (the "EIA 
Regulations").  They present information specifically aimed at assisting 
consultees and local communities to understand the nature, scale and location 
of the Project. 
1.1.10 Copies of the PEIR and this PEIR NTS may be examined during a 
consultation exercise being carried out by the Applicant between 13th October 
2014 until 16th November 2014 at Central Bedfordshire Council Office (Priory

1.2 
Purpose of this Document 
1.2.1 An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is being undertaken to determine 
the likely significant effects of the Project on the environment. The purpose of 
the PEIR is to present preliminary environmental information relating to the 
Project, including the preliminary findings of the assessments undertaken to 
date together with a summary of the additional information or studies required 
to complete the EIA. This will enable consultees, including the local 
community, to understand the likely significant environmental effects of the 
Project so they can provide a comprehensive response to the consultation.  
Feedback received during the consultation process will help inform the 
development and design of the Project and further refine the EIA. 
1.2.2 Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations, the Applicant must consult on 
preliminary information relating to the Project.  The consultation responses 
received to date have been considered and referenced in the PEIR as 
summarised in this PEIR NTS. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary

1.2.3 Once complete, the findings of the EIA will be reported in full in the 
Environmental Statement (ES) to be submitted with the application for 
Development Consent. 
1.2.4 This document is a summary (in non-technical language) of the PEIR for the 
Project. 
1.3 
The Developer 
1.3.1 The Applicant is MPL, which has been set up to develop the Project and has 
been established by Watt Power Limited (WPL). WPL has been established to 
develop flexible gas-fired power stations, designed to meet the Government’s 
energy policy objectives of security of supply and affordability, in support of 
the UK's transition to a low carbon economy. 
1.3.2 For further details on MPL please visit: http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk or 
http://www.wattpowerltd.co.uk. 
1.4 
Need for the Project 
1.4.1 National planning policy supports the need for new electricity infrastructure 
due to the current ageing and inevitable closure of older coal fired power 
plants and the likely increase in demand for electricity over the coming 
decades. 
1.4.2 The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs).  NPS EN-1 (the overarching energy NPS) states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector - providing vital 
flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply (paragraph 3.6.2)". 
1.4.3 Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants provide back-up to power generation 
from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly 
prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired power plants are 
among the most efficient and cleanest forms of generating electricity. 
1.4.4 Indications from the Government, in key documents (e.g. the ‘Gas Generation 
Strategy’, released by DECC in December 20121) are that up to 26 gigawatts 
(GW) of new gas generation will be needed nationally by 2030 to underpin 
long term electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind 
generation at times of peak demand.

1.5 
Planning Policy Context 
1.5.1 The PEIR and this PEIR NTS have been prepared with reference to all 
relevant European, national, regional and local policy.   Details of these are 
contained in Section 3 of the PEIR.  
1.5.2 As referred to in paragraph 1.4.2 above, the Department for Energy and 
Climate Change has published a number of NPSs in relation to energy 
infrastructure, which were designated by the Secretary of State in July 2011. 
These NPSs set out national policy against which proposals for NSIPs are 
assessed and decided on. 
1.5.3 Due to the nature of the Project (which will generate over 50 MW of 
electricity), four of the designated NPSs are considered relevant to the 
determination of the proposed DCO Application: 
� 
NPS for Energy EN-1: This sets out national policy for energy 
infrastructure as defined by the Planning Act 2008, which provides the 
primary basis for decisions by the Secretary of State; 
� 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure EN-2: This sets 
out policies specific to the determination of applications for fossil fuel 
electricity generating infrastructure; 
� 
NPS for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This 
sets Government policy on the relevant considerations and factors that 
should be taken into account as to route selection for developers for, inter 
alia, gas pipelines; and 
� 
NPS for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5): This provides the 
primary basis for decisions taken by the Secretary of State on applications 
it receives for electricity network NSIPs, including the relevant 
considerations and factors that should be taken into account related to 
route selection. 
1.5.4 NPS EN-1 states that consideration may be given to planning policy outside 
the NPSs where it is important and relevant to the Secretary of State's 
decision. Other national planning policies have therefore been considered in 
the preparation of the PEIR as these may be relevant to the determination of 
the proposed DCO Application.

Site and Project Description 
2.1 
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.1 The Project Site is shown in Figure 1.2 and encompasses all elements of the 
Project described in Section 1.1 of this PEIR NTS. 
2.1.2 The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection would be situated on land within former clay pits known as ‘The 
Rookery’. The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes 
and Bedford, approximately 3 km north-west of Ampthill, and 7 km south west 
of Bedford.  
2.1.3 The Rookery comprises two large former clay pits, Rookery North and 
Rookery South Pits. The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts 
of the Access Road and Gas and Electrical Connections would be located 
within Rookery South Pit. Part of the Access Road would lie within Rookery 
North Pit. 
2.1.4 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within the 
areas identified on Figure 1.2 and would extend from Rookery South Pit into 
agricultural land to the south and/or east. 
2.1.5 To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, 
which provides indoor and outdoor community amenities. There is a Forest 
Centre within the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park located just to the 
south of Stewartby Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor and 
outdoor community amenities. In addition Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle 
testing ground, is located to the south-west of the Project Site. 
2.1.6 The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 150 m to the west of the Project Site. To 
the north of Green Lane and The Rookery, lies Stewartby. Other neighbouring 
residential areas include: Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5 km to the 
east of the Project Site boundary; Marston Moretaine approximately 1.2 km to 
the west of the Project Site boundary; and Millbrook approximately 400 m to 
the south of the Project Site boundary. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.1.7 The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) being undertaken by the landowner.  This was the subject of a 
separate planning permission and would be taking place regardless of the 
Applicant's proposals for the Project. The objective of the LLRS is to restore 
the former clay workings to low grade agriculture. This would be achieved 
through the restoration of The Rookery at a low level (i.e. below pre-
excavation ground levels), with measures included in the restoration to 
enhance biodiversity and landscape. Further details of the LLRS are described 
in Section 2.6 of the PEIR.

2.2 
Generating Equipment Technology 
2.2.1 The Generating Equipment would provide a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW, operate as a peaking plant fired on natural gas, and run up to 1500 hours 
per annum. Given these parameters, it has been determined that a Simple 
Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant is the preferred and most appropriate 
technology choice for the Generating Equipment for the Project. Further detail 
is provided in Section 3.3 of this PEIR NTS and Section 2.3 of the PEIR and a 
schematic showing SCGT operation is shown below in Insert 1. 
2.2.2 There are several technology options of SCGT plant available to generate up 
to 299 MW. These different options mainly relate to the number and type of 
Gas Turbine Generators used. 
2.2.3 SCGT plant often use aero-derivative Gas Turbine Generators (i.e. turbines 
derived from the aeronautical industry), primarily because of their suitability to 
frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and easy maintenance. However, 
‘industrial’ type units can also be used. These are typically larger and often 
more suited to longer operational hours. For the Project it is envisaged that 
either 3, 4 or 5 individual aero-derivative Gas Turbine Generators or, 
alternatively 1 or 2 industrial Gas Turbine Generators will be used to generate 
up to 299 MW.  
2.2.4 The Power Generation Plant will have up to five gas turbine generators and up 
to five stacks, each between 30 and 40 m in height. 
2.2.5 Section 3.1.3 sets out the worst case scenario of the Project from the above 
parameters which has been assessed in the topic sections.  
2.2.6 The main equipment in an SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising of 
the following components(shown in Insert 1): 
� 
 Inlet air filter; 
� 
 Air compressor 
� 
Combustion chamber; 
� 
Gas turbine; and 
� 
Exhaust silencer. 
2.2.7 In the gas turbines air is compressed and natural gas is injected. The fuel will 
then burn in the combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. 
This gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine which drives the 
electrical generators to produce electricity. The exhaust silencer will reduce 
noise pollution from this process. 
2.2.8 The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released to the 
atmosphere via stacks. The stack(s) will be equipped with emissions control 
technologies which will reduce emissions released to the atmosphere

2.2.9 In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator Units at the Generating Equipment 
Site the following integral plant and buildings will also be present and can be 
seen on Insert 2. 
� 
Fire Water Tank: in order to control any fire at the Power Generation 
Plant Site; 
� 
A Control Building: Required in order to monitor the Generating 
Equipment operation and house plant controls; 
� 
A Workshop and Stores Building: To store certain strategic and routine 
maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out minor 
maintenance of the Generating Equipment;  
� 
A Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc; 
� 
An Electrical Banking Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Power Generation Plant to transformers before 
export to the National Grid; and 
� 
A Gas Receiving Installation: Required to regulate gas coming from the 
NTS to feed into the Generating Equipment Site at the right flow and 
pressure conditions.

2.3 
Gas Connection 
2.3.1 A new underground gas pipeline is required to connect the Generating 
Equipment to the existing NTS to provide a reliable supply of fuel. 
2.3.2 After detailed feasibility studies, it has been determined that there are two 
suitable Gas Connection options, as shown on Figure 1.2. Further details of 
these feasibility studies are provided in Section 2 of the PEIR. 
2.3.3 Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 ("Option 1”) is the current preferred 
option to connect the Generating Equipment to the National Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS) as it is of a shorter length and avoids crossing 
the railway line.   
2.3.4 As an alternative to the current preferred Option 1, other options that the 
Applicant considers are less technically and environmentally preferable are 
still potentially deliverable, being the Gas Connection Route Corridor 2 
("Option 2").  Although Option 2 has not been defined in as much detail as 
Option 1, it has been included within the redline boundary for the Project as 
the Applicant has not as yet made any final decisions on the location of the 
routing of the Gas Connection.  The final routing will be finalised following 
consultation and further assessment work.

2.4 
Electrical Connection 
2.4.1 A new electrical connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Generating Equipment to be exported to the National Grid. The most 
suitable point of connection would be a new substation (likely to be located 
adjacent to the Generating Equipment within Rookery South Pit), which would 
connect in to the line of the existing National Grid 400 kV overhead line which 
runs from Sundon to Grendon.  The 400 kV line is located approximately 320 
m southwest of the Project Site and is shown on Figure 1.2.  
2.4.2 For the purposes of the assessments undertaken to date a realistic worst case 
scenario of to two overhead line double circuits (including up to seven new 
towers one of which will replace an existing tower resulting in a net addition of 
six towers) has been assumed and assessed for the connection between the 
substation and the NETS. However, the Applicant will continue to work with 
National Grid on the indicative design of the Electrical Connection over the 
coming months.    
2.4.3 
In conjunction with the construction of the Electrical Connection a temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line located adjacent to the three most 
westerly existing transmission towers within the Project Site may be required.  
It is anticipated that the temporary diversion is likely to be constructed as a 
single circuit outage of the existing 400 kV line. The circuit is likely to comprise 
between one and up to four Lindsey towers, each being approximately up to 
39 m high. The temporary works may also include the temporary erection of 
scaffolding over Station Lane.  
2.4.4 
Access for the purposes of installing and dismantling the temporary diversion 
would be as described for the Electrical Connection above. At this stage, it is 
anticipated that the installing and dismantling of the temporary works may 
require a closure of Station Lane for a number of hours and that the temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line would be in place for approximately three 
months.   
2.4.5 Insert 2 below shows a 3D visualisation of an indicative layout of the Project, 
including the worst case Electrical Connection that has been assessed.

2.5 
Alternatives 
Sites 
2.5.1 The Applicant has looked at a range of sites around the UK to support power 
generation plants being of the same nature as the Project. The key factors 
which were considered necessary in a site were broadly four fold: technical 
(e.g. the size of the site and the proximity to appropriate gas and electrical 
connection points), environmental, economic and whether the proposals would 
be in line with local planning policy. 
2.5.2 Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons:  
� 
Close proximity to the NTS; 
� 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead line) 
(NETS); 
� 
The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, lying 
below ground level; 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
14 
 
� 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
� 
It has a well-developed road network for access to the Project Site; 
� 
The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; and  
� 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
integral infrastructure. 
Generating Equipment  
2.5.3 Although other technology choices were considered for the Generating 
Equipment, SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for 
generating up to 299 MW as a peaking plant based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
� 
Visual impact: SCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and therefore are less visually 
intrusive in views from the surrounding environment; 
� 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is significantly 
lower than for CCGT plants; 
� 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant would typically 
be lower than for a Reciprocating Gas Engine (RGE) plant. A larger 
number of RGE units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site 
to generate up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
� 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that 
the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly cost 
effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
� 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to 
meeting variable demands. 
Gas Connection 
2.5.4 The Scoping Report for the Project2 described a gas connection ‘opportunity 
area’, to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which a new gas 
pipeline and AGI would be developed. Since the publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies have refined this opportunity area such that there are 
now two remaining Gas Connection options (as described in section 2 of the 
PEIR).  
2.5.5 These options have been chosen as the most direct connections between the 
Generating Equipment Site and the NTS, avoiding obstructions such as

roads, large changes in elevation, waterbodies and protected sites as much 
as possible.  
2.5.6 Option 1 is the preferred Gas Connection Corridor Route. This is because it is 
shorter (and therefore less expensive and less damaging to agricultural land), 
it avoids crossing the midland mainline railway line, and other high pressure 
gas pipelines. 
2.5.7 Nevertheless, Option 2 remains a viable alternative should further studies 
reveal any as yet unknown constraints on Option 1 such as previously 
undiscovered archaeological remains.  
2.5.8 Consultation feedback will be considered in determining which option is the 
most appropriate. 
Electrical Connection 
2.5.9 The Scoping Report for the Project described an electrical connection 
opportunity area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Since publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies have been undertaken to refine the available options.  
2.5.10 Based on these studies, it has been determined that the most suitable 
location for the substation is likely to be next to the Generating Equipment 
Site within Rookery South Pit. However, a number of options still exist on the 
best way to connect the substation to the existing NETS.   The Applicant will 
continue to work with the National Grid on the indicative design of the 
Electrical Connection over the coming months.

Assessment findings  
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 This section sets out, by topic area, a summary in non-technical language, of 
the preliminary findings of the assessment of likely significant environmental 
effects of the Project. It is based on information gathered from studies to date 
and will be updated and revised following further work with the final results 
reported in the ES.  
3.1.2 Throughout the following sections, the terms construction, operation and 
decommissioning have been used. These are defined as follows: 
� 
Construction – Construction of the Project. Depending on the final plant 
selection, this is anticipated to take approximately 22 months; 
� 
Operation – Operation of all aspects of the Project, including maintenance. 
The Project is anticipated to have a lifetime of approximately 25 years; and 
� 
Decommissioning – Removal of some plant items and site reinstatement 
when the Project has reached the end of its operational life. This is 
anticipated to take a similar time to construction. 
3.1.3 The following assumptions have been made prior to and in the carrying out of 
the preliminary assessment: 
� 
Embedded mitigation will be employed - namely design/standard control 
measures, such as working within best practice guidance, which will 
routinely be incorporated for the Project or for any similar project 
constructed in the UK, and as such will be used to produce the initial 
assessment as to the likely significant effects of the Project. Embedded 
mitigation includes the implementation of a construction environmental 
management plan (CEMP) which is a document designed to ensure best 
practice working methods are maintained on construction sites so that any 
risk of causing environmental harm is minimised as far as is reasonably 
practicable, such as spill prevention plans, correct storage of waste and 
prevention of pollution to land, air and water.  
� 
A worst case scenario for assessment has been undertaken for each 
topic. For the majority of topics this worst case scenario assumes that up 
to five Gas Turbine Generators will be built on the Generating Equipment 
Site, each with their own stack being up to 40 m in height. For air quality 
and ecology, a worst case scenario has been assessed assuming that up 
to five Gas Turbine Generators will be built on the Generating Equipment 
Site, each with their own stack being up to 30 m in height. This is because 
a lower stack gives rise to potentially more significant emissions. Further 
detail is provided in Section 6.2 of the PEIR. It has also been assumed 
that the Electrical Connection will include two overhead line double 
circuits, including up to seven new transmission towers one of which will

be replacing an existing tower and is likely to be located in close proximity 
to the location of that existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net additional 
towers, each of up to 45 m high.  
� 
The total construction programme will be approximately 22 months, with a 
start date of 2017 and an end date of 2019;  
� 
The operational life of the Power Generation Plant will be 25 years; 
� 
The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at the 
end of its operational life; 
� 
The Gas Pipeline will be left in situ at the end of its operational life;  
� 
The decommissioning phase will be similar in duration to the construction 
phase; 
� 
The Power Generation Plant will operate for up to 1500 hours per year. 
This could be at any time during the year and for any length of time up to 
1500 hours; 
� 
The Power Generation Plant will have a rated electrical output of between 
50 and up to 299 MW; 
� 
Current surrounding land uses do not change, with the exception of the 
developments to be cumulatively assessed with the Project that have been 
identified as referred to at section 3.1.5 below; 
� 
Assessments are based on published sources of information and primary 
data collection. 
3.1.4 The following topic sections are covered by this assessment: 
� 
Air Quality; 
� 
Noise; 
� 
Ecology; 
� 
Water Quality and Resources; 
� 
Ground Conditions; 
� 
Landscape and Visual Impacts; 
� 
Traffic and Transport; 
� 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage;  
� 
Socio-economics; and  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
18 
 
� 
Other topics considered, including waste and electromagnetic frequency 
(EMF).  
3.1.5 Schedule 4, Part 1 (para 20) of the EIA Regulations requires an ES to include 
"....a description of the likely significant effects of the development on the 
environment, which should cover......cumulative effects".  For the assessment 
of cumulative effects, the effects of the Project, together with other major 
developments that are proposed or consented but not yet built have been 
assessed. The developments which have been assessed cumulatively 
include:  
� 
The proposed Covanta RRF Project to be developed to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
� 
Integrated Waste Management Operations at Rookery South, 
Bedfordshire; 
� 
Brogborough Wind Energy Project at Brogborough Landfill Site; 
� 
Land at Moreteyne Farm at Wood End in Marston Moretaine; 
� 
Land at Warrant Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill proposed for residential 
properties; 
� 
Land East and West of Broadmead Road, Stewartby proposed for 
residential properties - under construction; and 
� 
The new settlement at Wixams. 
3.1.6 As part of the initial scoping of the EIA it was determined that certain topics 
are more likely to give rise to potential significant cumulative effects than 
others, based on the nature of the Project and surrounding development 
proposals. Therefore certain topic assessments have focused specifically, at 
this preliminary stage of the assessment, on potential cumulative effects and 
interactions.  These topics are air quality, noise, traffic and landscape and 
visual effects.  For example, air quality may give rise to a potential cumulative 
effect given that there are emissions from the Generating Equipment and also 
potential emissions from, for example, the proposed Covanta RRF Project. 
3.1.7 For those remaining topics where cumulative effects and interactions are 
unlikely, due for example to the limited geographical nature or significance of 
the potential effect, potential cumulative effects have been considered at a 
commentary level only at this preliminary stage and will be considered in detail 
as the assessment is completed. An example of this is in relation to ground 
conditions where there will be no significant effects arising from the Project 
and therefore no potential cumulative effects are anticipated.

3.2 
Air Quality 
Introduction  
3.2.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect air quality both through the generation of dust during the 
construction and decommissioning phases and the generation of stack 
emissions during operation. 
3.2.2 A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling have been 
carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from the Project 
on identified residential and ecological receptors. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.2.3 The main potential effects resulting from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project on air quality are from dust generated from construction activities 
(e.g. excavation for new foundations, excavation of the gas pipeline route and 
excavation for the electrical towers). There is also a small potential for effects 
arising from exhaust emissions from construction traffic. 
3.2.4 However, based on the preliminary assessment, it is considered unlikely that 
levels of atmospheric dust would be generated which would constitute a health 
hazard or nuisance to local people, ecology or industry in the vicinity of the 
Project Site. The limited numbers of vehicle movements associated with the 
project also means that there is not anticipated to be any impacts from 
exhaust emissions. Impacts would be minimised through implementation of a 
Construction Environmental Management Plant (CEMP), which would 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather. 
Additionally, the majority of particulates from construction activities settle 
within a very short distance of the construction site. Therefore, effects on 
receptors further afield from the Project Site will be negligible.  
Operation 
3.2.5 The main potential effects arising from operation of the Project are associated 
with the stack emissions arising as a result of the combustion of natural gas in 
the Generating Equipment. Emissions from the stack(s) include Nitrous 
Oxides (NOx). 
3.2.6 However, modern gas fired power plant are inherently clean and produce far 
fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. coal) when compared 
on an energy output basis. Emissions of NOx are strictly limited under national 
and international guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive. 
Operation of the Generating Equipment will also be regulated by the 
Environment Agency under an Environmental Permit, which will limit 
emissions in line with national guidelines.  
3.2.7 Initial air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height which 
will achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits and prevent 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
20 
 
any impacts to identified receptors is between 30 m and 40 m. It is concluded, 
therefore, that effects on air quality during operation will be negligible. 
3.2.8 Emissions during the operational phase of the Gas Connection will potentially 
include infrequent emissions of natural gas and also minor emissions from 
vehicles accessing the above ground installation (AGI) for maintenance 
reasons. In terms of the Electrical Connection, very infrequent maintenance 
visits will also take place. There is therefore a very limited scope for potential 
impacts on air quality from the Gas connection or Electrical Connection.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.2.9 The only development in the vicinity of the Project from the list set out in 
paragraph 3.1.5 above which has the potential to cumulatively interact in 
terms of air quality are  the Covanta RRF Project and the Integrated waste 
management facilities planned for Rookery South Pit. The other developments 
listed are at such a distance from the Project Site so as to not to give rise to 
the potential for cumulative effects. However, very few details are available 
about the Integrated waste management facilities as at present only a Scoping 
Report has been submitted which is a high level outline conceptual design. 
Should further information on the scheme become available, then a more 
detailed cumulative assessment will be undertaken in the ES.  
3.2.10 There is also the potential that the Covanta RRF Project and the Project could 
operate simultaneously, giving rise to cumulative effects through combined 
stack emissions. However, initial modelling has been undertaken which has 
shown that given the proposed differences in stack heights between the 
Project and the Covanta RRF Project, no cumulative effects in terms of air 
quality are anticipated. Furthermore, the Covanta RRF Project will incorporate 
similar controls on dust during construction, so that no cumulative effects 
during construction are predicted either.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.2.11 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on air quality as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. A more detailed assessment will be 
undertaken for the EIA which will provide further information on the potential 
for any impacts on air quality arising from the Project. Further work will include 
a more detailed assessment of cumulative effects with other projects, as well 
as the production of figures accurately showing the distribution of stack 
emissions.  
3.3 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
3.3.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect local noise levels and generate vibration, which may affect 
sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
21 
 
3.3.2 A desk based assessment, noise survey and preliminary noise modelling have 
been undertaken at the nearest noise sensitive receptor (South Pillinge Farm) 
(approximately 150 m west of the Project Site) to assess the potential noise 
effects that may be caused by the Project. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.3.3 Construction and decommissioning activity inevitably leads to some degree of 
noise disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities. Noise at 
the Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from 
e.g. excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation of the Gas 
Connection. This will however be a temporary source of noise. Based on a 
conservative, worst case assessment, where numerous large plant items are 
operating simultaneously, the significance of the overall effect of construction 
and decommissioning noise from the Power Generation Plant is predicted to 
be neutral at all receptor locations following the implementation of embedded 
mitigation measures which include:  
� 
All calculations for construction noise assume a 10 dB reduction due to 
use of an appropriately placed acoustic screen, which is typical of this type 
of construction / decommissioning activity. 
� 
Inherent best practice plant design incorporating acoustic enclosures to 
limit operational noise.  
� 
Implementation of a CEMP; 
� 
Use of appropriately maintained plant and equipment during construction, 
decommissioning and operation.  
3.3.4 Additionally, further noise mitigation is available in the form of programming of 
construction activities not to occur simultaneously, utilising a temporary noise 
bund and using quieter equipment. 
Operation 
3.3.5 During operation, noise disturbance could potentially occur from the rotating 
components of the Generating Equipment (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator 
units) when operational. There may also be a limited amount of noise from the 
Access Road from the small number of vehicles associated with the operation 
of the Generating Equipment, although this will not be significant when 
compared to the existing traffic noise.  
3.3.6 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken 
at South Pillinge Farm were modelled alongside noise levels predicted for 
typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the Project. 
3.3.7 This preliminary assessment has shown that there are not predicted to be any 
significant noise effects at South Pillinge Farm. As this is the closest property 
to the Generating Equipment Site, it therefore follows that, by proxy, no 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
22 
 
significant effects from noise are predicted at any other properties in close 
proximity to the Generating Equipment Site.  
3.3.8 During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the gas 
AGI. This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the AGI regulates 
the flow of gas from the NTS to the Power Generation Plant. 
3.3.9 This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to the AGI. 
Given that there are no residential properties in close proximity to the current 
preferred location for the AGI, based on the preliminary assessment, it is 
considered that the operational noise from the Gas Connection would be 
neutral. 
3.3.10 At this preliminary stage of the EIA, no impacts are anticipated from operation 
of the Electrical Connection, given the distance between the Electrical 
Connection and residential properties (approximately 100 m minimum), and 
the typically low levels of noise generated from such electrical equipment. 
However, these studies will be further refined and a more detailed assessment 
undertaken and presented in the final ES.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.3.11 The only development in the vicinity of the Project which has the potential to 
cause a cumulative effect in terms of noise is the Covanta RRF Project and 
the Integrated waste management facilities at Rookery South pit, given the 
distance from the Project of the other developments listed in Section 3.1.5, as 
well as their nature. However, very few details are available about the 
Integrated waste management facilities as at present only a Scoping Report 
has been submitted which is a high level outline conceptual design. Should 
further information on the scheme become available, then a more detailed 
cumulative assessment will be undertaken in the ES.  
3.3.12 Initial modelling has been undertaken which has shown that given the noise 
limits which the Covanta RRF Project must adhere to, added to the predicted 
noise from the Project, no cumulative effects are anticipated during 
construction or operation.  However, this will be further assessed as part of the 
ES.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.3.13 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated from noise as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to carry out 
background monitoring at more potential sensitive receptors, as well as better 
defining any potential effects from operation of the Electrical Connection, and 
quantifying cumulative effects with the Covanta RRF Project.

3.4 
Ecology 
Introduction 
3.4.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect sensitive ecological receptors. The Project also has the 
potential to provide ecological value, for example, by reinforcing existing 
habitats or through the introduction of screen planting, which could provide 
additional habitat for some species. 
3.4.2 In order to assess the potential for the Project to affect sensitive ecological 
receptors, desk studies and site walkover studies known as a “Phase 1 habitat 
surveys” were undertaken.  
3.4.3 Once the Phase 1 habitat surveys were completed, the resulting information 
obtained from them was then used to inform species specific surveys termed 
“Phase 2 protected species surveys”. These surveys involved field based 
assessments to determine the presence / absence of notable species and 
their population size if present. 
3.4.4 Phase 2 surveys have been undertaken for the following species:  
� 
Invertebrates; 
� 
Great Crested Newts; 
� 
Breeding Birds; 
� 
Reptiles; 
� 
Bats 
� 
Otters and Water Voles; and  
� 
Badgers.  
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.4.5 The potential effects on ecological receptors during the construction phase are 
likely to be from indirect noise, vibration and lighting, as well as direct 
disturbance of habitats. However, work is being carried out (as part of the 
LLRS scheme) to translocate certain ecological species, (for example, Great 
Crested Newts) from the Project Site so that by the time the Project starts 
construction, the Power Generation Plant Site will be void of ecological value. 
Furthermore, the areas where the Gas and Electrical Connection would be 
located have been found to be of limited ecological value.  
3.4.6 Furthermore, mitigation measures would be put in place to further limit 
potential impacts to ecology, including the careful timing of vegetation removal 
(outside of times when species are active) and maintaining an appropriate 
buffer around sensitive ecological sites during construction works. Therefore, 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
24 
 
based on the preliminary assessment, no effects are predicted as a result of 
construction or decommissioning of the Project.  
Operation 
3.4.7 During operation, the main potential effects on ecological receptors are likely 
to result from stack emissions impacting on sensitive ecological sites through 
acid deposition. However, air quality modelling has shown that setting the 
stack height of between 30 and 40 m will not result in any impacts to sensitive 
ecological sites. Therefore, no effects are predicted from operation of the 
Project.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.4.8 The preliminary assessment has shown that it is unlikely that there will be any 
ecological impacts as a result of the Project.  Accordingly then, based on this 
preliminary assessment, given that the Project alone is not anticipated to  give 
rise to any ecological effects, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result 
in or contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects 
with other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is 
anticipated that no cumulative effects assessment is required.    
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.4.9 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on ecological receptors as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to finalise the 
Phase 2 surveys, as at the time of writing, there are still some outstanding 
surveys to undertake for invertebrates and bats. The results of the completed 
surveys will be included in the ES. 
3.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
3.5.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect water quality and resources, for example through 
introduction of pollutants and sediments to watercourses or for the Project to 
be impacted by flooding. 
3.5.2 A desk based assessment has been carried out with regards to water quality 
and resources. This has identified all surface water resources within the 
vicinity of the Project Site, as well as previous pollution incidents which may 
have impacted on water bodies. The potential for the Project to be impacted 
by flooding, or for development of the Project to result in an increased 
likelihood of flooding occurring elsewhere has also been assessed.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.5.3 Based on the preliminary environmental assessment data, the main potential 
impacts that may result from construction and decommissioning of the Project 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
25 
 
are contaminated material entering a surface water body or for the Generating 
Equipment Site to become inundated with flood water. 
3.5.4 However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified as best practice working methods and mitigation will be employed. 
These mitigation measures include having appropriate spill response plans in 
place, the refuelling of vehicles away from watercourses and the siting of 
stockpiles and materials away from watercourses. The Gas Connection will 
need to potentially cross one minor watercourse (a drainage ditch). In order to 
minimise adverse effects best practice would be employed during construction 
of the Gas Connection to protect the water environment, in accordance with 
guidelines published by the Environment Agency and Internal Drainage Board. 
These include re-routing of drainage ditches if necessary and undertaking 
work at a time of year when ditches are likely to have lowest flow (e.g. 
summer).  
3.5.5 It is predicted that following the implementation of embedded mitigation and 
best practice construction methods referred to above, any effects on water 
quality and resources will be negligible. 
Operation 
3.5.6 During operation, the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a 
surface water drainage system and a sewerage system. The surface water 
drainage system would remove any potentially polluted runoff through the use 
of oil interceptors and silt traps, prior to reaching the main sewerage network.  
3.5.7 Due to the very limited water demand of the Power Generation Plant once 
operational (only required for fire water tanks and cleaning the blades of the 
Gas Turbine Generators), all water is anticipated to be tankered to the Power 
Generation Plant Site and stored in water storage tanks adjacent to the 
administration buildings. No surface water or groundwater abstraction would 
be required. 
3.5.8 Any water generated during washing will be retained on the Power Generation 
Plant Site in a storage tank and subsequently tankered off-site by a licensed 
contractor. 
3.5.9 Additionally, part of the LLRS works to Rookery Pit mean that any excess 
surface water (e.g. from a large storm event) will be effectively managed 
through the construction of a new surface water drainage system, which will 
discharge to an attenuation pond, therefore posing no risk to the Project Site 
from flooding. Further details regarding the LLRS drainage strategy are 
provided in Section 9.4 of the PEIR.  
3.5.10 Neither the Gas Connection nor Electrical Connection will require water during 
operation, nor will they have any impact on flooding or run off rates.  
3.5.11 It is predicted that any effects on water quality and resources during operation 
will therefore be negligible and therefore not significant. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary

Cumulative Effects 
3.5.12 Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
assessment has shown no significant effects on water quality and resources 
are anticipated to arise from the Project.  Accordingly then, given that the 
Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects on water quality and 
resources, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to 
any likely significant cumulative effects with other developments in the vicinity 
of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that no cumulative impacts 
assessment is required.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.5.13 Based on the preliminary assessment, no significant effects are anticipated on 
water quality and resources as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to produce a 
detailed flood risk assessment which will be submitted as a supporting 
document to the final ES.  
3.6 
Ground Conditions 
Introduction 
3.6.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect ground conditions, for example, the removal of good quality 
agricultural land or from contamination (existing or created) impacting on 
human health and other sensitive receptors. 
3.6.2 An initial desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline 
geology and ground conditions underlying the Project Site. The assessment 
studied information regarding previous land uses of the Project Site and the 
surrounding area, the soils and geology present at the Project Site, any 
potential contamination issues resulting from former site uses and any 
potential ground stability hazards. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.6.3 During construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential impacts 
on ground conditions will be from; 
� 
Disturbance of any existing contamination and therefore causing effects to 
receptors through the creation of pollution pathways; and 
� 
Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages. 
3.6.4 Further information is provided in Section 10.4 of the PEIR.  
3.6.5 However, mitigation measures such as working within best practice guidelines 
and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be employed to prevent any 
contamination or pollution incidents impacting on ground conditions. This will 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
27 
 
include having an appropriate spill response plan, correct re-fuelling of 
vehicles and plant on hardstanding and the correct storage of potentially 
hazardous substances in bunded storage tanks, thus the effect will be not 
significant.  Furthermore given the historical extraction of clay undertaken in 
the Power Generation Plant Site there is no important geology or soils 
underlying the Power Generation Plant Site. 
3.6.6 Construction of the Gas Connection will result in the temporary loss of 
agricultural land. However, this will be a relatively narrow corridor (maximum 
of 30 m working width) and any effects would be temporary. There is therefore 
considered to be a minor adverse effect. Given that land underlying the Gas 
Connection has not been subject to industrial development, the potential for 
encountering contaminated materials is considered to be low. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.6.7 Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, 
the preliminary assessment has shown no significant effects on ground 
conditions are anticipated to arise from the Project.  Accordingly then, given 
that the Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects on ground 
conditions, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to 
any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that 
no cumulative impacts assessment is required.    
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.6.8 Based on the preliminary assessment, no significant effects are anticipated on 
ground conditions as a result of construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the Project. Further work will be undertaken to carry out ground water 
monitoring at the Project Site to confirm the results of the desk based work 
carried out to date.   The results of this further work will be included in the ES. 
A further appraisal of slope stability and foundation requirements will also be 
undertaken.  
3.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
Introduction 
3.7.1 A desk based assessment and site visit have been undertaken to determine 
the baseline landscape character in which the Project would sit and the 
sensitive receptors which may be affected by the visual appearance of the 
Project. This study identified landscape designations, nature conservation 
designations, public rights of way, residential settlements, infrastructure and 
the historic landscape. 
3.7.2 Photographs were also taken from key viewpoints in order to produce 
photographic models (termed photomontages) showing how the Project would 
look in the landscape when viewed from key viewpoints. Key viewpoints were 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
28 
 
agreed with consultees and include, amongst others; residential areas, public 
rights of way and historic monuments.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.7.3 The main potential sources of landscape and visual impact during construction 
of the Project are: earthworks, site clearance works, removal of vegetation (in 
the case of the Gas Connection), presence of construction traffic and 
presence of construction site lighting. However, given the limited construction 
period (22 months) and the relatively modest construction operations, these 
effects are considered to be not significant from the majority of locations. 
However, at one viewpoint, located on footpath 14 adjacent to Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1 there is the potential for significant effects 
given the close proximity of the views. Work is ongoing to determine effective 
mitigation to limit these effects.  
Operation 
3.7.4 During operation, effects on landscape and visual amenity will result from the 
introduction of permanent structures, particularly the stacks of the Generating 
Equipment (up to five stacks) and towers (up to seven new towers) and 
overhead line required for the Electrical Connection, which will be the largest 
structures on the Project Site. 
3.7.5 However, the Project will be largely screened from views by the fact that a 
large proportion is sited within the Rookery South Pit. The Project will also be 
viewed in the context of other industrial development such as large towers of 
the former London Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line 
and towers and the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park.  Views of the 
Electrical Connection and stacks of the Generating Equipment will be clearly 
visible in some views from the south and south east, particularly along the 
Greensands Ridge and from footpath 14, as described above for the 
construction phase. A preliminary assessment is that these impacts will be 
significant at worst, and may reduce to not significant following mitigation in 
the form of landscaping and planting of vegetation.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.7.6 Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
assessment has shown in the majority of cases that there will be no significant 
effects on landscape or visual amenity arising from the Project during 
construction or decommissioning.  However, there is the potential for 
significant impacts to occur from views to the south, particularly footpath 14. 
Should construction of other developments occur simultaneously, then a 
significant cumulative effect may arise. However, work is ongoing to determine 
effective mitigation to limit these effects. Furthermore, other developments 
would also be required to mitigate any construction effects through e.g. screen 
planting or use of hoardings.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
29 
 
3.7.7 During operation, there is the potential for cumulative effects to arise from the 
Project together with other planned developments. The most significant of 
these other planned developments from a landscape and visual impacts 
perspective are anticipated to be from large scale industrial or power 
developments such as the Covanta Rookery RRF, the Integrated waste 
management operations planned for the Rookery and the Brogborough Wind 
Energy Project.  
3.7.8 Whilst work is ongoing as to the cumulative impacts assessment with these 
other developments, a preliminary assessment has been undertaken which 
has concluded the following: 
� 
Not enough details are available at this time to make an assessment of 
cumulative impacts with the Integrated waste management operations 
proposed for the Rookery South Pit. The scheme is a high level outline 
concept only at this stage.  
� 
The Brogborough Wind Energy Project is approximately 4.5 km from the 
Project site and the Project and Project would not be seen in views 
together apart from when viewed from a significant distance away. 
Therefore no significant cumulative effects are anticipated.  
� 
It is recognised that the addition of the Project and the Covnanta RRF 
within close proximity would have the potential to cause cumulative 
effects, particularly for visual receptors to the south. Although the two 
projects would be viewed in the context of other industrial development 
and would look to be complimentary to each other in terms of layout and 
design. Although there is the potential for a moderately significant impact 
cumulatively, the Project would add little to the much larger Covanta RRF 
project.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.7.9 Based on the preliminary assessment, there is the possibility for moderately 
significant effects from certain views, primarily from the south and east of the 
Project Site. Further work will be undertaken to produce photomontages in the 
winter to ensure that a worst case scenario is being assessed when screening 
effects of vegetation are at the minimum.  Further work will also focus on 
designing appropriate mitigation such as screen planting in order to limit 
impacts from views to the south and east of the Project Site. The results of the 
further work will be included in the ES. 
3.8 
Traffic and Transport 
Introduction 
3.8.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect the local transport network, through the generation of 
additional traffic movements to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
30 
 
3.8.2 An initial desk based assessment has been carried out as part of the PEIR. 
This identified and assessed the following: 
� 
Pedestrian and cycle facilities; 
� 
Public transport services including bus and rail services; 
� 
Private transport services including parking provision; 
� 
Highways networks and junctions; 
� 
Road safety and collision statistics; and  
� 
Impacts from increased traffic movements as a result of construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
3.8.3 Access to the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed from the north near 
Stewartby via Green Lane. Green Lane links to Bedford Road and the A421 to 
the west, and Stewartby Way and the B530 to the east. There is a junction on 
Green Lane leading to an access track on the previously unexcavated land on 
the western side of Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery 
South Pit.  
3.8.4 A new purpose built access road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
"Access Road"). The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow 
the existing track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On 
reaching Rookery South Pit the Access Road would use the access ramp 
(which will be constructed as part of the LLRS scheme) to enter into the south 
pit and cross through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating 
Equipment Site along the alignment shown on Figure 1.2. It is proposed that 
the 1.7 km long Access Road would be bitumen construction formed with 
kerbs, and would be approximately 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic.  
3.8.5 Several options are being considered with regard to accessing the Gas 
Connection. These options are as follows:  
� 
From M1 Junction 13 via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, 
Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road;  
� 
From Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
and Millbrook Road, or;  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant area; or 
� 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
31 
 
3.8.6 Several options are still being considered with regard to accessing the 
Electrical Connection. They are as follows:  
� 
From Junction 13 of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close and Station 
Lane;  
� 
From Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
Millbrook Road, Houghton Land and Station Lane;  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant area; or 
� 
From the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Land and 
Station Lane.  
3.8.7 Any off-road site construction access would be temporary in nature, and would 
be removed following completion of the Access Road. In addition, any 
operational access requirement would have minimal and ephemeral usage. 
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.8.8 During construction, the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to require up to 
120 HGV movements and 20 car movements workers at its peak construction 
phase (for approximately three months over a 22 month construction phase). 
Construction / decommissioning of the Gas Connection will require 
approximately 68 vehicle movements at the construction peak, and the 
Electrical Connection will require approximately 34.  
3.8.9 The construction of the Project will also require the delivery of large plant 
items such as the Gas Turbine Generators, stacks, components for the new 
towers associated with the Electrical Connection and sections of gas pipeline. 
There is therefore the potential to impact on the surrounding road network 
through for example, temporary road closures and requirement for escort 
vehicles. Notwithstanding, to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles 
on local towns and villages (particularly Stewartby), the Applicant will seek to 
agree a contractor's Route Management Plan at the detailed design stage of 
the Project to ensure the vehicles stick to agreed access routes and avoid built 
up residential areas as far as reasonably practical. Given these measures, 
together with the temporary nature of the construction phase, and the 
relatively few numbers of abnormal loads anticipated the effects on traffic and 
transport are predicted to be neutral and therefore not significant.  
Operation 
3.8.10 During normal operation of the Project, up to five members of staff would be 
working at the Generating Equipment Site at any one time. Three shifts per 
day are assumed, to provide 24 hour coverage. These shift changes would be 
timed to avoid the network peak hour i.e. morning and evening rush hours, 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
32 
 
hence the highway impact would be minimised. Additionally, there will be 
infrequent maintenance visits by one or two engineers.  
3.8.11 Neither the Gas, nor Electrical Connection will be manned. They will have very 
infrequent service and maintenance visits.  
3.8.12 Therefore, normal operation of the Project is not anticipated to have any 
negative effects on the local road network. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.8.13 Given that the Project will not give rise to any traffic and transport effects on its 
own, no cumulative effects are predicted with other developments. However, it 
is recognised that there is the potential for the Project to be operational at the 
same time as the Covanta RRF Project, which will produce a large volume of 
additional traffic movements during operation. However, the very limited 
number of vehicles accessing the Project Site during operation (five workers 
on the Project Site at any one time) will not dramatically change the 
assumptions made by Covanta RRF in the mitigation required to alleviate the 
effects from their scheme.  Therefore, it is considered that these mitigation 
measures will still be suitable for use with the Covanta RRF and the Project. 
Should the Covanta RRF Project not progress, it is anticipated that no 
measures would be required for the Project given the limited number of traffic 
movements generated.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.8.14 Based on the preliminary assessment, no significant effects are anticipated 
from traffic and transport as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further traffic counts will be undertaken on 
the local road network and included in the ES. 
3.9 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage 
3.9.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect both above ground and buried archaeological assets, as well 
as the potential to affect the setting and appreciation of assets of Cultural 
Heritage importance, including, for example, surrounding Listed Buildings, 
Registered Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation 
Areas. 
3.9.2 An archaeological desk based assessment and preliminary site visit were 
carried out as part of the archaeological assessment which identified 
archaeological and cultural heritage assets in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
Construction 
3.9.3 The extent of any previous disturbance to buried archaeological remains is an 
important factor in assessing the potential impact of the Project.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
33 
 
3.9.4  Given that the Power Generation Plant Site is within formerly developed land 
(e.g. previously excavated Rookery clay pits, it is likely that any archaeology 
would have already been removed. Therefore, this preliminary assessment 
has concluded that there will be no physical direct impacts on any heritage 
assets. The preliminary assessment has shown that no features or structures 
of archaeological interest have been recorded on the Bedfordshire Historical 
Environmental Record (HER) within the area of the Power Generation Plant.   
3.9.5 The majority of the construction works will not be visible outside of Rookery 
South Pit and therefore will have no impacts on the setting of any heritage 
assets.   
3.9.6 The Access Road will have no potential impacts on designated heritage 
assets.  
3.9.7 The Gas and Electrical Connection are in previously undeveloped agricultural 
land, and therefore there remains the potential for impacts on as yet 
undiscovered 
buried 
archaeology. 
Although 
previous 
archaeological 
investigations in the areas where the Gas and Electrical Connections are 
proposed did not reveal any significant archaeology, further assessment of 
this area will be undertaken as part of ongoing works and presented in the 
final ES.  
Operation  
3.9.8 During operation, the introduction of the stack(s) (up to five) associated with 
the Generating Equipment, as well as the towers (up to six net additional 
towers) to support an overhead electrical line, have the potential to have minor 
adverse effects on surrounding cultural heritage assets such as listed 
buildings. There is also the potential for intervisibility between the stacks of the 
Generating Equipment and the Electrical Connection and up to five Scheduled 
Monuments however, in all cases effects are anticipated to be no more than 
minor and therefore are not significant for EIA purposes. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.9.9 The Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the 
Project Site.  However, the preliminary archaeology assessment has shown 
that no significant effects on heritage assets are predicted as a result of the 
Project.  Given that the Project alone is predicted to have no significant effects 
on heritage assets, it follows on that the Project is also unlikely to result in or 
contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with 
other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated 
that no cumulative impacts assessment is required.   
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.9.10 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be

undertaken to confirm the potential effects of the Gas Connection on buried 
archaeology and in relation to the operation of the Generating Equipment and 
Electrical Connection and the potential effects on cultural heritage assets such 
as Listed Buildings and Scheduled Monuments. A visit will also be made to 
Rookery south pit to assess the potential for any heritage associated with the 
pit. The results of the further assessments will be included in the ES. 
3.10 Socio-economics 
Introduction 
3.10.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project have 
the potential to affect the area’s labour markets, community facilities and 
tourism sector. 
3.10.2 A desk based assessment has been undertaken which has assessed the 
socio-economic makeup of the local and wider areas surrounding the Project 
through a review of statistics.  
3.10.3 The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the Project 
is characterised by a pattern of population increase which is expected to 
continue until 2021. The area has a declining work age population with more 
than one fifth of the population expected to be at retirement age by 2021. This 
is also coupled with high economic activity which is higher than the UK 
average. Retail work is the main employment category in the local area, and is 
above the national average. 
3.10.4 The Project will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of the 
area through both employment creation and capital expenditure and worker 
spending in the local economy. It is anticipated that up to 150 construction 
workers would be required at the Project Site during peak periods. These 
workers would not only benefit the economy directly, but would also have 
knock on effects on other businesses (e.g. slight positive impact to 
accommodation providers in providing accommodation for temporary 
workers). 
3.10.5 No impacts are predicted on tourism and community infrastructure as a result 
of the Project from visual, noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality 
impacts, given that the preliminary assessment has concluded that there will 
be no likely significant effects arising from these areas.  
Operation 
3.10.6 During operation, there will be a limited number of staff employed (of the order 
of five on the Project Site at any one time). This is anticipated to bring minor 
beneficial effects to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site through the 
generation of jobs and investment of staff from e.g. spending their wages 
locally.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project

Cumulative Effects 
3.10.7 The Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the 
Project Site.  However, the preliminary socio-economic assessment has 
shown that there are minor positive effects associated with the Project. Should 
construction, decommissioning or operation occur simultaneously with any 
other projects in the area, it is anticipated that this would enhance local 
benefits for goods, services and employment, resulting in a minor positive 
cumulative effect.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.10.8 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on socio-economics as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. However, there are likely to be minor 
beneficial effects from investment at all stages of the Project. Further work will 
be undertaken to distribute a questionnaire in the area to ascertain people’s 
opinions of the Project, particularly focusing on local businesses, as well as 
mapping of tourism receptors alongside the ZTV to assess impact; review of 
relevant findings of LVIA, Noise, Traffic and Air Quality chapters to confirm 
that impacts on receptors are not significant, community infrastructure 
mapping and a review of existing capacity in the local labour market to apply 
for jobs connected with the Project.  , The results of this further work will be 
included in the ES. 
3.11 Other Topics Considered  
3.11.1 It is recognised that some of the statutory consultees have raised concerns 
that the Project may give rise to environmental impacts over and above those 
described in this PEIR NTS. Specifically, it has been requested that the 
Applicant assesses waste arising from the Project and Electromagnetic 
Frequency (EMF) arising from operation of the Electrical Connection.  
Waste 
3.11.2 As part of the construction works, there is likely to be limited potential for the 
generation of waste given that the LLRS will ensure that a level platform is 
created in the base of the Rookery South Pit on which to site the Generating 
Equipment. There may be small amounts of waste spoil produced from 
excavations for foundations, for the Gas Connection and for the new towers 
associated with the Electrical Connection, although it is hoped that as much of 
this as possible can be re-used on site.  
3.11.3 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework 
Directive, the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 
(where relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the Project, will seek to apply 
the waste hierarchy as part of their waste prevention and management policy. 
3.11.4 The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
� 
 Prevention; 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
36 
 
� 
 Re-use; 
� 
Recycling; 
� 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
� 
Disposal 
3.11.5 A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of construction 
method statements for approval by the local authority prior to commencement 
of construction, secured by a requirement attached to the DCO. 
3.11.6 Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used 
on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from 
de-watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
3.11.7 In order to facilitate the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive 
during decommissioning, much of the structures and equipment for the 
proposed Project will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far as is 
practicable. For example, a large proportion of the buildings will be 
constructed of pre-fabricated steel and will therefore be of interest to scrap 
metal merchants. 
3.11.8 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the 
Project Site at any time, and any such substances will be held in secured 
containers to prevent contaminant migration. Closed storage facilities or 
suitable dampening techniques will be utilised within the Project where 
emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible. All mitigation measures will be 
in full accordance with industry good practices. 
3.11.9 The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a 
manner that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project 
Site) waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. 
Where hazardous waste is transported from the proposed Project Site, it will 
be handled in accordance with relevant regulations, and, where necessary, be 
transported in sealed tankers. 
3.11.10 During operation a feature of the Gas Turbine Generator technology to be 
incorporated in the proposed Project is that waste generated should be 
minimal and will be restricted to the following: 
� 
General office wastes; 
� 
Used air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
� 
Used ion exchange resins or used membranes (typically replaced every 5 
to 10 years); 
� 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
37 
 
� 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
3.11.11 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that the proposed Project will 
result in no likely significant effects with respect to waste.  
EMF 
3.11.12 The potential effects of electric and magnetic fields is a very specialised area 
which relies upon extensive work of worldwide experts. UK Power developers 
(such as the Applicant) rely on national guidelines in accordance with 
Government advice to ensure that new installations consider health risks 
based on current knowledge. The UK’s Health Protection Agency, previously 
the National Radiological Protection Board NRPB, provides independent 
recommendations to the Government based on reviews of international study 
results. 
3.11.13 In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to 
power-frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by 
the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 
are adopted in the UK as recommended by the NRPB. 
3.11.14 Based on these guidelines, it is likely that that the EMF field strength for the 
Project would be the same as that which is already present associated with 
the existing 400 kV Sundon to Grendon overhead line, and that the field 
strength remains within the1998 ICNIRP occupational exposure Reference 
Level. 
3.11.15 A full EMF report will be produced as part of the ongoing EIA and reported in 
the ES.

Overall Conclusions 
4.1.1 This PEIR NTS provides a background and sets the context of the proposed 
Millbrook Power Project and summarises the preliminary assessment of 
environmental effects from the Project, based on work done to date. 
4.1.2 It has concluded that the use of SCGT is the most appropriate technology 
choice for the Generating Equipment and that the Project Site is appropriate to 
support a project of this nature. Key features of the Project site are the close 
proximity to existing gas and electrical connection infrastructure.   
4.1.3 The preliminary assessment of environmental effects has shown that the 
Project can be responsibly delivered without causing significant harm to the 
environment. No effects are predicted on local air quality, noise sensitive 
receptors, ecology, water quality, ground conditions, traffic and transport or 
archaeology and cultural heritage during the construction, operation or 
decommissioning phases, or cumulatively with those developments listed in 
Section 3.1.5.  
4.1.4 Minor positive effects are likely to result on the socio-economics of the area 
surrounding the Project Site due to an increase in workforce during all phases 
of the Project.  
4.1.5 Potentially significant effects have been identified from one of the visual 
receptors on a footpath within the Project Site. However, further assessment 
will be undertaken to determine whether this impact can be mitigated through 
the use of strategic planting. 
4.1.6 Further work is ongoing to cement the assessments undertaken to date and 
will be reported in the ES.

A-weighting sound level 
The sound pressure level 
determined when using 
the frequency-weighting

modifies the electrical 
response of a sound level 
meter so that the

varies with frequency in 
approximately the same 
way that the sensitivity of

system varies with 
frequency.   
The human ear has a 
non-linear frequency 
response; it is less 
sensitive at low and high 
frequencies and most 
sensitive in the range of 1 
to 4 kHz.  The A-
weighting is applied to 
measured or calculated 
sound pressure levels so 
that these levels 
correspond more closely 
to the response of the 
human ear.  A-weighted 
sound levels are often 
denoted as dB(A).

There are four 
classifications for flood 
zones as defined in the 
National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF):  
 
 Zone 1: Low 
probability (less than 1 
in 1000 annual 
probability of river or 
sea flooding in any 
year); 
 Zone 2: Medium 
probability (between 1 
in 100 and 1 in 1000 
annual probability of 
river flooding or 
between 1 in 200 and 
1 in 1000 annual 
probability of sea 
flooding in any year); 
 Zone 3a: High 
probability (1 in 100 or 
greater annual 
probability of river 
flooding in any year or 
1 in 200 or greater 
annual probability of 
sea flooding in any 
given year); and 
 Zone 3b: High 
probability (functional 
flood plain. Essentially 
the 1 in 20 or greater 
annual probability of 
flooding in any given 
year).

Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 This document is the Non-Technical Summary (NTS) of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for the proposed Millbrook Power 
Project (hereafter referred to as the Project). It has been prepared by Peter Brett 
Associates LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) (the 
"Applicant"). 
1.1.2 The Project would comprise: 
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with an 
exhaust gas flue stack and balance of plant, which are located within 
the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment"); 
 A new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
"Access Road" or the “Short Access Road”);  
 A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"); and 
 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the "Electrical 
Connection").  
1.1.3 The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  The boundary of the Project Site 
falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC) areas.  
1.1.4 The location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1 of the PEIR.  
1.1.5 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  
1.1.6 The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the “Project” and are all 
required for the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that electricity 
to the NETS. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project

would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred 
to as the ‘Project Site’. 
1.1.7 All elements of the Project are shown on Figure 1.2 of the PEIR.  
1.1.8 The Generating Equipment would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means it 
would operate intermittently for up to 2,250 hours per year. This could be at any 
time during the year and for any length of time up to but not exceeding 2,250 
hours and not exceeding 1,500 hours on a 5 year rolling average; 
1.1.9 A peaking plant is designed to operate when there is a surge in demand for 
electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. when a large number of people 
boil their kettles following the end of a popular TV programme) or when there is 
a sudden drop in power being generated from power stations which are 
constantly in operation. It will also support intermittent forms of renewable 
energy which are weather dependent (e.g. wind and solar). 
1.1.10 The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008, which means that a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The proposed DCO 
Application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate who 
will make a recommendation on whether the DCO should be granted to the 
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of State) 
with whom the final decision lies. The PEIR and this PEIR NTS have been 
prepared in accordance with Regulation 2 and 10 of the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact) Assessment Regulations 2009 (the "EIA Regulations").  
They present information specifically aimed at describing the nature, scale and 
location of the Project and a preliminary assessment of any likely significant 
environmental impacts resulting from the Project.

1.2 
Purpose of this Document 
1.2.1 The Project requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 
accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations).  
1.2.2 The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 2009 before 
the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA 
Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the 
Project. 
1.2.3 EIA is an assessment of the Project’s likely significant environmental effects. 
This document is a summary (in non-technical language) of the PEIR for the 
Project which details the preliminary assessment of the results of the EIA. The 
full PEIR is available separately. 
1.2.4 This document is the second “PEIR NTS” which has been prepared for the 
Project. The first PEIR was published and consulted upon in 2014 (the “2014 
PEIR”) together with supporting information and a Non-Technical Summary 
("2014 PEIR NTS").  This information accompanied MPL’s initial phase of 
statutory consultation ("Phase 1 Statutory Consultation") with both the local 
community and prescribed consultees.

1.2.5 Because the DCO Application for the Project was put on hold in 2015, MPL is 
undertaking a further round of statutory consultation and has prepared the PEIR 
and this PEIR NTS to accompany this further statutory consultation.  
1.2.6 The feedback received relating to the 2014 PEIR has further helped to inform 
and refine the EIA process (including the PEIR and this PEIR NTS) as well as 
the design and development of the Project. 
1.2.7 A full Environmental Statement (ES) will be submitted as part of the DCO 
Application, anticipated to be in Q4 of 2017.  
1.3 
The Applicant 
1.3.1 The Applicant for the Project is MPL, an energy development company 
established for the Project and recently acquired by Drax Group plc (Drax). 
1.3.2 Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via 
Drax power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers 
and is committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal 
off the system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created 
by intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.

1.4 
Need for the Project 
1.4.1 There is a considerable national need for this type of project, acknowledged at 
all levels of government policy. National planning policy supports the need for 
new electricity infrastructure due to the current ageing and inevitable closure of 
older coal fired power plants and the likely increase in demand for electricity 
over the coming decades. 
1.4.2 The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs).  NPS EN-1 (the overarching energy NPS) states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector - providing vital 
flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply (Paragraph 3.6.2)". 
1.4.3 Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants provide back-up to power generation 
from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly 
prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired power plants are 
among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity generation. 
1.4.4 The recommendations and needs case set out in NPS EN-1 are also reflected 
in the ‘Updated Energy and Emissions Projections’ – 2016 (BEIS 2017). The 
projections describe how, under current policy, emissions from the power sector 
fall by 52% from 113 MtCO2e in 2015 to 54 MtCO2e in 2020. Low carbon 
generation is projected to increase from 47% of the generation mix in 2015 to 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
31 
 
61% in 2020. The projections also realise that in the short to medium term, an 
increase in flexible gas generation is required to maintain system flexibility given 
likely increases in renewable generation and decreases in coal generation.   
1.5 
Planning Policy Context 
1.5.1 The PEIR and this PEIR NTS have been prepared with reference to all relevant 
European, national, regional and local policy.   Details of these are contained in 
Chapter 2 of the PEIR.  
1.5.2 As referred to in Paragraph 1.4.2 above, the Department for Energy and Climate 
Change (now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) has 
published a number of NPSs in relation to energy infrastructure, which were 
designated by the Secretary of State in July 2011. These NPS’ set out national 
policy against which proposals for NSIPs are assessed and decided on. 
1.5.3 Due to the nature of the Project (which will generate over 50 MW of electricity), 
four of the designated NPSs are considered relevant to the determination of the 
proposed DCO Application: 
 
NPS for Energy EN-1: This sets out national policy for energy infrastructure 
as defined by the Planning Act 2008, which provides the primary basis for 
decisions by the Secretary of State; 
 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure EN-2: This sets out 
policies specific to the determination of applications for fossil fuel electricity 
generating infrastructure; 
 
NPS for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This 
sets Government policy on the relevant considerations and factors that 
should be taken into account as to route selection for developers for, inter 
alia, gas pipelines; and 
 
NPS for Electricity Networks Infrastructure EN-5: This provides the primary 
basis for decisions taken by the Secretary of State on applications it 
receives for electricity network NSIPs, including the relevant considerations 
and factors that should be taken into account related to route selection. The 
Electrical Connection is underground rather than overhead but various 
policies may still be considered by the Secretary of State to be important 
and relevant in the determination of the Application for Development 
Consent. 
1.5.4 NPS EN-1 states that consideration may be given to planning policy outside the 
NPSs where it is important and relevant to the Secretary of State's decision. 
Other national planning policies have therefore been considered in the 
preparation of the PEIR as these may be relevant to the determination of the 
proposed DCO Application.

Site and Project Description 
2.1 
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.1 The Project Site is shown in Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and encompasses all 
elements of the Project described in Section 1.1 of this PEIR NTS. 
2.1.2 The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection would be situated on land within former clay pits known as ‘The 
Rookery’. The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes 
and Bedford, approximately 3 km north west of Ampthill, and 7 km south west 
of Bedford.  
2.1.3 The Rookery comprises two pits: Rookery North and Rookery South. The 
Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area, Short Access Road and parts of the 
Access Road, Gas Connection and Electrical Connections would be located 
within Rookery South Pit. Part of the Access Road would lie within Rookery 
North Pit. 
2.1.4 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within the 
areas identified on Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and would extend from Rookery South 
Pit into agricultural land to the south. 
2.1.5 To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, which 
provides indoor and outdoor community amenities. There is a Forest Centre 
within the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park located just to the south of 
Stewartby Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor and outdoor 
community amenities. In addition, the Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle 
testing facility, is located to the south west of the Project Site. 
2.1.6 The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 150 m to the west of the Project Site 
Boundary. To the north of Green Lane and The Rookery, lies Stewartby. Other 
neighbouring residential areas include Houghton Conquest, approximately 1.5 
km to the east; Marston Moretaine, approximately 1.2 km to the west; 
Stewartby, approximately 400 m to the north west, Lidlington, approximately 
400 m south west and Millbrook approximately 400 m to the south of the Project 
Site boundary. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.1.7 The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) for which landowner this responsible.  This was the subject of a separate 
planning permission and would be taking place regardless of the Applicant's 
proposals for the Project. The objective of the LLRS is to restore the former clay 
workings to low grade agriculture. This would be achieved through the 
restoration of The Rookery at a low level (i.e. below pre-excavation ground 
levels), with measures included in the restoration to enhance biodiversity and 
landscape. Further details of the LLRS are described in Section 3.1 of the PEIR.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017)

2.2 
Generating Equipment Technology 
2.2.1 The Generating Equipment would provide a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW, operate as a peaking plant fired on natural gas, and could run up to a 
maximum of 2,250 hours in any given year, provided that the five year rolling 
average does not exceed 1,500 hours. Given these parameters, it has been 
determined that an OCGT plant is the preferred and most appropriate 
technology choice for the Generating Equipment for the Project. Further detail 
is provided in Section 3.3 of the PEIR and a schematic showing OCGT operation 
is shown below in Insert 1. 
2.2.2 An ‘industrial’ type gas turbine would be used for the Project. This type of turbine 
has been selected as it is suited to generating up to 299 MW using only one 
unit, thereby reducing potential effects of noise, air quality and visual impacts. 
Additionally, they are suitable for frequent and fast start-ups, flexibility, and high-
availability maintenance techniques.   
2.2.3 The main equipment in an OCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, including the 
following components: 
 
Gas turbine generators; 
 
Air inlet filter house; 
 
Air inlet duct; 
 
Exhaust diffuser; 
 
Auxiliaries including: 
 Lube oil system; 
 Air dryers; 
 Fuel gas filter package; 
 Instrument air system; and  
 Compressor washing. 
2.2.4 A stack with an exhaust silencer will also be part of the OCGT.  
2.2.5 Air is compressed in the gas turbine and natural gas is injected. The fuel will 
then burn in the combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. This 
gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine, which drives the electrical 
generator to produce electricity.  
2.2.6 The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released to the 
atmosphere via the stack.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
37 
 
2.2.7 A stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project which has 
determined that the minimum stack height for the Power Generation Plant, 
required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air quality 
targets is 32.5 m. The maximum stack height would be 35 m. Further information 
on this is provided in Chapter 6 of the PEIR. 
2.2.8 In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator Units at the Generating Equipment 
Site, the following balance of plant and buildings will also be present and can 
be seen on Insert 2 below: 
 
Raw / Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank would be designed to 
comply with the relevant fire regulations and would be installed together with 
fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable extinguishers; 
 
Demineralised Water Tank: Required to store demineralised water for the 
Generating Equipment (used for e.g. blade washing); 
 
Control Room / office / workshop Building: Required in order to monitor the 
plant operation and house plant controls; 
 
Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc.; 
 
Electrical Transformer Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Generating Equipment to transformers before export 
to the NETS; 
 
Natural Gas Receiving Station: Required to ensure that gas coming from 
the NTS feeds into the Generating Equipment Site at the right flow and 
pressure conditions;  
 
Telemetry apparatus including electrical cabinets; 
 
Fin-fan coolers to provide cooling to the Generating Equipment; 
 
Emergency Generator: a small diesel-fired generator used to start up the 
plan independently of the NETS; and 
 
Maintenance Compound: a small area of hard standing for use during 
maintenance procedures.

2.3 
Access Road 
2.3.1 The Covanta RRF Project includes provision to upgrade this track further, to a 
tarmac road suitable for 594 traffic movements a day for the delivery of waste 
via HGV.  Should this road be developed as part of the Covanta RRF Project 
prior to the development of this Project, it would be suitable to meet both the 
needs of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project. In this instance, there would 
be a requirement for a short section of new Access Road (‘Short Access Road’) 
of up to 1.4 km in length connecting the end of the Covanta RRF road to the 
Generating Equipment Site. References in this PEIR to the "Access Road" 
mean the up to 2.2 km access road referred to below and includes the Short 
Access Road. References to the "Short Access Road" refer only to the 
approximately 1.4 km length road that MPL would construct in the event that the 
Covanta scheme commenced ahead of the Project. The Short Access Road 
would be constructed from tarmac bordered by a concrete kerb. The tarmac 
surface would be 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic. It is bordered on one 
side by a footway.  
2.3.2 However, because it is not certain when the Covanta RRF Project will be 
implemented, the Applicant has also included the provision of a complete 
Access Road from Green Lane to the Power Generating Site within this Project. 
If the Covanta RRF Project is not built before construction commences for the 
Project, then the complete Access Road would be built. This complete 2.2 km 
long Access Road would be constructed from tarmac bordered by a concrete 
kerb. The tarmacked surface would be 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic. It 
would be bordered in part on one side by a footway where there is no existing 
footpath. 
2.3.3 The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the alignment of 
the access road proposed within the LLRS and Covanta RRF Project along the 
Insert 1 – Schematic of OCGT plant 
 
 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
39 
 
existing access track which borders Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery 
South Pit, the Access Road (as would also be the case for the Covanta RRF 
Project's access road) would use the access ramp (built to agricultural standard 
as part of the LLRS as described below) to enter into the pit and cross through 
the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site.  
2.3.4 Should the Access Road for the Project be constructed first, it would not prevent 
the Covanta RRF Project or other developments from progressing at a later 
date, although it may mean that the Access Road would be upgraded as part of 
the other scheme(s). The upgrade of the Access Road would be the 
responsibility of Covanta in the event that the permission for that scheme is 
implemented after any DCO for the Project. 
2.4 
Gas Connection 
2.4.1 A new underground gas pipeline is required to connect the Generating 
Equipment to the existing NTS to provide a reliable supply of fuel. Connection 
to the NTS would require two above ground facilities to be installed, a minimum 
offtake connection facility (containing monitoring and control equipment), which 
would be owned by National Grid Gas, and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge 
launching facility (required for maintenance operations on the Pipeline) which 
would be owned by MPL. Together these form the above ground installation 
(AGI). 
2.4.2 The pipeline begins at the AGI, which would allow connection into the NTS 
Feeder 9, east of the Millbrook Proving Ground approximately 1.82 km south of 
the Generating Equipment Site. The Pipeline crosses a farm track which is 
connected to Lower Farm, NTS Feeder 9, a PROW, drainage ditches, Millbrook 
Road and then an oil pipeline. The route then turns down into Rookery South 
Pit before terminating at the gas receiving facility within the Generating 
Equipment Site.   
2.4.3 Construction of the Gas Connection would likely take place within a 50 m wide 
strip of land along the Gas Connection, which would be increased or decreased 
in size, where required (for example, decreased adjacent to nature conservation 
areas). It is expected that the Pipeline will be constructed using standard open-
cut cross-country pipeline construction techniques (i.e. a trench). Trenchless 
techniques (e.g. Drilling) may be used in some locations to reduce impacts on 
sensitive areas or public highways.  
2.5 
Electrical Connection 
2.5.1 A new electrical connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Generating Equipment to be exported to the NETS. The most suitable point 
of connection would be a new substation (located adjacent to the Generating 
Equipment within Rookery South Pit), which would connect into the existing 
National Grid 400 kV overhead line which runs from Sundon to Grendon.  The 
400 kV line is located approximately 320 m south west of the Rookery South 
Pit, as shown on Figure 1.2 of the PEIR.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
40 
 
2.5.2 The Electrical Connection could be delivered in one of two ways (these two 
options are both assessed in the topic chapters in this PEIR):  
 
The first option would involve one underground double circuit Tee-in. This 
would require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be 
located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, 
thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would also require 
two SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and 
both circuits would then be connected via underground cables 
approximately 500 metres in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
This is hereafter referred to as "Option 1". 
 
The second option is similar to Option 1 and would involve an underground 
single circuit turn in (requiring two cable circuits, one into and one out of the 
substation). This would require one new tower (which will again replace an 
existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). 
This option would also require one larger SEC, which could be located on 
either side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would then be 
connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres in length to a 
new substation (the ‘Substation’). This is hereafter referred to as "Option 2". 
2.5.3 
In conjunction with the construction of the Electrical Connection a temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line located adjacent to the three most westerly 
existing transmission towers within the Project Site will be required.  It is 
anticipated that the temporary diversion is likely to be constructed as a single 
circuit outage of the existing 400 kV line. The circuit is likely to comprise one 
temporary tower, being approximately up to 55 m high. The temporary works 
may also include the temporary erection of scaffolding over Station Lane.  
2.5.4 
Access for the purposes of installing and dismantling the temporary diversion 
would be as described for the Electrical Connection above. At this stage, it is 
anticipated that the installing and dismantling of the temporary works may 
require a closure of Station Lane for a number of hours and that the temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line would be in place for approximately five 
months.

(showing Electrical Connection Option 1).

2.5.6 Power Generation Plant would be designed to have an operational life of 
approximately 25 years, after which time it will be decommissioned or re-
powered depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy mix at 
the time. The Electrical Connection, AGI and respective cables and pipelines 
will be designed to be operational for the life of the Power Generation Plant. For 
the purposes of the EIA, it will be assumed that all these elements will be 
decommissioned at the end of the operational life of the Power Generation 
Plant, whenever that may be. 
2.6 
Alternatives 
Sites 
2.6.1 
The site selection process considered a range of factors, in accordance with 
Section 4.4 (Alternatives) of NPS EN-1 and Section 2.2 (Factors influencing site 
selection by developers) of NPS EN-2. This process included the following main 
phases, in order to identify a number of potential sites and refine this set of sites 
through increasingly detailed selection criteria: 
 
Identification of a large number of potential sites across the UK through 
existing data sources; 
 
Refinement of this set of sites, driven mainly by the need for electrical 
generation capacity to be located as closely as possible to the main 
sources of demand in the UK; 
 
Further refinement based on the layout of the electricity and gas 
transmission networks in the UK, to ensure proximity to these networks; 
and 
 
Assessment of the remaining sites based on technical, environmental and 
economic factors, as well as consideration of whether or not a proposed 
Project would be in accordance with local planning policy. 
2.6.2 Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons:  
 
Close proximity to the NTS; 
 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead line) 
(NETS); 
 
The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, lying 
below ground level; 
 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
 
It has a well-developed road network for access to the Project Site; 
 
The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; and  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
43 
 
 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
balance of plant. 
Generating Equipment  
2.6.3 Other technology choices were considered for the Generating Equipment, 
including Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; Reciprocating Gas 
Engines (RGE) plant and CHP Plant. However, OCGT is considered to be the 
most suitable technology choice for generating up to 299 MW as a peaking 
plant based on the following environmental, technical and feasibility 
considerations: 
 
Visual impact: OCGT plants require a shorter stack compared to Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in 
views from the surrounding environment; 
 
Water resources: the water requirement of a OCGT plant is significantly 
lower than for CCGT plants; 
 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a OCGT plant would typically 
be lower than for a Reciprocating Gas Engine (RGE) plant. A larger number 
of RGE units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to 
generate up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that the 
Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly cost 
effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
 
Start-up times: OCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to 
meeting variable demands. 
Gas Connection 
2.6.4 The Scoping Report for the Project1 described a gas connection ‘opportunity 
area’, to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which a new gas 
pipeline and AGI would be developed. Since the publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies refined this opportunity area such that there were two 
remaining Gas Connection options presented during the Phase 1 Statutory 
Consultation and presented in the 2014 PEIR.  
2.6.5 These options were chosen as the most direct connections between the 
Generating Equipment Site and the NTS, avoiding obstructions such as roads, 
large changes in elevation, waterbodies and protected sites as much as 
possible.  
2.6.6 Based on further refinement and feedback received during the Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation, this has been narrowed down further to one option as

shown on Figure 1.2 of the PEIR and described above in Section 2.4. This 
option was selected because it is shorter (and therefore less expensive and 
less damaging to agricultural land), it also avoids crossing the midland mainline 
railway line.  
Electrical Connection 
2.6.7 The Scoping Report for the Project described an Electrical Connection 
opportunity area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Following publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies were undertaken to refine the available options.  
2.6.8 Based on these studies, it was determined that the most suitable location for 
the substation is likely to be next to the Generating Equipment Site within 
Rookery South Pit. However, a number of options still existed on the best way 
to connect the substation to the NETS. These included the use of an overhead 
line connection requiring new pylons.    
2.6.9 Following further refinement studies and feedback received during Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation, it has been determined that the most appropriate 
method of connecting into the NETS would be via underground cables and 
SECs, as described in Section 2.5 above.

Assessment Findings  
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 This section sets out, by topic area, a summary of the findings of the preliminary 
assessment of likely significant environmental effects of the Project. Further 
detail can be found in the PEIR topic chapters.  
3.1.2 In accordance with Planning Act 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA process 
for the Project incorporates the following (further detail is provided in Chapter 4 
of the PEIR): 
 
Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including obtaining 
a Scoping Opinion from the Secretary of State; 
 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental alternatives; 
 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing baseline 
environmental conditions for the Project Site and the relevant study areas 
for each topic; 
 
Identifying the likely significant environmental impacts resulting from the 
Project; 
 
Determining how the likely significant environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
 
Assessing the significance of the likely significant environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the Project and those from other 
neighbouring developments and / or sources (in-combination and 
cumulative impacts); and 
 
Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored. 
3.1.3 As part of the EIA for the Project, MPL requested a Scoping Opinion from the 
Secretary of State in June 2014, who then consulted bodies such as CBC, 
Natural England and the Environment Agency to agree the scope of the 
assessment. The formal Scoping Opinion was received in July 2014 and is 
included in Appendix 2.1 of the PEIR. Further consultation was subsequently 
undertaken based on the 2014 PEIR, which was issued in October 2014. This 
provided preliminary environmental information up to the point of the Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation, based on the environmental surveys undertaken up to 
that point. 
3.1.4 Throughout the following sections, the terms construction, operation and 
decommissioning have been used. These are defined as follows: 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
46 
 
 
Construction – Construction of the Project. Depending on the final plant 
selection, this is anticipated to take approximately 22 months, starting 2020; 
 
Operation – Operation of all aspects of the Project, including maintenance. 
The Project is anticipated to have a lifetime of approximately 25 years; and 
 
Decommissioning – Removal of some plant items and site reinstatement 
when the Project has reached the end of its operational life. This is 
anticipated to take a similar time to construction. 
3.1.5 The following assumptions have been made prior to and in the carrying out of 
the assessment: 
 
Embedded mitigation will be employed - namely design/standard control 
measures, such as working within best practice guidance, which will 
routinely be incorporated for the Project or for most similar projects 
constructed in the UK, and as such will be used to produce the initial 
assessment as to the likely significant effects of the Project. Embedded 
mitigation includes the implementation of a Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP), which is a document designed to ensure best 
practice working methods are maintained on construction sites so that any 
risk of causing environmental harm is minimised as far as is reasonably 
practicable, such as spill prevention plans, correct storage of waste and 
prevention of pollution to land, air and water;  
 
A worst case scenario for assessment has been undertaken for each topic. 
For the majority of topics this worst case scenario assumes one Gas 
Turbine Generator will be built on the Generating Equipment Site, with a 
stack of up to 35 m in height. For air quality and ecology, a worst case 
scenario has been assessed assuming that one Gas Turbine Generator will 
be built on the Generating Equipment Site, with a stack up to 32.5 m in 
height. This is because a lower stack gives rise to potentially more 
significant emissions. Further detail is provided in Section 6.4 and 8.4 of the 
PEIR. Both Electrical Connection options have been assessed, as although 
Option 1 is considered to be a realistic worst case scenario as it includes 
one more SEC, the impacts and effects of both options is substantively the 
same given the very similar design of the connection options. All Chapters 
have assumed that the full length Access Road will be built out; 
 
The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at the 
end of its operational life; 
 
The Gas Pipeline will be left in situ at the end of its operational life;  
 
The decommissioning phase will be similar in duration to the construction 
phase; 
 
The Generating Equipment would operate intermittently for up to 2,250 
hours per year. This could be at any time during the year and for any 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017)

length of time up to but not exceeding 2,250 hours and not exceeding 
1,500 hours on a five year rolling average; 
 
The Power Generation Plant will have a rated electrical output of between 
50 and up to 299 MW; 
 
Current surrounding land uses do not change, with the exception of the 
developments to be cumulatively assessed with the Project that have been 
identified as referred to in Paragraph 3.1.11 below; and 
 
Assessments are based on published sources of information and primary 
data collection. 
3.1.6 The assessments consider the sensitivity of a receptor and the magnitude of 
impact on a receptor. The significance of the effect on the receptor is then 
determined. Further detail is provided in the methodology section for each 
environmental topic in the PEIR (Chapters 6 - 15). A brief summary is provided 
below. 
3.1.7 The sensitivity of a receptor is categorised from very high (for example an 
internationally designated site such as a Special Area of Conservation), high 
(for example a nationally designated site such as a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest), medium (for example a regionally designated site), low (for example a 
locally designated nature conservation site) to negligible (no sensitivity to 
change). The magnitude of impact on a receptor is categorised from major, 
moderate, minor, negligible to no change. The significance of the effect is then 
determined following the method shown below:

proposed residential development of 600 dwellings – approximately 5k 
north of Access Road. 
3.1.12 This list has been agreed with CBC as part of pre-application consultation. 
3.1.13 As part of the initial scoping of the EIA it was determined that certain topics are 
more likely to give rise to likely significant cumulative effects than others, based 
on the nature of the Project and surrounding development proposals. Therefore, 
certain topic assessments have focused specifically on quantitative potential 
cumulative effects and interactions. These topics are air quality, noise and traffic 
and transport.  
3.2 
Air Quality 
Introduction  
3.2.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect air quality both through the generation of dust and particulate 
matter during the construction and decommissioning phases and the generation 
of stack emissions during operation. 
3.2.2 A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling has been 
carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from the Project 
on identified human receptors within 10 km of the Project Site and ecological 
receptors within 2 km of the Project Site. These include properties at South 
Pillinge Farm, in Stewartby and at Houghton Conquest. The preliminary 
assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 6 of the PEIR. A brief summary 
is provided below. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project

Baseline  
3.2.3 The nearest Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) to the Project Site is within 
Ampthill, approximately 4 km south of the Project Site. This is a specially 
designated area where national air quality objectives designed to protect human 
health are not being met or are in danger of not being met.   
3.2.4 Monitored concentrations of pollutants within the 10 km study area are 
presented in Section 6.6 of the PEIR. However, no exceedances of air quality 
objectives have been identified within the study area.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.2.5 The main potential effects resulting from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project on air quality are from dust and particulate matter generated from 
construction activities (e.g. excavation for new foundations, stockpiling, 
materials transport, excavation of the gas pipeline route and excavation for the 
electrical cable and SECs). There is also a small potential for effects arising 
from exhaust emissions from construction traffic. Potential receptors are human 
receptors and ecological sites.  
3.2.6 Despite this, it is considered unlikely that levels of dust or particulate matter 
would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to 
human or ecological receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site. Although the 
potential for dust generation through construction of the Project is large (given 
the scale of the Project Site) when taken into consideration alongside the low 
sensitivity of the study area (agricultural land, with scattered small scale 
residential development and the potential for bare soils during normal use) as 
well as the fact that the LLRS works will be responsible for the majority of site 
preparation, together with the nature of the Gas Turbine Generator which is 
such that it is largely pre-fabricated, means that risks of dust generation and 
deposition are low.  
3.2.7 The limited numbers of vehicle movements associated with the Project also 
means that there are not anticipated to be any impacts from exhaust emissions 
and in accordance with best practice guidance, these potential impacts were 
scoped out of the assessment.  
3.2.8 Impacts would be minimised through implementation of a CEMP, which would 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather. 
Additionally, the majority of particulates from construction activities settle within 
a very short distance of the construction site. Therefore, there are expected to 
be no likely significant effects during construction and decommissioning on 
human and ecological receptors.  
Operation 
3.2.9 The main potential effects arising from operation of the Project are associated 
with the stack emissions arising as a result of the combustion of natural gas in 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
51 
 
the Generating Equipment. Emissions from the stack which have the potential 
to cause impacts on human or ecological receptors are limited to Nitrous Oxides 
(NOx), which can increase ground level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
which could impact human receptors or lead to nitrogen and acid deposition 
which could impact sensitive ecological habitats.  
3.2.10 However, modern gas fired power plants are inherently clean and produce far 
lower emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. coal) when compared 
on an energy output basis. Emissions of NOx are strictly limited under national 
and international guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED). 
Operation of the Generating Equipment will also be regulated by the 
Environment Agency under an Environmental Permit, which will limit emissions 
in line with national guidelines.  
3.2.11 Air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height which will 
achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits and prevent any 
likely significant effects to identified receptors is between 32.5 m and 35 m. It is 
concluded that there are expected to be no likely significant effects during 
operation of the Generating Equipment on human or ecological receptors.  
3.2.12 In terms of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, they will not directly 
generate any emissions during operation. Only very infrequent maintenance 
visits will take place, generating very few traffic movements. There is therefore 
considered to be a negligible effect on air quality from operation of the Gas 
Connection or Electrical Connection or from traffic emissions and these have 
been scoped out of the assessment.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.2.13 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of air 
quality.  
3.2.14 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for air quality are the Integrated Waste 
Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta RRF 
Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.2.15 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
air quality as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to consider 
the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise between it 
and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in relation to 
cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be assessed 
as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for the 
proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
52 
 
3.2.16 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that although there were 
potential 
impacts 
arising 
from 
air 
quality 
during 
construction 
or 
decommissioning, the implementation of embedded mitigation measures such 
as adhering to a CEMP would negate any effects on air quality. 
3.2.17 The proposed Covanta RRF project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site will release both oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide from the 
combustion process.  However, the exhaust stack for the Covanta RRF will be 
much higher than the stack for the Project (105 m compared to 35 m) and 
therefore the location of maximum ground level concentrations will be different 
from those associated with the Project.   
3.2.18 Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and the 
Generating Equipment together and the results are contained in Appendix 6.1 
of this PEIR.  There are no predicted exceedances of the assessment levels for 
human health impacts for the two plants operating together and therefore the 
cumulative effect is expected to be negligible and not significant. 
3.2.19 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the PEIR, along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise as between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.11. 
Conclusions / Residual Impacts 
3.2.20 No likely significant effects are anticipated on air quality, human or ecological 
receptors as a result of the construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed in the vicinity or in 
isolation.  
3.3 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
3.3.1 The construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect local noise levels and generate vibration, which may affect 
sensitive receptors (e.g. residential properties) in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
3.3.2 A noise survey and noise modelling have been undertaken at the nearest noise 
sensitive receptors to assess the potential noise effects that may be caused by 
the Project. The preliminary assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 7 
of the PEIR. A brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.3.3 The baseline noise climate in the area of the Project Site is largely dominated 
by distant road traffic / railway traffic / farm traffic and animal noise. Construction 
works associated with the LLRS are also ongoing which currently contribute to 
the background noise climate.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
53 
 
3.3.4 Background noise measurements were made at two residential properties 
deemed to be Noise Sensitive Receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site in 
order to determine the existing baseline noise climate (refer to the PEIR for 
further information). One of these locations was concentrated on the Power 
Generation Plant Site and Electrical Connection and one was the closest 
residential property to the Gas Connection AGI. These locations were agreed 
in consultation with CBC and are shown in Figure 7.1 of the PEIR. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.3.5 Construction and decommissioning activity inevitably leads to some degree of 
noise disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities. Noise at the 
Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from e.g. 
excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation of the trenches to 
lay the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. This will however be a 
temporary source of noise. Based on a conservative, worst case assessment, 
where numerous large plant items are operating simultaneously across the 
Project Site, the significance of the overall effect of construction and 
decommissioning noise from the Project is predicted to be neutral for the Power 
Generation Plant, slight adverse for the Electrical Connection and slight adverse 
for the Gas Connection (and therefore not significant).  
3.3.6 For the project as a whole, the effect is predicted to be slight adverse (and 
therefore not significant) at all receptor locations following the implementation 
of embedded mitigation measures, including the implementation of a CEMP, 
which will include (but is not limited to) the following measures:  
 
All construction activities would be undertaken in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS 5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on 
Construction and Open Sites’ Part 1 Noise and Part 2 Vibration; 
 
Only plant conforming with relevant national or international standards, 
directives or recommendations on noise or vibrations emissions would be 
used; 
 
Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately, having 
regard to the manufacturer’s written recommendations or using other 
appropriate operation and maintenance programmes which reduce noise 
and vibration emissions; and 
 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps would be 
positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance (e.g. as far away as 
practicable from sensitive receptors). If necessary, temporary acoustic 
barriers or enclosures would be provided. 
3.3.7 It is considered that there would be no likely significant effects from noise 
generated by construction traffic using existing local roads given that the 
increase in traffic flow during construction would not be significant.   
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
54 
 
3.3.8 Given the distances involved between the Project Site and sensitive receptors 
(over 90m away), any vibration impact (e.g. from piling activities) has been 
scoped out of further assessment. 
Operation 
3.3.9 During operation, noise disturbance could potentially occur from the rotating 
components of the Generating Equipment (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator unit 
and cooling equipment) when operational. There may also be a limited amount 
of noise from the Access Road from the small number of vehicles associated 
with the operation of the Generating Equipment, although this will not be 
significant when compared to the existing traffic noise and has therefore not 
been assessed in detail.  
3.3.10 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken at 
the nearest sensitive residential receptors was modelled alongside noise levels 
predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the 
Project.  
3.3.11 Calculations indicated that without mitigation noise levels at South Pillinge Farm 
could be considered to be significant. However, this is a preliminary assessment 
which has not explored detailed mitigation options. Mitigation measures will be 
explored further as part of the ES with respect to reducing the impact at the 
nearest noise sensitive receptors to an acceptable level. The environmental 
statement will report on all residual effects from noise after mitigation has been 
applied.  
3.3.12 During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the AGI. 
This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the AGI regulates the 
flow of gas from the NTS to the Power Generation Plant.  
3.3.13 This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to the AGI. 
Given that the closest residential property is over 100 m away, it is considered 
that the operational noise from the Gas Connection would be neutral. 
Operational noise from the Gas Connection and AGI was scoped out of further 
assessment due to this. 
3.3.14 No impacts are anticipated from operation of the Electrical Connection, given 
the typically imperceptible noise levels generated from an underground 
electrical cable. Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has therefore 
not been modelled as, although there will be a low level electrical hum produced 
at the substation this will not be perceptible at the Noise Sensitive Receptors. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.3.15 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017)

cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of 
noise and vibration during construction, decommissioning or operation.  
3.3.16 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for noise and vibration are the Integrated 
Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.3.17 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
noise and vibration as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be 
assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for 
the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.3.18 A cumulative noise assessment has been undertaken with the Project and the 
Covanta RRF project for construction and operation, assuming that the 
construction and operational phases of the projects would occur simultaneously. 
The results of the modelling are presented in Chapter 7 of the PEIR. It is 
considered that provided the noise limits detailed within the PEIR are achieved 
no likely significant effects are likely to arise.   
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.3.19 Provided that the limits identified in the PEIR are met no likely significant effects 
are anticipated from noise as a result of the construction, operation and 
maintenance or decommissioning of the Project. Based on the Preliminary 
assessments undertaken, mitigation measures are likely to be required which 
will be fully explored in the ES. 
3.4 
Ecology 
Introduction 
3.4.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect ecological receptors (e.g. flora and fauna). The Project also 
has the potential to provide ecological value, for example, through the 
introduction of screen planting, which could provide additional habitat for some 
species. The preliminary assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 8 of 
the PEIR. A brief summary is provided below. 
3.4.2 In order to assess the potential for the Project to affect sensitive ecological 
receptors, desk studies and site walkover studies known as “Phase 1 habitat 
surveys” were undertaken.  
3.4.3 Once the Phase 1 habitat surveys were completed, the resulting information 
obtained from them was then used to inform species specific surveys. These 
surveys involved field based assessments to determine the presence / absence 
of notable species and their population size if present. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
56 
 
3.4.4 Phase 2 surveys have been undertaken for the following species:  
 
Invertebrates; 
 
Great Crested Newts; 
 
Breeding Birds; 
 
Reptiles; 
 
Bats; 
 
Otters and Water Voles; and  
 
Badgers.  
3.4.5 The study area is 10 km from the Project Site for European and nationally 
designated sites, 2 km for local/non-statutory designated sites and up to 1 km 
for desk study records of protected and notable species (extended to 10 km 
from the Project Site for bat species). Field surveys were undertaken in 
individually defined survey areas.  
Baseline  
3.4.6 Baseline conditions at the Generating Equipment Site comprise the Rookery 
South Clay Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS.  Part of the 
Access Road is located adjacent to Rookery North Pit (also a former clay pit 
which has been flooded). The Gas and Electrical Connections are mainly 
located within agricultural land interspersed with ditches, hedgerows and 
woodland.  
3.4.7 The Extended Phase 1 surveys undertaken in both 2014 and 2017 confirmed 
that the base of the south western corner of Rookery South Pit presently 
comprises sparsely vegetated ground, swamp vegetation (including drying 
reedbeds) and bare ground.   
3.4.8 Desk studies identified that there are no Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), 
Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or Ramsar sites within 10 km of the Project 
Site. 
3.4.9 There are two SSSIs within 2 km of the Power Generation Plant Site, the nearest 
of which (Coopers Hill SSSI) is approximately 1.4 km to the south east.   
3.4.10 Part of the Project is within the Rookery Clay Pit CWS is within the Project Site 
and comprises Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit.  
3.4.11 A further 11 non-statutory designated sites are present within 2 km of the Project 
Site. These include the large water bodies that dominate the base of the 
Marston Vale as well as woodland and grassland sites which are present both 
in the base and on the sides of the Marston Vale.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
57 
 
3.4.12 The grid references and principal reasons for designation of these sites are set 
out in Appendix 8.1 of the PEIR. 
3.4.13 At the time that the Project is constructed, it is assumed that all great crested 
newts and reptiles will have been removed from the base of the Rookery South 
Pit and surrounding area as part of the translocation operation which has 
recently been completed.  In addition, the LLRS re-profiling works will replace 
any terrestrial habitat currently suitable for great crested newts, reptiles, 
breeding birds and/or invertebrates within Rookery South Pit with clay, 
rendering it of negligible nature conservation value for these species.   
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.4.14 The potential effects on ecological receptors during the construction and 
decommissioning phases are likely to be from indirect noise, vibration and 
lighting, as well as direct disturbance of habitats or indirect impacts from 
pollution (e.g. silt entering watercourses). The impacts could lead to effects on 
habitats and species within and adjacent to the Project Site.  
3.4.15 However, work is being carried out (as part of the LLRS scheme) to translocate 
certain ecological species, (for example, Great Crested Newts) from the Project 
Site so that by the time the Project starts construction, the Power Generation 
Plant Site will be of negligible ecological value. Furthermore, the areas where 
the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located have been 
found to be of limited ecological value due to intensive agricultural practices on 
the land.  
3.4.16 Furthermore, mitigation measures would be put in place to further limit potential 
impacts to ecology, including the careful timing of vegetation removal and 
maintaining an appropriate buffer around sensitive ecological sites during 
construction works. Compensatory planting and ponds would also be created 
as part of the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
(LEMMS) for the Project (see Appendix 11.3 of the PEIR). Therefore, no likely 
significant effects are predicted as a result of construction or decommissioning 
of the Project.  
Operation 
3.4.17 During operation, the main potential effects on ecological receptors are likely to 
result from stack emissions impacting on sensitive ecological sites. An increase 
in nitrogen deposition can cause a change in plant communities. An increase in 
acid deposition above the critical load can cause a decrease in soil base 
saturation and may cause toxicity to plants.  
3.4.18 However, air quality modelling (see Section 3.2 of this PEIR NTS and Chapter 
6 of the PEIR) has shown that setting the stack height at between 32.5 m and 
35 m will not result in any impacts to sensitive ecological sites. Therefore, no 
likely significant effects are predicted from operation of the Project on ecological 
receptors on the basis that the stack will be a minimum of 32.5 m in height.

Cumulative Effects 
3.4.19 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the 2 km study area for this topic 
within which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered 
that no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in 
respect of ecology during construction, decommissioning or operation.  
3.4.20 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for ecology are the Integrated Waste 
Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta RRF 
Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.4.21 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
ecology as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to consider the 
Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise between it and 
the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in relation to 
cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be assessed 
as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for the 
proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.4.22 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts likely significant effects arising from construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the project on ecology.  
3.4.23 The Landscape Strategy associated with the Covanta RRF has been taken into 
account when designing the preliminary LEMMS in Appendix 11.3 of the PEIR.  
All areas of planting and habitat creation proposed associated with the Covanta 
Scheme has been taken into account in the context of the Strategy and will not 
be disturbed by the Project. This will ensure that the biodiversity enhancements 
proposed associated with the Covanta Scheme can still be delivered.  
3.4.24 Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and the 
Generating Equipment together and the results are contained in Appendix 6.1 
of the PEIR.   
3.4.25 For the ecological features, all but one of the predicted annual mean oxides of 
nitrogen process contributions is insignificant, i.e. above 1% of the assessment 
level when the plants are operating simultaneously. In one case, (at Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS) there is a minor breach in annual mean oxides of nitrogen 
process contributions, at 1.7% of the assessment level. However, when 
combined with the background concentrations, no breaches of the critical level 
are predicted to occur and therefore the significance of effect is minor and not 
significant. The predicted daily mean oxides of nitrogen concentrations are not 
significant in EIA terms, and when added to the background concentrations, no 
breaches of the daily mean critical level are predicted to occur.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
59 
 
3.4.26 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of mitigation described in the PEIR along with mitigation in the Covanta RRF 
Project, no likely significant cumulative effects will arise as between the Project, 
the Covanta RRF Project and the other developments referred to in Paragraph 
3.1.11. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.4.27 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on 
ecological receptors as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed 
in the vicinity or in isolation.  
3.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
3.5.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect water quality and resources, for example through introduction 
of pollutants and sediments to watercourses or for the Project to be impacted 
by flooding, or to cause flooding elsewhere.  
3.5.2 It is however noted here that the Power Generation Plant would utilise air 
cooling, substantially reducing the need for water during operation. 
3.5.3 A desk based assessment has been carried out with regards to water quality 
and resources. This has identified all surface water resources within the vicinity 
of the Project Site, as well as previous pollution incidents which may have 
impacted on water bodies. The potential for the Project to be impacted by 
flooding, or for development of the Project to result in an increased likelihood of 
flooding occurring elsewhere has also been fully assessed by undertaking a 
detailed Flood Risk Assessment including hydraulic modelling (Appendix 9.1 of 
the PEIR). The preliminary assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 9 of 
the PEIR. A brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.5.4 
The Mill Brook flows to the north, close to the western boundary of Rookery 
South Pit, and drains a predominantly rural catchment of approximately 4.5 km2. 
It passes through a culvert beneath the Marston Vale Railway Line and 
ultimately outfalls to Stewartby Lake a further 400 m downstream.  A tributary 
watercourse draining a catchment of 1.5 km2 joins the Mill Brook to the east of 
South Pillinge Farm. These watercourses are shown in Figure 9.1 of the PEIR. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.5.5 The main potential impacts that may result from construction and 
decommissioning of the Project are contaminated material entering a surface 
water body or for the Generating Equipment Site to become inundated with flood 
water. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
60 
 
3.5.6 However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified (see Figure 9.1 of the PEIR) as best practice working methods and 
mitigation will be employed. These mitigation measures include having 
appropriate spill response plans in place, the refuelling of vehicles away from 
watercourses, and the siting of stockpiles and materials away from 
watercourses. These mitigation measures will be contained within the CEMP. 
The Gas Connection will need to cross two minor watercourses (drainage 
ditches). In order to minimise adverse effects best practice would be employed 
during construction of the Gas Connection to protect the water environment, in 
accordance with guidelines published by the Environment Agency and Internal 
Drainage Board. These include re-routing of drainage ditches if necessary and 
undertaking work at a time of year when ditches are likely to have lowest flow 
(e.g. summer).  
3.5.7 It is predicted that following the implementation of embedded mitigation and 
best practice construction methods referred to above, any effects on water 
quality and resources will be negligible. Therefore, no likely significant effects 
are predicted as a result of construction or decommissioning of the Project. 
Operation 
3.5.8 During operation, the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a 
surface water drainage system (which would tie into the drainage system 
developed as part of the LLRS) and a sewerage system which would feed to a 
septic tank, with waste tankered off site. The surface water drainage system 
would remove any potentially polluted runoff through the use of oil interceptors 
and silt traps, prior to discharge into an attenuation pond created as part of the 
LLRS.  
3.5.9 Due to the very limited water demand of the Power Generation Plant once 
operational (only required for fire water tanks and cleaning the blades of the 
Gas Turbine Generator), all water is anticipated to be tankered to the Power 
Generation Plant Site and stored in water storage tanks adjacent to the 
administration buildings. No surface water or groundwater abstraction would be 
required. 
3.5.10 Any water generated during washing of turbine blades will be retained on the 
Power Generation Plant Site in a storage tank and subsequently tankered off-
site by a licensed contractor. 
3.5.11 The Project will lead to an increase in the amount of runoff from within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary due to the increase in hardstanding. However, 
part of the LLRS works to Rookery Pit mean that any excess surface water (e.g. 
from a large storm event) will be effectively managed through the construction 
of a new surface water drainage system, which will discharge to an attenuation 
pond, therefore posing no risk to the Project Site from flooding. Further details 
regarding the LLRS drainage strategy are provided in Section 9.6 of the PEIR.  
3.5.12 Neither the Gas Connection nor Electrical Connection will require water during 
operation, nor will they have any impact on flooding or run off rates. It is 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
61 
 
anticipated that soakaway drains will surround the AGI and SECs which will 
effectively manage increased surface water runoff from an increased amount of 
hardstanding.  
3.5.13 It is predicted that there will be no likely significant effects on water quality and 
resources during operation of the Project. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.5.14 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur (1 km). As such it is considered 
that no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in 
respect of water quality and resources during construction, decommissioning or 
operation.  
3.5.15 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for water quality and resources are the 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and 
the Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.5.16 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
water quality and resources as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will 
have to consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will 
arise between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future 
in relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would 
be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process 
for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.5.17 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on water quality and resources.  
3.5.18 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the PEIR along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.11 in respect of water quality and 
resources. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.5.19 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on water 
quality and resources or from flooding as a result of the construction, operation 
or decommissioning of the Project either cumulatively with other projects 
proposed in the vicinity or in isolation.

Ground Conditions 
Introduction 
3.6.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect ground conditions, for example, the removal of agricultural 
land or from contamination (existing or created) impacting on human health and 
other sensitive receptors. 
3.6.2 A desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline geology 
and ground conditions underlying the Project Site. The assessment studied 
information regarding previous land uses of the Project Site and the surrounding 
area, the soils and geology present at the Project Site, any potential 
contamination issues resulting from former site uses and any potential ground 
stability hazards. Groundwater monitoring was also undertaken to establish 
groundwater quality in the study area (1 km from Project Site) and previous site 
investigations were also studied to assess ground conditions. The preliminary 
assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 10 of the PEIR. A brief summary 
is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.6.3 Baseline conditions at the Power Generation Plant Site comprise the Rookery 
South former clay extraction pit. The Gas and Electrical Connections are mainly 
located within agricultural land interspersed with ditches, hedgerows and 
woodland.  
3.6.4 The geological sequence underlying the Project Site broadly comprises the 
oxford formation overlying Kellaways sand and clays which overlie Blisworth 
clay and limestone. There are no significant groundwater bodies underlying the 
Project Site.   
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.6.5 During construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential impacts 
on ground conditions will be from; 
 
Disturbance of any existing contamination and therefore causing effects to 
receptors through the creation of pollution pathways;  
 
Unstable slopes associated with deep excavations or cuttings into the 
sides of Rookery South Pit; 
 
Uplift from high groundwater levels; and 
 
Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages. 
3.6.6 Further information is provided in Section 10.6 of the PEIR.  
3.6.7 However, mitigation measures such as working within best practice guidelines 
and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be employed to prevent any contamination

63 
 
or pollution incidents impacting on ground conditions. This will include having 
an appropriate spill response plan, correct re-fuelling of vehicles and plant on 
hardstanding and the correct storage of potentially hazardous substances in 
bunded storage tanks, thus there are expected to be no likely significant effects.  
Furthermore, given the historical extraction of clay undertaken in the Power 
Generation Plant Site there is no important geology (e.g. designated geological 
sites or minerals) or soils (e.g. fertile agricultural land) underlying the Power 
Generation Plant Site which could be affected or lost during construction. 
3.6.8 Construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection will result in the 
loss of a small amount of agricultural land. However, this will be a relatively 
narrow corridor and most effects would be temporary as the land would be re-
instated. The area for the SECs and the AGI would be affected long term (for 
the lifetime of the Project) although these are small areas. Additionally, the land 
is of moderate quality. There is therefore considered to be a slight adverse effect 
from the loss of agricultural land which is not significant. Therefore, no likely 
significant effects are predicted as a result of construction or decommissioning 
of the Project. 
Operation 
3.6.9 High groundwater levels may have the potential to result in ground heave in the 
base of buried structures (e.g. foundations) associated with the Generating 
Equipment which could result in the potential for uncontrolled release of 
groundwaters. However, given the placement of engineered low permeability fill 
across the base of the Rookery South Pit as part of the LLRS, widespread heave 
is not expected to occur. However, this cannot be confirmed until further ground 
investigations have been undertaken (as described in Section 10.9 of the PEIR) 
and therefore a precautionary approach has been taken to the assessment.  
3.6.10 These further assessments will form part of the additional mitigation measures 
required and will include Phase 2 investigations to confirm findings of Phase 1 
studies to date, along with the determination of an appropriate foundation 
solution and a subsequent reappraisal of risk. These measures will be secured 
as DCO Requirements. There are not expected to be any likely significant 
effects following the implementation of these additional mitigation measures.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.6.11 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur (1 km). As such it is considered 
that no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in 
respect of ground conditions during construction, decommissioning or 
operation.  
3.6.12 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for ground conditions are the Integrated

Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.6.13 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
ground conditions as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be

3.6.14 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on ground conditions.  
3.6.15 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the PEIR along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise as between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.11 in respect of ground conditions. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.6.16 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on ground 
conditions as a result of construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed in the vicinity or in 
isolation.  
3.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
Introduction 
3.7.1 The Project has the potential to affect the landscape and people’s views and 
visual amenity due to the processes involved in construction (e.g. ground 
clearance, use of large plant), operation from the introduction of new large 
structures into the landscape (e.g. the stack of the Generating Equipment and 
SECs associated with the Electrical Connection) and decommissioning (e.g. 
dismantling structures, restoring land). 
3.7.2 A desk based assessment and site visits have been undertaken to determine 
the baseline landscape character in which the Project would sit and the sensitive 
receptors which may be affected by the visual appearance of the Project. This 
study identified landscape character areas, landscape designations (such as 
registered parks and gardens and conservation areas), public rights of way, 
residential settlements and infrastructure. 
3.7.3 Photographs were taken from a range of representative viewpoints in order to 
produce photographic models (photomontages) showing how the Project would 
look in the landscape. Key viewpoints were agreed with consultees and include, 
amongst others, residential areas, public rights of way and historic monuments. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
65 
 
All the viewpoints are from publicly accessible locations. The preliminary 
assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 11 of the PEIR. A brief summary 
is provided below. 
Baseline  
3.7.4 Baseline conditions at the Generating Equipment Site comprise the Rookery 
South Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. The Access Road is 
located adjacent to Rookery North Pit (also a former clay pit which has been 
flooded). The Gas and Electrical Connections are mainly located within 
agricultural land interspersed with ditches, hedgerows and woodland.  
3.7.5 Most of the Project Site lies within National Character Area 88: Bedfordshire 
and Cambridgeshire Claylands but the southern part of the Project Site is within 
National Character Area 90: Bedfordshire and Greensand Ridge.  
3.7.6 There are a number of footpaths surrounding the Project Site, as well as several 
small groups of residential properties. Key sensitive visual receptors include 
Houghton House and Ampthill Park House.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.7.7 The main potential sources of landscape and visual effects during construction 
of the Project are earthworks, site clearance works, removal of vegetation (in 
the case of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection), presence of 
construction traffic, the presence of construction site lighting and the temporary 
diversion of footpaths. Given the limited construction period (22 months) and 
the relatively modest construction operations, these effects are considered to 
be not significant in the majority of cases.  
3.7.8 However, from several distant and medium distance viewpoints and a small 
number of local viewpoints to the south and south-east, significant visual effects 
are anticipated.  
3.7.9 These are from: 
 
From St. Katherines Cross, Ampthill; 
 
Cottages near to Houghton House; 
 
Footpath on the outskirts of Ampthill; 
 
Public Footpath near Ampthill Park House; 
 
Marston Vale Forest Centre including the approach track; 
 
Marston Vale Millennium Country Park; 
 
Footpath within the Country Park near the railway; and 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
66 
 
 
Footpath 7, near to Vehicle Proving Ground, to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
3.7.10 There will be also significant landscape effects on public rights of way and 
woodlands, trees and hedgerows during construction as footpaths will be 
temporarily diverted and there will be some loss of vegetation.  
3.7.11 However, these effects will be temporary.  
Operation 
 
3.7.12 During operation, effects on landscape and visual amenity will result from the 
introduction of permanent structures, particularly the stack of the Generating 
Equipment, which will be the largest structure on the Power Generation Plant 
Site. 
3.7.13 However, the Project will be largely screened from views as a large proportion 
is sited within the Rookery South Pit.  The Project will also be viewed in the 
context of other industrial development such as large towers of the former 
London Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line and towers 
and the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park.   
3.7.14 The stack of the Generating Equipment will be visible in some views from the 
south and south-east, particularly along the Greensand Ridge and from 
Footpath 7. However, the only significant visual effects during the operational 
phase will be the local viewpoints due to their proximity to the Project.  
3.7.15 By year 15 all but one of these effects will have reduced to not significant as the 
new woodland belts and hedgerows mature to provide effective mitigation. 
3.7.16 Most of the significant landscape effects on public rights of way and woodlands, 
trees and hedgerows during the construction period will have reduced to not 
significant during operation. By year 15 these will have become significant 
benefits with the maturing of new woodland areas and hedgerows.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.7.17 Construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, 
the assessment has shown that in the majority of cases there will be no 
significant effects on landscape or visual amenity arising from the Project during 
construction, operation or decommissioning alongside other planned 
developments.   
3.7.18 However, significant effects are predicted in views from the south, particularly 
Footpath 7, and in views from the south-east. Should construction of other 
developments occur simultaneously, then a significant cumulative effect may 
arise. However, the implementation of appropriate mitigation will limit these 
effects. Furthermore, other developments would also be required to mitigate any 
construction effects, such as through screen planting or use of hoardings.

3.7.19 During operation, there is the potential for cumulative effects to arise from the 
Project together with other planned developments. The most significant of these 
other planned developments, from a landscape and visual impacts perspective, 
are anticipated to be from large scale industrial or power developments such as 
the Covanta Rookery RRF Project.  
Conclusions  
3.7.20 Based on the assessment, most of the predicted significant landscape and 
visual effects will occur during the construction period. Few significant effects 
persist into the operational period and some significant benefits are predicted 
with the maturing of new woodlands and hedgerows. 
3.8 
Traffic and Transport 
Introduction 
3.8.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect the local transport network, through the generation of 
additional traffic movements to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
3.8.2 A desk based assessment and on-site traffic count has been carried out as part 
of the PEIR. This identified and assessed the following: 
 
Pedestrian and cycle facilities; 
 
Public transport services including bus and rail services; 
 
Private transport services including parking provision; 
 
Highways networks and junctions; 
 
Road safety and collision statistics; and  
 
Impacts from increased traffic movements as a result of construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
3.8.3 The preliminary assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 12 of the PEIR. 
A brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.8.4 Access to the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed from the north near 
Stewartby via Green Lane. Green Lane links to Bedford Road and the A421 to 
the west, and Stewartby Way and the B530 to the east. There is a junction on 
Green Lane leading to an access track on the previously unexcavated land on 
the western side of Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery 
South Pit.  
3.8.5 A new purpose built access road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
68 
 
"Access Road") (should the Covanta RRF project not be constructed prior to the 
Project). The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the 
existing track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching 
Rookery South Pit, the Access Road (as would also be the case for the Covanta 
RRF Project's access road) would use the access ramp (built to agricultural 
standard as part of the LLRS) to enter into the pit and cross through the base 
of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site. It is proposed that the 
2.2 km long Access Road would be bitumen construction formed with kerbs and 
footway where needed, and would be approximately 6 m wide allowing for two-
way traffic.  
3.8.6 Should the Covanta RRF project be constructed ahead of the Project, their 
access road would be suitable for use for the Project together with the Covanta 
RRF project. However, MPL would also construct the ‘Short Access Road’ from 
the Covanta RRF project site to the Generating Equipment Site, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection.  
3.8.7 Two access routes will be used with regard to access for the Gas Connection, 
depending on which part of the Gas Connection is being accessed.  These 
access routes are shown on Figure 12.2 of the PEIR, and are as follows:  
 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site; and  
 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road. 
3.8.8 Two access routes will be used for construction access for the Electrical 
Connection, depending on which part of the Electrical Connection is being 
accessed.  They are shown on Figure 12.2 of the PEIR and are as follows:  
 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant Site; and 
 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7 km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and 
Station Lane. The secondary access into the southern side of Rookery 
South Pit that is being constructed as part of the LLRS would then be used 
to access the Electrical Connection. One or two short spur tracks would be 
created to allow permanent access to the SECs from the LLRS secondary 
access track. 
3.8.9 Any off-road site construction access would be temporary in nature, and would 
be removed following completion of the Access Road. In addition, any 
operational access requirement would have minimal and short-termephemeral 
usage.

3.8.10 The Public Rights of Way (PROW) in the vicinity of the Generating Equipment 
Site are shown on the plan in Appendix 12.3 of the PEIR. 
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.8.11 During construction, the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to require up to 
53 HGV movements and 20 car movements per day during normal construction 
works. Construction / decommissioning of the Gas Connection will require up to 
15 HGV and 10 car movements at the construction peak, and the Electrical 
Connection will require approximately 10 HGV and 50 car movements.  
3.8.12 The construction / decommissioning of the Project will also require the delivery 
/ removal of large plant items such as the Gas Turbine Generator, stack, cables 
associated with the Electrical Connection and sections of gas pipeline. There is 
therefore the potential to impact on the surrounding road network through for 
example, temporary road closures and requirement for escort vehicles.  
3.8.13 The increase in daily traffic flows on the surrounding road network has been 
calculated in terms of percentage increase over existing flows. The impact of 
these increases has then been calculated on sensitive receptors including 
KIimberley College, the Water Sports Club on Green Lane, footways and 
cyleways on Green Lane and users of footpaths and public rights of way.  
3.8.14 In terms of Pedestrian Severance, Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and 
Intimidation the assessment has shown that all of these relatively limited-
duration construction movements are generally well below the level at which 
changes can be perceived, and the significance of effect is therefore no greater 
than slight at any receptors and therefore not significant.  
3.8.15 Although peak construction movements on Green Lane are anticipated to be 
around 125 HGVs for a short period of time (1 to 2 days), the effect of this has 
been calculated as slight and therefore not significant.  
3.8.16 In addition, the relatively minor traffic flows associated with construction 
movements forecast are all below the level at which changes in road user delay 
or accidents and safety can be perceived or measured, and the significance of 
effect is therefore neutral and not significant. 
3.8.17 Notwithstanding, to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles on local 
towns and villages (particularly Stewartby), the Applicant would agree a 
contractor's Route Management Plan at the detailed design stage of the Project, 
to ensure the vehicles stick to agreed access routes and avoid built up 
residential areas as far as reasonably practical.  
3.8.18 Given these measures, together with the temporary nature of the construction 
phase, and the relatively few numbers of abnormal loads anticipated the effects 
on traffic and transport are predicted to be neutral and therefore there are 
predicted to be no likely significant effects during construction and 
decommissioning of the Project.

Operation 
3.8.19 During normal operation of the Project, up to five members of staff would be 
working at the Generating Equipment Site at any one time. Three shifts per day 
are assumed, to provide 24 hour coverage. These shift changes would be timed 
to avoid the network peak hour i.e. morning and evening rush hours, hence the 
highway impact would be minimised. Additionally, there will be infrequent 
maintenance visits by one or two engineers.  
3.8.20 During the annual maintenance of the Generating Equipment, there may be up 
to 40 additional staff on site for a typical maintenance period of one month. It is 
assumed that all these trips would all be made by car, assuming 1.6 occupants 
per car, as per the average Journey to Work car occupancy within the National 
Travel Survey. Reflecting the typical working hours on construction sites, it is 
assumed that majority of these movements would be made outside of the 
network peak. However, in order to provide a robust assessment, it has been 
assumed that up to 25% of these movements would occur at peak times and a 
further 4 HGV movements per day are assumed during maintenance. 
3.8.21 Neither the Gas Connection, nor Electrical Connection will be manned. They 
will have very infrequent service and maintenance visits (less than 1 per week).  
3.8.22 Even during the higher traffic generating periods in the short-term maintenance 
period, all of these operational phase movements are so low that they are well 
below the level at which changes can be perceived, and that they are therefore 
neutral and not significant. 
3.8.23 Therefore, normal operation of the Project is not anticipated to have any likely 
significant effects on the local road network. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.8.24 The Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of 
traffic and transport during construction, decommissioning or operation.  
3.8.25 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for traffic and transport are the Integrated 
Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.8.26 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
traffic and transport as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
71 
 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be 
assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for 
the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.8.27 The PEIR for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on traffic and transport providing their upgraded access requirements and traffic 
management measures were implemented. 
3.8.28 The requirement for any further cumulative effect assessment of the Project is 
considered in the context of the minimum environmental impact thresholds 
identified in Section 12.5 of the PEIR for: 
 
Pedestrian Severance (Minor is below 8,000 additional vehicles);  
 
Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and Intimidation (Negligible is less than 600 
vehicles an hour over an 18 hour day); and 
 
the significance of effect of the Project being identified as being below 
moderate throughout Section 12.7 of the PEIR and being considered to be 
not significant. 
3.8.29 The level of Project-generated traffic is significantly below these thresholds.  
3.8.30 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the PEIR along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise as between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.11. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.8.31 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated from traffic 
and transport as a result of the construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed in the vicinity or in 
isolation.  
3.9 
Historic Environment 
Introduction 
3.9.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect both above ground and buried archaeological assets, as well 
as the potential to affect the setting and appreciation of assets of Cultural 
Heritage importance, including, for example, surrounding Listed Buildings, 
Registered Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation 
Areas. 
3.9.2 An archaeological desk based assessment and site visit were carried out as 
part of the archaeological assessment which identified archaeological and 
cultural heritage assets in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
72 
 
3.9.3 The full assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 13 of the PEIR. A brief 
summary of the likely significant effects identified is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.9.4 The Power Generation Plant is depicted on historic maps as being agricultural 
fields until the 1970s when the Rookery Pits are first shown. By 1988-89 
Rookery north and south were both disused. Land on which the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection will be sited has remained as undeveloped land 
according to the earliest historical mapping data available.  
3.9.5 No significant features or structures of archaeological or historic interest have 
been recorded on the Bedfordshire Historical Environmental Record (HER) 
within the Power Generation Plant Site, representative of the fact that the 
majority of it is located within a former clay extraction pit.   
3.9.6 A number of crop marks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the vicinity of the Gas Connection, although previous excavations in the 
area did not reveal any archaeological remains.  
3.9.7 A number of cropmarks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the vicinity of the Electrical Connection, which relate to Romano-British 
remains.  
3.9.8 A review of the National Heritage List for England confirmed there to be no 
designated heritage assets within the Power Generation Plant Site or within the 
Gas Connection or Electrical Connection. Tables 13.5 to 13.9 in the PEIR list 
the designated assets within the wider study area (5 km from the Project Site).  
They include 12 Scheduled Monuments and 22 listed buildings, 5 Conservation 
Areas and 1 Registered Park and Garden.  
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.9.9 The extent of any previous disturbance to buried archaeological remains is an 
important factor in assessing the potential impact of the Project.  
3.9.10  Given that the Power Generation Plant Site is within formerly developed land 
(e.g. previously excavated Rookery clay pits) which are subject to ongoing 
construction works as part of the LLRS, it is likely that any archaeology would 
have already been removed. Therefore, this preliminary assessment has 
concluded that there will be no physical direct impacts on any heritage assets. 
The preliminary assessment has shown that no features or structures of 
archaeological interest have been recorded on the Bedfordshire HER within the 
area of the Power Generation Plant.   
3.9.11 The majority of the construction works will not be visible outside of Rookery 
South Pit and therefore will have no impacts on the setting of any heritage 
assets.   
3.9.12 The Access Road will have no potential impacts on designated heritage assets.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
73 
 
3.9.13 The Gas and Electrical Connection are in previously undeveloped agricultural 
land, and therefore there remains the potential for impacts on as yet 
undiscovered 
buried 
archaeology. 
Although 
previous 
archaeological 
investigations in the vicinity of the Gas Connections did not reveal any 
significant archaeology, further assessment of this area will be undertaken prior 
to construction in order to fully characterise the extent of any archaeological 
deposits at the Project Site.  This will involve stripping off and recording any 
discovered archaeology prior to construction, thereby limiting any effects. This 
will also be undertaken along the route of the Electrical Connection, in the 
proximity of previously identified cropmarks and Roman remains.  
Operation  
3.9.14 During operation, the introduction of the stack associated with the Generating 
Equipment has the potential to have minor adverse effects on surrounding 
cultural heritage assets such as listed buildings. There is also the potential for 
intervisibility between the stack of the Generating Equipment, the SECs 
associated with the Electrical Connection and the AGI of the Gas Connection 
and up to five Scheduled Monuments. However, in all cases effects are 
anticipated to be no more than no more than a slight adverse indirect effect on 
the setting of any of the assets, and for the majority of assets, there will be a 
neutral indirect effect.   
Cumulative Effects 
3.9.15 The Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of 
archaeology and cultural heritage during construction, decommissioning or 
operation.  
3.9.16 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.11 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for the historic environment are the 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and 
the Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.9.17 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of this project. Should it go ahead 
it will have to consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative 
impacts will arise between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is 
needed in future in relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and 
the Project would be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the 
permission process for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities 
development. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017)

3.9.18 The PEIR for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no likely 
significant effects arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the project on archaeology and cultural heritage.  
3.9.19 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation, along with the embedded mitigation in the Covanta 
RRF Project, cumulative and combined operational impacts with Covanta are 
the same nature and magnitude as the Proposed Development on its own in 
respect of archaeology and cultural heritage. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.9.20 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on 
archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to confirm the 
potential effects of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection on buried 
archaeology prior to construction in the form of trial trenching and recording of 
any discovered archaeology.  
3.10 Socio-economics 
Introduction 
3.10.1 The Project has the potential to affect the socio-economic make-up of the 
surrounding area due to increased investment to the local economy and labour 
market distortions. It also has the potential to affect community infrastructure by 
placing pressure on facilities used by construction workers and their families. 
Additionally, the Project could have potential effects on the tourism economy 
should it cause potential tourist to be dissuaded from visiting the area. The 
preliminary assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 14 of the PEIR. A 
brief summary is provided below. 
3.10.2 The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using standard 
indicators. This provides a baseline from which potential impacts and effects 
can be assessed: 
 
Socio-economic/ labour market: research has been undertaken into the 
business and labour market structure of the local economy; 
 
Tourism economy: the area’s visitor attraction has been profiled including: 
visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and value; and 
the local tourism economy; 
 
Community Infrastructure: an audit of community infrastructure including 
GP facilities, education facilities, sport and recreation facilities, pharmacies 
and dentists has been prepared; and 
 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other relevant policy 
has been reviewed to identify related economic, social and regeneration 
objectives which the Project may affect.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
75 
 
3.10.3 The study areas are as follows:   
 
The socio-economic assessment is based on drive time catchment areas 
from the Project. The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30 minute drive time, 
‘wider area’ within a 45 minute drive time, and ‘wider region’ within a 60 
minute drive time    
 
The tourism / recreation study area is based on a 10 km radius from the 
Project Site. 
 
The community infrastructure assessment is focussed on the area defined 
within an approximate 5 km radius from the Project Site.   
Baseline 
3.10.4 The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the Project is 
characterised by a pattern of population increase since 2001 which is expected 
to continue until 2035. The area has a declining work age population with more 
than one fifth of the population expected to be at retirement age by 2035. This 
is also coupled with high economic activity which is considerably higher than 
the UK average. Retail work is the main employment category in the local area, 
and is above the national average. 
3.10.5 Tourism volume and value in Central Bedfordshire recovered strongly during 
the period 2011 to 2013 but has decreased slightly between 2013 to 2015 and 
now accounts for approximately one third of Bedfordshire’s tourism economy.  
Previously Central Bedfordshire accounted for approximately a quarter of 
Bedfordshire’s tourism volume and value.  
3.10.6 An initial audit of community facilities shows there is sufficient capacity to 
accommodate additional demand from construction workers.   
3.10.7 The community infrastructure audit has identified:  
 
16 schools within approximately 5 km of the Project Site (capacity for 
1,004 pupils);  
 
Six GP surgeries (all accepting new patients);  
 
One hospital; 
 
Five pharmacies; and 
 
One library.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.10.8 The Project will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of the 
area through both employment creation and capital expenditure and worker 
spending in the local economy. It is anticipated that up to 122 construction 
workers would be required at the Project Site during peak periods at any one 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary (2017) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
76 
 
time. Project construction would support up to nine permanent full time 
equivalent construction jobs.  
3.10.9 These workers would not only benefit the economy directly, but would also have 
knock on effects on other businesses (e.g. slight positive impact to 
accommodation providers in providing accommodation for temporary workers). 
3.10.10 No likely significant effects are predicted on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of the Project from traffic and accessibility and air 
quality impacts, given that assessments in Chapters 12 and 6 respectively have 
concluded that there will be no likely significant effects arising from these areas. 
Although noise impacts have been predicted from operation of the Generating 
Equipment, this is likely to be localised and would not impact on tourism or 
community assets.  
Operation 
3.10.11 During operation, there will be up to 10 full time equivalent jobs created at the 
Project Site. This is anticipated to bring minor beneficial effects to the area in 
the vicinity of the Project Site through the generation of jobs and investment of 
staff from e.g. spending their wages locally.  
3.10.12 No likely significant impacts are predicted on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of operation of the Project from visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts, given that preliminary assessments in 
Chapters 11, 7, 12 and 6 respectively have concluded that there will be no likely 
significant effects arising from these areas on tourism or community assets.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.10.13 Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.11.  
3.10.14 A total of 4,964 temporary construction jobs would be required to build nearby 
projects, including the Covanta RRF Project.  The assessment shows that there 
is sufficient labour in a 60-minute drive time of the Project to build all of the 
cumulative projects The cumulative projects could therefore be built using 
labour from the Project labour market area without creating any minor labour 
market distortions.  The projects would therefore contribute to an overall slight 
benefit in terms of job creation.   
3.10.15 The air quality and traffic chapters (6 and 12 respectively) conclude that there 
would be no significant adverse cumulative effects.  Therefore, it has been 
concluded that cumulative impacts on tourism and recreation receptors would 
also be not significant during the construction/decommissioning process, 
especially given that there are limited tourism and recreation receptors in close 
proximity to the Project Site.

77 
 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.10.16 No likely significant effects are anticipated on socio-economics as a result of the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. However, there are 
likely to be minor beneficial effects from investment and job creation at all stages 
of the Project.  
3.11 Other Topics Considered  
3.11.1 It is recognised that some of the statutory consultees have raised concerns that 
the Project may give rise to environmental impacts over and above those 
described in this PEIR NTS. Specifically, it has been requested that the 
Applicant assesses waste arising from the Project and EMFs arising from 
operation of the Electrical Connection. The preliminary assessment for other 
topics considered is provided in Chapter 15 of the PEIR. A brief summary is 
provided below. 
Waste 
3.11.2 As part of the construction works, there is likely to be limited potential for the 
generation of waste given that the LLRS will ensure that a level platform is 
created in the base of the Rookery South Pit on which to site the Generating 
Equipment. There may be small amounts of waste spoil produced from 
excavations for foundations, for the Pipeline associated with the Gas 
Connection and for the trench associated with the Electrical Connection, 
although it is hoped that as much of this as possible can be re-used on site.  
3.11.3 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework Directive, 
the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (where 
relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the Project, will seek to apply the waste 
hierarchy as part of their waste prevention and management policy. 
3.11.4 The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
 
Prevention; 
 
 Re-use; 
 
Recycling; 
 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
 
Disposal. 
3.11.5 A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of construction 
method statements for approval by the local authority prior to commencement 
of construction, secured by a requirement attached to the DCO.  
3.11.6 Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used 
on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from

de-watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
3.11.7 In order to facilitate the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive 
during decommissioning, many of the structures and equipment for the 
proposed Project will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far as is 
practicable. For example, a large proportion of the buildings will be constructed 
of pre-fabricated steel and will therefore be of interest to scrap metal merchants. 
3.11.8 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the Project 
Site at any time, and any such substances will be held in secured containers to 
prevent contaminant migration. Closed storage facilities or suitable dampening 
techniques will be utilised within the Project where emissions of dust etc. from 
waste are possible. All mitigation measures will be in full accordance with 
industry good practices. 
3.11.9 The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a manner 
that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project Site) waste 
will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. Where 
hazardous waste is transported from the Project Site, it will be handled in 
accordance with relevant regulations, and, where necessary, be transported in 
sealed tankers. 
3.11.10 During operation a feature of the Gas Turbine Generator technology to be 
incorporated in the Project is that waste generated should be minimal and will 
be restricted to the following: 
 
General office wastes; 
 
Used air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
 
Used ion exchange resins or used membranes (typically replaced every 5 
to 10 years); 
 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
3.11.11 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that the Project will result in no 
likely significant effects with respect to waste.  
Electromagnetic Fields 
3.11.12 The potential effects of electric and magnetic fields is a specialised area which 
relies upon extensive work of worldwide experts. UK Power developers (such 
as the Applicant) rely on national guidelines in accordance with Government 
advice to ensure that new installations consider health risks based on current 
knowledge. The UK’s Health Protection Agency provides independent 
recommendations to the Government based on reviews of international study 
results.

3.11.13 In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to power-
frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) are 
adopted in the UK as recommended by the NRPB. 
3.11.14 The proposed substation would be surrounded by an earthed metal fence and 
consequently the electric field outside of this fence due to the substation 
equipment it encloses would comply with ICNIRP exposure guidelines for the 
public. 
3.11.15 There are no external electric fields associated with underground cables. 
Electric fields associated with underground cable are contained by the sheath 
of the cable itself. The public would thus not be exposed to electric fields from 
the proposed underground cables.  
3.11.16 Some equipment within the substation would produce magnetic fields, but these 
fields tend to diminish rapidly with increasing distance from the equipment. 
Magnetic fields outside the substation due to these items of equipment are 
inherently compliant with public exposure limits, as discussed above.  
3.11.17 The prospective magnetic field strength due to the proposed underground 
cables is calculated to remain below the public exposure basic restriction levels. 
3.11.18 There will be a magnetic field due to the underground cable from the SECs 
beside the existing overhead line to the proposed substation.  
3.11.19 A full EMF report will be included with the DCO Application.

Overall Conclusions 
4.1.1 This PEIR NTS provides a background and sets the context of the proposed 
Millbrook Power Project and summarises the assessment of environmental 
effects from the Project. 
4.1.2 It has concluded that the use of OCGT is the most appropriate technology 
choice for the Generating Equipment and that the Project Site is appropriate to 
support a project of this nature. Key features of the Project Site are the close 
proximity to existing gas and electrical connection infrastructure.   
4.1.3 The assessment of environmental effects has shown that the Project can be 
responsibly delivered without causing significant harm to the environment. No 
likely significant effects are predicted on local air quality, ecology, water quality, 
ground conditions, traffic and transport or archaeology and cultural heritage 
during the construction, operation or decommissioning phases in isolation, or 
cumulatively with those developments listed in Paragraph 3.1.11. 
4.1.4 Minor positive effects are likely to result on the socio-economics of the area 
surrounding the Project Site due to an increase in workforce during all phases 
of the Project.  
4.1.5 Based on the assessment, most of the predicted significant landscape and 
visual effects will occur during the construction period and are therefore of a 
limited duration. Few significant effects persist into the operational period and 
some significant benefits are predicted with the maturing of new woodlands and 
hedgerows. 
4.1.6 Although likely significant effects have been predicted in terms of noise at 
nearest noise sensitive receptors, the assessment has been based on a worst 
case scenario and mitigation measures to limit these impacts will be fully 
explored in the ES.

dB(A) 
A-weighting sound 
level 
The sound pressure level determined 
when using the frequency-weighting 
network A.  The A-weighting network 
modifies the electrical response of a 
sound level meter so that the 
sensitivity of the meter varies with 
frequency in approximately the same 
way that the sensitivity of the human 
hearing system varies with frequency.   
The human ear has a non-linear 
frequency response; it is less sensitive 
at low and high frequencies and most 
sensitive in the range of 1 to 4 kHz.  
The A-weighting is applied to 
measured or calculated sound 
pressure levels so that these levels 
correspond more closely to the 
response of the human ear.  A-
weighted sound levels are often 
denoted as dB(A).

Introduction 
1.1 
Introduction 
1.1.1 Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") is proposing to develop a gas-fired power 
generation plant (and connections to the electricity and gas networks) on land 
located in Rookery South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook and 
Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire. 
1.1.2 In 2014, MPL consulted on its proposals (as they stood at that time). In March 
2015 MPL put "on hold" its plans and notified the public that this was the case. 
Under the new ownership of the UK energy company Drax Group plc, MPL is 
now resuming the development consent process for the Project. 
1.1.3 The Project would comprise: 
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
- 
Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with an 
exhaust gas flue stack and balance of plant, which are located within 
the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment"); 
- 
A new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the "Access Road" or the “Short Access Road”);  
- 
A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"); 
and 
 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the "Electrical Connection").  
1.1.4 The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire. The boundary of the Project Site 
falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC).  
1.1.5 A full description of the Project and Project Site can be found in Chapter 3 of 
the Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(“PEIR”), which this document accompanies. The location of the Project Site is 
shown in Figure 1.1 of the PEIR.

1.1.6 More information on the Project can also be found at 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
1.1.7 The Project is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
("NSIP") under the Planning Act 2008, which means that development consent 
is required by means of a Development Consent Order ("DCO"). The DCO 
application for the Project will be submitted to the Secretary of State via the 
Planning Inspectorate ("PINS") and, once accepted, it will be considered over 
a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority (made up of 
Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the "Secretary of State"). The final 
decision on the application would be made by the Secretary of State following 
a recommendation made by the Examining Authority. Consultation with local 
people, businesses and organisations is an essential part of the DCO process 
and will help to influence the final design of the Project. 
1.1.8 MPL anticipates submitting an application for development consent for the 
Project in Q4 2017. The application would then be examined by an Examining 
Authority appointed by the Secretary of State over the course of 2018, with a 
decision from the Secretary of State likely to be issued in mid-2019. 
1.2 
Purpose of the Project Overview Document 
1.2.1 The Project Overview Document forms part of a suite of documents provided 
for statutory consultation on the proposal under Section 42 of the Planning Act 
2008; a summary of consultation undertaken to date is provided in Section 2. 
The documents which this accompanies, and which have also been published 
as part of this consultation are: 
 
PEIR; and 
 
The PEIR Non-Technical Summary (“PEIR NTS”). 
1.2.2 The purpose of the Project Overview Document is to provide an explanation of 
the interaction between the Project and the Rookery South Resource 
Recovery Facility (the "Rookery South RRF Project"), which is another project, 
promoted by a separate developer, Covanta Rookery South Limited 
(“Covanta"). 
1.2.3 The document is structured as follows:   
a. a summary of the consultation undertaken to date, and details of the 
second phase of statutory consultation on the Project, of which this 
document forms a part (Section 2 of this document); 
b. an explanation of the interaction between the Project and the Rookery 
South RRF Project (Section 3 of this document); and

c. 
details of the next steps in the Project programme including details of how 
MPL will continue to address the interrelationship with the Rookery South 
RRF Project (Section 4 of this document).     
Planning and Public Consultation   
1.2.4 MPL undertook an initial phase of statutory consultation in October/November 
2014 which was preceded by a period of informal consultation that 
commenced in June 2014. Details of this public consultation are provided in 
Section 2. Section 3.3 provides further details of consultation undertaken with 
Covanta during this initial phase of public consultation in order to manage the 
relationship between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project.    
1.2.5 Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project MPL will 
undertake further statutory consultation on the Project in accordance with the 
Planning Act 2008 in order to inform key stakeholders and the public of the 
key changes to the Project that have been made following consideration of the 
consultation responses from 2014.  
1.2.6 The second phase of statutory public consultation will begin on 29th May 2017 
and will end on 2nd July 2017. This gives a further opportunity to comment on 
the Project. Further details of the second phase of statutory public consultation 
are provided in a Statement of Community Consultation (“SoCC”) published by 
MPL which is available to view at www.millbrookpower.co.uk.  
Preliminary Environmental Information Report  
1.2.7 A PEIR has been published alongside this document, which provides 
preliminary environmental information relating to the Project.  
1.2.8 The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the "EIA Regulations") require an Environmental Impact Assessment 
("EIA") to be carried out in respect of any development listed in Schedule 1 to 
the EIA Regulations ("Schedule 1 development").  
1.2.9 The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal power station with 
a heat output of 300 MW or more (as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a) of 
the EIA Regulations). Therefore, an EIA for the Project is required under the 
EIA Regulations.  
1.2.10 The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(the "EIA Regulations 2017") regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 2009 before 
the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37(2)(a)(ii) of the 
EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the 
Project.

1.2.11 Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations, the applicant is required to set 
out how it intends to publicise and consult on preliminary environmental 
information relating to the Project. Preliminary environmental information is 
defined by Regulation 2 of the EIA Regulations as the environmental 
information that has been compiled by the applicant and which is reasonably 
required to assess the environmental effects of the development.  
1.2.12 In the case of the Project, information has been compiled into the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information collected to date and an assessment, 
on a preliminary basis, of the likely significant environmental effects of the 
Project.  This is the second "PEIR" which has been prepared for the Project; 
the first was published and consulted upon in 2014 (the "2014 PEIR") together 
with supporting information and a Non-Technical Summary (the "2014 PEIR 
NTS"). This information accompanied MPL's initial phase of statutory and non-
statutory consultation ("Phase 1 Consultation") with both the local community 
and prescribed consultees.  
1.2.13 The feedback received relating to the 2014 PEIR has helped to inform and 
further refine the EIA process as well as the design and development of the 
Project. Significant changes which have been made to the Project are set out 
in more detail at paragraph 2.2.15.  
1.2.14 As the DCO application for the Project was paused in 2015, MPL is 
undertaking a further round of statutory consultation accompanied by the 
second PEIR which contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.

Consultation   
2.1 
Introduction  
2.1.1 The Project is a NSIP under the Planning Act 2008. As a result, the 
consultation process set out in the Planning Act 2008 is being complied with 
for the Project. This section provides an overview of the consultation 
undertaken on the Project to date as part of the Phase 1 Consultation and sets 
out details of the Phase 2 Consultation to be undertaken in 2017.  
2.1.2 More information on the consultation requirements of the Planning Act 2008 
can be found at https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/legislation-
and-advice/advice-notes/ and an explanation of how MPL is consulting with 
the public can be found in the SoCC (please see 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/ for more details).  
2.2 
Phase 1 Consultation 
2.2.1 MPL carried out both statutory and non-statutory consultation as part of its 
work on the first stages of the DCO application process in 2014.  
2.2.2 MPL focused primarily on non-statutory consultation with the local community 
within the Core Consultation Zone ("CCZ") and publicised the Project through 
media coverage across a wider area defined as the Outer Consultation Zone 
("OCZ"). MPL defined both the CCZ and the OCZ in consultation with CBC 
and BBC officers and councillors. The CCZ equates to an approximate 5km 
radius around the Power Generation Plant site and the OCZ equates to a 
10km radius around the Power Generation Plant site. The CCZ is defined by 
parish council boundaries closest to the 5 km radius. Copies of the CCZ and 
OCZ area maps are enclosed at Appendix A and Appendix B respectively.   
2.2.3 An overview of both statutory and non-statutory elements of the Phase 1 
Consultation is provided in the paragraphs below.  
Phase 1 Non-statutory Consultation  
2.2.4 MPL chose to engage with the local community, their political representatives 
and other key stakeholders during an early phase of non-statutory 
consultation, several months in advance of the commencement of the 
statutory consultation phase.   
2.2.5 Stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels as well as local 
community representatives were contacted by MPL and exhibitions were held 
for the benefit of the local community. During this non-statutory phase of 
consultation, MPL explained the rationale and key objectives of the Project, 
gave reasons why the Power Generation Plant Site had been chosen (and its 
need) and presented opportunities for feedback on the emerging project 
concepts.

2.2.6 MPL carried out the following non-statutory consultation activities between 
April 2014 and June 2014, summarised below:  
 
Meetings held with CBC and BBC regarding consultation approach and 
draft SoCC (“2014 SoCC”) (April - October 2014); 
 
Meetings held with key stakeholders such as local Members of Parliament, 
English Heritage (now Historic England), Natural England and Parish 
Councils to introduce the outline proposals and provide an understanding 
of local and technical issues of the Project (April - October 2014); 
 
Publishing the initial plans for the Project for people living in the vicinity of 
the site through a range of media coverage - radio, TV, newspapers, 
websites and social media (May - June 2014); and  
 
Holding public exhibitions in Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston Moretaine 
to gather the local community's feedback on the initial Project plans and its 
potential impact on the environment, local communities and local 
economy. The public exhibitions were attended by approximately 250 
people (June 2014).   
2.2.7 MPL also undertook further consultation on the scope of the EIA ('the EIA 
Scoping Consultation"). MPL submitted an EIA Scoping Report to PINS in 
June 2014 and received an EIA Scoping Opinion from PINS in July 2014 
which contained the Regulation 9 consultee list; the Secretary of State’s and 
statutory consultees’ opinions on the scope; and methodologies and potential 
effects of the Project to be assessed in the EIA.  
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
2.2.8 Following the non-statutory consultation period, MPL published a draft 2014 
SoCC in July 2014 which was developed in consultation with CBC and BBC. 
The final version of the 2014 SoCC was published on the 23rd September 
2014. 
2.2.9 The 2014 SoCC set out how the PEIR would be publicised and proposed a 
single phase of statutory consultation which aligned with s42 and s48 publicity 
deadlines. MPL sought to maximise the opportunities for consultees to 
comment on the Project by exceeding the minimum statutory timescales of 28 
days.  
2.2.10 During the statutory phase of consultation MPL was able to demonstrate the 
iterative process of project evolution and design development, including how 
the proposals developed since the early non statutory phase of consultation. 
2.2.11 A number of consultation documents were published as part of the 2014 
statutory consultation, these are listed below:  
 
2014 Scoping Report;

2.2.13 MPL undertook a series of consultation activities as part of the Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation as summarised below: 
 
s47 PA 2008- Statutory consultation with BBC and CBC on the content of 
the 2014 SoCC (July-August 2014);  
 
s47 PA 2008- 2014 SoCC published online (MPL website) and hard 
copies made available for public viewing in local Council offices and 
libraries within the CCZ and OZC. The 2014 SoCC set out how MPL will 
consult the local community living in the vicinity of the Project and how 
they can comment on the proposals (September 2014);  
 
s48 PA 2008 - Notice publicising the Project in national newspaper to 
publicise the intention to submit a DCO Application (October 2014);  
 
s46 PA 2008- SoS notified of the proposed DCO Application and supplied 
with all consultation information (October 2014); 
 
s42 PA 2008- MPL supplied statutory consultees (including prescribed 
persons, local authorities and those with land interests) with consultation 
materials and undertook consultation for a period of 35 days (October-
November 2014);  
 
s48 PA 2008- Publicised the intention to submit a DCO application for the 
project through a range of media coverage- Radio, TV, Newspapers, 
websites and social media (September –  October 2014);    
 
s47 PA 2008 - Hard copies of the 2014 PEIR, the 2014 PEIR NTS and 
2014 information leaflet made available for public viewing over the 35-day 
consultation period at local Council offices and libraries in the CCZ and 
OZC; and  


PEIR, the Project and its impact on the environment, local communities 
and local economy (October - November 2014). 
2.2.14 Following the close of the statutory consultation period, MPL undertook 
additional non-statutory consultation activities. This involved follow up 
meetings with various statutory consultees, a Project update meeting with 
PINS, a Project update meeting with the EA and a meeting with CBC, BBC 
and local parishes. MPL also issued two information updates to the parties 
covered by section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 as well as members of the 
public who requested to be kept informed. The first update explained how 
MPL had made some changes to the Project as a result of statutory 
consultation and the second update reported on the slight amendment to the 
red line boundary.    
2.2.15 MPL had regard to all feedback received during the Phase 1 Statutory 
Consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby 
avoiding the need for overhead transmission lines and additional 
transmission towers); 
 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a 
maximum of 5 units to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the potential 
impact of noise on nearby homes; 
 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce the potential impact on 
agricultural land; and 
 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and 
routing during construction to minimise potential impact on the road 
network.   
2.2.16 Additionally, MPL has undertaken detailed technical and environmental 
studies, and associated design work to refine the design of the plant.  
2.3 
Phase 2 Consultation 
2.3.1 A second phase of statutory public consultation is planned to begin on 29th 
May 2017 and end on 2nd July 2017. This gives a further opportunity to 
comment on the Project.  
2.3.2 MPL is again liaising closely with CBC and BBC. It is also engaging with the 
Parish Councils in the area as well as organisations such as the Environment 
Agency, Natural England and Historic England, to ensure that the Project is

Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
9 
designed, built, operated and maintained to the highest safety and 
environmental standards. 
2.3.3 Over the Phase 2 consultation period, MPL will publish a number of 
documents providing updated information about the Project parameters and 
design evolution. A brief overview of the content of each report is summarised 
below:  
 
This Project Overview Document; 
 
SoCC - explains how MPL proposes to consult with residents, businesses 
and other organisations in the vicinity of the Project;  


The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 The "Rookery South RRF Project" is a separate project promoted by Covanta, 
which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. The Rookery 
South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). 
3.1.2 The Project sits within part of the Order limits (i.e. the redline boundary) of the 
RRF Order. This means that there would be an overlap between the RRF 
Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State for the Project.  
3.1.3 MPL has engaged with Covanta throughout the development of the Project 
and is developing its DCO application for the Project in such a way as to allow 
both schemes to co-exist successfully. To do this, MPL intends to submit a 
draft DCO (the 'MPL Draft Order') which would amend the existing RRF Order. 
The amendments would insert protective provisions into the RRF Order for the 
benefit of MPL and further protective provisions into the MPL Draft Order for 
the Project to protect Covanta. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure 
that both projects can proceed without conflict and to ensure that the parties 
co-operate to ensure the best outcome. 
3.1.4 The purpose of this section of the report is to summarise the interrelationship 
between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project, and to explain 
briefly the approach to the provisions that MPL proposes to include in the MPL 
Draft Order to ensure that both schemes can co-exist successfully.  
3.2 
Rookery South RRF Project Background  
3.2.1 The RRF Order permits the construction of an Energy Recovery Facility at 
Rookery South Pit that will be capable of using municipal, commercial and 
non-hazardous industrial residual waste, left after recycling and composting 
efforts, as fuel to generate over 50MWe of heat and electricity.  
3.2.2 During early meetings regarding the Project, both CBC and BBC noted the 
existence of the Rookery South RRF Project and advised that the consultation 
zones for the Project should be broadly of a similar size to those of the 
Rookery South RRF Project. It was also recognised by MPL, from the outset, 
that because of their close proximity, both physically and in terms of their likely 
construction programmes, the interaction between the two schemes would 
need to be dealt with transparently and openly during both non-statutory and 
statutory consultation phases. 
3.3 
Consultation with Covanta 
3.3.1 MPL first carried out non-statutory public consultation relating to the Project in 
May 2014 and June 2014 and statutory consultation in October 2014 and 
Project Overview Document 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
12 
November 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. The following 
paragraphs set out how and where the interaction between the two schemes 
was reported, and gives details of feedback received relevant to that issue. 
They also explain the further relevant consultation undertaken by MPL 
following the conclusion of the statutory consultation.  
Phase 1 Non-statutory Consultation  
3.3.2 Early non-statutory consultation occurred in May and June 2014. In 
recognition of the need for clarity as expressed above, MPL representatives at 
all exhibitions ensured that when discussing the Project with attendees, they 
made it clear that there was a possibility that (subject to consent) both the 
Rookery South RRF Project and the Project could both be implemented and 
operate at the same or similar times. Subsequent feedback from the 
consultation exercise showed that this possibility was of concern to residents. 
3.3.3 In particular, in response to the consultation question: “Is there anything you 
would like to see done differently at the next round of exhibitions?”, consultees 
expressed concern about the “Relationship with Covanta and creep of 
subsequent growth” (which MPL interpreted as concern about cumulative 
impact); and made requests to “keep [consultees] informed over future 
proposals on the old Covanta project”.  
3.3.4 In response to the above remarks, additional consultation material was 
prepared for the statutory phase of consultation.   
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation  
3.3.5 Further to the concerns expressed by respondents to the non-statutory 
consultation, briefing materials at the formal consultation (section 47) 
exhibitions sought to make clear that an overlap had been identified between 
the boundaries of both the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project, and 
that both could be implemented and operational at the same time if the Project 
was granted Development Consent. The issue of the cumulative impact of 
both projects being brought forward was dealt with in the text of the 
explanatory exhibition boards that were presented at the exhibitions.  
3.3.6 The 2014 PEIR, which formed part of the statutory consultation materials, 
sought to explain the relationship between the Project and the Rookery South 
RRF Project at section 2: 'Project and Site Description' (para 2.2.4 and paras 
2.3.22 - 2.3.25), with cumulative impact with the Rookery South RRF Project 
also being addressed at section 4: 'Environmental Impact Assessment 
Methodology' (paras 4.7.5 - 4.7.7) and then within the topic-specific chapters 
of the 2014 PEIR. This document is available online at 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  
3.3.7 Covanta responded specifically to the section 42 consultation on the 10th 
November 2014 and indicated its willingness to discuss protective provisions 
that might govern the interaction between both projects. Other comments were 
Project Overview Document 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
13 
received from consultees demonstrating knowledge of the relationship 
between the two projects and commenting upon it. These included:  
 
English Heritage (now Historic England) commenting that the Project was 
modest in comparison with the Rookery South RRF Project but that the 
accumulation of impacts was potentially significant; 
 
Four additional comments to the effect that the Rookery South RRF 
Project has already been permitted and that the Project would add to the 
cumulative impact in the area; and  
 
A comment stating that if choice were available then the MPL Project 
would be preferred.  
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation Activities - Post Statutory 
Consultation 
3.3.8 Non-statutory consultation has continued since the Phase 1 statutory 
consultation phase. A number of meetings were held with stakeholders 
including an outreach meeting at the Marston Vale Forest Centre on the 26th 
November 2014. At that meeting it was agreed not to use background data 
from the Rookery South RRF Project application, which was considered to be 
out of date. 
3.3.9 MPL also issued two information updates to the local community and 
prescribed consultees, which explained the principal changes made to the 
Project since statutory consultation. The second information update issued in 
March 2015 dealt specifically with an amendment to the Project's application 
boundary, this amendment was made in order to ensure that both the MPL 
Project and the Rookery South RRF Project could co-exist in Rookery South 
Pit. Additionally, the information update informed consultees of amendments 
to the RRF Order that MPL proposes to make, details of which are set out in 
the following section. 
3.4 
Management of the relationship with the Rookery South RRF Project  
3.4.1 As indicated in the introduction to this section, in order to manage the 
relationship between the two projects, MPL is proposing to include two sets of 
protective provisions within the MPL Draft Order that will be submitted as part 
its DCO application. 
3.4.2 The first set of provisions would be for the benefit of the Rookery South RRF 
Project. These provisions would ensure that MPL consults Covanta before 
submitting certain design details (for example, details relating to the access 
road into the Rookery South Pit), or before exercising certain powers under 
the MPL Draft Order for the Project (for example, powers to access land for 
undertaking street works) where this relates to the land on which Covanta has 
consent to construct the Rookery South RRF Project.  
Project Overview Document 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
14 
3.4.3 This set of provisions would also ensure that MPL and Covanta work together 
on landscaping and ecological mitigation works within the redline boundary of 
the Project, so as to ensure that the mitigation schemes for both projects will 
be compatible and, indeed, will also require MPL and Covanta to work co-
operatively to co-ordinate construction programmes and to try to avoid 
conflicts between the construction of the two schemes to the extent that 
construction happens at the same time. The drafting of these provisions has 
been discussed directly with Covanta and will continue to be negotiated 
following submission, as is the case with the other sets of protective provisions 
that are for the benefit of statutory undertakers. 
3.4.4 The second set of protective provisions would be inserted into the RRF Order 
in the event that the MPL Draft Order for the Project is made by the Secretary 
of State. These protective provisions would protect MPL where Covanta 
wishes to exercise its powers under the RRF Order over the land that is also 
contained within the MPL Order limits. This protection would particularly relate 
to the exercise of the powers in the RRF Order allowing access to land for 
various reasons, including for street works, restricting the use of public rights 
of way, for survey works and for felling or lopping trees. This wording would 
also require MPL and Covanta to work co-operatively to co-ordinate 
construction programmes and to try to avoid conflicts between the carrying out 
of the two schemes to the extent that this happens at the same time. Again, 
this drafting has been discussed directly with Covanta and will continue to be 
negotiated following submission, as is the case with the other sets of 
protective provisions which are for the benefit of other statutory undertakers. 
3.4.5 In addition to drafting the above protective provisions, MPL has also made 
certain minor changes to its own Project since 2015 to better enable both 
projects to co-exist and has also engaged with Covanta as the promoter of the 
Rookery South RRF Project, O&H as the landowner and the two local 
authorities (CBC and BBC). The local community and prescribed consultees' 
views on how MPL has sought to manage this relationship are welcomed as 
part of Phase 2 Consultation.   
3.4.6 It is noted that since the RRF Order was granted, Covanta, the original 
promoter of the Rookery South RRF Project, has entered into a Project 
Development Agreement with Veolia to develop the Rookery South RRF 
pursuant to the RRF Order. On 12th May 2016 Veolia issued a press release 
stating that construction is anticipated to commence "by late 2017 with the 
facility becoming operational in 2020". Managing the relationship between the 
two projects therefore remains of considerable practical importance.

Next Steps 
4.1.1 The Phase 2 Statutory Consultation is scheduled to take place between 29th 
May 2017 and 2nd July 2017 and therefore, MPL welcome views from all 
parties on the Project on or before 5.00pm on 2nd July 2017. The SoCC 
provides further details of the Phase 2 Statutory Consultation and explains the 
ways in which comments can be submitted to MPL (see 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/ for more details).  
4.1.2 Following the Phase 2 Statutory Consultation MPL will have regard to all 
consultation responses received in taking forward the detailed technical and 
environmental assessment, and associated design work, in order to refine the 
design of the plant and progress the Project in preparation of the DCO 
application.  
4.1.3 MPL will continue to engage with CBC, BBC, and Parish Councils as well as 
statutory consultees (such as the Environment Agency, Natural England and 
Historic England) on the development of the Project, and to ensure that the 
Project is designed, built, operated and maintained to the highest relevant and 
current safety and environmental standards.  
4.1.4 MPL will also continue to engage with Covanta in order to develop the Project 
in a way which will allow both schemes to successfully coexist.  
4.1.5 MPL anticipates submitting an application for development consent for the 
Project in Q4 2017 with the intention of the application being examined by 
PINS during 2018, to enable a decision from the Secretary of State by mid-
2019.
