Introduction 
1.1 
Background 
1.1.1 
This document is the Transport Assessment for the Millbrook Power Project which has been 
prepared to accompany an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO). The 
Millbrook Power Project comprises an up to 299 Megawatts (MW) gas fired peaking power 
generation plant designed to produce electricity, along with associated development, such as 
a gas connection and electrical connection (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project)’. It has been 
prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), 
(the ‘MPL Applicant’).  
1.1.2 
The Project Site is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, 
approximately 3km north-west of Ampthill, and 8km south-west of Bedford The location is 
shown in Appendix 1.1 (PBA dwg no 31116/3010/001).   
1.2 
Planning Background 
1.2.1 
In England and Wales, an on-shore electricity generating station is considered to be a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) if it 
has a capacity of more than 50 MW. As the Project will have a rated electrical output of at 
least 50 MW, and up to 299 MW, it will be classified as a NSIP under Section 14(1) (a) and 
Section 15(2) of the PA 2008.  
1.2.2 
Under Section 31 of the PA 2008, consent is required for development that is or forms part of 
a NSIP and therefore a Development Consent Order (DCO) application for the Project must 
be made to the Secretary of State. 
1.2.3 
This Transport Assessment forms one part of the documentation that informs the DCO 
Application process and has been prepared to assess the impact of the construction, 
maintenance and operation phases of the Project.  
1.3 
Millbrook Power Limited 
1.3.1 
The Applicant for the Project is Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), an energy development 
company established for the Project and acquired in 2016 by Drax Group plc (Drax). 
1.3.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UK’s electricity, including the Drax Power Station 
in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers, and is committed to supporting 
the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy by developing systems to enable aging 
coal-fired power stations to be replaced with facilities to support intermittent renewables, as 
well as boosting the security of supply.  
1.3.3 
MPL recognises the need to balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and 
concerns relating to energy projects and believes this balance can be responsibly delivered. 
The Project would be designed and developed to high quality, safety and environmental 
standards. 
1.3.4 
Drax currently has three other power generation projects which have either already been 
granted consent under, or are being brought forward through, the PA 2008 process. They are:  
� 
Progress Power Limited at Eye Airfield in Suffolk (www.progresspower.co.uk);  
� 
Hirwaun Power Limited at Hirwaun in South Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk); and 
� 
Abergelli Power Limited at Abergelli in South Wales (www.abergellipower.co.uk).

1.3.5 
The first two listed projects were granted Development Consent Order in July 20151. The 
latter, Abergelli Project, is in the process of submitting an application.  
1.3.6 
Stag Energy Development Co. Ltd (Stag Energy) provides management services to Drax to 
deliver the MPL scheme. Stag Energy was founded in 2002, and draws on a depth of 
experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation 
and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in 
the UK. 
1.3.7 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at www.drax.com, 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk or www.stagenergy.com. 
1.4 
The Project 
1.4.1 
The Project comprises the following elements listed below, shown on the development site 
plan reproduced in Appendix 1.1: 
� 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW.  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the terminals of 
the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the ‘Access Road’ or ‘Short Access Road’);  
 a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’); 
� 
a new underground gas pipeline connection approximately 1.8km in length (the ‘Pipeline’) 
to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System 
(the ‘Gas Connection’). This Gas Connection also incorporates an Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System. and 
� 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National 
Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), comprising an 
underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will replace 
an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route 
corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two SECs, 
one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would then be 
connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres in length to a new substation 
(the ‘Substation’). 
1.4.2 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the 
‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant Site’. The Power 
Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5ha in area.  
1.4.3 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with all 
access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would

be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, 
is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48ha in area.  
1.4.4 
The Project Site and all elements of the Project listed above are shown in Appendix 1.1.  
1.4.5 
The Generating Equipment would run for limited times throughout the year, and is referred to 
as a ‘Peaking Plant’. Peaking plants are required to operate when:  
� 
there is a ‘stress event’ on the grid - when there is a surge in demand for electricity 
associated with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the country might 
boil a kettle following the end of a popular television programme);  
� 
where there is a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which are 
constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage); and  
� 
they are needed to ‘balance out’ the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and 
help to support the grid at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy 
sources, such as wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to their 
intermittent operation and reliance on weather conditions. 
1.4.6 
The Power Generating Plant would run up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in any given year, 
provided that the 5-year rolling average does not exceed 1,500 hours.  
1.4.7 
The Project would generate a very low number of vehicle trips, particularly in the operational 
phase – a maximum of only four workers are anticipated on site per day. However, during the 
yearly maintenance periods, there may be up to 40 extra staff for a period of a month. 
1.4.8 
Further information regarding the Project is provided in Section 2. 
1.5 
Structure of the Report  
1.5.1

Background and Development Proposals 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This Section summarises the background to the Project, and outlines the proposals.  
2.1.2 
The Project Site is located within the administrative area of Central Bedfordshire, the local 
planning authority. The road to which the Project accesses – Green Lane – is within the 
administrative area of Bedford Borough Council. Both Central Bedfordshire and Bedford 
Borough Councils are unitary highway authorities.  
2.2 
Site Location 
2.2.1 
As shown in Appendix 1.1, the site is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and 
Bedford, approximately 3km north-west of Ampthill, and 8km south-west of Bedford. 
2.2.2 
The Project Site is located: 
i. 
to the east of the existing Marston Vale rail line; 
ii. 
to the west of the existing Midland Main Line rail line; 
iii. to the north of Station Lane, connecting Marston Moretaine to Millbrook; and 
iv. to the south of the Rookery North Pit – see Section 2.3. 
2.2.3 
The closest residential dwelling to the Generating Equipment Site is South Pillinge Farm, 
located approximately 190m to the west of the Project Site and separated from the Project 
Site by a small area of deciduous woodland.  
2.2.4 
Rookery Pit lies to the south of Green Lane and the village of Stewartby. Other neighbouring 
residential areas include:  
i. 
Houghton Conquest - approximately 3km to the east of the Generating Equipment Site;  
ii. 
Marston Moretaine - approximately 2km to the west; and  
iii. Millbrook - approximately 1.5km to the south.  
2.2.5 
These are shown in Appendix 1.1. 
2.3 
Application Site and Planning Context 
Application Site 
2.3.1 
The Generating Equipment Site, the Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road and Gas 
and Electrical Connections would be located within Rookery South Pit which is approximately 
95ha and is bound by steep clay banks that are varied in nature and substrate. 
2.3.2 
The Rookery is situated within a post-industrial landscape, presently undergoing significant 
change. It comprises two large former clay extraction pits – Rookery North and Rookery South 
Pits - separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated clay.  
2.3.3 
The Gas and Electrical Connections will extend from Rookery South Pit into farmland to the 
south and south-east as shown in Appendix 1.1. These would be located within a mostly 
undeveloped agricultural landscape.

Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.3.4 
The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing LLRS being undertaken by the landowner.  This was 
the subject of a separate planning permission and is taking place regardless of the MPL 
Applicant's proposals for the Project.  
2.3.5 
The LLRS works for Rookery South Pit comprise re-profiling of the base of the pit, 
implementation of surface water drainage measures, landscaping, and provision of access 
routes. 
2.3.6 
Whilst the programme for the LLRS works is independent from the Project, it will be completed 
prior to the commencement of construction works. The baseline assessments for the Project 
are therefore based on certain elements of the LLRS having been completed ahead of 
construction.  
Site Access 
2.3.7 
Road access to the Project Site is currently from the north from Green Lane near Stewartby, 
and consists of a gated access approximately 90m east of the level crossing at Stewartby Rail 
Station. This is shown in Appendix 1.1. An unsurfaced track currently leads into the Rookery 
north and south Pit areas. 
2.3.8 
The proposed Site Access will be located on this existing access, which will be reconstructed 
to adoptable standards.  
2.3.9 
A simple priority junction is proposed on Green Lane, leading to the access track which 
extends southwards into Rookery South Pit towards the Generating Equipment Site. This is 
shown on PBA dwg no 31116/2001/008A included in Appendix 2.1. 
2.3.10 Green Lane links to the highway network at C94 Bedford Road to the west and the B530 to 
the east. Bedford Road used to form the A421 until the opening of the new A421 dual 
carriageway scheme in 2010, at which point it was reclassified as the C94 Bedford Road.  
2.3.11 A field access is being provided from Station Lane to the south-west to access the Low-Level 
Restoration Scheme (refer to Section 2.5). This will provide an alternative emergency 
vehicular access should a major incident close the main vehicle access route. 
2.3.12 Construction access to the Gas Connection Site will be obtained from the south, from 
Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane at three points: 
i. 
an existing field access to the east of Houghton Lane to an existing agricultural track will 
be used for both construction and operational access to the Above Ground Installation 
(AGI) and the southern end of the Gas Connection Site south of Millbrook Road / 
Houghton Lane; 
ii. 
from Houghton Lane to the west to the central section of the Gas Connection Site 
surrounding Houghton Lane; and 
iii. from Houghton Lane to the east to the southern section of the Gas Connection Site 
surrounding Houghton Lane. 
2.3.13 Construction access to the Electrical Connection Site will be obtained from the south at two 
points: 
i. 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site (having accessed 
the Site from Green Lane and Bedford Road as per the Generating Equipment site) for the 
northern section of the Electrical Connection Site; and

ii. 
for the southern section of the Electrical Connection Site, from Station Lane. 
2.3.14 Further details are also provided in Section 5.2. 
2.4 
Transport Scoping Discussions 
2.4.1 
Millbrook Power Limited has engaged with a range of statutory and non-statutory consultees 
and stakeholders at all levels to discuss the Project. This input has directly informed the 
proposals. Details of all consultation undertaken is provided in a separate consultation report 
which accompanies the DCO Application (Document Reference 5.1). However, the text below 
summarises the consultation activities of relevance to this Transport Assessment.  
Consultation 
2.4.2 
To discuss and agree the scope of the proposed Transport Assessment, on August 28th 2014 
Peter Brett Associates met with the Joint Authorities consisting of: 
i.

Other Relevant Developments and Proposals 
2.5.1 
Substantial areas of land around Stewartby – including The Rookery – formed the works of the 
London Brick Company’s Stewartby Brickworks and the land worked to supply the clay until it 
closed in 2008. To the north of The Rookery there remain some buildings associated with the 
former Stewartby Brickworks including four chimneys which are now listed structures. 
Following clay extraction, these former clay working sites have been restored to varying levels 
of completion by different means – including the disposal of waste – and to different uses 
which includes water-based recreation and commercial uses. 
2.5.2 
Furthermore, significant regeneration and development is allocated for the Northern Marston 
Vale Growth Area, in which the Project Site is located. This will result in further change within 
the planning status of surrounding areas, with substantial residential and employment 
development such as in the nearby settlements of Marston Moretaine and Stewartby. 
Covanta Rookery South Limited  
2.5.3 
Covanta Rookery South Limited obtained a DCO consent for an Energy from Waste Facility 
(EfW) in 2013. Although this scheme is also located in the Rookery South Pit adjacent to the 
Project, it is being promoted by others and is entirely independent of the Project. The nominal 
capacity of the EfW facility is 480,000 tonnes per year of mixed residual municipal, 
commercial and industrial waste, based on an assumed plant availability of 89%. The RRF 
would also include an associated Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) to recover ash and 
metals.  
2.5.4 
It is anticipated that construction of the EfW facility will commence by late 2017, with the 
facility becoming operational in 2020.  
2.5.5 
The trip generation of the EfW facility was assessed by Waterman Boreham Ltd, and is 
reported in the Proposed Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order Transport 
Assessment (dated August 2010). These flows – assuming the Nominal Throughput – are 
included in Appendix 2.5.  
Broadmead Road, Stewartby 
2.5.6 
City and St James Properties Ltd has sought outline planning permission for a residential the 
development on a site to the north of Stewartby off Broadmead Road – this is shown in 
Appendix 2.6. A revised application was submitted in 2002 taking into account numerous 
legislative changes since the initial application in 1997, which also received planning approval.  
2.5.7 
The trip generation of the Broadmead Road facility was assessed by Peter Brett Associates, 
and is reported in the Broadmead Road Stewartby Transport Assessment (dated December 
2002). The Development trip generation flows are included in Appendix 2.6.  
2.5.8 
The development is currently being built; for robustness, all flows have been added to this 
assessment. To the end of May 2017, there have been 113 completions on the site which is 
allocated for 610 dwellings.

Existing Conditions 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
This Section provides information on existing conditions in the area close to the Project Site – 
to the north (around Green Lane) and to the south, towards Millbrook Road.   It also 
addresses the current accessibility in the area. 
3.2 
Existing Pedestrian, Cycle and Equestrian Conditions 
Pedestrian Facilities 
3.2.1 
The existing pedestrian facilities in the vicinity of the Project are shown in Appendix 2.1. Whilst 
a number of existing public footpaths link it to the wider Marston Vale, there is limited public 
access to Rookery South Pit itself. 
3.2.2 
There is a footway in the northern verge of Green Lane linking between Stewartby village to 
the east, and the Kimberley College to the west. The footway commences in the centre of 
Stewartby and is between 1.5m and 2m in width. This footway link is 0.8km in length.  The 
College has committed to providing a crossing patrol during the College opening hours to 
assist the movements of students across Green Lane to the FP72 recreational footpath also 
linking to Marston Moretaine (see below) and the College Access. The footway in this section 
is illuminated by the street lighting system. As well as accommodating students walking to this 
facility, the footway would also accommodate pedestrians walking from Stewartby to 
Stewartby Rail Station and to the FP72 recreational footpath which runs alongside Stewartby 
Lake. 
3.2.3 
In the southern verge of Green Lane immediately adjacent to the railway level crossing there 
is a short section of footway either side of the crossing to provide pedestrian access to the 
platforms. This footway terminates within 20m of the crossing.  
3.2.4 
On Bedford Road (at the western end of Green Lane), there is a footway on the eastern verge 
commencing 160m south of the junction with Green Lane linking to Marston Moretaine to the 
south. This footway has a width of between 1.5m and 2m and is illuminated by the street 
lighting system.   
3.2.5 
As shown in Appendix 2.1, on the Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane / Station Lane Corridor 
there are no footways along either verge at the eastern end until Millbrook village. West of the 
junction with Russell Grove, a footway between 0.75m and 1.25m in width is located in the 
southern verge of the carriageway. This footway is present until the junction with Sandhill 
Close. West of this point on Station Lane, there is no footway in either verge.  
Cycling Facilities 
3.2.6 
Reflecting the rural nature of this area, the relatively low vehicle flows and the low number of 
existing cyclists in this area, no cycling facilities are available on Green Lane or Bedford Road, 
or to the south in the vicinity of the Project around Millbrook Road.   
Equestrian Facilities 
3.2.7 
Consistent with the low number of local stables and riding schools as well as the relatively low 
number of vehicles on the roads in this area, there are no bridleways or equestrian facilities 
available on Green Lane or Bedford Road, or to the south in the vicinity of the Project around 
Millbrook Road.

Recreational Footpaths / Bridleways 
3.2.8 
Recreational footpaths in close proximity to the Project Site are shown in Appendix 2.1, and 
are as follows: 
� 
Footpath FP72 to the north-west of the Project Site around Stewartby Lake;  
� 
Footpath FP4 is located to the north-east of the Project Site, connecting Green Lane with 
Station Lane; and  
� 
Footpath FP3 is adjacent to Rookery North to the east, travelling on a north-south axis 
from Stewartby; 
� 
an east-west route is formed between Station Lane (adjacent the Millbrook Proving 
Ground) and Millbrook Road (adjacent How End) by Footpaths FP14, FP65, FP15, FP4 
and FP8; 
� 
a north-west to south-east route is formed between the above FP14 adjacent the 
Millbrook Proving Ground and Millbrook Road by Footpath FP7 and FP6;  
� 
Footpath FP7 extends further eastwards from this route via FP13, FP25, FP14 and FP15 
through Ampthill Park House to the B530 adjacent the Engineering Research 
Establishment.    
3.2.9 
The BW84 bridleway is located approximately 400m west of the Project, joining FP17 and 
FP72, towards the south and south-west of Stewartby Lake respectively. This is shown in 
Appendix 2.1.  
3.2.10 Further new recreational footpaths in the Rookery Pit area are being promoted as part of the 
LLRS, including: 
� 
a footpath connection to Green Lane, approximately at the Proposed Site Access 
location; 
� 
a footpath circling the Rookery North Pit;  
� 
a footpath surrounding the attenuation pond in the Rookery South Pit; and 
� 
a footpath link to the existing public footpath FP4.  
3.2.11 These are also shown in Appendix 2.1. 
3.2.12 There are no Public Rights of Way within the Generating Equipment Site, although:  
� 
Footpath FP65 is crossed by the northern part of the Gas Connection; 
� 
Footpath FP7 is crossed by the southern part of the Gas Connection, and by the 
Electrical Connection access; and 
� 
Footpath FP14 is crossed by the Electrical Connection access.

3.4.2 
Green Lane is a rural single carriageway road, connecting Stewartby to Bedford Road and 
Marston Moretaine to the west. To the north-west of the Site Access, Green Lane is 
approximately 6.5m wide with no lighting or footway to the north-west of the Kimberley 
College. Green Lane is subject to a 30mph speed limit in the vicinity of the Site.   
3.4.3 
A level crossing of the Marston Vale Rail line is located 70m to the west of the Proposed Site 
Access. Vehicle movements are controlled remotely by one simple barrier per approach, 
flashing lights and a warning tone.  
3.4.4 
Green Lane connects to Bedford Road by a ghost island priority junction 1.3km north-west of 
the Site Access. Bedford Road previously formed the A421 before being down-graded when 
the M1 to Bedford A421 dual carriageway scheme was opened in 2010, and reclassified as 
the C94.  
3.4.5 
To the east of the Site Access, Green Lane is approximately 6.5m to 7.0m wide, with a 
footway in the northern verge leading into Stewartby. This section of road is subject to a 
30mph speed limit. Green Lane continues to the east, forming Stewartby Way, before 
connecting with the B530 to the east of the village.   
3.4.6 
Access to the new A421 is provided by grade-separated junctions, the closest to the Project 
are 2km south of the Green Lane junction, or 3.5km to the north.  
3.4.7 
To the south of the Project Site is the Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane / Station Lane Corridor 
between the B530 (to the east) and Marston Moretaine (to the west). The Millbrook Road / 
Houghton Lane / Station Lane Corridor is formed by rural roads generally around 6.0m wide 
with no footways along the majority of their length.

Locally, the A421 is generally aligned on a south-west to north-east axis, connecting between 
M1 Junction 13 (8km south-west of the Green Lane junction) bypassing south around Bedford, 
then connecting to the A1 at the Black Cat Roundabout, 26km north-east of the Green Lane 
junction. Access is provided to Bedford from the A421 by a series of five grade-separated 
junctions.

Traffic Count Data - 2017 Surveys 
3.5.1 
Nationwide Data (NDC) was commissioned to undertake traffic surveys in the area during May 
2017.  
3.5.2 
An all-movement part-classified turning count survey was undertaken at the junction of 
Bedford Road and Green Lane on Thursday 18th May 2017. 
3.5.3 
Three two-week fully classified automatic traffic counts (ATCs) were installed and surveyed 
flows between Thursday 11th May 2017 – Wednesday 24th May 2017 at the following 
locations: 
a. 
on C94 Bedford Road, 100m north of the junction with Green Lane; 
b. 
on C94 Bedford Road, 100m south of the junction with Green Lane; and 
c. 
on Green Lane, 50m east of the Stewartby Station level crossing (the approximate 
location of the Site Access). 
3.5.4 
The results of these surveys, are contained in Appendix 3.1; the ATC data results are 
summarised in Table 3.5 below.

The 2017 flows are higher than those observed in an earlier 2014 count, by 18% in the AM 
peak, and 32% in the PM peak.  This scale of  percentage increases reflect the low 2014 
flows, and the level of development in the surrounding area. 
3.5.6 
In 2014, an ATC had been installed along Millbrook Road (50m west of the B530).  The flows 
reported were light, less than 2 vehicles per minute.  As such, no recount was undertaken in 
2017.  To synthesise 2017 flows, the ATC data for Millbrook Road has been factored up from 
a 2014 data set using the following growth factors from the TEMPro 7.2 software for ‘All Road 
Typical Factors’:

3.6.2 
The results of the junction capacity assessment show that the Bedford Road / Green Lane 
priority junction currently operates well within capacity in both peaks. There is no queuing 
present and the junction has significant levels of reserve capacity.  
3.6.3 
The above results are consistent with the capacity assessment undertaken in 2014.

Road Traffic Collision Assessment 
3.7.1 
To understand existing road safety in the vicinity of the Project Site, road traffic personal injury 
collision (PIC) summary data covering the most recent five-year period to 31st December 2016 
was obtained from Central Bedfordshire Council. The location of each of the reported 
incidents is contained in Appendix 3.5.  
3.7.2 
The number of PICs that could be anticipated on links and junctions within the area based on 
the existing flow and layout was calculated with reference to the parameters contained in the 
Department for Transport’s Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, Volume 13, Section 1 Part 
2 Cobalt software (released in September 2013), which are used to calculate the anticipated 
PICs for major transport schemes. Links that are likely to be used by potential development 
traffic have been included within this assessment to identify whether there are any existing 
road safety issues along these links.   
3.7.3 
The calculations and a plan showing the links and junctions assessed are contained in 
Appendix 3.5. The results of observed and anticipated personal injury collisions are 
summarised in Table 3.8 for links and in Table 3.9 for the junction.

3.7.4 
The results in Tables 3.9 and 3.10 show that all the links and junctions assessed within this 
study area have either equal or lower than the anticipated numbers of PICs except for Link 
Reference 3 - Bedford Road between Green Lane and Broadmead Road which observed one 
more incident than anticipated. This difference of one PIC is not material.  
3.7.5 
Of the six PICs reported within the assessment area: 
i. 
five were classified as a slight severity personal injury collisions; 
ii. 
one was classified as a serious severity personal injury collisions; 
iii. one collision involved a motorcyclist;  
iv. one collision involved a cyclist; 
v. no collisions involved pedestrians; and  
vi. there were no PICs at the location of the proposed junction of the Access Road with 
Green Lane.      
3.7.6 
Of the four PICs on Link Reference 3 - Bedford Road between Green Lane and Broadmead 
Road, three PICs were similar: 
i. 
two incidents involved vehicles travelling south-west and losing control on the bend in 
damp or icy road conditions causing slight injuries;  
ii. 
one incident involved a vehicle travelling south-west and losing control for unknown 
reasons, consequentially crossing the centre markings and colliding with an oncoming 
vehicle, resulting in a serious injury; and 
iii. the remaining incident involved a broken-down vehicle parked facing south-west, and a 
cyclist colliding into its rear. 
3.7.7 
The are no similarities between the two PICs at the Bedford Road / Green Lane junction:  
i. 
one PIC was caused by a car “undertaking” on the left side of a motorcyclist on Green 
Lane, striking the rider; and 
ii. 
the second PIC was caused by a vehicle entering Green Lane from the south and driving 
directly into an oncoming vehicle travelling south on Bedford Road.  
There appears to be no common causation for the two PICs that occurred at this junction.

Policy Review 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This Section outlines the main elements of policy relevant to this Transport Assessment for 
the Project. 
4.2 
National Policy and Guidance 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
4.2.1 
The Planning Act 2008 introduced the concept of National Policy Statements (NPS). The NPS 
that is particularly relevant to the consideration of transport impacts of the DCO Application for 
the Project is the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1). 
4.2.2 
NPS EN-1 promotes sustainable development and states that there is to be a "presumption in 
favour of sustainable development" when making plans and decisions.  
4.2.3 
As well as a series of generic assessment principles - including topics such as pollution 
control, safety, hazardous substances nuisance and amenity et cetera - NPS EN-1 also 
identifies a list of impacts which could arise from an Energy NSIP and the criteria by which 
they should be assessed. These specific topics include – inter alia – traffic and transport.  
4.2.4 
Should a project have significant transport implications, NPS EN-1 requires the applicant to 
provide a transport assessment, having consulted the Highways England and Highway 
Authorities as appropriate on the assessment and mitigation. Where appropriate, the applicant 
is required to prepare a travel plan including demand management measures to mitigate 
transport impacts. The applicant is also required to provide details of proposed measures to 
improve access by public transport, walking and cycling, to reduce the need for vehicle 
movements associated with the proposal and to mitigate transport impacts. 
Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) 
4.2.5 
In England and Wales, an on-shore electricity generating station is considered to be a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under PA 2008 if it has a capacity of more 
than 50 MW. As the Project would have a rated electrical output of at least 50 MW, and up to 
299 MW, it is classified as an NSIP under Section 14(1)(a) and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008.  
4.2.6 
Under Section 31 of the PA 2008, consent is required for development that is or forms part of 
an NSIP and therefore a Development Consent Order (DCO) application must be made to the 
Secretary of State (SoS) for the Project. 
4.2.7 
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by an application made under Section 
37 of the PA 2008 to the SoS. Section 37 of the PA 2008 (and associated legislation) also 
governs the content of a DCO Application, including requirements for certain accompanying 
documents. 
4.2.8 
These requirements are specified, in particular, in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009. These Regulations require that a DCO 
Application, where applicable, includes a Transport Assessment. As such, this Transport 
Assessment is submitted as part of the suite of documents that accompanies the DCO 
Application.

National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) 
4.2.9 
When the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was published on 27th March 2012, it 
replaced all Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) and Planning Policy Statements (PPS). 
4.2.10 The NPPF promotes sustainable development and states that there is to be a "presumption in 
favour of sustainable development" when making plans and decisions. 
4.2.11 A Transport Statement or Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be provided for all 
developments that generate significant amounts of movement (Paragraphs 32 and 36 of the 
NPPF) and decisions should ensure that they "are located where the need to travel will be 
minimised and the use of sustainable transport modes can be maximised" (Paragraph 34), 
and take account of whether: 
� 
“the opportunities for sustainable transport modes have been taken up depending upon 
the nature and location of the site, to reduce the need for major transport infrastructure; 
� 
safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all people; and  
� 
improvements can be undertaken within the transport network that cost effectively limit 
the significant impacts of the development.”  
4.2.12 To facilitate the use of sustainable modes of transport, Paragraph 32 states that, where 
feasible, developments should be located and designed to:  
� 
accommodate the efficient delivery of goods and supplies;  
� 
give priority to pedestrian and cycle movements, and have access to high quality public 
transport facilities; 
� 
create safe and secure layouts which minimise conflicts between traffic and cyclists or 
pedestrians […]; 
4.2.13 In terms of managing the off-site impacts of the traffic generated from the development, 
paragraph 32 also states: 
“Development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds where the residual 
cumulative impacts of development are severe”. 
Planning Practice Guidance – (Travel Plans, Transport Assessments and 
Statements in Decision Taking – Updated 06/03/2014) 
4.2.14 This guidance supersedes, in part, earlier guidance published by the Department for Transport 
in 2009 (‘Good Practice Guidelines: Delivering Travel Plans through the Planning Process’) 
and has been prepared in consultation with Department for Communities and Local 
Government (DCLG), bringing together current practice from examples from around the 
country.   
4.2.15 The guidelines cover, in particular: 
� 
when a Transport Assessment is required; 
� 
how the need for, and scope of a Transport Assessment should be established; and 
� 
what information should be included in Transport Assessments. 
4.2.16 The planning practice guidance provides advice on what information should be included in 
Transport Assessments and states that: 
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
22 
 
 
“Paragraph 32 of the National Planning Policy Framework sets out that all developments that 
generate significant amounts of transport movement should be supported by a Transport 
Statement or Transport Assessment.” 
4.2.17 It also states the following: 
“Key issues to consider at the start of preparing a Transport Assessment or Statement may 
include: 
� 
the planning context of the development proposal; 
� 
appropriate study parameters (i.e. area, scope and duration of study); 
� 
assessment of public transport capacity, walking/ cycling capacity and road network 
capacity; 
� 
road trip generation and trip distribution methodologies and/ or assumptions about the 
development proposal; 
� 
measures to promote sustainable travel; 
� 
safety implications of development; and 
� 
mitigation measures (where applicable) – including scope and implementation strategy.” 
Highways Agency Circular 02/2013: The Strategic Road Network and the 
Delivery of Sustainable Development 
4.2.18 Relevant policy is set out in Circular 02/2013 'The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of 
Sustainable Development’ published in September 2013, which replaced the previous Circular 
02/2007 ‘Planning and the Strategic Road Network’ published in March 2007. 
4.2.19 At the time this circular was prepared, Highways England was operating under its previous 
name as the Highways Agency.  Circular 02/2013 sets out the role of the then Highways 
Agency in engaging with communities and developers to deliver sustainable development and 
economic growth. 
4.2.20 Paragraph 9 sets out the broad policy aims of the circular as it relates to development 
proposals, stating that: 
“Development proposals are likely to be acceptable if they can be accommodated within the 
existing capacity of a section (link or junction) …or they do not increase demand for use of a 
section that is already operating at over-capacity levels, taking account of any travel plan, 
traffic management and/or capacity enhancement measures that may be agreed”. 
4.2.21 However, with reference to decision making regarding developments, paragraph 9 goes on to 
state: 
“However, development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds where the 
residual cumulative impacts of development are severe”. 
Highways Agency and the Planning Application Process: A Protocol for 
Dealing with Planning Applications (2014) 
4.2.22 In November 2011, the Highways Agency (now Highways England) published a protocol 
document outlining how the Highways Agency would deal with planning applications. This was 
updated in June 2014.  
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
23 
 
 
4.2.23 The document tables the information that Highways England require in order to engage in the 
pre-application scoping process and sets out the key principles as it relates to the mitigation of 
impacts of developments on the strategic road network. The document states that mitigation of 
impacts should be based on the following hierarchy: 
iii. Minimise the level of off-site mitigation required through the use of measures such as 
travel plans and development phasing; 
iv. Implement physical measures on the local road network to minimise impact on the 
strategic road network; 
v. Once all reasonable minimisation and off-network mitigation has been implemented, 
capacity improvements on the strategic road network will be considered. 
4.2.24 The document also states that the mitigation proposed "must be sufficient to offset the 
detriment to the strategic road network". 
Highways England – The Strategic Road Network Planning for the Future 
(September 2015) 
4.2.25 Highways England’s ‘Planning for the Future’ document sets out HE’s approach when 
considering planning applications.  The document provides guidance on what information 
should be contained within respective planning proposals in relation to the strategic road 
network (SRN), and the decision-making process.  
4.2.26 The five planning values identified by HE within this document are: 
� 
engage early; 
� 
work openly; 
� 
share evidence; 
� 
share knowledge; and 
� 
work collaboratively.  
4.2.27 The document places a great emphasis on early engagement with HE, in order to ensure that 
all parties can work as a collaborative to deliver the various outcomes in the most effective 
way.   By working jointly with HE, relevant parties can ensure effective local economic growth 
whilst promoting sustainable transport outcomes.  The document states: 
“Engaging early, such as pre-application, gives all parties maximum time to understand the 
impacts of proposed development on the SRN, the level of assessment required to 
understand impacts, and to agree the most appropriate actions required as a result to help 
ensure the development proposal is sound and deliverable.” 
4.3 
Local Policy and Guidance 
Central Bedfordshire Council Local Development Framework 
4.3.1 
The Core Strategy and Development Management Policies Document was adopted by Central 
Bedfordshire Council on 19th November 2009. This is the overarching policy document within 
the Local Development Framework (LDF) for the “North Area”, and sets out the broad strategy 
for development in the area up to 2021. 
4.3.2 
Relevant policies within the Core Strategy include: 
Transport Assessment

i) 
Policy CS1 – Development Strategy – relating to planned growth in the Northern Marston 
Vale and with specific reference to Wixams and Marston Moretaine; 
 
ii) 
Policy CS4 – relating to accessibility and transport – with the Council seeking to facilitate 
the delivery of strategic transport schemes identified in the Local Transport Plan and 
other strategies, and to focus new development in locations which promote sustainable 
travel patterns; and 
 
iii) 
Policy DM9 – relating to the need for Transport Assessments and Travel Plans to 
accompany relevant planning applications. 
Bedford Borough Council Emerging Local Plan 2035 (2017 Consultation 
Paper) 
4.3.3 
The Bedford Borough Council’s emerging Local Plan will replace and extend the current 
planning policy documents which cover the period up to 2021.  The new Local Plan will 
contain policies which will be used to assist decisions on planning applications throughout the 
Borough. 
4.3.4 
With regards to employment sites, the Local Plan supports “new form and/or quality of 
employment sites”, rather than duplicate existing undeveloped sites.  
4.3.5 
The Emerging Local Plan states that “New employment development should be located near 
to main roads, preferably re-using existing employment sites and be in locations with good 
access by public transport, bicycle and foot”.  
Central Bedfordshire Local Transport Plan 3 (April 2011 to March 2026) 
4.3.6 
Central Bedfordshire’s Local Transport Plan 3 was published in April 2011 to cover the period 
2011 to March 2026. 
4.3.7 
The LTP3 sets out a number of key strategies to address issues such as accessibility, road 
safety, public transport, walking and cycling, smarter choices and parking. 
4.3.8 
In terms of major transport schemes in the area, the LTP3 sets out information regarding the 
East-West Rail project, which runs adjacent to the Millbrook Power Project. The East-West 
Rail Consortium proposes an upgraded continuous route between Oxford and Cambridge, 
with increased frequency of services on this route. The overall East-West Rail Project is split 
into three sections, with the western section running immediately adjacent being the most 
relevant section to the Millbrook Power Project. The western section is scheduled to deliver 
rail connections between Oxford, Aylesbury, Milton Keynes and Bedford through the Marston 
Vale, allowing for current services on this line to ensure residents between these locations do 
not lose services as a result of a through route. 
Bedford Borough Local Transport Plan 3 (2011-2021) 
4.3.9 
Bedford Borough’s first Local Transport Plan since the re-structuring of the county was 
published in April 2011 and outlines plans to tackle Bedford’s transport problems.  
4.3.10  One objective from the Local Transport Plan is:  
 
“To contribute to better safety, security and health by reducing death, injury or illness from 
transport and promoting travel modes that are beneficial to health”.  
4.3.11 This development supports this objective with the use of a Travel Plan, detailed further in 
Section 5. Modes of travel beneficial to health such as cycling are promoted with adequate 
resources available for employees.

Conclusions 
4.4.1 
This Transport Assessment identifies the national and local policy relating to transport, and 
concludes that there is no reason in terms of transport policy why the Project should not be 
progressed given there are no severe residual cumulative impacts as will be demonstrated in 
what follows.

Travel Demand Management Strategy 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
To support the Project, a travel demand management strategy has been created to manage 
vehicle impact on the surrounding highway network during both the Construction and 
Operational phases. This strategy is considered further in this section.  
5.2 
Construction Access Strategy 
5.2.1 
To manage the impact of the Construction phase movements, the Construction Access 
Strategy consists of a series of measures including: 
i. 
a framework Construction Environmental Management Plan;  
ii. 
a Route Management Plan; 
iii. traffic management at the Green Lane / Proposed Site Access; 
iv. traffic management at the Houghton Lane Gas Connection construction access;  
v. traffic management at the Station Lane Electrical Connection construction access; 
vi. the Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy;  
vii. a footpath management plan; and 
viii. an Abnormal Load delivery strategy.  
5.2.2 
These are considered in more detail in the following  sections. 
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) 
5.2.3 
As part of the Construction Access Strategy, a framework Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) has been prepared, part of which describes methods to reduce the 
impacts of the construction traffic servicing the Site. The strategy consists of the following 
main elements: 
i. 
design:  
- 
minimising the requirement for material to be imported or exported. For example, the 
movement of earthworks material off-site will be reduced to a minimum by 
maximising the use of raised material into the landscaping; 
- 
specifying materials and construction techniques that are resource-friendly. 
ii. 
using locally sourced materials where possible, to reducing haulage lengths; 
iii. managing effectively the supply of goods to construction sites – this can significantly 
reduce both road vehicle mileage and construction costs and wastage; and 
iv. managing the movement of workers into the development – the Contractor will produce a 
comprehensive Construction Travel Plan, detailing how their workforce will travel to the 
Site. 
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
27 
 
 
5.2.4 
The Construction Environmental Management Plan will be prepared to provide details of all 
Construction traffic movements during the life of the construction project - i.e. from design to 
decommissioning. The Construction Environmental Management Plan will consider the 
following elements: 
i. 
Design; 
ii. 
the Route Management Plan and Access Strategy; 
iii. Procurement strategy; 
iv. Operational Efficiency; 
v. Delivery Practice; 
vi. Demand Smoothing; 
vii. Managing Construction Traffic; 
viii. Targets and Monitoring; and 
ix. Waste Management. 
5.2.5 
A copy of the Outline CEMP is contained in Appendix 5.1. Until the contractor is appointed by 
the MPL Applicant, the details of the Construction Access Strategy will, perforce, be limited at 
this stage. The strategy will be defined in greater detail upon appointment of the contractor. 
Route Management Plan 
5.2.6 
A Route Management Plan will be defined within the CEMP, and implemented to control 
construction heavy vehicle movements, and to prevent their routing through sensitive areas on 
the local highway network - including along Stewartby Way.  
5.2.7 
Two routes will be used for construction access to the Generating Equipment Site: 
i. 
via Green Lane (from the north-west); and 
ii. 
via Millbrook Road (from the south).  
5.2.8 
The Green Lane route will be used to access the Generating Equipment Site. It directs users 
from the A421, onto Bedford Road via either the northern A421 junction at Wootton, or the 
southern A421 junction at Marston Moretaine. Bedford Road and Green Lane to the west of 
the Project Site are both suitable for HGV movements, and an assessment of the Bedford 
Road / Green Lane junction reported in Section 8 demonstrates that there is available 
capacity.  
5.2.9 
The Millbrook Road construction access route adopts the approved Route Management Plan 
implemented by the occupiers of the Millbrook Proving Ground, located to the south of the 
Project. This route takes users from the A421 / A6 junction, north on the A5141, south along 
the B530, then along Millbrook Road to the access for the Electrical and Gas Connection 
construction sites.   
5.2.10 Construction access to the Gas Connection Site will be obtained from three points: 
i. 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site (having accessed 
the Site from Green Lane and Bedford Road as per the Generating Equipment Site) for 
the northern sections of the Gas Connection Site; 
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
28 
 
 
ii. 
from Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane by an existing field access to the east of Houghton 
Lane to an existing agricultural track which will be used for both construction and 
operational access to the Above Ground Installation (AGI) and the southern end of the 
Gas Connection Site south of Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane; and 
iii. from Houghton Lane to both the east and the west, to both the southern and central 
sections of the Gas Connection Site surrounding Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane. 
5.2.11 Construction access to the Electrical Connection Site will be obtained from two points: 
i. 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site (having accessed 
the Site from Green Lane and Bedford Road as per the Generating Equipment Site) for 
the northern section of the Electrical Connection Site; and 
ii. 
for the southern section of the Electrical Connection Site, from Station Lane. 
Traffic management at the Green Lane / Proposed Site Access 
5.2.12 Network Rail has sought that any queuing at the Green Lane / Project Access must be 
managed to ensure that no obstruction occurs to the railway at the Green Lane / Stewartby 
Station level crossing during the 22-month Construction phase.  
5.2.13 As discussed and agreed with Network Rail, a temporary traffic light-controlled traffic 
management scheme will be implemented during the construction of both the access and the 
Generating Equipment Site to ensure the efficient movement of vehicles along Green Lane, 
and to ensure that no such obstructions to the rail crossing occur.  
5.2.14 The traffic management scheme will be temporary, only operating during the construction 
working hours. Outside of these construction working hours, the signs and lights will be 
removed so that traffic can flow unobstructed. 
5.2.15 A Method Statement, prepared to respond to a request from Network Rail, is contained in 
Appendix 5.2. 
Traffic management at the Houghton Lane / Proposed Site Access 
5.2.16 A traffic management scheme has been prepared for the construction accesses to the Gas 
Connection from Houghton Lane. This plan is shown in Appendix 5.3.  
5.2.17 This scheme involves access to the southern section of the Project Site for construction 
vehicles from Houghton Lane via the following locations including: 
� 
East of Houghton Lane using an existing agricultural access opposite a farm building; 
� 
North of Houghton Lane (approximately 200m north of the aforementioned agricultural 
access)  
5.2.18 For more detail on the Houghton Lane access points, see the plan contained in Appendix 5.3.  
5.2.19 This scheme will be deployed during construction; no further scheme is required for the 
operational phase. 
Traffic management at the Station Lane / Proposed Site Access 
5.2.20 Two traffic management schemes have been prepared for the construction accesses to the 
Electrical Connection from Station Lane, as shown in Appendix 5.4: 
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
29 
 
 
i. 
the first scheme is the traffic management scheme for the Electrical Connection 
construction access. This would be installed for the duration of the construction works and 
consists of signage in accordance with chapter 8 of the traffic signals manual; 
ii. 
the second relates to overnight closures of Station Lane. This would enable the overnight 
installation, and subsequent decommission, of a temporary, pre-fabricated overhead 
scaffold, to enable de-tensioning and re-tensioning works to the overhead electrical cables 
to proceed without further affecting Station Lane. Associated with these works would be 
closure of a lay-by on Station Lane for approximately 1 week to accommodate the 
winching apparatus to de-tension and re-tension these overhead cables. 
5.2.21 These schemes will be deployed during construction; no further scheme is required for the 
operational phase. 
Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy 
5.2.22 Providing an appropriate level of parking on-site for the Construction activity is essential – 
over-provision would result in attracting too many vehicle trips, whilst under-provision could 
lead to fly-parking in the surrounding streets as well as less productive working as the 
workforce has further to walk. 
5.2.23 To serve the workforce working at the Generating Equipment Site, delineated areas will be 
provided within the Laydown Area for parking. Further parking areas will be provided adjacent 
to the Gas and Electricity Connection areas. 
5.2.24 Similarly, areas will be defined on-site for the parking of heavy goods vehicles delivering to 
site.  
5.2.25 As part of the involvement with the contractors to minimise the movements onto site, the 
available levels of car parking will be monitored and amended as required to reflect the 
change in on-site activity. 
Footpath Management Plan 
5.2.26 During the course of the Construction phase, the following existing footpaths would be 
affected: 
i. 
FP65 and FP7 would be crossed by the gas pipeline during the installation of the Gas 
Connection;  
ii. 
Footpath FP7 and FP14 crossed by the access to the Electrical Connection; and 
iii. the new permissive footpaths proposed as part of the LLRS alongside the railway and into 
the Rookery South pit will be adjacent the proposed Site Access road.  
5.2.27 Once the contractor has been appointed and the details of the construction programme are 
agreed, the MPL Applicant will liaise with the Highway Authorities’ Rights of Way Officers and 
prepare a Footpath Management Plan for agreement with the Joint Authorities prior to the 
footpaths being affected. This will ensure the footpath routes are protected so that the 
pedestrians may use them safely. The protection details are subject to agreement, but would 
include: 
i. 
publication of the construction dates when the route would be affected;  
ii. 
safeguarding of the footpath route users by providing conspicuous fencing; 
iii. keeping a route of a suitable standard open during the works; and

iv. minimising the time that the route is affected. 
5.2.28 Following the completion of the Construction phase, no footpaths would be further impacted 
during the Operational phase. 
Abnormal Load Delivery Strategy 
5.2.29 The Gas Turbine Generators would be delivered to the Project in as small loads as is practical 
or feasible. Notwithstanding, some exceptionally heavy load deliveries will be required. This is 
referred to as the ‘Abnormal Indivisible Loads’ (AILs). 
5.2.30 The MPL Applicant will employ suitably experienced abnormal load contractors to deliver any 
such apparatus. 
5.2.31 The MPL Applicant will liaise fully with all the highway authorities and Police forces along the 
agreed route to confirm the following: 
i. 
the necessity of any such exceptionally heavy load; 
ii. 
the proposed route; 
iii. any necessary traffic management and road protection measures; and 
iv. the date and time of the movement along the route. 
5.3 
Travel Plan Measures 
5.3.1 
A Travel Plan has been created specifically targeting employees to decrease the number of 
vehicles accessing the Project.  
5.3.2 
In reality, any significant mode shift away from the private car is unlikely for the Project, as 
there are likely to be only four workers on site at the same time.  
5.3.3 
Notwithstanding, implementation of the following initiatives will be investigated to encourage 
the use of alternative modes of travel to the private car:  
� 
Cycle Storage and Shelters – Cycling may form an attractive non-car alternative for 
workers who live locally. To encourage cycle use, on-site cycle storage provision will be 
investigated. Storage would be secure, and located within the area covered by CCTV;  
� 
Showers and changing facilities – showers and changing facilities may be provided 
within the Building for workers who walk and cycle to work. These would be heated, 
maintained and cleaned on a regular basis; 
� 
Secure Lockers – should there be a need, Millbrook Power Limited will provide secure 
lockers adjacent the changing facilities for cyclists and walkers to store their equipment 
safely during work hours;  
� 
Car Sharing – car sharing is an effective way of reducing the demand for car movement.  
It involves two or more people sharing a car for their journey to / from work, which brings 
direct cost savings to both parties. Millbrook Power Limited staff will be encouraged to 
identify possible car share partners identified in the local Central Bedfordshire Council car 
share scheme: https://liftshare.com/uk/community/luton-and-central-bedfordshire. It is 
free for members to sign up, register their journeys and find someone to share a journey 
with; 
� 
Working with other future local employees – with the Rookery Pit being promoted for 
further employment uses, future opportunities exist to co-operate with these other users

to reduce car trips – such as the greater exposure to the car sharing database amongst 
all other employees within the Rookery Pit. The MPL Applicant will co-operate and 
consider changing shift patterns to increase the likelihood of finding car and cycle sharing 
partners;  
� 
Nominate Responsibility – an employee will be nominated to promote the travel 
measures, to initiate change among colleagues, and to be the conduit for any comments 
arising relating to potential improvement of the facilities on offer.

Construction Vehicle Trip Generation, 
Distribution and Assignment 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
In order to assess robustly the impact of the construction movements of the Project, a vehicle 
trip generation assessment has been undertaken for the Construction phase.  
6.1.2 
For the purposes of this assessment, these construction movements are considered in the 
context of the 2017 Observed flows as a proxy for the network flows when the Construction 
phase starts. 
6.2 
Construction Movements 
6.2.1 
An assessment has been made of the likely traffic generated by the construction of the 
Project. This vehicle trip generation has been derived with reference to previous similar Power 
Plant applications, undertaken for the Construction phase of 22 months.  
6.2.2 
For the purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that:  
i. 
because of the many and varied skills needed by the workforce to be employed at this 
site, the majority of the construction workers are unlikely to be local residents; 
ii. 
as alternative means of travel are limited, especially at the start and end of the normal 
construction worker shifts, it has been assumed that all of these trips would need to be 
made by car;  
iii. reflecting typical construction industry work patterns across the United Kingdom, the 
majority of these movements are made outside of the peak hours; and 
each vehicle would have 1.6 occupants per car – reflecting the car occupancy within the 
National Travel Survey. 
6.2.3 
There are three components which comprise the construction traffic for the Millbrook Power 
project.  These are: 
i. 
Generating Equipment Construction Traffic; 
ii. 
Electrical Connection Construction Traffic; and 
iii. Gas Connection Construction Traffic. 
6.2.4 
The flows are reported in Appendix 6.1 by Day and by Peak Hour for each quarter to reflect 
the changes in total movements of construction workers throughout the construction process.  
The third construction period, Q3, forms the peak construction traffic period. These flows are 
summarised in Table 6.1:

6.2.5 
Two construction traffic routes are proposed: from Green Lane - to the north of the Site; and 
from Millbrook Road - to the south. These are shown in Appendices 5.3 and 5.4.  The 
following assumptions have been used to derive the assignment of the construction traffic 
from the two points of access: 
• 
Green Lane: 
- 
100% of the Generating Equipment Construction Traffic; 
- 
50% of the Electrical Connection Construction Traffic; and  
- 
50% of the Gas Connection Construction Traffic. 
• 
Millbrook Road: 
- 
0% of the Generating Equipment Construction Traffic; 
- 
50% of the Electrical Connection Construction Traffic; and  
- 
50% of the Gas Connection Construction Traffic. 
6.2.6 
The Generating Equipment and Gas Connection construction traffic has been assessed with 
reference to the information within the Design Concept Report. For the purposes of this 
assessment it has been assumed that 75% of this traffic will be for the Generating Equipment 
and the remaining 25% will be for the Gas Connection.

6.5 
Worst Case Construction Phase Vehicle Trip Generation on Green Lane 
6.5.1 
The flows contained in Section 6.2 represent typical Construction phase flows averaged 
across the period. To assess the worst case daily construction trip generation, a further 
assessment has been made of an event that would typically occur once, at worst possibly 
twice, during the course of the Construction phase.  
6.5.2 
The following has been assumed for this worst-case Construction phase assessment: 
i. 
this event would arise from deliveries of ready-mixed concrete for the casting of the main 
foundation. To avoid the need for construction joints (with the associated impact on long-
term durability), it assumed that this base would be cast in one operation, during one day; 
ii. 
a typical Generating Equipment plant foundation detail is shown in Appendix 6.2 - this 
would require around 750m3 of concrete; 
iii. assuming the typical load is 6m3 of concrete per HGV, this would require around 125 
deliveries; 
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
35 
 
 
iv. due to the time that it takes to process the arriving concrete vehicle, to sample the batch, 
pump it to the correct area, then place and compact the concrete, it is likely that the 
delivery rate would be around one vehicle arriving every 5 minutes through the day for ten 
hours;  
v. this operation would need a total of 30 operatives on site – all of whom would need to be 
on site before the AM peak hour, and would work until after the PM peak hour had 
finished; 
vi. because of the priority needed to be provided to the concrete delivery, that no other 
construction operation will be ongoing on the Generating Equipment Site at the same 
time; and 
vii. this work would form one of the earlier work tasks in the project – i.e., it is assumed that 
this would be in the first quarter. 
6.5.3 
The worst-case Construction phase vehicle trip movements are summarised in Table 6.4.

6.5.4 
As there are one or two of these significant concrete casting operations on this site, the 
number of days when such an operation would generate these higher levels of flow is 
anticipated to be limited to one or two days in total across the whole project. 
6.5.5 
The worst-case Construction phase vehicle movements in Table 6.4 are compared to the 
typical Construction phase vehicle movements identified in Table 6.1. Whilst this worst case 
would generate around 80 more HGV movements across the working day, it appears to have 
a similar HGV impact during either the AM or PM peak period – whilst there appears to be 
significantly less car trips during the network peak hour.  
6.5.6 
As such, the typical Construction phase vehicle trips identified in Sections 6.2 to 6.4 are used 
in this assessment of the peak hour traffic impact of the development on the local highway 
network. 
6.6 
Construction Phase Distribution and Assignment on Green Lane  
6.6.1 
The distribution and assignment of the construction heavy vehicles along Green Lane will 
differ to that of the private cars. These two assignments are therefore reported.  
Transport Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
36 
 
 
Heavy Vehicle Movements 
6.6.2 
As detailed in Section 5, a Construction Environmental Management Plan – including a Route 
Management Strategy - will be implemented to minimise the impact of the construction phase 
traffic upon sensitive areas on the surrounding network.  
6.6.3 
As detailed in Section 5, all heavy vehicles are required to access the Project Site from 
prescribed routes.  
6.6.4 
For the purposes of this assessment - and in advance of the Contactor being appointed and 
the material sources being identified - it has been assumed that all the heavy vehicles would 
travel westwards along Green Lane, then travel north along Bedford Road towards the A421 
to avoid routing through Marston Moretaine. 
6.6.5 
All HGV peak movements are assumed to arrive and depart in the same peak hour. 
Car Movements 
6.6.6 
The distribution and assignment for car movements differs to that of the heavy vehicles, as 
construction workers’ cars will not be prevented from travelling from the east along Green 
Lane towards the B530.  
6.6.7 
The following assignment, adopted by the previously consented Covanta Development, has 
been applied to the predicted total Millbrook Power Project 79 car movements, to the nearest 
unit: 
i. 
10% - 8 - east on Green Lane to the B530; 
ii. 
90% - 71 - west on Green Lane to Bedford Road; of which  
- 
35% - 28 - south on Bedford Road  
- 
45% - 36 - north on Bedford Road 
- 
10% - 8 - westwards along minor rural roads towards Cranfield etc.  
 
6.7 
Construction Phase Traffic Flows on Green Lane

construction, Q3) are summarised in Figure 6.1.

6.8.1 
The distribution and assignment of the construction heavy vehicles along Millbrook Road will 
differ to that of the private cars. Two assessments are therefore reported.  
Heavy Vehicle Movements 
6.8.2 
As detailed in Section 5, a Construction Environmental Management Plan – including a Route 
Management Strategy - will be implemented to minimise the impact of the Construction phase 
traffic upon sensitive areas on the surrounding network. All heavy vehicles are required to 
access the Project Site from a prescribed route eastwards along Millbrook Road towards the 
B530. 
Car Movements 
6.8.3 
The distribution and assignment for car movements differs to that of the heavy vehicles, as 
construction cars will not be prevented from travelling west along Millbrook Road towards 
Station Lane and the A421.  
6.8.4

assignment pattern adopted by the previously consented Covanta RRF Project:

6.10 Summary  
6.10.1 This Section summarises the likely vehicle trip generation from the Project for the Construction 
phase on both Green Lane and Millbrook Road. 
6.10.2 Whilst the reported Worst Case would generate more heavy vehicle movements across the 
working day, it would generate less total vehicle trips during both the AM and PM peak 
periods. As the number of car trips is much lower in this Worst Case assessment, the Typical 
Construction Phase Vehicle Trips are used in this assessment.

Operational Vehicle Trip Generation, 
Distribution and Assignment 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
This Section considers the peak hour trip generation, distribution and assignment of vehicle 
trips generated by the Operational phase of the Project.  
7.1.2 
The Operational phase flows are considered against two different Future Year scenarios as 
stated below:  
� 
2031 Operational Test 1 – assuming the Future Year of 2031, assuming the background 
growth in traffic is reflected by TEMPRO factors and the additional trips from the 
development of Stewartby Broadmead Road; and 
� 
2031 Operational Test 2 – assuming the Future Year of 2031, assuming the background 
growth in traffic is reflected by TEMPRO factors, and the additional trips from the 
development of Stewartby Broadmead Road and the Covanta RRF Development. 
7.2 
Operational Phase Person Trip Generation 
7.2.1 
During the operation of the Project, up to four members of staff would be working on site at 
any one time (a total of up to 12 per day). A three shift working day will provide the necessary 
24-hour coverage. As the shift changes would be timed to reflect the generally quieter 
operational times, these would avoid the highway network peak hour: Any highway impact 
during operation would therefore be minimised.    
7.2.2 
Reflecting their adopted lifestyle and long-term job opportunity, the members of the full-time 
operational phase staff are more likely to be locally resident than the more transient 
construction phase workers. As such, not all of these 12 operational phase movements per 
day are assumed to be made by car. An assessment of the adopted operational phase mode 
share is contained in Section 7.3.  
7.2.3 
In addition to the operational phase movements, routine maintenance of the Generating 
Equipment is required – depending upon the level of use, this is assumed to be around once a 
year with the likely demand. During the routine maintenance phases, there may be up to 40 
additional maintenance staff on site typically for one month. As these workers are unlikely to 
be locally resident, and as alternative means of travel are limited, it has been assumed that all 
of these trips would be made by car, and that each vehicle would have 1.6 occupants per car 
– reflecting the average car occupancy within the National Travel Survey.  
7.2.4 
Reflecting the typical working hours on construction sites, it is assumed that majority of these 
Maintenance phase movements would be made outside of the network peak. Reflecting the 
Construction phase assumptions, to provide a robust assessment it has been assumed that 
25% of the total vehicle movements would be during the peak hour (i.e., 7 trips).  
7.2.5 
A further five HGV movements per day are assumed during the maintenance phase, none 
during the peak hour. 
7.2.6 
During the Operational phase, there would be minimal - if any - movements to either of the 
Gas Connection, or Electrical Connection areas. These movements would be intermittent, and 
would be limited to periodic routine inspection and maintenance operations.

7.3 
 Operational Phase Employee Mode Share and Vehicle Trips 
7.3.1 
An estimate has been made of the mode share of the Operational phase employees using 
local Journey to Work data obtained from the 2011 Census.  
7.3.2 
The 2011 Census data has been obtained for the ‘Middle Super Output’ area within which the 
Project will be located - the ‘Bedford 020’ area, which incorporates Stewartby. The results are 
summarised in Table 7.1, the Census data contained in Appendix 7.1. 
7.3.3 
Assuming that the 12 trips per day generated by the Project reflect the current mode choice, 
these Operational phase movements per day are also shown in Table 7.1.

The peak hour traffic flows from the Operational phase of the Project have been identified as 
being minimal – the worst case peak hour trip generation (during the periodic Maintenance 
cycle) generates one additional peak hour movement on the network every 9 minutes.

Operational Phase Distribution and Assignment 
Operational Phase Employees 
7.4.1 
As identified in Section 7.2, in the operational phase almost no trips would be generated 
during the peak hour by the 4 workers per shift. As such, no assessment has been made of 
the distribution and assignment of these trips. 
Maintenance 
7.4.2 
During the routine maintenance, the heavy vehicle and car trips are assumed to assign in 
accordance with the construction phase detailed in Section 6.5, albeit that these maintenance 
trips will not be as significant as the construction phase movements.  
7.4.3 
The assignment of the operational Phase trips during the Maintenance work is summarised in

The 2031 Future Year flows have been assessed, incorporating the Operational phase of the 
Project.  
7.7.2 
The traffic impact of the Operational phase of the Project has been identified as being minimal 
– around 1 additional peak hour movement on the network every 9 minutes. 
7.7.3 
The more significant changes in traffic flows in 2031 are mainly due to the Covanta 
development.

generated by the Project.  
8.1.2 
This assessment uses the traffic flows identified in Section 6, and reviews the impact on local 
links and junctions on the highway network.  
8.2 
Link Impact 
8.2.1 
When assessing the construction phase traffic flow impact, the highest third quarter (Q3) 
movements detailed in Section 6 have been used. The majority of construction phase 
movements will be outside of the network peak hours. 
8.2.2 
A plan showing the seven links assessed is included in Appendix 8.1.   
8.2.3 
The impact on the local links is summarised in Table 8.1.

8.2.4 
The results in Table 8.1 identify that the worst case third quarter Construction phase traffic 
impact upon Green Lane and Bedford Road is generally low, reflecting the relatively low base 
flows. At worst, the additional 86 trips generated by all aspects of the construction during the 
construction phase - one additional vehicle every 42 seconds in the AM and PM peaks - is 
unlikely to significantly affect traffic conditions.  
8.2.5 
Similarly, the worst case second quarter construction phase traffic impact on Millbrook Road is 
also limited - the increase in traffic represents one additional vehicle every two minutes.  
8.3 
Junction Capacity Assessment 
8.3.1 
This Section reviews the impact on the local junctions of Project Site / Green Lane, and 
Bedford Road / Green Lane - during the Construction phase.  
8.3.2 
For the purposes of this assessment, the construction movements are considered in the 
context of the 2017 flows as a proxy for the network flows when the construction phase starts.

with minimal queuing or delay. 
8.4.3 
The operational conditions on the local highway network will therefore be imperceptibly 
affected by the Construction phase.

11 Mitigation 
11.1 Introduction 
11.1.1 This Section summarises the proposed mitigation strategy for the local highway network to 
manage the effects of the Project.  
11.1.2 This Section considers the mitigation measures for both the construction and operation 
phases.   
11.2 Mitigation during Construction 
11.2.1 The assessment of construction phase-generated impact on the surrounding links and 
junctions on the local highway network has been considered earlier in this Assessment. This 
concluded that no highway capacity mitigation is required to respond to capacity issues.  
11.2.2 To manage any short-term construction-generated impact on the surrounding highway 
network, the following will be provided:  
i. 
a framework Construction Environmental Management Plan to reduce the transport 
impacts of the construction traffic servicing the Project Site, and the movements 
associated with construction waste;  
ii. 
a Route Management Plan to direct HGVs away from the sensitive local transport 
network; 
iii. a traffic management scheme at the Green Lane / Proposed Site Access to control 
queuing and to ensure no blocking of the rail develops; 
iv. a traffic management scheme at the Houghton Lane / Proposed Construction Access; 
v. a traffic management scheme at the Station Lane / Proposed Construction Access; 
vi. the Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy to control the vehicle generation and minimise 
impact on the surrounding area;  
vii. a footpath management plan to ensure any footpath route affected by the works are 
protected, and that the pedestrians may use them safely; and  
viii. an Abnormal Load Delivery strategy to manage the delivery to site of the major items of 
plant and apparatus that are indivisible. 
11.3 Mitigation during Operation 
11.3.1 The assessment of operational phase-generated impact on the surrounding links and 
junctions on the local highway network has been considered earlier in this Assessment. This 
concluded that no highway capacity mitigation is required to respond to capacity issues.  
11.3.2 To manage any Operational phase-generated impact on the surrounding highway network, a 
Travel Plan has been created specifically targeting employees to decrease the number of 
vehicles accessing the Project.  
11.3.3 In reality, any significant mode shift away from the private car is unlikely for the Project, as 
there are likely to be only five workers on site at the same time. Notwithstanding, a series of 
initiatives will be implemented to encourage the use of alternative modes of travel to the 
private car.

12 Conclusions 
12.1.1 Peter Brett Associates has been commissioned by Millbrook Power Limited (the MPL 
Applicant) to prepare a Transport Assessment to support the application for a Development 
Consent Order for the Millbrook Power Project. 
12.1.2 The existing highway access to the Project Site is well-suited to minimise the vehicle impact 
on surrounding communities, as Bedford Road, the old A421 around 2km to the north-west of 
the Project Site connects to the new A421 and the M1 Junction 13 without passing through 
existing settlements. 
12.1.3 Pre-application transport scoping discussions have taken place with a range of statutory and 
non-statutory consultees and stakeholders at all levels to discuss the Project. The MPL 
Applicant has engaged with the Highways England, Central Bedfordshire Council, Bedford 
Borough Council and Network Rail to agree the scope of work for this transport assessment, 
this input has directly informed the proposals. 
12.1.4 The results of the junction capacity assessment show that the Bedford Road / Green Lane 
priority junction currently operates well within capacity in both peaks with no queuing.  
12.1.5 There is no reason from the policy perspective why the Project should not be progressed. 
12.1.6 In order to assess robustly the impact of the Construction movements of the Project, a vehicle 
trip generation assessment has been undertaken for the Construction phase. The junction 
capacity assessments show that the Green Lane / Proposed Site Access, and the Bedford 
Road / Green Lane junctions both operate well within capacity during the Construction phase 
with minimal queuing or delay. The local highway network will therefore not be affected by the 
Construction phase. 
12.1.7 The 2031 Future Year conditions have been assessed, incorporating the operational phase of 
the Project. The impact of the operational phase has been identified as being minimal – 
around 1 additional peak hour movement on the network every 9 minutes. The local highway 
network will therefore not be affected by the operational phase.    
12.1.8 The Assessment also reports the mitigation measures for both the Construction and Operation 
phases. To manage any Construction-generated impact on the surrounding highway network, 
the following will be provided: 
i. 
a framework Construction Environmental Management Plan to reduce the transport 
impacts of the construction traffic servicing the Site, and the movements associated with 
construction waste;  
ii. 
a Route Management Plan to direct HGVs away from the sensitive local transport 
network; 
iii. a traffic management scheme at the Green Lane / Proposed Site Access to control 
queuing and to ensure no blocking of the rail develops; 
iv. a traffic management scheme at the Houghton Lane / Proposed Construction Access; 
v. a traffic management scheme at the Station Lane / Proposed Construction Access; 
vi. the Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy to control the vehicle generation and minimise 
impact on the surrounding area;  
vii. a footpath management plan to ensure any footpath route affected by the works are 
protected, and that the pedestrians may use them safely; and

viii. an Abnormal Load Delivery strategy to manage the delivery to site of the major items of 
plant and apparatus that are indivisible. 
12.1.9 Whilst any significant mode shift away from the private car is unlikely for the Project - there are 
likely to be only four workers on site at the same time - a Travel Plan has been created 
specifically targeting employees to decrease the number of vehicles accessing the Project. A 
range of non-car Initiatives will be implemented to encourage the use of alternative modes of 
travel to the private car 
12.1.10 Given the scale of development and anticipated impact with reference to paragraph 32 of the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), the cumulative impact of the development is not 
considered to be severe.

Introduction 
 
This meeting was arranged to scope the planning and highway authorities’ 
requirements for a transport assessment to support the Development Consent 
Order (DCO) application to be made by Millbrook Power Ltd. This meeting 
follows the issue of the DCO EIA Scoping Report in June 2014 to all relevant 
consultees.  
 
It is intended that this technical assessment process would progress together 
with the authorities to ensure that all matters arising be discussed and dealt 
with together in a mutually acceptable manner as the assessment work 
proceeds.    
 
Whilst there were no Network Rail (NR) representatives at this meeting, they 
had been invited. Copies of these Notes will be circulated to NR, the intention 
is that they be invited to future meetings.

Project Description and Historical / Background Planning Context 
 
The Project Applicant is Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL), an energy development 
company established for the Project by Watt Power Limited. 
 
As detailed in the EIA Scoping Report, and shown on the attached 
presentation and draft Figures 12.1 and 12.2 of the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) circulated to the attendees, the Project would 
comprise:  
 
i) 
a new Power Generation Plant, a gas fired peaking 299MW power 
generating station fuelled by natural gas. The Generation Plant would be 
accessed via a new purpose built access road from Green Lane, 
Stewartby; 
 
ii) 
a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System;

2.5 
 
iii) 
a new Electrical Connection to export power from the Power Generation 
Plant to the National Grid Electricity Transmission system for distribution;  
 
iv) 
a temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site;  
 
v) 
a new purpose-built 1.7km access road constructed from Green Lane to 
the Generating Equipment; 
 
vi) 
the route of the access road would follow the existing track which borders 
the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery South Pit, the 
Access Road would descend the ramp to enter into the Pit, and cross 
through the Pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site along the 
alignment shown on Figure 12.1.   
 
The Generating Equipment within the Project would run during periods of high 
electricity demand to support the high-output “base” suppliers such as nuclear 
and coal-fired power stations, as well as to complement the output from 
renewable energy sources.  As such, this plant will not operate constantly - an 
environmental permit limited to 1,500 hours operation per year is being sought. 
 
There are a series of extant consents for Rookery South Pit that could be 
implemented concurrently with the Project:  
 
i) 
the “Low Level Restoration Scheme” to restore the Rookery South Pit, 
including drainage, landscaping, and earthworks to ensure the long-term 
stability of the area (this will be fundamentally completed before the MPL 
works commence); 
 
ii) 
Covanta has an extant DCO for an Energy from Waste (EfW) plant, with 
an annual throughput of 580,000t of refuse passing into the Site for 
incineration. The IPCC order was published in March 2013 – although 
there is currently some uncertainty as to delivery timetables for this 
though; and 
 
iii) 
an Integrated Waste Management Facility associated with this EfW – 
albeit this facility would be entirely dependent upon the EfW facility.  
 
The design of the Gas and Electrical Connection is on-going, hence the lack of 
certainty at this point and why the redline boundary in the EIA Scoping Report 
covers a significant area of land. In particular: 
 
i) 
the Gas Connection will consist of an Above Ground Installation (AGI) on 
the existing gas main, connecting the existing pipeline apparatus to the 
Generating Equipment; 
 
ii) 
a sub-station would be located adjacent the Generating Equipment Site 
within the Rookery South Pit - and will transform the Plant output to a 
voltage compatible with the National Grid network voltage.

Likely Vehicle Trip Generation 
 
An average vehicle trip generation estimate for the 18 month construction 
period has been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, based on observations at 
other similar facilities. This is attached. This would inform the traffic impact 
assessment on the surrounding highway network. 
 
It was agreed that a further sensitivity test would be provided, identifying the 
very occasional worst case daily construction trip generation – likely to be the 
casting of the concrete foundation for the facility. These sensitivity test flows 
would also be applied in demonstrating the impact of the proposals on the local 
network from this generation.  
 
During operation of the Generating Equipment - and unlike the earlier 
approved Covanta DCO - the trip generation would be minimal – it is likely to 
consist of a maximum 4 staff attending each shift.  
 
The Generating Equipment would be subject to periodical maintenance during 
operation, undertaken by a specialist maintenance contractor. The frequency 
of the maintenance operation would be determined by the number of hours the 
Project would be running, but is likely to occur no more frequently than 
annually. During this maintenance period, the numbers of vehicles accessing 
the site would increase. Further details will be provided within the TA.

Proposed Access Arrangements and Highway Authority requirements 
 
To the Generation Equipment area from Green Lane 
 
The Covanta DCO included for an approved ghost island priority junction to 
Green Lane.  If Covanta delivers this arrangement, it would have sufficient 
spare capacity to accommodate the MPL application trip generation without 
amendment.  
 
It was noted and acknowledged that this ghost island access arrangement was 
derived to accommodate a significantly higher daily operational trip generation 
than is being proposed by the MPL application, and is therefore considered to 
be excessive.   
 
In the event that Covanta did not deliver this ghost island priority junction, a 
more suitably scaled alternative for this application is being considered by 
MPL. 
 
A simple priority junction, possibly similar to the attached PBA drawing 
reference 31116/3010/003, is proposed as the site access. In capacity terms, 
this will be tested and reported with the peak hour sensitivity test construction 
movements as a worst case to demonstrate its suitability.  
 
The forward visibility from the north-east (i.e., from Stewartby) to the vehicles 
turning right into the site would be marginally below the desirable minimum 
stated within the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, albeit within the 
requirements stated within the Manual for Streets. CBC confirmed that they 
would accept this situation subject to the provision of traffic calming on Green 
Lane to control speeds and provide advance notice of the potential turning 
movements.

The proposed construction access route, and any further HGV movements 
during operation and maintenance, would be from the A421 dual carriageway, 
and from either the Marston Moretaine (A421 / Beancroft Road) junction to the 
south, or the A421 / Woburn Road junction to the north.  This is shown on the 
attached Figure 12.2, tabled at the meeting. 
 
It was noted that the STEM College development off Green Lane included a 
commitment to implement a quality footway along Green Lane. 
 
To the Gas Connection area  
 
Whilst subject to confirmation of the connection location, the temporary 
construction site access junctions would be likely to be formed at a suitable 
point on Millbrook Road. This is likely to consist of two accesses from either 
side of Millbrook Road. 
 
The number of deliveries to the Gas Connection area would be limited to the 
temporary site accommodation, the necessary plant and machinery, the AGI 
housing and apparatus, and the 200mm dia. gas pipes. 
 
Four temporary construction routes are being considered – these are also 
shown on Figure 12.2. The adopted route will respond to the existing local 
weight and height restrictions. 
 
Further details of the likely trip generation relating to the Gas Connection area 
will be provided in the TA. 
 
It is more likely that the connecting gas main would be the one located to the 
west of the Midland Main Rail Line – thus, no new under-rail connection would 
be required. Notwithstanding, a connection under Millbrook Road will be 
required. This could be implemented either by directional drilling, or by a cut-
and-cover trench. MPL to contact Martin Freeman, the CBC Watchman-in-
Chief for this area to confirm details, CBC to provide the contact details.  
 
To the Electrical Connection area 
 
Whilst subject to confirmation of the Sub Station and connection location, the 
temporary construction site access junction could be formed from one of: 
 
i) 
the Green Lane Site Access; 
 
ii) 
Station Road – from the west; or 
 
iii) 
a suitable point on Millbrook Road.  
 
Again, the number of deliveries to the Electrical Connection area would be 
limited to the temporary site accommodation, the necessary plant and 
machinery, the sub-station transformer housing and apparatus, the towers and 
the cables. 
 
The same temporary construction routes as are being proposed for the Gas 
Connection area are being considered for the Electrical Connection area. The 
adopted route will respond to the existing local weight and height restrictions. 
 
Further details of the likely trip generation relating to the Electrical Connection 
area will be provided in the TA.

Abnormal and Hazardous loads  
 
Abnormal loads will be required, the weight of these would be determined by 
the precise form of the Generating Equipment. These abnormal loads would be 
either several 80t loads, or a single 200t load. Further details will be provided 
within the DCO process. 
 
No Hazardous loads are anticipated.

Report Work 
 
As part of the DCO application submission, a series of documents detailing the 
transport assessment will be produced: 
 
i) 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report; 
 
ii) 
a Transport  Assessment;   
 
iii) 
a Route Management Strategy; and a  
 
iv) 
Travel Plan.  
 
The list of suggested contents was circulated – these are attached.  It was 
commented that: 
 
i) 
a Non-Technical Summary is required for all documents, especially the 
PEIR; 
 
ii) 
despite the operational flow of the MPL being very low, the Joint 
Authorities will require a Transport Assessment rather than a Transport 
Statement. This would include an assessment of the MPL impact, and a 
further Sensitivity Test assessing the MPL impact in the context of the 
Covanta proposal flows within the base line flows. It was acknowledged 
that the TA would be sought mainly for the Construction phase rather 
than for the Operational phase; 
 
iii) 
the TP is to consider both the Construction and Operational Phases.

this MPL application is within the Pre-Application stage, the timescale is 
dictated by the applicant needing to complete satisfactorily all elements 
of the application;  
 
ii) 
the PEIR will be submitted in late September / early October; 
 
iii) 
a formal consultation process will then commence, the assessment work 
would then include the comments from this public engagement process; 
 
iv) 
the final DCO submission  would be made to the Planning Inspectorate 
around January / February; 
 
v) 
once the submission is made, the application would then proceed 
through a statutory defined programme as summarised in Section 3 of

with the above programme, electricity generation is anticipated to start 
2019 – 2020.  
 
As the Covanta DCO expires in 2016 (albeit potentially subject to later 
applications seeking extensions), it is unlikely that the construction of both the 
MPL and Covanta projects would be undertaken simultaneously.

Highways Agency comments: 
 
The HA confirmed that they did not anticipate there being significant impacts 
from the MPL application, but sought clarity that the application would not 
impact upon the strategic highway network. 
 
HA to provide the Post Opening Project Evaluation flows on the A421 – to 
assist HA, PBA is to forward the email received from the HA earlier. 
 
Bedford Borough Council comments 
 
BBC confirmed their issues had been addressed earlier within the meeting. 
 
Central Bedfordshire comments 
 
It was suggested that a mini-roundabout access option be considered at the 
Green Lane access. 
 
Luton Borough Council comments 
 
LBC commented that a Stewartby Chord railway link option considered was to 
align a new rail on the bund between the Rookery North and South Pits. NR 
has recently confirmed that work started in September 2014 to consider 
potential Eat-West Rail options, but was not due to report with their preferred 
options until 2016.  
 
The Covanta DCO consent approved an access route that would cross the 
potential rail link, this MPL scheme would use the same access. As such, it 
would be incumbent upon the promoter of the rail scheme to resolve any 
crossing issues should this rail option progress.   
 
LBC to circulate the indicative plans of the potential rail alignment from 
Network Rail.

Introduction 
 
This meeting was arranged to discuss the planning and highway authorities’ 
emerging requirements for a transport assessment to support the Development 
Consent Order (DCO) application to be made by Millbrook Power Ltd. This meeting 
follows: 
 
i) 
an earlier Joint Highway Authority Transport Meeting on 28th August 2014; 
and  
 
ii) 
the issue of the DCO Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) in 
October 2014 to all relevant consultees.  
 
MPL intended that this technical assessment process would be progressed 
together with the Joint Highway Authorities to ensure that all matters arising be 
discussed and dealt with together in a mutually acceptable manner as the 
assessment work proceeds.    
 
Whilst there have been no Network Rail (NR) representatives at these two Joint 
Highway Authority Transport Meetings, they had been invited to both. A further 
meeting has been arranged separately to discuss matters with them, the intention 
is that they be invited to future meetings. Copies of all Meeting Notes will be 
circulated to all parties.

Local Engagement and consultation  
 
Four consultation exhibitions have been held as part of the Local Engagement 
exercise at Stewartby, Marston Moretaine, Lidlington and Ampthill. The proposals 
have been generally well received.  
 
Refinement of the red line boundary  
 
The PEIR includes a redline boundary significantly reduced from that circulated at 
the meeting in August as the gas and electricity connection routes are confirmed. It 
is likely that the next iteration will remove further areas from the current red line.  
 
The redline boundary now includes the area to accommodate the traffic calming 
measures sought for Green Lane relating to the Site Access, as discussed at the 
previous meeting.  
 
Network Rail - East-West Rail Meeting 
 
Network Rail has published proposals to deliver a higher quality line for the high 
speed East-West Rail (EWR) link. Associated with this is NR’s objective of 
removing all level crossings across their network. 
 
MPL and PBA met with the East-West Rail Manager on October 24th to exchange 
information. The notes of this meeting are attached.  
 
NR acknowledges that the delivery programme for EWR is after that for the MPL 
proposals. NR would need to accommodate the approved / consented access 
proposals for the Covanta EfW plant, which may be delivered earlier by MPL. As 
such, the EWR proposals have no impact on the delivery of the MPL proposals.

Highways Agency comments  
 
HA had already forwarded the comments from Aecom to the TA / TP / ES Scoping 
issued in August 2014 by PBA, these comments are attached.  
 
In summary, HA has confirmed that they see no transport-related reasons why the 
MPL proposals should not be approved, albeit that they will seek further definition:  
 
i) 
regarding the construction movements assigning between the electrical / gas / 
power plant areas; 
 
ii) 
on the source of this information; 
 
iii) 
to the construction trip routing; 
 
iv) 
on the worst case construction trip assessment; 
 
v) 
of the two-way trip movements through the strategic road network junctions; 
and 
 
vi) 
to the construction trip analysis period. 
 
Aecom confirmed that:  
 
i) 
the Transport Assessment contents comply with the Department for 
Transport’s Guidance on Transport Assessment (March 2007); and  
 
ii) 
the content of the proposed TA and Travel Plan appears to comply with the 
HA guidance on requirements for transport assessments and travel plans.

Bedford Borough Council comments to the PEIR 
 
BBC confirmed that they see no transport-related reasons why the MPL proposals 
should not be approved, albeit that in addition to the HA comments they seek:  
 
 
i) 
further clarity to the quoted worst-case construction trip assessment – what 
this relates to; 
 
ii) 
a planning condition to ensure that the construction trips generated by the 
MPL and Covanta developments will be managed to avoid two operations 
with high HGV trip generation occurring together; 
 
iii) 
further definition to the construction programme; 
 
iv) 
a review of the construction routes shown in the PEIR, to comply with existing 
weight or height limits – such as through Millbrook and Kempston Hardwick; 
 
v) 
details of the construction movements through the local highway network 
junctions; 
 
vi) 
the collection of further traffic data on the B530 to inform the likely 
construction movement impacts – an  additional automatic traffic counter site 
was agreed as part of the ongoing traffic count survey to support the 
application.

1. 
Network Rail (NR) is currently reviewing the current rail provision in the Marston Vale within the 
context of the East – West Rail proposals :  
 
i) 
East West Rail will increase the existing rail frequency from 1 to 2 trains per hour per direction 
as an initial stage;  
 
ii) 
it is likely that this could increase to around 6 trains per hour per direction at a later stage; 
 
iii) 
this increase in movement will require a risk assessment to confirm that any increased risk at 
all level crossings is acceptable with the higher number of rail movements. Should this 
assessment identify a greater risk, the Office of Rail Regulation will expect these risks to be 
mitigated; 
 
iv) 
Parsons Brinckerhoff has been commissioned by NR to undertake risk assessments of all 
level crossings affected by the EWR proposals; 
 
v) 
concurrently, following a series of pedestrian fatalities associated with level crossings around 
the country, NR has a commitment and remit to remove all level crossings nationally; 
 
vi) 
Network Rail further wishes to electrify the Bedford – Bletchley section of EWR as part of 
delivery of a higher speed service. This electrification also has implications to the level 
crossing facilities, as well as the associated risk assessment. It is unlikely that this 
electrification would happen until NR’s expenditure programme timescale of Control Period 5 
(2019 – 2024).  
 
2. 
Whilst the existing Green Lane level crossing apparatus could be enhanced with an “Object 
Protection System” to deliver improved pedestrian / cyclist / motorist safety, this would require the 
barriers to remain lowered for around 4½ mins per train passing – considerably longer than the 
existing situation.  
 
3. 
With the proposed 2 trains per hour per direction (i.e., 4 trains per hour in total), this would result in 
barriers being lowered for around 18 minutes per hour.  
 
4. 
The necessary level crossing closures with a further increased frequency of train movements with the 
emerging EWR proposals (potentially 6 / hr / direction) would have a significant, potentially 
unacceptable impact, on traffic movements along Green Lane, the barriers being closed for the 
majority of the time. 
 
5. 
The provision of a bridge replacement for any level crossing is a significant engineering undertaking. 
Funding is not certain, nor indeed are deliverable technical solutions possible within the available 
highway. 
 
6. 
NR is currently undertaking initial scoping to understand the constraints within which NR would have 
to work – this work includes speaking to local authorities and potentially affected local developers.

Project Description  
 
The Project Applicant is Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL), an energy development 
company established for this Project by Watt Power Limited. 
 
The Project comprises:  
 
i) 
a new Power Generation Plant, a gas fired peaking 299MW power 
generating station fuelled by natural gas. The Generation Plant would be 
accessed via a new purpose built access road from Green Lane, 
Stewartby; 
 
ii) 
a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System; 
 
iii) 
a new Electrical Connection to export power from the Power Generation 
Plant to the National Grid Electricity Transmission system for distribution;  
 
iv) 
a temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site;  
 
v) 
a new purpose-built 1.7km access road constructed from Green Lane to 
the Generating Equipment. This access road would follow the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching 
Rookery South Pit, the Access Road would descend the ramp to enter 
into the Pit, and cross through the Pit until it reaches the Generating 
Equipment Site.   
 
The Generating Equipment within the Project would run during periods of high 
electricity demand to support the high-output “base” suppliers such as nuclear 
and coal-fired power stations, as well as to complement the output from 
renewable energy sources.  As such, this plant will not operate constantly - an 
environmental permit limited to 1,500 hours operation per year is being sought. 
 
The likely operational staffing of the MPL proposals would be a maximum of 5 
staff per shift. As the plant is powered by gas, there would be no / minimal 
additional delivery movements during normal operation.

Summary of the background planning  
 
There are a series of extant consents for Rookery South Pit that could be 
implemented concurrently with the Project:  
 
i) 
the “Low Level Restoration Scheme” to restore the Rookery South Pit, 
including drainage, landscaping, and earthworks to ensure the long-term 
stability of the area (this will be fundamentally completed before the MPL 
works commence); 
 
ii) 
Covanta has an extant DCO for an Energy from Waste (EfW) plant, with 
an annual throughput of 580,000t of refuse passing into the Site for 
incineration. The IPCC order was published in March 2013 – although 
there is currently some uncertainty as to delivery timetables for this 
though; and 
 
iii) 
an Integrated Waste Management Facility associated with this EfW – 
albeit this facility would be entirely dependent upon the EfW facility.

The redline boundary covers the ground over which the Gas and Electrical 
Connections pass. In particular: 
 
i) 
the Gas Connection will consist of an Above Ground Installation (AGI) on 
the existing gas main, connecting the existing pipeline apparatus to the 
Generating Equipment; 
 
ii) 
a sub-station would be located adjacent the Generating Equipment Site 
within the Rookery South Pit - and will transform the Plant output to a 
voltage compatible with the National Grid network voltage.

Project Update 
 
Local Engagement and consultation  
 
Four consultation exhibitions have been held this autumn as part of the Local 
Engagement exercise at Stewartby, Marston Moretaine, Lidlington and 
Ampthill. The proposals have been generally well received.  
 
PEIR issue 
 
The Section 42 consultation exercise commenced on October 16th following the 
issue of the PEIR on October 7th 2014. The responses were due to be returned 
on 12th November 2014. (Post Meeting Note - NR were requested to contact 
their planning colleagues to progress this response.) 
 
Network Rail - East-West Rail Meeting 
 
Network Rail has published proposals to deliver a higher quality line for the 
high speed East-West Rail (EWR) link. Associated with this is NR’s objective of 
removing all level crossings across their network. MPL and PBA met with the 
East-West Rail Manager on October 24th to exchange information.  
 
NR acknowledges that the delivery programme for EWR is after that for the 
MPL proposals. NR would need to accommodate the approved / consented 
access proposals for the Covanta EfW plant, which may be delivered earlier by 
MPL. As such, the EWR proposals have no impact on the delivery of the MPL 
proposals.

Network Rail comments to the MPL proposals 
 
Access Junction – Green Lane 
 
The Covanta DCO included for an approved ghost island priority junction to 
Green Lane.  If Covanta delivers this arrangement, it would have sufficient 
spare capacity to accommodate the MPL application trip generation without 
amendment.  
 
This ghost island access arrangement was derived to accommodate a 
significantly higher daily operational trip generation than is being proposed by 
the MPL application, and is therefore considered to be excessive – and indeed, 
potentially detrimental to highway safety providing excess highway width.

4.12 
In the event that Covanta did not deliver this ghost island priority junction, a 
more suitably scaled alternative for this application is being considered by 
MPL. A simple priority junction, possibly similar to the attached PBA drawing 
reference 31116/3010/003, is proposed as the site access. In capacity terms, 
this will be tested and reported with the worst case peak hour construction 
movements to demonstrate its suitability.  
 
Whilst NR has no concerns over the level of queuing arising during the normal 
operation, NR concerned over the greater number of movements during the 
construction period. It was agreed that a temporary traffic signal controlled 
arrangement would be acceptable in principle during working hours. PBA to 
prepare a Traffic Management signage plan and note on the potential 
arrangement, to Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual. 
 
Access Track 
 
The Covanta DCO also included a new, purpose-built, 1.7km access road 
constructed from Green Lane to the Rookery South Pit, following the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. This had been agreed 
with NR at the time of the Covanta DCO. 
 
As it is intended that the proposed access road is to be constructed at the 
existing level, NR has minimal concerns. PBA to issue details of the access 
track agreed in the DCO to NR. 
 
PBA to forward details of: 
 
- 
the railway boundary fencing identified within the DCO;  
- 
the “anti-dazzle” fencing to protect on-coming train drivers’ vision;  
- 
carriageway construction details; and 
- 
the safety fence detail. 
 
NR will allow no discharge of rainwater onto the rail land. 
 
Details of the dust control measures are to be forwarded to NR. 
 
Building construction 
 
As the proposed Generating Equipment Building would be circa 90m from the 
rail boundary, NR does not perceive this to impact detrimentally upon the rail, 
hence would not influence NR’s response. 
 
General 
 
NR to forward NR’s standard construction guidance documentation to PBA. 
 
All correspondence to NR to be issued to Amanda Ashton, the NR Town 
Planning Technician LNE & EM (who issued the initial response to the PEIR 
Scoping in June 2014), copied to the appropriate contact.

Inspectorate. 
 
Refinement of the red line boundary  
 
The redline boundary has significantly reduced from that original circulated earlier, as 
the Gas and Electrical Connection Routes have been defined. A revised plan was 
tabled, showing a significantly reduced area. This will be reviewed further as the 
electricity connection route is confirmed.

MPL has met with NR (as noted above) to discuss the access road arrangement, and 
the traffic management to protect the level crossing. This meeting has informed the 
proposals. 
 
Programme 
 
MPL will be making the formal DCO Submission on February 27th. 
 
Following the submission of the draft submission documents to the Joint Authorities 
(see Section 3 below), PBA requested that the Joint Authorities complete their review 
of these documents before the next meeting on February 11th 2015. This would 
enable PBA to make any necessary changes, and recirculate a second draft 
documents for approval.

Traffic Management proposals 
 
Two traffic management schemes were submitted to accommodate the construction 
movements: the first for the works access to Green Lane: the second to Houghton 
Lane. 
 
Green Lane / Site Access priority junction – to respond to NR’s concerns to ensure 
that no queuing arising from right turning vehicles blocks across the level crossing - 
despite the construction movements along Green Lane flows being light A Method 
Statement accompanies the plan. 
 
i) 
NR agree with the scheme in-principle, but will undertake a site visit and prepare 
a risk assessment review once the traffic management scheme has been 
installed; 
 
ii) 
PBA to amend the plan to show the forward visibility constrained by the highway 
and not the Stewartby Brickworks boundary (there is a minor discrepancy 
between these two lines that remains unresolved following work undertaken to 
support the Covanta application). 
 
Houghton Lane Above Ground Installation and Central Section Gas Connection Site 
access – a simple TM scheme plan was tabled for the Joint Authority review. MPL to 
confirm with their contractor the need for an access to the Gas Connection Sites in 
both directions from Houghton Lane - to both the north and south. 
 
A third scheme is being developed still for Station Lane, to enable the Electrical 
Connection to be installed. This would entail:

use of the existing LLRS southern Station Lane access for some of the Electrical 
Connection works; 
 
ii) 
the closure of the layby on Station Lane on two occasions,  each of around 5 
days, to accommodate the cable tensioning equipment; 
 
iii) 
two overnight closures each of around 5 hours to enable a scaffold to be 
installed then dismantled, providing the safety cage to enable overhead cabling 
works to proceed without interference to the traffic below. This would require 
vehicles to be re-routed south through Lidlington to the A507 to avoid the closed

Footpath Closures  
 
The works would affect three public footpaths and one permissive footpath shown on 
the attached Figure 3.1 (from the TA): 
 
i) 
Footpath 65 during the installation of the Central Section of the Gas Connection 
– requiring a minor footpath diversion to enable the pipeline to be installed and 
the ground reinstated; 
 
ii) 
Footpath 7 during the installation of the Southern Section of the Gas Connection 
– requiring a minor footpath diversion to enable the pipeline to be installed and 
the ground reinstated; 
 
iii) 
Footpath 14 during the installation of the Electrical Connection overhead cables 
– likely to require a more substantial footpath diversion from under the cable 
route whilst the works are ongoing; and 
 
iv) 
the permissive footpaths in the LLRS Scheme within the Rookery Pit – Post 
Meeting Note – it is unlikely that the footpath will be constructed until the Access 
Road construction works are complete – hence this issue will not arise. 
 
CBC to provide the contact details of the Public Rights of Way Officers to enable 
discussions to progress to clarify the requirements for the temporary diversions.

Subject: RE: 31116 - Millbrook Power, Rookery Pit South, Stewartby 
 
Bedford BC - OFFICIAL-Unsecure 
 
John, 
 
Thanks for your response. I attach my further comments in Green(!) 
 
1. There is no assessment of the Construction phase ‘likely generation’ Q4 or ‘worst case 
generation’ Q1 with background traffic, Tempro growth, Stewartby Broadmead and Covanta. I 
recognise that this will not be typical traffic and would only occur for a short period but it would 
be the worst, worst case and may be useful to have so that the percentage impact compared 
to development already permitted is clear –in case the question arises? 
 
We agree that this would be an unrepresentative scenario, and request you reconsider its 
requirement: 
 
i) 
the anticipated construction commencement for the MPL Project is 2017, 
completion 2019. TEMPRO growth for background traffic between 2014 – 2019 for 
the ward that contains Stewartby (Bedfordshire Bedford) is 1.0749 (AM) – 1.0781 
(PM). This increase is minimal. 
 
ii) 
the Q4 (End of 2017) peak hour trip generation from MPL is 28 lights / 4 heavies. By 
the end of construction (Q8 End of 2019) this has decreased to 15 lights / 0 heavies 
– a reduction of 17 peak hour trips. 
 
iii) 
whilst Broadmead Road has a consent for 800 units, we are unaware of any 
movement in progressing the design, discharging the list of conditions or resolving 
the reserved matters applications. Assuming that these planning approvals take ? 2 
years to resolve, then 50 units per year are constructed (a completion rate adopted 
by most house builders), only 100 units would be occupied by the time MPL 
construction activity has completed. In 2017 Q4 this would add 12 peak hour trips, 
by 2019 Q8 this would add a further 25 peak hour trips to Green Lane. The increase 
in Broadmead Road Devt trips along Green Lane is similar to the reduction in MPL 
trips as construction completes; 
 
iv) 
assuming that design work recommences on Covanta immediately and a 2 year 
design process, Covanta will not be operational by the time that MPL completes 
works. We have already offered a DCO Requirement to restrict the peak MPL 
construction operations when a peak Covanta construction operation is 
programmed.  
  
As the assessment demonstrated that the impact on Green Lane was minimal, the conclusions 
of this assessment will not change by including these additional movements. I suggest that the 
TA already reports a reasonable worst case assessment, and that other cases would be 
contrived and almost unlikely to occur.  
 
As I said I do realise that, but programmes slip and the question may be asked by others. If you 
don’t feel it necessary to clarify then that is fine.

2. I am still concerned that the estimate of the Worst Case construction phase generation should 
be double. 750m3 concrete at 6m3 per load is 125 loads. The lorries will deliver and leave 
this is 125 in and 125 out, 250 total a day not 125. In the ES Table 12.11 indicates 125 Peak 
Construction (1-way) and Table 12.13 reflects 250 total (two-way, 50% Bedford Rd North:50% 
South) but only 125 total appears to have been used in the TA ( Table 6.3)    
 
I regret this work has suffered from editing by others and there are two minor errors in this – 
but please be assured that PBA has assessed a “more worse” case than was required, the 
following minor changes will be required to the documents in the next issue: 
 
i) 
ES Table 12.11 – title to have “Total 1 way” replaced with “Total Vehs” 1 way is 
correct based on your methodology, no need to change it just does not match with 
Ta Table 6.3. the Peak Construction Car Movements of 40 should read 20 (the 30 
members of staff travelling 1.6 to the car). The impacts have been marginally over-
reported by 20 cars, this will be corrected in the next issue; 
 
ii) 
ES Table 12.13 is correct;  I also agree this is correct, but TA Table 6.3 only adds 
125 into the total 2-way, so the HGV total 2-way vehicles/day is shown as 128 (14 
PK) when it should be 253 (26PK). It won’t make a material difference but needs 
correcting to avoid confusion. 
 
iii) 
TA Table 6.3 - the Peak Construction Car Movements error of 40 / 20 has replicated 
and will be corrected in the next issue – albeit 20 vehicles too many have been 
assessed and reported in the TA. 
 
 
3. Please could you clarify if we have any other formal opportunity to comment on the DCO once 
it is submitted? How do we go about attaching ‘requirements’? 
 
 
The Draft DCO and Requirements have been sent to the local authorities last week to provide 
them the opportunity to comment on these. All registered stakeholders will have the 
opportunity to provide their views both in writing and appearance to the Submission 
documentation at the Examination – the Statement of Common Ground will form part of this. I 
trust that BBC’s comments will have been responded to before then and be minimal! Further 
details of the process are contained on the Planning Inspectorate’s website 
at   http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/application-process/the-process/. 
 
4. I would like to see a commitment to the following included as the suggested requirement 
(supplied on a separate sheet at the 21.1.15 meeting ) does not seem to cover all these:  
 
 
Provide access as shown in Drawing no. 31116/3010/003 before the start of any works; these 
works will be delivered in advance of the MPL generation-related construction works 
commencing; 
 
 
Provide details of Traffic Management to be delivered during construction phase on Green 
Lane; these are detailed in TA Appendix 5.2. References are to be included within the 
CEMP and the DCO Requirements;  
 
 
Not undertake worst case trip generating activities on days of high contractor activity on other 
sites within the pit; this is referred to in 1(i) of the Requirements – we suggest that this 
provides the LPA with the power to control construction activity;  
 
 
An agreed Construction Management plan (including signing Strategy) before works begin; 
this is a CEMP Requirement (within section 3.10)  
 
 
An agreed TP before works begin. this requirement is detailed within the CEMP (section 
3.10).

I had not been provided a full copy of the Draft Requirements prior to my comments. I have 
now seen them and they do cover most of my concerns. My only outstanding concern is the 
need for a reference to Wheel washing facilities /Measures on site to control the deposition of 
dirt mud on surrounding roads during construction – probably within the CMP?

Sorry but I’m not likely to be able to make the meeting this afternoon – although I may be able to get 
there towards the end assuming that Planning Committee gets through the agenda in good time. 
 
With regard to the TA I’ve nothing to add to the comments we made at the last meeting or those that 
Kim put forward.  Stuart will hopefully be able to speak with Paul this morning. 
 
Apologies for the late notice but I wasn’t expecting to have to attend Committee.

John and others 
 
I have nothing to add to Kim’s comments below. As we discussed at the last meeting I attended, I 
have no additional concerns regarding the amount of trips generated by this proposal.  
 
My view is that the proposal will not severely affect the SRN. Details of traffic management during 
construction is essential however this is dealt with in the copy of the draft TA (dated Jan 2015) through 
your method statement. I understand that a construction management plan has been developed and 
Bedford Borough have commented on this.  
 
Are you expecting the HA to sign a statement of common ground too – will this be a joint one with all 
authorities signing one statement or do you need individual ones? 
 
I will try to get the meeting tomorrow, however I am in a meeting in the morning which may overrun.

Introduction 
1.1. This Technical Note has been prepared by AECOM, on behalf of the Highways Agency (HA), to 
detail the review a series of documents associated with a proposed Millbrook Power Station (MPS) 
development in Bedfordshire. The proposal is currently at pre-application/scoping stage. The site is 
understood to straddle Bedford Borough and Central Bedfordshire authorities.  
 
1.2. The documents were prepared by Peter Brett Associates (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Ltd 
(MPL) a company set up for this project by Watt Power Limited.  
 
1.3. Within the vicinity of the Millbrook Power Station site the HA are responsible for the A421 and the 
M1 (Junction 13).  
 
1.4. The following documents have been provided: 
 
 
Copy of 27th August meeting notes (attended by the HA); 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR), Transport Assessment, Route 
Management Strategy, Travel Plan – proposed document contents.  
 
PIER Draft Figures 12.1 and 2 (maps showing the location of the site and proposed access 
routes); 
 
Traffic and Transport Introduction presentation (containing background information on the 
planned development); 
 
Notes of the National Infrastructure Planning process; 
 
Construction and Operational Movements (trip generation estimates during construction); 
 
Drawing 31116 / 3010 / 003 (proposed access junction) 
 
1.5. The purpose of this technical note is to review the submitted documentation, which indicates the 
trip generation and route of construction traffic PBA propose to take in the development of their TA 
and provides recommendations regarding the contents of the TA that will be required by the HA.  
 
2. 
Proposed Development  
2.1. The proposed development site is located approximately 9km to the south-west of Bedford town 
centre.  Milton Keynes is around 16km west of the site. The A421 which is approximately 1.5km 
north-west of the site as the crow flies. The closest A421 junction is the dumbbell junction at 
Marston Moretaine. 
 
2.2. The M1 at Junction 13 is located approximately 6km south-west of the site as the crow flies. The 
western corner of the site is bounded by Millbrook train station and Houghton Conquest is located 
to the east. The southern end of the site reaches just to the north of Woburn Road and the northern 
end of the site extends to the Rookery South Pit. The exact extent of the proposed development is 
not yet determined so the above listed edges are the furthest possible boundaries of the site.

2.3. At this stage the development consists of (as detailed in the meeting notes provided from August 
2014):  
 
“A new Power Generation Plant, a gas fired peaking 299MW power generating station 
fuelled by natural gas. The Generation Plant would be accessed via a new purpose built 
access road from Green Lane, Stewartby; 
 
A new Gas Conneciton to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
National Transmission System; 
 
A new Electrical Connection to export power form the Power Generation Plan to the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission system for distribution; 
 
A temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during construction 
adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site; 
 
A new purpose-built 1.7km access road constructed from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment; 
 
The route of the access road would follow the existing track which borders the lake within 
Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery South Pit, the Access Road would descent the 
ramp to enter into the Pit, and cross through the Pit until it reaches the Generating 
Equipment Site.”   
 
2.4. There is extant planning permission for the Rookery South Pit which is proposed to be implemented 
concurrently with the proposed development. The permission consists of a “low level restoration 
scheme” to restore the site, a DCO for an Energy from Waste (EfW) plant and a Integrated Waste 
Management Facility which is dependent on the EfW plant.  
 
2.5. The DCO extant permission for the EfW includes the proposal for a ghost island priority junction on 
Green Lane. If this is delivered it is proposed that it will provide sufficient capacity to accommodate 
the MPS proposal. This junction is understood to be more than sufficient to accommodate the 
proposed development as it was designed to cater for significantly more traffic. Green Lane links to 
Bedford Road, access to the A421 could potentially be gained via Marston Moretaine or Marsh 
Leys Interchanges.  
 
2.6. If the ghost island priority junction permitted with the EfW site is not built then PBA propose a 
simple priority junction at the same location. This will be tested for capacity as part of the TA.  
 
3. 
Trip Generation 
3.1. The information provided on trip generation relates to the construction period. The proposed trips 
for the construction period are presented as an attachment in “construction workers profile and 
HGV loads v3.0 MPL”. It is detailed that they have been generated by Parsons Brinkerhoff and 
based on data collected from similar facilities. This is used to create a vehicle trip generation 
estimate. The supplied meeting notes indicates that this is for an 18 month construction period. No 
further detail is provided to verify how these trips were generated although it is mentioned in the 
meeting notes (from 27th August 2014) that a sensitivity test will be provided to identify the worst 
case daily construction trip generation.  
 
3.2. The trips are split into vehicles per day and then peak hour trips. Within these sections the trips are 
categorised as associated with the “electrical connection” or the “power plant and gas connection” 
separately for cars and HGVs. It seems that the vehicles per day trips are total two way trips and 
the peak hour trips are one way trips but it is unclear from the table to confirm this definitely. 
AECOM recommends that further clarity is provided in the forthcoming TA. The trips are split into 8 
quarters but it is not defined how long a quarter is. It seems intuitive that this represents a quarter

of year but the meeting notes detail PBA expect an 18 month construction period, not a two-year 
construction period.  This definition needs to be provided by PBA in the TA.  
 
3.3. The electric connection trips are defined separately and the power plant and gas connection trips 
are combined. It is unclear why the power plant and gas trips have been combined. Figure 12.2 
provided by PBA presents the electricity and gas connection routes combined. Under most options 
the power generation plant has a separate route and access point. Option 3 however appears to 
indicate that the Power Plant, Gas and Electricity Connections could all be combined. Following 
discussion with the local highway authorities it is recommended that potential trip routing options 
are confirmed. Details of all the routes made available to the various disciplines should be 
confirmed in the forthcoming TA.  
 
3.4. Peak hour trips are presented but it is not defined what peak hour this represents i.e. is this is this 
representative of the expected construction traffic peak (and if so, at what times of the day is this 
expected to occur) or of traditional peak hours when background flows are at their highest? HGV 
traffic may have a relatively short stay on the site and hence potentially leave within the same peak 
hour as arrival. It is recommended that details of the anticipated number of trips are expanded upon 
within the forthcoming TA, listing both the number of arrivals and departures for the peak hours 
considered. This information should be presented for the ‘worse case’ scenario, reported ‘likely to 
be casting of the concrete foundation’. 
 
3.5. AECOM has performed a preliminary comparison of the trips with those suggested by Parsons 
Brinckerhoff for the submission of Progress Power Project (April 2014) in Eye, Suffolk (currently 
being examined as a nationally significant infrastructure project). This proposal is referenced within 
the material supplied by PBA, as it is also being developed byWatt Power Limited. The Progress 
Power Project proposal is for a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant to provide an 
electrical output of up to 299MW and will operate for up to 1,500 hours per year. The electrical 
output and hours of operation per year are the same as those proposed for the MPS application. It 
is unclear if the type of power plant at the Progress Power Project site would be similar or different 
in terms of construction traffic characteristics to the MPS power plant, however it serves as a useful 
reference point to reviewing the traffic flows proposed for the Millbrook site at this early stage. 
 
3.6. The Progress Power Project (PPP) reports details that the peak hours are assumed to stretch over 
2 hours as it assumes take HGVs an hour to leave the site. The peak hours presented are AM 
07:00-09:00 and PM 16:00-18:00. The working weekday is considered to consist of arrivals from 
07:00-17:00 and departures from 08:00-18:00. The proposal assumes there will be a range of 25 to 
127 workers visiting the site each day over the duration of the construction. It is assumed that a car 
share proportion of 1.6 people per car. The construction will take 2 years to complete and the trips 
are split into 8 quarters. These suggest around 80 car trips to and 80 car trips from the site for 
visiting workers. It is likely that there would be a peak in trips within the two hour period and the 
worse case may not be reflected by simply half of the two hour flow. 
 
3.7. It is recommended that further evidence is provided in the forthcoming TA to substantiate the 
figures for the Millbrook proposal, including when peak hours occur, the number of construction 
workers likely to be on site and assumed car occupancy.  
 
3.8. Once the plant is operational it is expected to consist of a maximum of 4 staff each shift. The traffic 
generated from the operational site therefore is likely to be negligible. It is noted however in the 
Construction Workers Profile and HGV Loads 250714 table that during maintenance periods there 
may be up to 40 extra staff on site for a period of a month. The meeting notes indicate that 
maintenance periods should be no more frequent than once a year. The notes acknowledge that

traffic flows will increase during these periods and that more details will be provided within the 
forthcoming TA.  
 
4. 
Routing of Traffic 
4.1. PIER Draft Figure 12.2 details possible route options for construction traffic between the 
development site and the SRN. There are three possible route options defined from different 
junctions on the A421: Marston Moretaine dumbbell junction, A421/A428 Marsh Leys signalised 
gyratory and the A421/A6 Elstow gyratory. One route option could go via M1 Junction 13. It is 
unclear whether one or more routes will eventually be chosen. From the HA’s perspective, having 
more than one route defined would be more acceptable as it would reduce the impact on any single 
point on the SRN. This may not however be acceptable to the local highway authority, particularly 
for HGV movements. The meeting notes appear to suggest only two potential access points to the 
SRN, with the inference that Green Lane would be the access route. The preferred routing options 
available should be clarified within the forthcoming TA.  
 
4.2. PBA have not detailed the proposed scope of assessment at this stage, however it would be 
expected that it details the number of trips at any SRN junction. HA Protocol states that junction or 
link capacity assessments should be undertaken on the SRN where development proposals results 
in generating significant amount of movement. It is recommended that the number of two way trips 
at each of the SRN junctions is identified. Depending upon the number of trips identified and how 
critical these additional trips could be to the operation of the junction, consideration can be given to 
whether or not there is a need for capacity assessments to be undertaken.   
 
5. 
Proposed Transport Assessment, Travel Plan and Route Management Strategy 
5.1. PBA have detailed what they propose to include in a forthcoming TA, Travel Plan and Route 
Management Strategy. This complies with the Department for Transport’s Guidance on Transport 
Assessment (March 2007). Although it is implied under the suggested heading “traffic impact 
assessment”, AECOM request that specific and detailed information is provided on development 
trip generation, distribution of trips and the analysis period is clearly defined.  
 
5.2. The content of the proposed TA and Travel Plan appears to comply with the HA guidance on 
requirements for transport assessments and travel plans.  
 
5.3. A Route Management Strategy is proposed, which will indicate amongst other items the traffic and 
HGV control measures to be imposed. Details such as this would effectively form a Construction 
Management Plan which, for a development of this scale and nature, would be recommended. 
Provision of this information should provide the HA an opportunity to agree appropriate measures 
to manage traffic flows via the SRN, for example control the number of trips occurring during the 
peak hours when background flows are at their highest (if this was considered necessary) and the 
junctions and routes to be used by construction vehicles.    
 
6. 
Conclusion 
6.1. This Technical Note has been prepared by AECOM to detail the review of trip rates and potential 
impact for a forthcoming Transport Assessment associated with a proposed power plant in 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire. The information supplied was prepared by Peter Brett Associates (PBA) on 
behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) working form Watt Power Limited. 
  
6.2. PBA’s approach is to calculate trips individually for the separate components of the power plant into 
cars and HGVs for the construction phase. This is considered reasonable.

6.3. AECOM query some of the assumptions used to generate the proposed trips and request more 
information on; when is the defined peak hours, what are the trips for arrivals and departures, 
comparisons to other comparable site for verification and for each trip to be presented separately 
i.e. gas, electrical and power plant. Clarification is also needed of the proposed construction period 
– is it 18 months or two years?  
 
6.4. PBA detail various options for the proposed construction access routes. Final confirmation of the 
proposed routes will be provided in the TA once the development proposals are finalised. It is 
possible that more than one SRN junction could be used by construction traffic, which could help to 
dissipate the impact.  
 
6.5. Subject to further evidence being provided to clarify and justify the trip generation, it is not 
confirmed at this stage that junction capacity assessments of the SRN junctions would be required. 
It is recommended that the ‘worse case’ traffic impact at each of the affected SRN junctions is 
identified such that the Agency can provide a view on whether or not capacity assessments will be 
required. A Route Management Strategy (which will detail plans to manage construction traffic) is 
proposed. If concerns materialise with regard to the level of traffic generation on the SRN, controls 
could potentially be put in place to reduce trip generation and to encourage traffic to avoid the peak 
periods in background traffic flows when the operation of SRN junctions are likely to be most 
susceptible to increases in traffic.  Preparation of an acceptable Route Management Strategy may 
remove the need for capacity assessments to be undertaken.

6.13 
In terms of total traffic volumes, the residential development generates 527 vehicles 
in each peak hour, whilst the employment area generates between 144 and 184 
vehicles in the peak hours.  In terms of Heavy Goods Vehicle movements, it is 
unlikely that any HGVs will be generated by the residential development during the 
peak hours.  The employment area will generate a number of HGVs, the precise 
amounts dependant upon the split of B1/B2/B8 uses (HGV proportions will increase 
from B1 to B2 to B8 use), although large numbers of HGV movements do not 
generally occur during the peak hours.  For this assessment it is assumed that none 
of the peak hour residential traffic will comprise HGVs, and that 10% of trips to/from 
the employment area will comprise HGVs. 
Trip Distribution / Assignment 
6.14 
Trip distribution and assignment assumptions are consistent with the two Wootton 
development Transport Assessments, as agreed with Bedfordshire County Council.  
The resulting trip distributions (which differ between residential and employment) are 
shown below and are assumed to be the same for both AM and PM peaks (see 
Figure 6).

For times of the next departures from a particular stop you can use traveline-txt - by sending the SMS code to 84268. Add the service number
after the code if you just want a specific service - eg: buctdgtd 60. The return message from traveline-txt will show the next three departures,
and it currently costs 25p plus any message sending charge. Departure times will be real-time predictions where available, or scheduled departure
times if not.
You can also get the same information by using the SMS code at www.nextbuses.mobi (only normal browsing charges apply)
or through several iPhone or Android apps that offer access to NextBuses.
NOTE: SMS codes are different in each direction. Make sure you choose the right direction from these lists.

Introduction 
1.1 
Overview and Project Description 
1.1.1 This document is the outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
(outline CEMP) for the Millbrook Power Project (hereafter referred to as the 
‘Project’). The Project comprises an up to 299 Megawatts (MW) gas fired 
peaking power generation plant designed to produce electricity, along with 
associated development, such as a gas connection and electrical connection. 
This outline CEMP has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on 
behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), (the ‘Applicant’).  
1.1.2 The Project will be located in an area known as ‘the Marston Vale’ between 
Milton Keynes and Bedford with the approximate centre of the Project Site at 
grid reference 501373, 240734).  
1.1.3 The up to 299 MW gas fired peaking power generation plant element of the 
Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) and therefore requires 
development consent under that Act. The Applicant is therefore applying for a 
development consent order (DCO); this outline CEMP is provided as part of that 
application.  
1.1.4 The Project would comprise: 
 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating 
station as a whole, measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the 
‘Generating Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating 
Equipment Site’; 
 a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
 a temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the ‘Laydown Area’); 
 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length 
(the ‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the 
National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection 
also incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of 
connection to the National Transmission System; and 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
2 
 
Connection’), comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would 
require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be located 
in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby 
resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two SECs, 
one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits 
would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 m in 
length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
1.1.5 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 
ha in area.  
1.1.6 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land 
upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order 
to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. 
The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is described in more 
detail in Chapter 3. 
1.1.7 
A full glossary of defined terms is presented in Appendix 1.1 of the ES. 
1.1.8 
The Project Site and all elements of the Project listed above are shown on 
Figure 1.2 of the ES.  
1.2 
Purpose of the document 
1.2.1 This document provides a framework from which a final CEMP will be produced 
by the Contractor prior to construction of the Project.  The purpose of a CEMP 
is to provide mitigation against potentially adverse construction impacts on 
environmental resources, local residents and businesses.  It will form the 
management framework for the planning and implementation of construction 
activities in accordance with the environmental commitments identified as part 
of the application for a DCO or any subsequent requirements, section 106 
agreements or equivalent.  The final CEMP will remain a live document and will 
be updated as required throughout construction.  
1.2.2 This outline CEMP is informed by the Environmental Statement (ES) (Document 
Reference 6.1) and associated DCO application documents. 
1.2.3 Schedule 2 of the DCO includes a requirement that prior to the commencement 
of development of the various works packages which make up the Project, the 
undertaker (via its Contractor) must submit a final CEMP to the local planning 
authorities, (namely CBC and BBC) for approval. The CEMP submitted must be 
substantially in accordance with this outline CEMP and must include certain 
items (see below). Such final CEMP(s) will be developed after any grant of a 
DCO, in conjunction with, or by, the main contractor/s appointed for such works 
once the timescales for the detailed implementation are defined. 
1.2.4 The contractor’s final CEMP must, under the requirement in the DCO, include 
the following:

 
the construction and phasing programme; 
 
liaison procedures to discuss and agree all relevant construction aspects 
with the relevant planning authority; 
 
complaints procedures; 
 
nuisance management including measures to avoid or minimise the 
impacts of construction works (covering dust, lighting, noise and vibration); 
 
A waste management strategy; 
 
an assessment of the site specific risks to and mitigation measures 
designed to protect controlled waters (surface and groundwaters) 
including pollution incident control; 
 
procedures for crossing watercourses (by reference to best practice 
methods); 
 
landscape and visual impact mitigation (specifically the protection of trees 
and hedgerows to be retained in accordance with BS 5837: 2012 (or its 
updates) and a scheme to minimise visual intrusion of the construction 
works); 
 
security measures; 
 
measures for the maintenance of construction equipment; 
 
restoration of site following completion of construction; and 
 
liaison procedures with all other contractors working within Rookery Pit 
regarding programmed construction movements and processes.  
1.2.5 In addition to the CEMP, the following documents will be used to implement 
specific environmental mitigation during the construction phase. The CEMP will 
provide a signpost to these additional documents:  
 
A Written Scheme of Investigation to detail procedures for topsoil stripping 
to record features of archaeological significance; 
 
A Landscape and Ecology  Mitigation and Management Strategy; 
 
A Phase 2 ground investigation; and 
 
A Construction Traffic Management Plan. 
1.2.6 The contractor’s final CEMP will provide information on: 
 
A register of environmental aspects [the effects of the Project]; 
 
Risk assessments;

Outline CEMP – General Information 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 This section of the document sets out the general information which should be 
included within the contractor’s final CEMP and is not necessarily linked to a 
specific environmental topic area. Section 3 of this document covers specific 
considerations for environmental topics linked to the items listed above at 
paragraph 1.2.4. Preparation of the final CEMP will be consistent with the best 
practice advice on CEMPs contained within Chapter 10 of BS42020 (or its 
updates).   
2.2 
Register of Environmental Aspects 
2.2.1 A register of Environmental Aspects will be produced as part of the final CEMP. 
This Register will be used to inform the environmental procedures to be 
undertaken on the construction site (e.g. any specifically identified 
environmental risks) and to provide a tool for construction teams when 
preparing construction method statements or field briefings.  
2.2.2 This register would cover several environmental topic areas and would be 
regularly updated to reflect any additional risks resulting from the main 
contractor/s selected methods of working, changing site conditions etc. Risks 
(and other relevant aspects) would be identified under the following general 
headings: 
 
Noise & Vibration; 
 
Air Quality; 
 
Pollution and Groundwater 
 
Surface Water; 
 
Ecology; 
 
Landscape and Visual Impacts; 
 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage; 
 
Artificial Lighting; and 
 
Traffic and Transport; 
2.3 
Risk Assessments 
2.3.1 The majority of construction activities undertaken on-site will be subject to an 
environmental risk assessment which will be required by the final CEMP, which 
will: 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
6 
 
 
Identify potential significant environmental impacts or effects that can be 
anticipated; 
 
Assess the impact or effects and probability of risks from these; 
 
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; and 
 
Report where an unacceptable level of residual risk is identified so that 
action can be taken through design changes, re-scheduling of work or 
alternative methods of working in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable 
level. 
2.3.2 The results of risk assessments, and their residual risks are only considered 
acceptable if: 
 
The severity of outcome is reduced to the lowest practical level; 
 
The number of risk exposures are minimised; 
 
All reasonably practical mitigating measures have been taken; and  
 
The residual risk rating is reduced to a minimum. 
2.3.3 The findings of the risk assessment and in particular the necessary controls 
would be explained to all contractors before the commencement of the relevant 
works using an agreed instruction format (e.g. Toolbox Talks).  The controls will 
be agreed by the Project developer’s environmental staff (or appropriately 
experienced personnel).  
2.3.4 The risk assessments would be kept and filed to be checked/reported against. 
2.4 
Method Statements 
2.4.1 Method statements would be completed by all contractors required to undertake 
work on the Project Site, in consultation with the Project developer’s engineers 
(or appropriately experienced personnel), on-site environmental staff and, 
where necessary, environmental specialists. Their production would include a 
review of the environmental risks and commitments referred to in section 2.3, 
so that appropriate control measures are developed and included within 
construction processes. 
2.4.2 Method statements would be reviewed by the Site Manager or appointed 
delegate and, where necessary, by an appropriate environmental specialist.   
2.4.3 The Contractor and / or in conjunction with the Contractor’s Environmental staff 
shall decide which of the works have environmental implications using the 
following criteria: 
 
The work may result in an adverse effect on the environment or human 
health; and /or  
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
7 
 
 
the work is adjacent to a surface water drain or water body.   
2.4.4 Where the works have environmental implications, the method statements will 
be passed to the main contractor and Project developer’s environmental staff 
for approval prior to work commencing.  Work would then need to be carried out 
in accordance with the approved method statements.  
2.4.5 Where required, method statements would also be submitted to the relevant 
enforcement agencies (Environment Agency, Natural England, Environmental 
Health Officer etc.). Method statements should contain at least the following 
information: 
 
Location of the activity and access/egress arrangements; 
 
Work to be undertaken and methods of construction; 
 
Plant and materials to be used; 
 
Labour and supervision requirements; 
 
Health, safety and environmental considerations; and 
 
Any permit or consent requirements beyond those already obtained 
(including the DCO). 
2.5 
Site Environmental Standards 
2.5.1 Site Environmental Standards will be agreed between the main contractor and 
Project developer and will detail the minimum measures that should be 
achieved for general operations falling outside the risk assessment/method 
statement procedure. These will be determined on a case by case basis and 
through consideration of e.g. site conditions or weather conditions. The site 
environmental standards would be designed to cover the majority of 
construction activities in accordance with the ES and Requirements associated 
with the DCO. 
2.5.2 These will cover issues such as storage of materials, management of waste, 
dust, noise and vibration, and water pollution control. The standards will be 
printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice boards and used as a briefing tool 
on site. These standards will also form the basis of Toolbox talks which will 
inform all contractors working on site of the potential environmental risks arising 
from construction activities. 
2.6 
Environmental Management System 
2.6.1 Following construction, an Environmental Management System (EMS) for 
commercial operation will be developed and designed to comply with ISO 14001 
or an equivalent recognised standard. 
2.6.2 Implementation of ISO 14001 is key to work undertaken by MPL and the use of 
an Environmental Management Plan for commissioning based on ISO 14001 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
8 
 
(or similar) will be used to support implementation and compliance with the DCO 
and the Environmental Permit that will be required for operation of the Project 
under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.  
2.7 
Public Relations / complaints procedures 
2.7.1 The following steps will be taken to make the public aware of the activities on 
site and the available lines of communication with MPL: 
 
A Community Liaison Group will be set up; 
 
Neighbouring occupiers will be notified of the start of site works and the 
likely duration of the overall construction phase; 
 
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published locally 
to the Project Site; 
 
The main contractor will maintain a close liaison with the council’s 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at all times; 
 
Should any unforeseen event occur within the construction site that has the 
potential to cause off-site pollution then the contractor will notify the EHO as 
soon as possible.  
2.8 
Monitoring and Measurement 
2.8.1 Regular site inspections will be carried out by the Site Manager or delegate 
which will assess the potential for environmental impacts to arise from 
construction works.  
2.8.2 Particular notice will be taken during and following extreme weather events, 
when working in areas of known or potential contamination, and when 
particularly hazardous activities are being carried out. Method Statements will 
be required where the risk assessment has identified a significant risk to the 
environment (see section 2.4 above). 
2.8.3 In the event of any environmental incident the most senior representative of the 
main contractor will take the role of the responsible person and will take charge 
of the situation. The responsible person will take immediate steps to eliminate 
the impact on the environment and mitigate/minimise any environmental 
damage through immediate preventative action (e.g. use of spill response kits) 
or by contacting the relevant regulatory body. 
2.9 
Roles and Responsibilities 
2.9.1 Suggested specific roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the final 
CEMP are described below: 
2.9.2 The MPL Project Director would have overall responsibility for the 
environmental performance throughout the construction period and will ensure 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
9 
 
that appropriate resources are made available, and environmental control and 
any agreed or appropriate protection measures are implemented.  
2.9.3 The Site Manager would be appointed the responsibility for co-ordinating and 
managing all the environmental activities during the construction phase. The 
role would involve carrying out the following duties:

Outline CEMP – Specific Measures 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures which 
will be used in the final CEMP for the Project in order to limit impacts on noise 
and vibration, air quality, ground conditions, water quality and resources, 
ecology, the historic environment, traffic and transport, and landscape and 
visual receptors. It will additionally outline the measures to prevent impacts 
arising from artificial lighting and also consider any waste management 
measures. 
3.2 
Noise and Vibration  
3.2.1 An assessment of the likely significant noise and vibration effects resulting from 
construction of the Project has been undertaken and this is set out in Chapter 7 
of the ES. 
3.2.2 This section outlines the potential sources of noise and vibration created by 
construction works and the methods of mitigation proposed to reduce these 
impacts which should be adopted in a final CEMP.   
3.2.3 All construction activities will be undertaken in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS 5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and 
Open Sites’ - Part 1 Noise and Part 2 Vibration.  
3.2.4 This standard details the legislative background to noise control, along with the 
recommended procedures for effective liaison between developers, site 
operators and local authorities. Methods of how to minimise the impact of site 
noise on workers and local residents are also provided. 
3.2.5 Additionally, the final CEMP will implement working methods agreed with the 
Local Authorities (namely CBC and BBC) which may include conditions 
regarding one or more of the following: 
 
Working Hours; 
 
Noise / vibration action levels (at noise sensitive locations); 
 
Working Practices (site equipment, methodology etc.); 
 
Noise / vibration mitigation measures (corrective actions).  
3.2.6 The final CEMP will include at least the following measures: 
 
The contractor shall ensure that plant used has a known noise / vibration 
output, so that accurate data can be used in any assessment if required;  
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
11 
 
 
Only plant conforming with relevant national or international standards, 
directives or recommendations on noise or vibrations emissions would be 
used; 
 
Approved routes and programming for the transport of construction 
materials, spoil and personnel to reduce the risk of increased noise and 
vibration impacts due to the construction of the Project; 
 
Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately, having 
regard to the manufacturer’s written recommendations or using other 
appropriate operation and maintenance programmes which reduce noise 
and vibration emissions; 
 
The use of temporary sound reducing screens/enclosures around plant 
and activities (where necessary or possible) which provide 10dB of noise 
attenuation from construction activities; 
 
All vehicles and plant will be switched off when not in use; 
 
Vehicle and mechanical plant used for the purpose of the works should be 
fitted with effective exhaust silencers, to be maintained in good working 
order and operated in such a manner as to minimise noise emissions. The 
contractor should use plant items that comply with the relevant EU/UK 
noise limits applicable to all equipment; 
 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps would be 
positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance (e.g. as far away as 
practicable from sensitive receptors); 
 
A requirement to use mufflers on pneumatic tools; 
 
Where practicable, rotary drills actuated by hydraulic or electrical power 
should be used for excavating hard materials; 
 
The use of non-reciprocating construction plant where practicable; 
 
Drop heights are to be minimised and chutes are to be used where 
possible;  
 
Loading and unloading of vehicles, dismantling of equipment such as 
scaffolding or moving equipment or materials around the Project Site will 
be conducted in such a manner as to minimise noise / vibration 
generation.  The targeting, where possible, of noisy work at times which 
minimise disturbance; 
 
If any abnormal operations occur which lead to noise levels in excess of 
the agreed planning limits (e.g. any equipment malfunction), the operator 
will inform the local authority and residents of the reasons for these 
operations, and the anticipated period.

3.3 
Air Quality 
3.3.1 An assessment of the Air Quality impacts resulting from the development has 
been undertaken and this is set out in Chapter 6 of the ES. 
3.3.2 Relevant air quality mitigation measures are outlined in Chapter 6 of the ES and 
in the Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 (Document Reference: 5.5). However, the following 
provides an outline of the processes which could be employed in the final CEMP 
in order to reduce dust, particulate matter and exhaust emissions during 
construction. 
3.3.3 Construction activities associated with the greatest potential for dust generation 
are: 
 
Earthworks including topsoil excavation, handling on site and deposition; 
 
Handling and storage of materials (including loading and unloading); 
 
Wind blow across disturbed/exposed site surfaces and materials; and 
 
Mechanical operations such as crushing, drilling, concrete mixing and 
cutting. 
3.3.4 In order to ensure the employment of best practical means to minimise the risk 
of adverse effects from construction dust and causing nuisance or damage, 
specific control measures are proposed as follows:  
Site Planning 
 
Prior to commencing works, the site manager must have regard to 
weather conditions and the dust generating potential of material to be 
excavated. The final CEMP will provide further details about specific 
considerations and actions to be taken in different scenarios; 
 
Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles etc. to sensitive 
receptors (as defined in the ES); and 
 
Removal of dusty materials from site as soon as possible. 
Construction Traffic 
 
Loads entering and leaving the site with dust generating potential should 
be covered and wheel washing facilities made available; 
 
The performance of the wheel washing system will be maintained by the 
regular removal of settled sediment from within the sump; 
 
Plant and wheel washing to be carried out in a designated area; 
 
No idling of vehicles; 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
13 
 
 
Vehicles to comply with site speed limits; 
 
Water assisted sweeping of local roads to be undertaken if material is 
tracked out of site on to Green Lane or Houghton Lane;  
 
Hard surfacing (e.g. access roads) installed as soon as practicable on site 
following commencement of construction; and 
 
Site roads should be cleaned regularly, and damped down if necessary to 
prevent nuisance dust.  
Site Activities 
 
Exposed soils should be re-vegetated as soon as practicable; 
 
Minimise dust generating activities during prolonged dry, dusty weather 
unless damping / other suppressants are used; 
 
Use water as dust suppressant where applicable;  
 
Ensure any site machinery is well maintained and in full working order; 
 
Ensure equipment available for cleaning spills etc is available at all times; 
and;  
 
Fine material should be delivered to site in bags.  
3.3.5 Good site management practices (e.g. adherence to guidance such as ‘control 
of dust and emissions from construction and demolition, best practice guidance’ 
2006) during the construction works will help to prevent the generation of 
airborne dust. It will be the responsibility of the nominated main contractor and 
site manager to ensure through the CEMP that sufficient precautionary 
measures to limit dust generation are undertaken. 
3.3.6 Standard mitigation measures for low risk sites, taken from the Institute of Air 
Quality Management (IAQM) document ‘Dust and Air Emissions Mitigation 
Measures’ tables would also be applied. These are: 
 
Record all dust and air quality complaints, identify cause(s), take 
appropriate measures to reduce emissions in a timely manner, and record 
the measures taken. Make the complaints log available to the local authority 
when asked.;  
 
Record any exceptional incidents that cause dust and/or air emissions, 
either on- or off- site, and the action taken to resolve the situation in a log 
book. 
 
Avoid bonfires and burning of waste materials on site; and  
 
Ensure vehicles entering and leaving sites are covered to prevent escape 
of materials during transport.

3.4 
Ground Conditions 
3.4.1 An assessment of the likely significant effects on ground conditions resulting 
from construction of the Project has been undertaken and this is set out in 
Chapter 10 of the ES. 
3.4.2 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures which 
will be used in the final CEMP for the Project in order to limit impacts on ground 
stability, contaminated land and groundwater. 
3.4.3 The final CEMP must require the following: 
 
The carrying out of a Foundation Works Risk Assessment (FWRA) by the 
contractor once the proposed foundation solutions are known, which will 
then form part of the CEMP. This will be in accordance with ‘Piling and 
Penetrative Ground Improvements Methods on Land Affected by 
Contamination: Guidance on Pollution Prevention, NGCLC report NC/99/73’ 
and is required to ensure that the proposed foundations do not adversely 
affect the water environment beneath the site.  
 
Construction activities will be carried out in full compliance with appropriate 
health and safety legislation, at current amendments, and with reference to 
appropriate guidance documents and approved Codes of Practice 
published by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), including where 
appropriate, HSE Guidance Note HS (G) 66 “The Protection of Workers and 
the General Public during the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land” 
HMSO 1991. 
 
Where there is the potential for instability to occur, temporary works 
measures including trench sheeting in any excavations will be utilised. 
3.4.4 
Methods to protect soils and agricultural land will include: 
 
Stockpiling of any excavated materials in discreet horizons, in reverse 
order of excavation to test whether any can be re-used on site and also to 
ensure that proper reinstatement (where appropriate) can take place; 
 
Methods to prevent compaction of soils such as constructing access roads 
first and ensuring traffic only uses designated access routes; 
 
Ensuring any exposed soils are re-vegetated as soon as practical to 
prevent excess runoff or wind erosion and all agricultural land required 
temporarily during construction would be reinstated, with a five-year 
aftercare plan to ensure land is returned to its former productivity.  
 
Tthe following procedures would be applied if unidentified contaminant 
“hotspots” showing visual or olfactory evidence of contamination are 
discovered during construction works: 
 Stop work immediately; 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
15 
 
 Report the discovery to the Site Manager; 
 Seal off the area to contain the spread of contaminants; 
 Clear the area to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion; 
 Contact the regulator or local authority once it is confirmed that 
contamination is found; 
 Arrange for testing to be carried out and agree changes to the existing 
contamination strategy;  
 Record details of the incident, including photos and relevant information 
on the Environmental Incident Report Form; and 
 Any soils which are considered to be contaminated hotspots) will be 
removed and disposed of by a suitably licensed contractor or treated 
on-site. 
 
Any material which is excavated and free from visual and olfactory evidence 
of contamination will be stockpiled and tested to assess its suitability for 
reuse on the Project Site.  
 
If significant groundwater flows are encountered within excavations, then 
temporary dewatering pumps will be implemented.  
 
In the relation to the potential to induce mixing of confined groundwater 
bodies by construction of piled foundations, the design and construction will 
be undertaken in accordance with EA guidance ‘Piling and Penetrative 
Ground Improvement Methods on Land Affected by Contamination’ (EA, 
2001), and therefore will follow best practice to ensure that groundwater 
mixing does not occur. 
 
All water from dewatering activities shall either be transported off site by a 
suitably licensed contractor or treated on site. Any proposed discharges to 
existing land drains (or other surface water bodies) will be undertaken in 
accordance with the requirements of the Environment Agency (EA) 
Regulatory Position Statement on temporary water discharges from 
excavations. 
 
Where soils are imported onto the Project Site then they shall be subject to 
testing to ensure they are not contaminated.  
 
The imposition of speed restrictions onsite to minimise disturbance of bare 
surfaces. Measures shall also be put into place to ensure that the length of 
time bare surfaces are left exposed are minimised. 
 
The imposition of the following measures in accordance with the EAs 
Pollution Prevention Guidance to ensure that silt laden runoff, arisings or 
chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses: 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
16 
 
 testing of arisings to see whether they are suitable for reuse on site;  
 siting stockpiles well away from watercourses;  
 covering stockpiles in inclement weather;  
 use of impermeable liners; and  
 use of fixing agents. 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage in 
order to prevent the contamination of ground water. 
 
To minimise the risk of coming into contact with potentially contaminated 
materials, contractors should comply with the measures set out in the 
following documents: 
− Protection of Workers and the general public during the development of 
contaminated land (HSE 1991); and 
− If applicable, a guide to safe working on contaminated sites R132 
(CIRIA 1996). 
 
Construction workers will wear appropriate personal protective equipment 
(PPE) for the nature of works being undertaken. This will involve standard 
site PPE, plus overall, gloves and eye protection where required. 
3.4.5 Additional mitigation measures that should be implemented are: 
 
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ area of 
the Project Site; 
 
Project Site welfare facilities will be made available; 
 
All workers will be required to wash their hands and remove overalls/boots 
when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the Project Site; 
 
Any soils excavated which are considered to be potentially contaminated 
(e.g. visual or olfactory evidence) will be reported to site management and 
left alone until their appropriate treatment. Suitable training will be 
provided to site personnel to ensure the correct identification of potentially 
contaminated soils by olfactory means;  
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage 
and construction materials in order to prevent the contamination of ground 
water. Site personnel will be made aware of the potential impact on ground 
and surface water associated with certain aspects of the construction works 
to further reduce the incidence of accidental impacts; 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project

3.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
3.5.1 An assessment of the likely significant effects on water quality and resources 
from the construction of the Project has been undertaken and this is set out in 
Chapter 9 of the ES. 
3.5.2 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures which 
will be used in the final CEMP for the Project in order to limit impacts on surface 
water. 
3.5.3 All construction activities will be undertaken in accordance with Requirements 
attached to the DCO (specifically Requirement 7) and should include best 
practice working methods to prevent water pollution, including:  
 
siting stockpiles away from watercourses;  
 
refuelling on designated areas of hardstanding and supplied with 
appropriate spill kits and bunded bowser to be located away from 
watercourses and surface drains; and 
 
installing construction site drainage.  
3.5.4 The most appropriate crossing methods will be used for watercourses in the 
context of the Gas Connection which may include open cut or horizontal direct 
drilling techniques. Further detail is provided in section 3.5 of the ES.    
3.5.5 All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored will be 
surrounded by an impermeable bund and located away from watercourses in 
accordance with COSHH Regulations 2002 and the Control of Pollution (Oil 
Storage) Regulations 2001. Single tanks will be within bunds sized to contain 
110 per cent of capacity and multiple tanks or drums will be within bunds sized 
to contain the greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the largest tank or 25 
per cent of the total tanks contents.  Empty drums and any drums that are 
identified as leaking will be removed from the Project Site as soon as possible 
and disposed of appropriately in accordance with the relevant legislation;  
3.5.6 Any surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons will be passed through oil/grit 
interceptors prior to discharge.  
3.5.7 Precautions will be undertaken to ensure that silt laden runoff, arisings or 
chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses including the following:                                 
 
Siting stockpiles well away from watercourses;                                                                   
 
Covering stockpiles in inclement weather;  
 
Use of impermeable liners; and  
 
Use of fixing agents. 
3.5.8 Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage in 
order to prevent the contamination of ground water

3.6 
Ecology 
3.6.1 An assessment of the ecological impacts resulting from the development has 
been undertaken and this is set out in Chapter 8 of the ES. 
3.6.2 The LEMMS for the Project (Appendix 11.3 of the ES) will ensure that any 
habitats of ecological value that would have been created as part of the LLRS 
(in the absence of the Project) will be incorporated into the design of the Project.  
These include surface water management ditches, and areas of tree and scrub 
planting.  Should the construction of the Access Road result in the loss of any 
vegetation, this would be replanted with appropriate native species.  In addition, 
the enhancement of retained vegetation and creation of new habitats, through 
tree and hedgerow planting and new ponds (as detailed in the LEMMS) would 
be expected to result in a net gain in biodiversity.   
3.6.3 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures which 
will be used in the final CEMP for the Project in order to limit impacts on ecology. 
3.6.4 Appropriate regard for the protection of habitats and protected species during 
the construction works will be included within the final CEMP and will 
incorporate the following measures: 
 Haul routes would be established at appropriate locations within the 
Project Site (away from sensitive residential receptors, waterbodies and 
the hedgerows and woodland adjacent to the Power Generation Plant 
Site).  The construction laydown area would also be prepared which would 
include offices and welfare facilities for the management team and 
construction workers. Site fencing will be used to prevent access to areas 
outside working areas, particularly in areas adjacent to features of 
ecological value; and 
 Procedures will be implemented to address site safety issues, including 
storage of potentially dangerous materials; 
 Best practice method statements would be set out prior to construction; 
 Briefings and instruction would be given to contractors regarding the 
biodiversity issues associated with the Project Site.   
3.6.5 With regard to specific protected species, the following control measures will be 
implemented through the final CEMP:  
Great Crested Newts  
3.6.6 The management measures identified below are required in order to avoid the 
incidental mortality/ injury of great crested newts during the implementation of 
the Project, and to ensure that the favourable conservation status of the local 
great crested newt population is maintained.  
 
Any requirement to carry out the works under a precautionary method 
statement included within the CEMP or a derogation licence issued by 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
21 
 
Natural England to ensure that no newts are harmed during the construction 
process, will be determined prior to construction. 
 
If required, appropriate mitigation measures will involve the appropriate 
timing of works, avoidance of suitable terrestrial habitat as far as possible, 
and the careful removal/ dismantling by hand of any suitable refugia 
beneath the footprint of the works. 
 
The working width of the Gas Connection through the hedgerows will be 
minimised as far as possible and gaps will be used in the hedgerows to 
reduce the habitat loss; and 
 Given that construction is due to commence six years after the 2014 great 
crested newt surveys were completed; updated surveys may be required to 
confirm the management and/or mitigation measures. This approach has 
been agreed with NE. 
Reptiles  
3.6.7 As there is the potential to impact reptile populations during construction of the 
Project, the following mitigation measures would be applied to displace reptiles 
present into areas of retained habitat within and adjacent to the Project Site prior 
to construction works commencing: 
  Progressive removal of suitable low-lying vegetation, including long grass, 
ruderals and scrub, using hand-held tools.  The final stages of clearance 
to ground level should take place during suitable climatic conditions at a 
time of year when reptiles are active (generally April to September 
inclusive). 
 Dismantling of any potential hibernacula or refugia by hand, including 
compost heaps and log piles. 
 Where appropriate, ground level clearance work will be overseen by a 
suitably experienced ecologist who would relocate any reptiles 
encountered to an area of suitable retained habitat within and adjacent to 
the site. 
 Following the clearance of vegetation, the vegetation will be maintained at 
ground level to prevent re-colonisation prior to works commencing. 
 Given that construction is due to commence six years after the 2014 
reptile surveys were completed; updated surveys may be required to 
confirm the management/mitigation measures that will be implemented. 
Breeding birds 
3.6.8 Any clearance or cutting of woody vegetation will avoid the breeding bird season 
(generally taken to be March to August inclusive) in order to avoid the 
destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the vegetation will be 
checked prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' nests.  If active 
nests are present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be retained around the 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
22 
 
nest and such works will be delayed until the young birds have fledged and the 
nest becomes inactive.   
Bats 
3.6.9 The Project layout has been designed to ensure that the tree and scrub-lined 
Access Road, which was found to constitute an important resource for foraging 
and commuting bats will be retained.  Similarly, the plantation woodland edge, 
field margins and road side hedgerows will be retained (as outlined in the 
LEMMS).   
3.6.10 No night time construction working would be undertaken at the Project Site (ie 
outside of permitted construction working hours). 
3.6.11 The lighting scheme associated with the Project has been sensitively designed 
to minimise potential impacts on bats (see section 3.9 below).   
3.7 
Landscape and Visual  
3.7.1 An assessment of the likely significant landscape and visual effects resulting 
from construction of the Project has been undertaken and this is set out in 
Chapter 11 of the ES. 
3.7.2 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures which 
will be used in the CEMP for the Project in order to limit landscape and visual 
impacts.  
3.7.3 The construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), 
significant mitigation to limit landscape and visual impacts is not anticipated. 
However, the following measures will be adopted in the final CEMP: 
 
Land / vegetation clearance will be limited to the minimum necessary for 
the works; 
 
Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to be 
retained would be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice; 
 
Temporary storage of soils and other material considered of value for 
retention. Where practical stockpiles would be sited to screen the 
construction works from sensitive receptors where appropriate, such as 
public rights of way and residential properties in close proximity to the 
Project Site; 
 
Construction areas will be laid out to minimise adverse impacts arising 
from temporary structures, construction activities and lighting; 
 
Construction roads will use the same alignment as permanent access 
roads where possible; 
 
Use of construction site lighting outside the construction working hours 
that are set out as a requirement in the DCO will be restricted to the 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
23 
 
minimum necessary for workforce and public safety, and for security. 
Directional luminaries will be used to limit unwanted light spill; 
 
Maintenance will be undertaken to ensure tidy and contained site 
compounds; 
 
Hoardings will be erected around the area of construction works, for 
reasons of creating a visual barrier to construction activities and also as a 
safety measure, to prevent access to the general public. 
 
The removal of all temporary structures and stockpiles when no longer 
required, and prompt reinstatement of construction areas will be carried 
out; 
 
Reinstatement of all agricultural land required temporarily during 
construction and a five-year aftercare plan to seek to ensure land is 
returned to its former productivity will be undertaken;  
 
Replacement of all trees, shrubs and hedgerows removed to 
accommodate the utility Connections, subject to National Grid planting 
constraints, will be undertaken.  
3.8 
Historic Environment 
3.8.1 An assessment of the likely significant effects on the historic environment 
resulting from construction of the Project has been undertaken and this is set 
out in Chapter 13 of the ES. 
3.8.2 Although the potential impacts on archaeology are likely to be very limited, they 
cannot be ruled out completely. 
3.8.3 A Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) will be prepared for the Project and 
intrusive works (including topsoil stripping) will be undertaken along the route of 
the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection prior to construction. This is 
secured as a Requirement to the DCO (Requirement 9). 
3.9 
Artificial Lighting 
3.9.1 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures 
related to artificial lighting which will be used in the final CEMP for the Project. 
3.9.2 The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to provide a 
safe working site during hours of darkness.  
3.9.3 The contractor should follow guidance and legislation relevant to lighting, 
including:  
 
Institution of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Guidance Notes for the 
Reduction of Obtrusive Light, (2011)

3.9.4 The general design objectives that will be used to ensure that potential adverse 
effects of lighting associated with construction of the Project are minimised are 
listed below: 
 
Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand; 
 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
 
Construction lighting should be directed away from all sensitive receptors; 
 
Preference should be given to several, lower lighting units rather than tall, 
wide beam lighting units to illuminate large areas as it will limit light 
trespass, glare and sky glow from the Project Site; 
 
Vehicle lights should be properly directed (conforming to MOT 
requirements) and lenses must be intact to prevent un-necessary glare 
and light intrusion; 
 
Lighting should be reduced or switched off when not required for safety 
purposes. Security lighting should be kept at the minimum level needed for 
visual and security protection; and 
 
Motion sensitive lighting will be used in order to avoid unnecessary 
lighting. 
3.9.5 Light fittings will comply with the specifications and the requirements of CIE 150 
(2003) and Institute of Lighting Engineer’s Guidance Notes for the Reduction of 
Obtrusive Light.  
3.9.6 Arrangements for construction lighting following these principles will be set out 
in the final CEMP.   
3.10 Traffic and Transport 
3.10.1 An assessment of the likely significant effects resulting from Traffic and 
Transport has been undertaken and this is set out in Chapter 12 of the ES.  
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
25 
 
3.10.2 Separate to this CEMP, to manage the impact of the construction phase 
movements, an outline Construction Traffic Management Plan has been 
developed and is included as Appendix 12.4 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.2). The DCO requires that a final CTMP is agreed with the relevant Authorities 
and adhered to during the construction of the Project (Requirement 11). The 
CTMP includes the following:   
 
a Route Management Plan to direct HGVs away from the sensitive local 
transport network; 
 
a traffic management scheme at the junction with Green Lane and the 
Access Road to control queuing and to ensure no blocking of the railway 
develops; 
 
a traffic management scheme for the Gas Connection access at Houghton 
Lane; 
 
a traffic management scheme for the Electrical Connection access at 
Station Lane; 
 
the Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy to control the vehicle generation 
and minimise impact on the surrounding area;  
 
a footpath management plan to ensure any footpath route affected by the 
works are protected, and that the pedestrians may use them safely; and 
 
an Abnormal Load Delivery Strategy to manage the delivery to site of the 
major items of plant and apparatus that are indivisible.  
3.11 Waste Management 
3.11.1 This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation measures in 
relation to waste management which will be used in the final CEMP for the 
Project. 
3.11.2 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework Directive, 
the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (where 
relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the Project, will apply the waste 
hierarchy which will focus on; 
 
Prevention; 
 
Re-use;  
 
Recycling;  
 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and  
 
Disposal. 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
26 
 
3.11.3 Where hazardous waste is transported from the Project Site, it will be handled 
in accordance with relevant regulations (e.g. by a registered waste carrier and 
in line with the hazardous waste regulations (2005)), and, where necessary, be 
transported in sealed tankers. 
3.11.4 As part of the construction works, there is likely to be limited potential for the 
generation of waste associated with the Power Generation Plant given that the 
LLRS will ensure that a level platform is created in the base of the Rookery 
South Pit on which to site the Generating Equipment. However, where possible 
waste will be re-used on site.  
3.11.5 The final CEMP must: 
 
provide for the submission of construction method statements for approval 
by the local authority 
 
provide for the stockpiling of excavated spoil and testing for Waste 
Acceptance Criteria (as defined in the Landfill (England and Wales) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2005), to determine whether it can be re-used 
on- or off-site 
 
provide for the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from de-
watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor; and 
 
require that structures and equipment for the Project will be made of 
materials suitable for recycling as far as is practicable.

Conclusions 
4.1.1 This outline CEMP provides a framework on which the construction contractor 
should base a more detailed and CEMP which will be implemented during 
construction of the Project. 
4.1.2 Although no likely significant effects are predicted as a result of the construction 
phase of the Project, the mitigation measures outlined herein will ensure that 
the lowest level of risk possible is placed on the environment. 
4.1.3 Mitigation measures have been outlined to limit potential impacts of noise, air 
quality, ground conditions, surface water, ecology, historic environment, 
landscape and visual, artificial lighting, traffic and transport and waste. These 
mitigation measures should be taken forward for further consideration when 
preparing the final CEMP. 
4.1.4 It has also outlined a series of general best practice principles which should be 
adhered to, including; a register of environmental impacts, the production of risk 
assessments and method statements, the adherence to Site Environmental 
Standards, dealing with public relations, the monitoring and measurement of 
construction activities and the roles and responsibilities of key site staff.

MILLBROOK POWER LIMITED DEVELOPMENT  
METHOD STATEMENT – TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT 
Prepared by: 
John Hopkins 
Date: 
January 12th, 2015 
________________________________________________________________________________ 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Peter Brett Associates LLP has been commissioned by Millbrook Power Limited to resolve all 
transport matters relating to the development of land at the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, in Stewartby, Bedfordshire. This land shown in Figure 1 is proposed to be 
developed into a Power Generation Plant. 
 
1.2 
The site is to be accessed by a simple priority junction on Green Lane, located 75m to the 
south-east of the Stewartby Rail Station level crossing. The proposed access is shown on 
drawing reference 31116/2001/06. 
 
1.3 
This Method Statement has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP to detail the 
proposed traffic management scheme to be implemented at this Development access during 
the construction phase. 
 
2. 
Traffic management control requirements 
2.1 
The proposed site vehicle access is located adjacent the Stewartby Rail Station level crossing 
on Green Lane. This permanent site access will be constructed in advance of the Power 
Generation Plant construction works, and will form the main Development vehicle access.  
 
2.2 
Whilst the predicted construction vehicle movements are likely to be limited – peaking at 60 
vehicle movements per hour – Network Rail has expressed concerns that any significant 
queuing arising from vehicles waiting to turn right into the Development could back on to the 
level crossing, hence obstruct rail movements.  
 
2.3 
As discussed and agreed with Network Rail, a temporary traffic light controlled traffic 
management scheme will be implemented during the construction of both the access and the 
Power Generation Station to ensure the efficient movement of vehicles along Green Lane, and 
to ensure that no obstructions to the rail occur.  
 
2.4 
The predicted daily operational vehicle movements are much less than in the construction 
phase. Network Rail has concurred that these do not require any such traffic management. 
 
3. 
Approval process 
3.1 
The Green Lane traffic management scheme is within the jurisdiction of two local highway 
authorities - Bedford Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire Council. 
 
3.2 
The traffic management scheme has been prepared in accordance with the Highways 
Agency’s Chapter 8 Traffic Signs Manual (2009), and is shown on the attached drawing 
reference 31116//2001/06. The detail of these scheme proposals will be agreed with the local 
highway authorities and Network Rail before implementation on site. 
 
3.3 
Prior to first use, the scheme will be set out on site, and will be inspected and approved by the 
local highway authorities and Network Rail. Any necessary amendments will be made.

4. 
Traffic Management Scheme 
Hours of operation 
 
4.1 
The traffic management scheme will be temporary, only operating during the construction 
working hours. Outside of these construction working hours, the signs and lights will be 
removed so that traffic can flow unobstructed. 
 
Traffic management scheme 
 
4.2 
This traffic management scheme consists of the following: 
 
i) 
advance temporary access and traffic signal control signing on all approaches; 
 
ii) 
temporary stop line signage on all approaches; 
 
iii) 
manually-operated three-stage traffic signal controls to all approaches. Whilst the Site 
Exit and Green Lane Northbound approaches will be provided with a standard three 
aspects light, the Green Lane Southbound approach will be provided with an 
additional green right turn filter aspect as well as the standard three aspects light;  
 
Signal phases 
 
4.3 
The traffic signal scheme will have three stages: 
 
i) 
Stage 1 – for normal operation - allowing the Green Lane North- and Southbound 
movements, all Site Exit movements stopped; 
 
ii) 
Stage 2 – when a vehicle approaches to turn into the Site - allowing Green Lane 
Southbound movements and the inward Site Access movements. The Site Exit and 
Green Lane  Northbound movements will be stopped; and 
 
iii) 
Stage 3 - allowing Site Exit movements, the Green Lane North- and Southbound 
movements will be stopped.     
 
5. 
Operational procedure 
Maintenance and back-up  
 
5.1 
All signal apparatus will be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s / supplier’s 
recommendations. 
 
5.2 
A set of “Stop Go” boards will be held on site in case of an emergency.  
 
Daily establishment 
 
5.3 
The traffic management scheme will be set up each working day prior to any arrivals of 
construction traffic on site. A member of the contractor’s staff will be nominated to ensure that 
the traffic management scheme has been set out as agreed. 
 
Signal Operative  
 
5.4 
A member of staff will be nominated as the Signal Operative to operate the traffic signal 
controls manually at all times that the traffic signals are in place.  
 
 
 
5.5 
This Signal Operative: 
 
 
 
 
J:\40335 Millbrook Power Project\Word\Notes\150112 Green Lane TM Method Statement Document.docx 
 
 
 
Page 3 of 4 
 
 
i) 
will be suitably trained; 
 
ii) 
will confirm that the traffic management has been established each day as agreed 
prior to operation, and will report to the senior site staff any shortfall; 
 
iii) 
will be provided with a heated shelter, with simple welfare facilities immediately 
available to minimise the need to be absent; 
 
iv) 
has the sole role on site of operating the traffic signals, any duties relating to security 
or the recording of movements will be undertaken by others;  
 
v) 
have a suitably-trained deputy to relieve him for breaks; and 
 
vi) 
will report to the senior site staff any problems with the traffic management.  
 
Procedure - approaching Southbound vehicle to enter the Site 
 
5.6 
Upon sighting any vehicle approaching southbound along Green Lane indicating to turn into 
the Site Access, the Signal Operative will advance the traffic light phase immediately to Stage 
2.  
 
5.7 
Upon the amber / red aspect being provided for Green Lane Northbound movements, the 
additional green arrow aspect will be provided to the Green Lane Southbound movements 
without the need to provide a red aspect. This will enable the approaching Southbound vehicle 
to clear the junction as quickly as possible, with minimal development of a queue. 
 
5.8 
As soon as the entering vehicle has cleared, the Signal Operative will advance the traffic light 
phase immediately to Stage 1 again.  
 
5.9 
The approaching vehicle will be moved into the Site as soon as possible, any queries or 
security matters will be addressed by the Gate Keeper and not the Signal Operative.  
 
Procedure - approaching Southbound vehicle to enter the Site 
 
5.10 
Upon sighting any vehicle exiting the Site approaching the Site Access, the Signal Operative 
will review the vehicle movements along Green Lane, and when convenient advance the traffic 
light sequence to Stage 3.  
 
5.11 
It is accepted that the vehicles exiting the Site Access have a lower priority than those moving 
along Green Lane, and at no point should the Site Access green aspect cause the queue to 
extend to the level crossing.   
 
5.12 
As soon as the exiting vehicle has cleared, the Signal Operative will advance the traffic light 
phase immediately to Stage 1 (or Stage 2 as appropriate).  
 
6. 
Review  
6.1 
The scheme will be reviewed on a regular basis with all the local highway authorities and 
Network Rail as part of a monthly traffic management meeting. Any issues will be raised at this 
meeting, and if necessary this Method Statement be amended to reflect any agreed changes.

Introduction 
1.1 
Peter Brett Associates LLP has been commissioned by Millbrook Power Limited to resolve all 
transport matters relating to the development of land at the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, in Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  
 
1.2 
This land is proposed to be developed into a Power Generation Plant. The location of the site 
is shown on Figure 1 in Appendix A. 
 
1.3 
This Travel Plan has been prepared to summarise the proposed travel demand management 
measures for this Development.

Development Description 
2.1 
The Proposed Development would be a Power Generating Plant, to be run during periods of 
high electricity demand to support the high-output “base” electricity suppliers such as nuclear 
and coal-fired power stations, as well as to complement the output from renewable energy 
sources.   
 
2.2 
During the normal operation, the Proposed Development would generate a very low number of 
vehicle trips, particularly in the operational phase – a maximum of only 4 workers are 
anticipated on site per day. However, during the yearly maintenance periods, there may be up 
to 40 extra staff for a period of a month.

Policy 
3.1 
Guidance on Transport Assessment 
3.1.1 
The Department for Transport’s archived document “Guidance on Transport Assessment” 
provided indicative thresholds for when travel plans are required to support planning 
applications. It suggests that Travel Plans would not be required for: 
 
B2 General Industrial development less than 4,000m2,  
 
any development generating less than 30 or more two-way vehicle movements in any 
hour; nor 
 
any development generating less than 100 or more two-way vehicle movements per day. 
3.1.2 
As detailed above, this proposal would generate significantly fewer trips than these thresholds. 
As such, this brief Travel Plan document has been prepared to summarise the travel demand 
management measures that will be deployed to minimise the car trip generation from this 
Development.  
3.2 
National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) 
3.2.1 
The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) promotes sustainable development, and 
states that there is to be a “presumption in favour of sustainable development” when making 
plans and decisions. 
3.2.2 
Decisions on planning applications should ensure that “…the use of sustainable transport 
modes can be maximised” (Paragraph 34), and take account of whether “the opportunities for 
sustainable transport modes have been taken up”. 
3.3 
Central Bedfordshire Council Local Transport Plan 3 (adopted April 
2011)  
3.3.1 
A key aspiration identified within the Central Bedfordshire Council Local Transport Plan 3 is to 
change single occupancy car-based travel habits within the region by finding solutions to 
transport matters.  
3.3.2 
As part of the objectives, a minimum 20% modal shift away from private car to more 
sustainable modes (based upon the existing local travel patterns) is the stated target set for all 
new developments in the area.  
3.3.3 
In the case of the Millbrook Power Ltd Development, assuming that all workers were to drive 
to work, meeting this target would require the change of 1 employee’s travel pattern out of the 
five workers present on site during a shift.  
3.4 
Bedford Borough Council Local Transport Plan 3 (adopted April 2011) 
3.4.1 
The Bedford Borough Council Local Transport Plan 3 identifies aspirations to increase 
accessibility by non-car modes to employment by:  
i. 
improving physical access for non-car modes by addressing issues that affect the 
pedestrian and cycle environment; 
ii. 
improving the attractiveness of walking and cycling by improving routes and facilities;

iii. considering the role of parking provision; 
iv. reducing the impact of congestion on accessibility through traffic calming or traffic 
management measures.   
3.5 
Summary 
3.5.1 
Despite the Millbrook Power Limited proposals generating a small number of car mode trips, 
this brief review of national and local policy highlights the need for a travel demand 
management strategy to assist in managing car movements on a local level.  
3.5.2 
This Travel Plan sets out the physical measures (“hard” measures) to be implemented on site, 
as well as identifying the travel demand management strategies and measures (“soft 
measures”) that will be developed.

Travel Demand Measures 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
When considering the travel demand management measures for the Millbrook Power 
Development, these reflect the limited scale of car-based trip generation. 
4.1.2 
This Travel Plan identifies a number of “hard” and “soft” measures that will be delivered to 
encourage less private car movements for the users accessing the site.  
Hard Measures 
 
Cycle Storage and Shelters – Cycling will form an attractive non-car alternative for 
workers resident locally. To encourage cycle use, on-site cycle storage for 4 cycles will 
be provided conveniently, close to the employees’ access. The storage will be secure, 
and located within the area covered by CCTV. The cycle storage will be sheltered, with 
cycles protected from the weather.  
 
Showers and changing facilities – showers and changing facilities will be provided 
within the Building for workers who walk and cycle to work. These will be heated, as well 
as maintained and cleaned on a regular basis. 
 
Secure Lockers – Millbrook Power Limited will provide secure lockers adjacent the 
changing facilities for cyclists and walkers to store their equipment safely during work 
hours.  
Soft Measures 
 
Car Sharing – car sharing is an effective way of reducing the demand for car movement.  
It involves two or more people sharing a car for their journey to / from work, which brings 
direct cost savings to both parties. Millbrook Power Ltd staff will be encouraged to identify 
possible car share partners identified in the local Central Bedfordshire Council car share 
scheme: https://liftshare.com/uk/community/luton-and-central-bedfordshire. It is free for 
members to sign up, register their journeys and find someone to share a journey with. 
 
Working with other future local employees – with the Rookery Pit being promoted for 
further employment uses, future opportunities exist to co-operate with these other users 
to reduce car trips – such as the greater exposure to the car sharing database amongst 
all other employees within the Rookery Pit. Millbrook Power Limited will co-operate and 
consider changing shift patterns to increase the likelihood of finding car and cycle sharing 
partners.  
 
Nominate Responsibility – an employee will be nominated to promote the travel 
measures, to initiate change among colleagues, and to be the conduit for any comments 
arising relating to potential improvement of the facilities on offer.

Conclusion 
5.1 
The Millbrook Power Limited development would generate significantly fewer trips than the 
minimum thresholds identified within the archived Guidance on Transport Assessment 
needing a Travel Plan – typically, around 15 staff would be on site each day, split into three 
shifts.  
 
5.2 
This Travel Plan has been prepared to summarise the travel demand management measures 
that will be implemented to minimise the car trip generation from this Development, to meet 
national and local objectives.
