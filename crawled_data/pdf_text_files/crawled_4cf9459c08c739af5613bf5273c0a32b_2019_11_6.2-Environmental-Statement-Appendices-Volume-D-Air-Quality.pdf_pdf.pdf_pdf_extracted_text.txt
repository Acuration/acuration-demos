Appendix 6.1
Approach to Air Quality Dispersion Modelling
Appendix 6.1 Approach to Air Quality Dispersion 
Modelling  
The following methodology was agreed as part of the consultation process as agreed 
with City and County of Swansea (CCS). 
Table 6-1: Agreed Approach to the Air Quality Assessment  
Point of Consultation 
Agreed Approach 
Stack Modelling 
Model to be used: 
ADMS 5 
Pollutants 
to 
be 
considered: 
Nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide 
Meteorological Data 
5 years data (2012-2016) for Cwm Level Park Data 
(provided by CCS) with missing data/cloud cover 
supplemented with Mumbles Head Data for the same time 
period. 
Terrain Data  
Included in the model based maximum resolution (64x64) 
allowed within ADMS5 and covering an area applicable to 
each modelling grid 
Modelling Grid 
200 m (20 km x 20 km centred on the stack) – used for 
contour plots and ecological impact assessment. 
30 m (3 km x 3 km centred on the stack) – used for Stack 
Height Determination 
Indicative Receptors  
Ecological Designations (modelled at a height of 1.5 m):  
- Ramsar, SAC and SPA sites within 10 km 
- SSSI, SINC, Ancient Woodland, NNR and LNRs 
designated within 2 km 
 
Human Receptors (modelled at a height of 1.5 m)  - 
specific receptor locations representing the closest 
sensitive receptors to the Project Site, i.e.: 
- Abergelli Farm; 
- Morriston; 
- Pant-lasau; 
- Llwyncelyn; 
- Llangyfelach; and 
- Receptors representative of the eastern boundary of 
areas 11 and 5 on the LDP Concept Plan 
Background Air Quality 
Human Health - Based on Mapped Defra grid square for 
each modelled receptor. 
Contour Plots - No background will be applied for contour 
plots which will just show contributions from the Project 
Point of Consultation 
Agreed Approach 
Ecology - Background for ecological receptors will be 
based on APIS background estimates  
NOx to NO2 conversion 
Use Environment Agency values of 70% conversion of 
NOx to NO2 for annual concentrations and 35% for hourly 
concentrations. 
Assessment 
of 
Significance 
Environment Agency Screening levels i.e. if less than 1% 
of AQS objective for Long-term and 10% for short-term 
then can be screened out as not significant. 
Roads Modelling 
Is assessment required? Screen need to assess road contributions based on the 
based on the IAQM Land-Use Planning & Development 
Control Planning For Air Quality Jan 2017 (v1.2) Table 6.2
If 
traffic 
contributions 
cannot be screened out 
based 
on 
the 
IAQM 
guidance’s then: 
Model Using ADMS Roads at specific receptors close to 
the roads that exceed the IAQM screening level at a 
height of 1.5 m.  
Use Defra mapped background data 
Stack contribution will be added to this to assess in 
combination effects. 
NOx to NO2 conversion based on Defra conversion tool. 
Assess significance based on the IAQM guidance’s 
criteria  
 
 
 
Appendix 6.2
Stack Height Determination
Appendix 6.2 Stack Height Determination 
6.1.1 
Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using Cwm Level Park 
meteorological data from 2012 to 2016 with the maximum ground-level 
concentrations predicted across a grid of receptors with a model resolution 
of 30 m.  
6.1.2 
Dispersion model runs were undertaken for various stack heights between 
20 m and 50 m with the stack height models in 2 metre incremental heights 
within this range. Table  and the associated Figure A6-1 to Figure A6.3 show 
the results of the stack height sensitivity testing. The appropriate stack height 
was determined as the point at which the change in maximum predicted 
annual and 99.79th percentile NO2 concentrations with each stack increase 
ceased to be significant.  When plotted as a graph this is the point at which 
the curve flattens of after an initial rapid decrease with each increase in 
stack height.

Note: Annual mean NO2 AQS objective 40 µg/m3, daily 99.79th percentile NO2 AQS objective 200 
µg/m3, CO 8 hour running 10,000 µg/m3. 
6.1.3 
Significant benefits are seen as the stack height increases from 20 m to 32 
m, in terms of maximum ground level concentrations of NO2 (both annual 
and 99.79th percentile hourly concentrations) and CO, as the impacts of 
building downwash reduce. Beyond this height, there is only a slight benefit 
seen, in terms of maximum ground level concentrations, with increasing 
stack height further, though there is a further decrease between 32 and 34 m 
when looking at 99.79th percentile hourly NO2 concentrations though this 
also flattens out after 34 m. The continuing small decrease in maximum 
concentrations above 32/34 m is driven by the fact that with each stack 
increase the plume disperses slightly more before reaching ground-level, 
however, as thee changes above 34 m are so small this indicates that the 
dispersion is no longer influenced by building downwash. When the stack 
height is increased to 34 m, the maximum impact on ground level 
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide is less than 1% of the annual mean 
objective and both NO2 and CO are well below 10% of their relevant short-
term AQS objectives.   
6.1.4 
A minimum stack height of 35 m has been proposed by APL for the Power 
Generation Plant and a maximum height of 45 m.  The assessment of 
impacts at both human health and ecological receptors has, therefore, used 
a stack height of 35 m as this represents the worst-case in terms of 
dispersion.  For other disciplines the maximum stack height of 45 m has 
been assumed as this represents a worst-case e.g. in terms of landscape 
and visual impacts etc.
