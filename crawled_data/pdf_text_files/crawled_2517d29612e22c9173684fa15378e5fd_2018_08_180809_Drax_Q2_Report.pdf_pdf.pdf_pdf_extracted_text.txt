This quarter we focus on the phase-out of coal at home and abroad, and 
the impacts of Britain’s heat wave on demand and renewables. Electricity 
generation from coal has again fallen to new lows in Britain, to the point 
where summer months are almost coal-free. However, growing consumption 
in Asia means that the global phase-out of coal is at a complete stand-still.
Article 1 explores the global trends in coal-fired electricity, and how the world 
has changed in the last 30 years. Article 2 looks at the year so far in Britain, 
and how the summer has seen coal fall to less than 1% of the generation mix.
Last month the Committee on Climate Change released its progress report 
to Parliament, which sets out how Britain’s power sector has made ‘excellent 
progress’, while cleaning up heat, transport and industry ‘has stalled’.  
Article 3 asks whether progress in the power sector is about to get a lot 
harder? Coal is all but eliminated, investment in renewables is slowing, and 
new nuclear is still a decade away.
June 23rd marked the start of the strongest heat wave for a generation.  
Article 4 shows how this impacts on electricity demand due to air 
conditioning and refrigeration, with each extra degree of heat adding the 
equivalent of a million extra households to national demand. With the hot 
weather came clear and calm skies, meaning solar power was up and wind 
power down significantly on last year. Despite news of a ‘wind drought’ in 
Britain, Article 5 shows that the calm periods were offset by increased solar 
and biomass output. Article 6 finishes with statistics on the capacity and 
production for the quarter.

1. (Lack of) progress in global electricity generation 
Coal has declined steadily in Europe (from 39% to 22% of electricity generation 
over the last thirty years), but it is still a significant source in Eastern Europe, 
particularly Poland and Serbia. The US has always used more coal than Europe, but 
is also falling steadily (from 57% to 31%). The latest pro-coal policies cannot trump 
the simple economics that gas is the cheaper fuel to use in America. 
Africa and the Middle East mostly rely on their abundant supplies of natural gas and oil. 
The notable exception is South Africa, which still gets 88% of its electricity from coal. 
So much for powering past coal. Thirty years ago, coal provided 38% of the world’s 
electricity. Today, it still provides 38%. This lack of movement on the global scale 
masks very different national trajectories (see charts, below). Progress in Europe 
and America is being counteracted by the rise of coal across Asia.
This may come as a shock given the rapid progress made with renewable energy 
over the last decade. Globally, some $300 billion a year is being invested into new 
renewables, which has seen their share quadruple from 2% to 8% of electricity 
generation since 2007. However, this has done little more than to offset the fall in 
nuclear power and growth in demand for electricity.
The global share of electricity generation simplified into three categories 2
South America uses very little coal for its electricity due to the abundance of 
hydropower. While the share in most countries is rising, the average is from 
1.7% to just 2.6% last year. 
 
The Asia Pacific region has by far the heaviest reliance on coal, led by China 
and India. China’s share steadily grew to a peak of 81% in 2007, but has since 
fallen to 67% as the government focused on improving air quality. Australia 
is the world’s fourth largest coal producer, which powered five-sixths of its 
electricity generation until 1997. Over the last decade this has fallen to 61%. 
Many Asian countries are strengthening their their reliance though: India 
maintained a two-thirds share of coal for the 1990s and 2000s, then increased it 
to 76% over the last 10 years. Indonesia (the world’s 4th most populous country) has 
doubled its coal share from 30% to 58%; Japan has grown steadily from 15% to 34%; 
and South Korea from 28% to 46%. Of all the countries in Asia, North Korea is an 
unlikely climate champion for having halved its coal reliance to 20%.
As global demand for electricity is growing (especially in Asia), the trend in the 
absolute amount of coal used is bleak. China, South Korea and Indonesia now burn 
10 times more coal for electricity than they did 30 years ago. Only 7 countries use 
less coal today than they did 30 years ago: Germany, Poland, Spain, Ukraine, the US, 
UK and Canada.
Last year the UK and Canada launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance, to promote 
the rapid phase-out of coal. Membership has grown to 60 countries, states and 
companies; however, further work is needed to recruit nations who are highly 
dependent on coal and cannot switch to other forms of generation without  
building new infrastructure.3
Still, the UK is leading by example: coal generation has fallen by four-fifths in just 
five years. If the world followed suit, one can only hope that in another thirty years, 
coal does not still provide 38% of global electricity.

2. Britain edges closer to zero coal
For the third summer in a row, coal is edging closer to extinction in Britain, 
producing nothing for 12 days during June. Coal supplied just 1.3% of Britain’s 
electricity over the quarter, and its share fell below 1% for the first time  
in June.
Britain is racking up more ‘zero-coal’ hours than ever before. No coal power 
stations were running for 812 hours during quarter 2 (37% of the time). There 
were as many coal-free hours this quarter as in the whole of 2016 and 2017 
combined. Britain went for three days straight with no coal (76 hours) from 
the 21st to 24th of April, and saw two other runs more than 48 hours. The 
previous record was 40.5 hours in 2017. 
At the times when coal is running, it is now at a bare minimum. Apart from 
two cold spells in April, coal rarely went above 1 GW – just half the peak 
output of one of Britain’s remaining coal-fired power stations. Overall, the 
fleet ran at just 3% of its rated capacity across the quarter. One question is 
why is this small amount still needed – could Britain simply run with no coal 
over the whole summer?
Yes, it likely could. Much of the coal output during May and June has been 
for system stability rather than providing bulk energy. National Grid called 
on specific coal stations in the North of England to balance the system, 
predominantly overnight. During June, coal stations produced 50% more 
output overnight than during the day, despite demand being one-third lower.
Coal was responsible for 6% of carbon emissions from generating electricity 
over the quarter (less than 1 million tonnes of CO2). Meanwhile, gas supplied 
41% of demand, and was responsible for 82% of emissions (11 million tonnes). 
So, while it would be a clear symbolic victory to remove coal from the system 
for entire months at a time, its impact on the climate in summer months is 
no longer significant. Using coal for balancing, if it happens to be in the right 
place and at the right price may be sensible until there are more low-carbon 
forms of generation for system balancing.

The UK has seen a remarkable reduction in carbon emissions from the 
power sector, but this rapid progress may be about to slow down. For the 
last four years, emissions reductions have been in the range of 12–24% per 
year, thanks to gas replacing coal, and renewables (plus imports of French 
nuclear power) displacing fossil fuels. Such progress could never go on 
indefinitely, and three factors mean that future emissions reductions are likely 
to be tougher and much slower:
1. 
the easiest option of removing coal is almost at its end;
2. 
growth in renewables is a more gradual process and is facing 
uncertainty; and 
3. 
Britain will lose nuclear capacity as old plants will have retired 
before new plants can be built.
The era of slow progress may already be upon us. The carbon intensity of 
electricity generation in Quarter 2 averaged 195 g/kWh – a new record for 
Britain, but only 2% lower than achieved in Quarter 2 of 2017 (see chart 
below left). The reason is that generation during the summer months has 
settled on a similar pattern: 25% nuclear, 25% renewables, 40% gas, 8% 
imports and 2% coal. Until these shares start shifting, the recent experience 
of 200 g/kWh in summer and 275 g/kWh in winter will not budge.
Phasing out Britain’s coal consumption has been a major success story.  
Coal has gone from supplying 43% of Britain’s electricity in 2012 to 7% during 
2017. This only fell slightly, to 6%, in the first half of 2018. Britain’s coal power 
stations have gone from annual emissions of 129 to just 19 million tonnes of 
CO2 over the last five years (see chart below right). This has corresponded 
with a small increase in emissions from gas, but the main issue is simply 
that the bulk of the emissions savings from closing coal plants have already 
been made. Government expects to phase out the remaining coal by 2025, 
meaning that future savings will happen at one-eighth of the current pace 
(19 Mt in eight years, versus 22 Mt per year over the last five years).

The growth of renewables has been the other big success. Output from renewables has 
increased five-fold since 2010, and now consistently supplies a quarter of Britain’s electricity 
(see chart below left). However, while they have grown consistently, they have done so 
relatively slowly; increasing their share gradually by 3 percentage points per year.
This growth has been fostered by policies that are either defunct or where future growth will 
be limited. Around 25 GW of renewables have a contract through the Renewables Obligation 
(RO), 10 GW with Contracts for Differences (CfDs), and 6 GW with microgeneration Feed-in 
Tariffs (FiTs). However, the RO is now closed to new entrants, it is not clear whether there 
will be further CfD auctions for the most mature technologies (onshore wind and solar), and 
the FiT for rooftop solar will close in April 2019. This leaves only the CfDs for less mature 
technologies (mainly offshore wind and onshore wind on remote Scottish islands), where the 
government will allocate up to £557m across multiple CfD auctions into the 2020s.  
It is perhaps less clear than ever how Britain’s renewable capacity will grow over the next  
10 years. 
Thirdly, it is also unlikely that new nuclear power stations will plug the gap in emission 
reductions. Britain’s nuclear fleet is growing old, and half are expected to close for safety 
reasons by 2025, before Hinkley Point C comes online. EDF, which operates all British nuclear 
plants, is seeking lifetime extensions for the existing plants, but it is widely expected that 
nuclear capacity will dip in the coming decade before recovering in the 2030s (see chart, 
below right).
While falling emissions from UK power generation offer much to celebrate, it looks as 
if progress is set to slow down in the next few years as the coal phase out culminates, 
renewables growth slows and new nuclear cannot stem the impending stream of 
retirements. Uncertainty also hangs over the future of other emerging low-carbon 
technologies such as carbon capture and storage, tidal lagoons and small nuclear reactors. 
Continued progress can be achieved, but will require renewed focus to translate the switch 
from coal to gas into a switch from gas to low-carbon sources. The key question is whether 
government is willing to continue intervening in the electricity market to maintain its world-
leading status on carbon reductions and to provide investors with the long-term security 
they need to finance construction, whilst maintaining public support towards clean energy.

16.5 degrees Celsius is the Goldilocks temperature for the Brits – not hot enough for 
air-con, not too cold to put the heating on. In March we saw how the Beast from the East 
caused a surge in demand, now the long summer heat wave is doing the same.
June 23rd marked the start of the heat wave, with daytime temperatures surpassing 30°C in 
Scotland and Wales. The last week of June was 3.3°C warmer than the previous week, and 
demand was 860 MW higher (see chart, below left). This rise is equivalent to the power 
demand from an extra 2.5 million households.5 
This reflects the growing role of air conditioning and refrigeration in shops, and cooling 
for data centres. Global electricity demand from cooling is rising dramatically, and is seen 
as a ‘blind spot’ in the global energy system. This will become more important as global 
temperatures, and more importantly, global incomes rise. However, it is easier to deal with 
than cold spells during winter because demand is low and solar PV output is high.
Below 14°C, demand increases by 750 MW for every degree it gets colder as buildings 
need more heating. Around a tenth of British homes have electric heating, as do half of 
commercial and public buildings.6 And while the British weather is not synonymous with air 
conditioning, demand rises by 350 MW for each degree that temperature rises above 20°C.
This effect may well grow stronger in the coming years. National Grid expect that the peak 
load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade. Perhaps events such as the 
current prolonged heat wave may spur more households to invest in air conditioning.

Wind output fell by 60% between January and June, but Britain’s ‘wind 
drought’ was balanced out by a record-breaking summer for solar panels.  
Low wind output during the summer heat wave has been widely reported,  
as the high pressure sitting over the country has kept the skies calm.
 
For three weeks in June, wind output hovered between 0.3 and 4.3 GW, well 
below the 13 GW peak output over the quarter. The minimum of 273 MW was 
the lowest instantaneous output seen in two years. 
While this might sound severe, wind output during Quarter 2 was up 2% on the 
same period last year. That said, Britain’s wind capacity has grown by a sixth 
over the last year, so it’s productivity this summer has been lower. The fall 
has been magnified as we move out of an extremely windy winter. Given that 
summer demand is low, National Grid confirmed “we’re comfortable with the 
level of spare generation we have available.”
The fall in wind output coincides with a record period for Britain’s solar panels. 
As Britain’s solar fleet overtook the installed capacity of coal power stations 
(see Article 6), solar output broke past 9 GW in May to a new record of  
9.39 GW at lunchtime on 27th June. 
Britain saw 13 days in June where solar peaked above 8 GW, including every 
day of the last week (during the heatwave). The average capacity factor of 
Britain’s wind farms was just 17% in June, less than the 19% recorded by  
solar panels.7

6. Capacity and production statistics
This quarter, low carbon sources produced 55% of Britain’s electricity and 
gas produced 41%. Of the low-carbon sources, 50% was British nuclear and 
renewables, and 5% was French nuclear.
The carbon intensity of electricity hit a new low of 195 g/kWh averaged over 
the quarter. Of this, 82% of emissions came from burning natural gas, and 
approximately 5% each from coal, biomass and imports from  
the Netherlands.
Demand was 68.2 TWh, unchanged from 2017 Q2. However, demand net of 
variable renewables (which must be met by fully-controllable generators) hit 
its lowest ever level of 54.1 TWh (1.2% below Q2 last year). This ‘net demand’ 
fell below 10 GW for the first time, reaching 9.85 GW on June 14th. Demand net 
of renewables and nuclear fell to just 2.4 GW, continuing the rapid descent 
towards net-zero that we reported on previously.
Installed coal capacity fell below 13 GW as Drax closed its fourth unit for 
conversion to biomass. This 5% drop meant that Britain now has less coal 
than it does solar generating capacity – highlighting the dramatic shifts in the 
power sector. 
Meanwhile, wind capacity surpassed the milestone of 20 GW installed,8 
and Lynemouth biomass conversion began operating, pushing up biomass 
capacity and output by a quarter.

8 Note that sources for installed wind capacity differ notably. Elexon report 21.1 GW (including projects currently being commissioned), whereas RenewableUK report 19.3 GW. We take the average of these. 
9 Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 900 MW of wind, 600 MW of biomass and 500 MW of solar,  
respectively producing 1.4, 1.2 and 0.2 TWh extra per quarter. These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system operator and so cannot be reported on here.
