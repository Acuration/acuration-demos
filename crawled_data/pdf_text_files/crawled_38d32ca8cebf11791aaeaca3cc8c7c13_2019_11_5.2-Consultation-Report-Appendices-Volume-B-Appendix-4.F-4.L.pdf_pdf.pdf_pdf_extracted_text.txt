NOTICE OF PROPOSED APPLICATION FOR A DEVELOPMENT CONSENT ORDER TO 
CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE THE ABERGELLI POWER PROJECT ON LAND ADJACENT TO 
THE NATIONAL GRID GAS COMPRESSOR STATION AT ABERGELLI FARM, SWANSEA, 
SOUTH WALES 
 
1. Notice is hereby given that Abergelli Power Limited ("APL") of 33 Cavendish Square, London 
W1G 0PW, intends to apply to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change for a 
Development Consent Order ("DCO") under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”) 
to authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of a gas-fired electricity generation 
project which includes a power generation plant and integral gas and electrical connections on 
land adjacent to the National Grid Gas Compressor Station at Abergelli Farm, Swansea, south 
Wales (the "Project"). APL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
 
2. APL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power Limited is 
seeking to develop gas-fired power stations on land at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to 
support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.  
 
3. The site for the power generation plant covers an area of approximately 6ha.  
 
4. The proposed DCO would, among other things, license and authorise:  
 
a. The construction, operation and maintenance of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power 
generation plant consisting of up to five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural 
gas with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 megawatts (MW).  
 
b. Provision of:  
i. Up to 5 GTGs.  
ii. Up to 5 exhaust gas emission flue stacks, each up to 40m in height.  
iii. A combined control room, administration, workshop and store building, telemetry

viii. Site vehicular access(es) including a new access road from either the Rhyd-y-
pandy Road to the north or the B4489 to the west. 
ix. An underground 400kV electrical connection to export electricity produced by the 
power generation plant to the National Electricity Transmission System at the 
existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.  
x. A switchyard/banking compound containing up to 6 transformers and other plant 
required to manage the transmission of electricity.  
xi. A new underground gas pipeline connection to import natural gas from the 
National Transmission System (NTS) to the GTGs.  
xii. An above ground installation at the NTS connection point containing:  
1. a minimum offtake connection comprising a remotely operable valve, 
control and instrumentation kiosk and electrical supply kiosk;  
2. a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) trap facility, comprising a PIG 
launching facility, emergency control valve, isolation valve and control 
and instrumentation kiosk, and electricity supply kiosk; 
3. security infrastructure; and 
4. access to the installation.  
xiii. A natural gas receiving facility at the generating equipment site containing: 
1. a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) receiving facility; 
2. isolation valves, metering, heating, filtering, compression, pressure 
regulation equipment; 
3. electricity supply kiosk; and 
4. control and instrumentation kiosks. 
xiv. Temporary construction compound(s) for the power generation plant, gas 
connection and electrical connection together with access to the compound.  
xv. Site drainage and waste management infrastructure and other services.

d. Replacement and compensatory planting, landscaping and, if required, ecological 
mitigation.  
 
e. If required, the temporary prohibition or restriction on the use of public footpath(s) during 
the construction works described above. 
 
f. 
If required, permanent and temporary changes to the highway network for the Project.  
 
g. Compulsory acquisition of land and/or rights in land for the Project.  
 
h. Overriding of easements and other rights over or affecting land (if required) for the 
Project.  
 
i. 
The application and/or disapplication of legislation relevant to the Project as may be 
required.  
 
j. 
Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works, provisions, permits, consents, waivers 
or releases as are necessary and/or convenient for the successful construction, operation 
and maintenance of the Project.  
 
5. Due to the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). Therefore the Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. The proposed application for a 
DCO will therefore be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES). The ES will provide a 
detailed description of the Project and its environmental impacts.  
 
6. Information so far compiled about the Project's environmental impacts is contained in a 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) and a non-technical summary. These 
documents will be available to view or download free of charge from the Project website from 13 
October 2014. The website is located at the following link: www.abergellipower.co.uk

Dear Mr Sargeant, 
 
 
Re: Abergelli Power Station, on land adjacent to the National Grid compressor station at 
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea, SA5 7NN 
 
Regulation 11 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended) (the ‘EIA Regulations’) 
 
Peter Brett Associates acts for Abergelli Power Limited. 
 
Abergelli Power Limited (‘APL’) intends to apply to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate 
Change for a Development Consent Order (‘DCO’) under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (as 
amended) (‘the 2008 Act’) to authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of a gas-fired 
power station project together with its integral gas and electrical connections (the ‘Project’).  APL is 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Watt Power Limited, a company which develops gas-fired power 
station projects in the United Kingdom. 
 
The EIA Regulations require the carrying out of an Environmental Impact Assessment in relation to 
certain applications for DCOs.  All development in Schedule 1 (‘Schedule 1 development’) requires 
an EIA.  The definition of Schedule 1 development includes thermal power stations with a heat 
output of 300 MW or more.  APL therefore proposes to provide an Environmental Statement as part 
of its application for a DCO for the Project.  
 
Under section 48 of the 2008 Act and Regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009, APL is publishing a notice of the proposed 
application for a DCO for the Project in the London Gazette and The Independent on 6 October 
2014 and in the South Wales Evening Post (which circulates in the vicinity of the Project site) on 6 
October 2014 and 13 October 2014. Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations requires that APL sends 
a copy of its section 48 notice to the consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA Regulations) and to 
any person notified to the applicant in accordance with regulation 9(1)(c) of the EIA Regulations, at 
the same time as publishing its section 48 notice.  
 
Accordingly, APL hereby provides a copy of the section 48 notice (in English and Welsh) to you. A 
copy of this letter in Welsh can be made available on request.  
 
In addition, by separate letter, you will be invited to comment on the APL proposals during the 
forthcoming phase of statutory consultation.

Dear Mr Sargeant, 
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent to the National 
Grid compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended 
 
Pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, Abergelli Power Limited ("APL") must consult with 
a variety of persons about its proposals to construct and operate a gas fired power plant project on 
a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas connection and electrical 
connection (together "the Project"). The persons that APL is required to consult include certain 
prescribed bodies (such as Natural Resources Wales), local authorities within or near the Project 
site, those with an interest in the land affected by the Project (such as owners, tenants and 
occupiers), and those who may be able to bring a claim under certain land compensation 
legislation for the construction or use of the Project. 
 
For the purposes of this section 42 consultation, please find enclosed a copy of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report Non-Technical Summary ("NTS").  The NTS is a non-technical 
summary of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") described in part 4 of this 
letter.   Should you wish to refer to the full PEIR at any stage during consultation, a CD copy is 
enclosed (the enclosed CD also contains the NTS and the public information leaflet). For your 
further convenience, from 13 October 2014 the PEIR will also be accessible on the Project website 
www.abergellipower.co.uk and a paper copy will be available for inspection at deposit locations. 
Details are provided in part 7 of this letter.   
 
In this letter we have set out an overview of the Project, the applicant APL, the need for gas fired 
power generation, the planning regime under the Planning Act 2008, and how you can respond to 
this consultation.  For more detail about the Project and its potential likely significant environmental 
effects please refer to the NTS enclosed with this letter. The relevant sections of the NTS have 
been listed for your information.  
 
Abergelli Power Limited welcomes your comments on the Project, as set out in this letter and in the 
NTS.  Part 6 of this letter contains details on how you should respond.  This consultation will close 
at 5pm on 16 November 2014 and we therefore invite responses on or before this date.  Following 
this consultation period and receipt of consultee responses, Abergelli Power Limited will have 
regard to comments received in the final design of the Project, and in the assessment and 
mitigation of its potential environmental impacts.   
 
1 Introduction 
APL proposes to develop the Project on a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  It is 
proposed that the power generation plant would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means that it 
Address
 
 
 
 
would have an intermittent operating regime (up to 1,500 hours per year), designed to provide 
back-up generation capacity to respond quickly and efficiently to both short-term variation in 
customer demand and intermittent output from renewable power generation. 
 
Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power plant could enter commercial 
operation in 2020.  
 
1.1 The Applicant 
APL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power is seeking to 
develop gas fired generation assets at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK 
Government drive to a low carbon economy. 
 
For more information, please refer to the NTS Section 1.4 The Applicant. 
 
1.2 Development Consent Order  
The Project requires a development consent order ("DCO") under the Planning Act 2008. This is 
because the generating capacity of the Project will be more than 50 MW and therefore falls within 
the definition of a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the 
Planning Act 2008.  Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by a DCO.  The DCO 
will permit the construction, operation and maintenance of the Project. The examining authority for 
DCO applications is not the Local Planning Authority but the Planning Inspectorate.  DCO 
applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning Inspectorate which will process and examine 
the application before making a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate 
Change ("SoS").  The final decision on the application is made by the SoS. APL's application is 
likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
 
2 The Project 
The Project, for which a DCO is sought, consists of three integral main elements. 
 
1) A Power Generation Plant; a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power generation plant consisting 
of up to five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical 
output of between 50 and 299 megawatts (MW). The power plant will have up to 5 stacks, 
which will be up to 40m in height. The Power Generation Plant will also include a new 
access road from either the Rhyd-y-pandy Road to the north or the B4489 to the west (the 
"Access Road") and temporary construction compound (the "Laydown Area"). 
2) A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the existing high pressure gas National Transmission System in the vicinity of the site.  
3) A new underground Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power Generation 
Plant to the existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.   
For more information see NTS Sections 5.3 Power Generation Plant, 5.5 Electrical Connection, 
and 5.6 Gas Connection. 
 
3 The Need for Gas Generation 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out in 
National Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the 
relevant Energy NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure) and EN-4 (Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines). EN-1 (paragraph 
3.6.2) states that  
 
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility 
to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of 
supply.” 
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas 
provides back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is 
 
 
 
 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent form of energy. As mentioned above, the Project will be 
designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not “always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to 
short-term variations in customer demand and intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind 
power.  
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs referred to above and is not an issue for 
consultation.  Please refer to NTS Section 1.5 Need and Benefits of the Project for discussion 
about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 Environmental Information and Likely Significant Effects 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment ("EIA") as the Project is classified as ‘EIA development’ under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. The EIA is considering the likely 
significant effects of the Project including air quality, noise and vibration, ecology, water resources, 
geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, landscape and visual impact, waste management 
and health, traffic, transport and access, cultural heritage and archaeology, socio-economics and 
cumulative effects with other reasonably foreseeable projects in the area.  
 
The PEIR presents the information gathered to date and provides the preliminary findings of APL’s 
assessments as to the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The PEIR does not set out the final findings, but does include 
information on the preliminary mitigation measures proposed.  As part of our statutory consultation 
under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, please find enclosed a copy of the NTS of the full 
PEIR, which presents a summary of the information in the PEIR.

5 Options for the Project 
At this stage the Project design has yet to be finalised. Indeed, the design that will form the basis 
of the DCO application will not be a final detailed design but rather it will be a "Rochdale" envelope 
within which the Project can be constructed (please see Advice Note 9 on the Planning 
Inspectorate's 
website 
at 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2013/05/Advice-note-9.-Rochdale-envelope-web.pdf). 
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant  
The site for the Power Generation Plant is on land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea and 
covers an area of approximately 6ha. The Power Generation Plant includes the Generating 
Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area. Figure 2.1 in the NTS shows the areas within which 
these elements would be located. The position of the Power Generation Plant will be finalised after 
this consultation exercise has closed having regard to the responses received and the further 
environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your views on this would be welcome. 
 
There are also two options for the Access Road.  A decision on the options described will be 
informed by consultation feedback as well as additional environmental and technical studies being 
undertaken. Your views on this would be welcome. 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2 Gas Connection 
An indicative route option for the Gas Connection is shown on Fig 2.1 in the NTS.  The connection, 
in the form of a new underground pipeline up to 1.4km in length, would bring natural gas to the 
Power Generation Plant from the National Transmission System. Your views on this would be 
welcome.   
 
5.3 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage in the Project's development, the DCO may seek the compulsory acquisition of land 
and rights over land, including rights to use land, for the Project together with temporary 
possession of land during the construction and commissioning periods. APL is in discussions with 
those persons affected and is keen to reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior 
to submission of the DCO application.   
 
6 Consultation  
Consultation with the local community, businesses, and organisations is an important part of the 
DCO process and will help to inform the final design of the Project.  
 
In June 2014, APL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Clydach, 
Felindre and Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments 
on its plans.  
 
APL has also briefed the Planning Inspectorate, City and County of Swansea Council, the local 
Members of Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly, Welsh Government Ministers, local 
community councils and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the 
vicinity of the proposed site. Written notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was 
issued to community council clerks and all residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project 
Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural 
Resources Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  
Our request for a Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, 
accompanied by a Scoping Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 
August 2014.  
 
Since initial stages of consultation, the project design has evolved in the light of comments 
received during the non-statutory consultation stage, the Scoping Opinion and statutory 
consultees.  The significant design changes which have occurred since the previous round of 
consultation comprise: a refinement and confirmation of the routes for both the Gas and Electrical 
Connections; a reduction in the application area; and a reduction in the maximum height of the 
stacks from a maximum of 60m to 40m. 
 
The information within the NTS describes the Project, as well as the preliminary findings of the 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  We wish to seek your 
views about the Project including the preliminary findings of our assessment work, as described in 
the NTS, and the Project Access Road options summarised above. 
 
Alongside this statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, APL is carrying out 
statutory consultation under section 47 of the Planning Act. APL has written to approximately 
14,000 residents, businesses and institutions in the vicinity of the Project outlining the Project and 
inviting their views. Four exhibitions will be held 22 – 25 October allowing those who live in the 
vicinity of the Project, or those groups and organisations who may have a view on the Project, to 
find out more information and provide APL with any comments they may have.

Annwyl Mr Sargeant, 
 
Abergelli Power Cyfyngedig: prosiect gwaith pŵer arfaethedig sy’n rhedeg ar nwy ar dir gerllaw 
gorsaf gywasgu’r Grid Cenedlaethol ar Fferm Abergelli, Felindre, Abertawe SA5 7NN 
 
Ymgynghoriad statudol o dan Adran 42 Deddf Gynllunio 2008, fel y’i diwygiwyd 
 
Yn unol ag adran 42 Deddf Gynllunio 2008, mae’n rhaid i Abergelli Power Cyfyngedig ("APL") 
ymgynghori ag amrywiaeth o bersonau ynglŷn â’u cynigion i adeiladu a gweithredu prosiect gwaith 
pŵer sy’n rhedeg ar nwy ar safle ar Fferm Abergelli, Felindre, Abertawe, ynghyd â chysylltiad nwy 
a chysylltiad trydanol annatod (gyda’i gilydd, "y Prosiect").  Mae’r personau y mae’n ofynnol i APL 
ymgynghori â hwy yn cynnwys rhai cyrff rhagnodedig neilltuol (megis Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru), 
awdurdodau lleol o fewn neu ger safle’r Prosiect, y rheiny sydd â buddiant yn y tir yr effeithir arno 
gan y Prosiect (megis perchnogion, tenantiaid a deiliaid), a’r rheiny a all ddod â hawliad o dan rai 
deddfwriaethau iawndal tir neilltuol o ran adeiladu neu ddefnyddio’r Prosiect.   
 
Er dibenion yr ymgynghoriad adran 42 hwn, a fyddech cystal â chanfod copi’n amgaeedig o 
Grynodeb Annhechnegol (“NTS”) yr Adroddiad Gwybodaeth Amgylcheddol Rhagarweiniol.  Mae’r 
Crynodeb Annhechnegol yn grynodeb annhechnegol o’r Adroddiad Gwybodaeth Amgylcheddol 
Rhagarweiniol ("PEIR") a ddisgrifir yn rhan 4 y llythyr hwn.  Petaech yn dymuno cyfeirio at y PEIR 
llawn ar unrhyw adeg yn ystod y gwaith adeiladu, amgaeir copi Cryno Ddisg (mae’r Cryno Ddisg 
amgaeedig hefyd yn cynnwys y Crynodeb Annhechnegol a’r daflen wybodaeth i’r cyhoedd).  Er 
hwylustod pellach ichi, o’r 13eg o Hydref, 2014, bydd y PEIR hefyd yn hygyrch ar wefan y Prosiect 
www.abergellipower.co.uk a bydd copi papur ar gael i’w archwilio mewn lleoliadau adneuo.  
Darperir manylion yn rhan 7 y llythyr hwn.   
 
Yn y llythyr hwn, rydym wedi amlinellu trosolwg ar y Prosiect, yr ymgeisydd APL, yr angen i 
gynhyrchu pŵer sy’n rhedeg ar nwy, y gyfundrefn gynllunio o dan Ddeddf Gynllunio 2008, a sut y 
gallwch ymateb i’r ymgynghoriad hwn.  I gael mwy o fanylion am y Prosiect a’i effeithiau 
amgylcheddol arwyddocaol tebygol posib’, cyfeiriwch, os gwelwch yn dda, at y Crynodeb 
Annhechnegol a amgaeir â’r llythyr hwn.  Mae adrannau perthnasol y Crynodeb Annhechnegol 
wedi’u rhestru er eich gwybodaeth.  
 
Mae Abergelli Power Cyfyngedig yn croesawu’ch sylwadau ar y Prosiect, fel a amlinellir yn y llythyr 
hwn ac yn y Crynodeb Annhechnegol.  Mae Rhan 6 y llythyr hwn yn cynnwys manylion ynglŷn â 
sut y dylech ymateb.  Bydd yr ymgynghoriad hwn yn cau am 5.00yp ar yr 16eg o Dachwedd, 2014 
ac rydym felly’n gwahodd ymatebion erbyn neu cyn y dyddiad hwn.  Ar ôl y cyfnod ymgynghori 
hwn ac ar ôl iddynt dderbyn ymatebion ymgyngoreion, bydd Abergelli Power Cyfyngedig yn 
ystyried sylwadau a dderbyniwyd yn ystod dyluniad terfynol y Prosiect, ac o ran asesu a lliniaru’i 
effeithiau amgylcheddol posib’.   
 
1 Rhagymadrodd 
Mae APL yn cynnig datblygu’r Prosiect ar safle ar Fferm Abergelli, Felindre, Abertawe.  Cynigir y 
byddai’r gwaith cynhyrchu pŵer yn gweithredu fel ‘gwaith brigo’.  Golyga hyn y byddai ganddo 
Address
 
 
 
 
gyfundrefn weithredu ysbeidiol (hyd at 1,500 o oriau’r flwyddyn), a gynlluniwyd i ddarparu capasiti 
cynhyrchu wrth gefn i ymateb yn gyflym ac yn effeithlon i amrywiad byrdymor yn y galw gan 
gwsmeriaid a’r allbwn ysbeidiol oddi wrth bŵer adnewyddadwy a gynhyrchid. 
 
Yn amodol ar ymgynghori â’r cyhoedd, cynllunio ac ariannu, gall y gwaith pŵer ddechrau 
gweithredu’n fasnachol yn 2020. 
 
1.1 Yr Ymgeisydd 
Sefydlwyd APL gan Watt Power Limited i ddatblygu’r Prosiect.  Mae Watt Power yn dymuno 
datblygu asedau cynhyrchu sy’n rhedeg ar nwy ar Fferm Abergelli a mannau eraill yn y Deyrnas 
Unedig i gefnogi ymgyrch Llywodraeth y DU i gael economi carbon isel. 
 
I gael mwy o wybodaeth, cyfeiriwch, os gwelwch yn dda, at  y Crynodeb Annhechnegol Adran 1.4 
Yr Ymgeisydd. 
 
1.2 Gorchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu   
Mae’n ofynnol i’r Prosiect gael gorchymyn caniatâd datblygu ("DCO") o dan Ddeddf Gynllunio 
2008.  Y rheswm am hyn yw y bydd capasiti cynhyrchu’r Prosiect yn fwy na 50 megawat ac mae 
felly’n dod o fewn diffiniad Prosiect Seilwaith Cenedlaethol ei Arwyddocâd ("NSIP") o dan Adran 
15(2)(c) Deddf Gynllunio 2008.  Gellir ond rhoi caniatâd datblygu ar gyfer Prosiect Seilwaith 
Cenedlaethol ei Arwyddocâd gan Orchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu.  Bydd y Gorchymyn Caniatâd 
Datblygu’n caniatáu adeiladu, gweithredu a chynnal a chadw’r Prosiect.  Nid yr Awdurdod 
Cynllunio Lleol yw’r awdurdod archwilio ar gyfer ceisiadau am Orchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu ond yr 
Arolygiaeth Gynllunio.  Cyflwynir y ceisiadau am Orchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu ar gyfer Prosiectau 
Seilwaith Cenedlaethol eu Harwyddocâd i’r Arolygiaeth Gynllunio fydd yn prosesu ac yn archwilio’r 
cais cyn gwneud argymhelliad i’r Ysgrifennydd Gwladol dros Ynni a Newid Hinsawdd ("SoS").  
Gwneir y penderfyniad terfynol ar y cais gan yr Ysgrifennydd Gwladol.  Mae’n debygol y cyflwynir 
cais APL yn chwarter cyntaf 2015.  
 
2 Y Prosiect 
Mae’r Prosiect, y ceisir Gorchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu amdano, yn cynnwys tair prif elfen annatod. 
 
1) Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer; gwaith cynhyrchu pŵer Tyrbin Nwy Cylch Syml sy’n cynnwys 
hyd at bum generadur tyrbin nwy ("GTG") sy’n defnyddio tanwydd nwy naturiol sydd â 
chyfradd allbwn trydanol o rhwng 50 a 299 megawat (MW).  Bydd gan y gwaith pŵer hyd at 
5 simnai, fydd hyd at 40 metr o uchder.  Bydd y Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer hefyd yn cynnwys 
ffordd fynediad newydd o naill ai Heol Rhyd-y-pandy i’r gogledd neu’r B4489 i’r gorllewin (y 
"Ffordd Fynediad") ac adeilad o fewn amgaefa adeiladu dros dro (y "Man wedi’i Glirio ar 
gyfer Storio Cyfarpar Dros Dro"). 
2) Cysylltiad Nwy tanddaearol newydd i ddod â nwy naturiol i’r Gwaith Cynhyrchu Nwy o’r 
System Drawsyrru Genedlaethol nwy gwasgedd uchel bresennol yng nghyffiniau’r safle.    
3) Cysylltiad Trydanol tanddaearol newydd i drosglwyddo trydan o’r Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer 
i Is-orsaf bresennol 400kV Gogledd Abertawe sydd gerllaw.   
I gael mwy o wybodaeth, gweler y Crynodeb Annhechnegol Adrannau 5.3 Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer 
a Thechnoleg Cynhyrchu, 5.5 Cysylltiad Trydanol, a 5.6 Cysylltiad Nwy. 
 
3 Yr Angen i Gynhyrchu Nwy  
Caiff polisïau’r Llywodraeth yn gysylltiedig â Phrosiectau Seilwaith Cenedlaethol eu Harwyddocâd 
eu hamlinellu mewn Datganiadau Polisi Cenedlaethol (NPSs). Datblygwyd y Prosiect arfaethedig 
gan roi ystyriaeth i’r Datganiadau Polisi Cenedlaethol perthnasol ar Ynni, yn enwedig EN-1 (Ynni), 
EN-2 (Seilwaith Cynhyrchu Trydan o Danwydd Ffosil) ac EN-4 (Seilwaith Cyflenwi Nwy a 
Phiblinellau Nwy ac Olew).  Mae EN-1 (paragraff 3.6.2) yn datgan y:  
 
“Bydd nwy’n parhau i fod â rôl bwysig yn y sector trydan – gan ddarparu hyblygrwydd 
hanfodol i ategu cyfaint cynyddol o gynhyrchu carbon isel ac i gynnal sicrwydd cyflenwad.”    
 
 
 
 
 
Mae nwy’n ffynhonnell ddibynadwy o danwydd.  Fel a nodir uchod, cydnabyddir gan y Llywodraeth 
ei fod yn hanfodol i economi carbon isel ac i danategu sicrwydd ynni’r wlad.  Yn ychwanegol, mae 
nwy’n darparu ynni wrth gefn i’r pŵer a gynhyrchir o ffynonellau adnewyddadwy, yn enwedig pŵer 
gwynt, sy’n ffurf o ynni sy’n gynyddol gyffredin ond ysbeidiol.  Fel a grybwyllir uchod, cynllunnir y 
Prosiect i weithredu’n hyblyg (hynny yw, nid “bob amser ar waith”) fel y gall ymateb yn gyflym ac 
yn effeithlon i amrywiadau byrdymor yn y galw gan gwsmeriaid ac allbwn ysbeidiol oddi wrth bŵer 
gwynt atraeth ac alltraeth. 
 
Mae’r angen am y Prosiect yn cael ei gadarnhau trwy’r Datganiadau Polisi Cenedlaethol y cyfeirir 
atynt uchod ac nid yw’n fater ar gyfer ymgynghori.  Cyfeiriwch, os gwelwch yn dda, at Crynodeb 
Annhechnegol Adran 1.5 Yr Angen am a Buddion y Prosiect am y drafodaeth ynghylch yr angen 
am brosiectau cynhyrchu nwy. 
 
4 Gwybodaeth Amgylcheddol ac Effeithiau Arwyddocaol Tebygol  
Oherwydd natur a maint y Prosiect, mae APL yn cynnal Asesiad o’r Effaith Amgylcheddol ("EIA") 
gan fod y Prosiect wedi’i gategoreiddio fel ‘datblygiad EIA’ o dan Reoliadau Cynllunio Seilwaith 
(Asesiad o’r Effaith Amgylcheddol) 2009.  Mae’r Asesiad o’r Effaith Amgylcheddol yn ystyried 
effeithiau arwyddocaol tebygol y Prosiect, yn cynnwys ansawdd yr aer, sŵn a dirgryniad, ecoleg, 
adnoddau dŵr, daeareg, cyflwr y ddaear a hydroddaeareg, tirwedd ac effaith weledol, rheoli 
gwastraff ac iechyd, traffig, trafnidiaeth a mynediad, etifeddiaeth ddiwylliannol ac archeoleg, 
ffactorau cymdeithasol-economaidd ac effeithiau cronnus gyda phrosiectau gweddol ragweladwy 
eraill yn yr ardal.  
 
Mae’r PEIR yn cyflwyno’r wybodaeth a gasglwyd hyd yn hyn ac yn darparu canfyddiadau 
rhagarweiniol asesiadau APL ynghylch effeithiau amgylcheddol arwyddocaol tebygol y gwaith o 
adeiladu, gweithredu a datgomisiynu’r Prosiect.  Nid yw’r PEIR yn amlinellu’r canfyddiadau 
terfynol, ond mae yn cynnwys gwybodaeth am y camau lliniaru rhagarweiniol a gynigir.  Fel rhan 
o’n hymgynghoriad statudol o dan Adran 42 Deddf Gynllunio 2008, a fyddech cystal â chanfod

5 Opsiynau ar gyfer y Prosiect  
Ar hyn o bryd, mae dyluniad y Prosiect eto i’w gwblhau.  Yn wir, ni fydd y dyluniad a fydd yn ffurfio 
sail y cais am y Gorchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu yn ddyluniad manwl terfynol, ond yn hytrach bydd 
yn amlen "Rochdale" o fewn ble y gellir adeiladu’r Prosiect (gweler Nodyn Cyngor 9, os gwelwch 
yn dda, ar wefan yr Arolygiaeth Gynllunio yn http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-

5.1 Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer   
Mae’r safle ar gyfer y Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer ar dir ar Fferm Abergelli, Felindre, Abertawe ac 
mae’n ymestyn dros ardal sydd oddeutu 6 hectar.   Mae’r Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer yn cynnwys y 
Cyfarpar Cynhyrchu, Ffordd Fynediad a Man Storio Cyfarpar Dros Dro.  Dengys Ffigwr 2.1 yn y 
Crynodeb Annhechnegol safleoedd dangosol yr elfennau hyn o fewn y safle.Pennir y safle yn 
derfynol ar ôl i’r ymarfer ymgynghori hwn ddirwyn i ben gan roi ystyriaeth i’r ymatebion a 
 
 
 
 
dderbyniwyd a’r astudiaethau amgylcheddol a thechnegol pellach a gynhelir.  Byddai’ch barn am y 
safle dangosol yn cael ei chroesawu.     
Mae yna hefyd ddau opsiwn ar gyfer y Ffordd Fynediad.  Bydd penderfyniad ar yr opsiynau a 
ddisgrifir yn cael ei oleuo gan adborth o’r ymgynghoriad, yn ogystal ag astudiaethau amgylcheddol 
a thechnegol ychwanegol a gynhelir.  Byddai’ch barn am hyn yn cael ei chroesawu.   
 
5.2 Cysylltiad Nwy 
Dangosir yr opsiwn a ffafrir ar gyfer y llwybr ar gyfer y Cysylltiad Nwy ar Ffigwr 2.1 yn y Crynodeb 
Annhechnegol.  Byddai’r cysylltiad, fyddai ar ffurf piblinell danddaearol newydd hyd at 1.4 cilometr 
o hyd, yn dod â nwy naturiol i’r Gwaith Cynhyrchu Pŵer o’r System Drawsyrru Genedlaethol. 
Byddai’ch barn am hyn yn cael ei chroesawu.      
 
5.3 Hawliau Caffael Gorfodol  
 
Ar hyn o bryd yn natblygiad y Prosiect, gall y Gorchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu geisio sicrhau 
caffaeliad gorfodol ar dir a hawliau dros dir, yn cynnwys hawliau i ddefnyddio tir, ar gyfer y 
Prosiect, ynghyd â meddiant dros dro ar eiddo yn ystod y cyfnodau adeiladu a chomisiynu.  Mae 
APL wrthi’n trafod â’r personau hynny yr effeithir arnynt ac maent yn awyddus i gael cytundeb, ble 
y bo’n bosibl, â’r bobl hynny cyn y cyflwynir y cais am Orchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu.     
 
6 Ymgynghori  
Mae ymgynghori â’r gymuned leol, y busnesau lleol, a’r sefydliadau yn rhan bwysig o broses 
Gorchymyn Caniatâd Datblygu a bydd yn helpu i oleuo dyluniad terfynol y Prosiect.    
 
Ym mis Mehefin 2014, rhannodd APL eu cynlluniau cychwynnol am y tro cyntaf â’r cyhoedd mewn 
arddangosfeydd a gynhaliwyd yng Nghlydach, Felindre a Thircoed.  Yn yr arddangosfeydd ac ers 
hynny, mae APL wedi derbyn ac wedi ymateb i sylwadau ynghylch eu cynlluniau.  
 
Mae APL hefyd wedi briffio’r Arolygiaeth Gynllunio, Cyngor Dinas a Sir Abertawe, yr Aelodau 
Seneddol lleol ac Aelodau lleol y Cynulliad, Gweinidogion Llywodraeth Cymru, cynghorau 
cymuned lleol a Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water - sydd â gwaith trin dŵr yng nghyffiniau’r safle 
arfaethedig.  Rhoddwyd hysbysiad ysgrifenedig o flaen llaw o gyfnod cychwynnol yr ymgynghori i 
glercod cynghorau cymuned a’r holl drigolion a busnesau yng nghyffiniau Safle’r Prosiect. 
 
Yn ychwanegol, ymgynghorwyd ag amrywiol gyrff statudol, yn cynnwys Cyngor Dinas a Sir 
Abertawe, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru, Cadw a darparwyr cyfleustodau parthed cwmpas yr Asesiad o’r 
Effaith Amgylcheddol.  Derbyniwyd ein cais am Farn Gwmpasu gan yr Arolygiaeth Gynllunio ar y 
26ain o Fehefin, 2014, ynghyd ag Adroddiad Cwmpasu.  Cyhoeddwyd y Farn Gwmpasu ffurfiol oddi 
wrth yr Ysgrifennydd Gwladol ar y 1af o Awst, 2014.    
 
Ers cyfnodau cychwynnol yr ymgynghori, mae dyluniad y prosiect wedi esblygu yng ngoleuni 
sylwadau a dderbyniwyd yn ystod y cyfnod ymgynghori anstatudol, y Farn Gwmpasu a chan 
ymgyngoreion statudol.  Mae’r newidiadau sylweddol i’r dyluniad a ddigwyddodd ers y cylch 
blaenorol o ymgynghori yn cynnwys: mireinio a chadarnhau’r llwybrau ar gyfer y Cysylltiadau Nwy 
a Thrydanol; lleihau ardal y cais; a gostwng uchder mwyaf y simneiau o uchafswm o 60 metr i 40 
metr. 
 
Mae’r wybodaeth yn y Crynodeb Annhechnegol yn disgrifio’r Prosiect, yn ogystal â chanfyddiadau 
rhagarweiniol yr asesiad o effeithiau amgylcheddol arwyddocaol tebygol y Prosiect.  Dymunwn

Dear  
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent to the National Grid 
compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
We are writing in response to your letter to Abergelli Power Limited dated 30 November 2014. 
 
As you may be aware, the statutory consultation period for the Abergelli Power Project took place from 13 
October 2014 to 16 November 2014. Pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, Abergelli Power 
Limited ("APL") must consult with a variety of persons about its proposals to construct and operate a gas 
fired power plant project on a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas 
connection and integral electrical connection (together "the Project"). The persons that APL is required to 
consult include certain prescribed bodies (such as Natural Resources Wales), local authorities within or near 
the Project site, those with an interest in the land affected by the Project (such as owners, tenants and 
occupiers), and those who may be able to bring a claim under certain land compensation legislation for the 
construction or use of the Project. As a business with an interest in the land affected by the Project, we 
apologise that you did not receive the consultation material circulated to those within our core consultation 
zone during the statutory consultation period and we are grateful for the comments set out in your letter. This 
letter provides the consultation material together with a response to your comments and gives you the 
opportunity to comment on this further. 
 
For the purposes of this section 42 consultation, please find enclosed the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report Non-Technical Summary ("NTS").  The NTS is a non-technical summary of the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") described in part 4 of this letter.  Should you wish to 
refer 
to 
the 
full 
PEIR, 
this 
can 
be 
viewed 
and 
downloaded 
from 
the 
Project 
website 
www.abergellipower.co.uk. For your information, please also find enclosed the letter that was sent to other 
consultees pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008.  
 
In this letter (and in the enclosed letter) we set out an overview of the Project, the applicant (APL), the need 
for gas-fired power generation, the planning regime under the Planning Act 2008, and responses to the 
areas of concern noted in your letter dated 30 November 2014. For more detail about the Project and its 
potential likely significant environmental effects please refer to the NTS. The relevant sections of the NTS 
are listed for your information.  
 
We invite you to provide any further comments on the enclosed material by Friday 23 January 2015. We will 
have regard to comments received in the final design of the Project and in the assessment and mitigation of 
its potential environmental effects. 
 
1 
Introduction 
APL proposes to develop the Project on a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  It is proposed that the 
power generation plant would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means that it would have an intermittent 
operating regime (up to 1,500 hours per year), designed to provide back-up generation capacity to respond 
quickly and efficiently to both short-term variation in customer demand and intermittent output from 
renewable power generation. Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power plant could 
enter commercial operation in 2020.  
 
1.1 The Applicant 
 
 
 
 
APL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power is seeking to develop 
gas fired generation assets at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government drive 
to a low carbon economy. For more information, please refer to the NTS Section 1.4. 
 
1.2 Development Consent Order  
The Project requires a development consent order ("DCO") under the Planning Act 2008. This is because 
the generating capacity of the Project will be more than 50 MW and therefore falls within the definition of a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the Planning Act 2008.  
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by a DCO.  The DCO will permit the construction, 
operation and maintenance of the Project. The examining authority for DCO applications is not the Local 
Planning Authority but the Planning Inspectorate.  DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change ("SoS").  The final decision on the application is made by 
the SoS. APL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
 
2 
The Project 
The Project, for which a DCO is sought, consists of three integral main elements. 
 
1) A Power Generation Plant; a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power generation plant consisting of up to 
five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of between 
50 and 299 megawatts (MW). The power plant will have up to 5 stacks, which will be up to 40m in 
height. The Power Generation Plant will also include a new access road from either the Rhyd-y-
pandy Road to the north or the B4489 to the west (the "Access Road") and temporary construction 
compound (the "Laydown Area"). 
2) A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
existing high pressure gas National Transmission System in the vicinity of the site.  
3) A new underground Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.   
For more information see NTS Section 1.2. 
 
3 
The Need for Gas Generation 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out in National 
Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy 
NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure) and EN-4 (Gas 
Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines). EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that  
 
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to 
support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply.” 
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being essential to a 
low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas provides back-up to 
power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent form of energy. As mentioned above, the Project will be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not 
“always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variations in customer demand and 
intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind power.  
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs referred to above and is not an issue for 
consultation.  Please refer to NTS Section 1.5 for discussion about the need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 
Environmental Information and Likely Significant Effects 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") 
as the Project is classified as ‘EIA development’ under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009. The EIA is considering the likely significant effects of the Project including 
air quality, noise and vibration, ecology, water resources, geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, 
landscape and visual impact, waste management and health, traffic, transport and access, cultural heritage 
and archaeology, socio-economics and cumulative effects with other reasonably foreseeable projects in the 
area.  
 
The PEIR presents the information gathered to date and provides the preliminary findings of APL’s 
assessments as to the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The PEIR does not set out the final findings, but does include information on 
the preliminary mitigation measures proposed.  As part of our statutory consultation under Section 42 of the 
 
 
 
 
Planning Act 2008, please find enclosed a copy of the NTS of the full PEIR, which presents a summary of 
the information in the PEIR.

Options for the Project 
At this stage the Project design has yet to be finalised. Indeed, the design that will form the basis of the DCO 
application will not be a final detailed design but rather it will be a "Rochdale envelope” within which the 
Project can be constructed (please see Advice Note 9 on the Planning Inspectorate's website at 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Advice-note-9.-Rochdale-envelope-
web.pdf). 
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant  
The site for the Power Generation Plant is on land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea and covers an area 
of approximately 6ha. The Power Generation Plant includes the Generating Equipment, Access Road and 
Laydown Area. There are two options for the Access Road at this stage: 
 
1. Access from Rhyd-y-pandy Road via shared use of the existing private track to the north of Abergelli 
Farm. The potential use of the Rhyd-y-pandy Road received significant negative feedback during the 
statutory consultation period, primarily due to the potential to give rise to congestion on Rhyd-y-
pandy Road and the potential impact on users of Morriston Hospital driving via the Rhyd-y-pandy 
Road; and 
 
2. Access from the B4489 via shared use of National Grid’s existing access road, which is currently 
used by National Grid Electricity Transmission and National Grid Gas. This option would require the 
extension of National Grid’s existing road and it received a high level of positive feedback during the 
statutory consultation period. 
 
Our intention is to present one Access Road option as part of our application and our preferred option is to 
use National Grid’s existing road (Option 2 above), however this is subject to the agreement of the affected 
National Grid companies.  Your views on this would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection 
An indicative route for the Gas Connection is shown in Figure 2.1 in the NTS.  The connection, in the form of 
a new underground pipeline up to 1.4km in length, would bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System. Your views on this indicative route would be welcome.   
 
5.3 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage in the Project's development, the DCO may seek the compulsory acquisition of land and rights 
over land, including rights to use land, for the Project together with temporary possession of land during the 
construction and commissioning periods.  APL is in discussions with those persons affected and is keen to 
reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of the DCO application.   
 
6 
Consultation  
Consultation with the local community, businesses, and organisations is an important part of the DCO 
process and will help to inform the final design of the Project. 
 
 
 
 
 
In June 2014, APL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments on its plans.  
 
APL has also briefed the Planning Inspectorate, City and County of Swansea Council, the local Members of 
Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly, Welsh Government Ministers, local community councils and Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the vicinity of the proposed site. Written 
notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was issued to community council clerks and all 
residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural Resources 
Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  Our request for a 
Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping 
Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 August 2014.  
 
Since initial stages of consultation, the project design has evolved in the light of comments received during 
the non-statutory consultation stage, the Scoping Opinion and statutory consultees.  The significant design 
changes which have occurred since the previous round of consultation comprise: a refinement and 
confirmation of the routes for both the Gas and Electrical Connections; a reduction in the application area; 
and a reduction in the maximum height of the stacks from a maximum of 60m to 40m. 
 
The information within the NTS describes the Project, as well as the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  We wish to seek your views about the Project 
including the preliminary findings of our assessment work, as described in the NTS, and the Project Access 
Road options summarised above. 
 
Alongside statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, APL has carried out statutory 
consultation under section 47 of the Planning Act. APL wrote to approximately 14,000 residents, businesses 
and institutions in the vicinity of the Project outlining the Project and inviting their views. Four exhibitions 
were held between 22 and 25 October 2014 allowing those who live in the vicinity of the Project, or those 
groups and organisations who may have a view on the Project, to find out more information and provide APL 
with any comments. 
 
The following points address the specific areas of concern in your letter dated 30 November 2014. 
 
1. 
Transport and access/egress issues 
 
a. The potential traffic volume to and from the site (construction phase) 
 
Section 2.11 of the PEIR provides preliminary information on the expected peaks in traffic during the 
construction and decommissioning phases of the Project. Further information will be provided in the 
Environmental Statement. A Construction Traffic Management Plan will be agreed with CCS to manage 
construction traffic and seek to minimise congestion on the local road network. 
 
b. The potential traffic volume to and from the site (operational phase) 
 
Assuming all operational workers travel to the site in single occupancy vehicles as a worst case scenario, 
this equates to a traffic generation of an additional six vehicles on the network every eight hour shift. 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be very infrequent so are not anticipated to cause any detriment to the 
local transport network. 
 
c. Run-off from the access road off the B4489 
 
Embedded mitigation measures that will be employed as part of the construction phase will be selected by 
the main construction contractor. However, these measures will incorporate standard best practice working 
methods and will be subject to a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) which will govern 
the construction works associated with the Project for all contractors.  A draft CEMP will be included in our 
application material which is submitted to the Planning Inspectorate. 
 
d. The use of National Grid’s existing access road 
 
Based on the feedback which we have received during consultation with the public and local authorities, the 
preferred access option is to use National Grid’s access road without modifications, subject to concluding 
negotiations with National Grid. We appreciate the requirement to consult all parties who may be affected if 
any modifications are required. 
 
2. Environmental Impact Assessment 
 
 
 
 
 
a. Potential ecological impacts of the power station 
 
The Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) explains that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning phases of the proposed Project have the potential to affect the local ecology and disturb 
various sensitive species. 
 
The potential effects on ecology during the construction and decommissioning phases of the Project are 
expected to range between slight and moderate adverse and to be mostly temporary. The potential effects 
during operation, such as disturbance to protected species and habitats, are expected to range between 
slight and moderate adverse. 
 
There is potential for loss of some Ancient Woodland and non-statutory designated sites if Access Option 2 
were implemented, although we would seek to minimise the effects of this as far as reasonably practicable.   
 
Consideration would be given to the provision of new habitat to replace that which will be permanently lost 
through the development of the Project, seeking to compensate for adverse effects and potentially providing 
some benefits. 
 
b. Environmental surveys in the vicinity of the Teamforce Paintball & Activity Centre 
 
We have undertaken a wider range of environmental surveys on the site and in the wider area many of which 
are described in the PEIR.  Since the statutory consultation period we have undertaken additional ecological 
and arboricultural surveys in the vicinity of National Grid’s access road (and within the Project Site Boundary 
shown in the consultation material). The objective of these surveys has been to better understand the 
potential impacts of implementing Option 2 (subject to negotiation with National Grid).

Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent to the National Grid 
compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended 
 
Pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, Abergelli Power Limited ("APL") must consult with a variety 
of persons about its proposals to construct and operate a gas fired power plant project on a site at Abergelli 
Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas connection and integral electrical connection 
(together "the Project"). The persons that APL is required to consult include certain prescribed bodies (such 
as Natural Resources Wales), local authorities within or near the Project site, those with an interest in the 
land affected by the Project (such as owners, tenants and occupiers), and those who may be able to bring a 
claim under certain land compensation legislation for the construction or use of the Project. 
 
For the purposes of this section 42 consultation, please find enclosed a copy of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report Non-Technical Summary ("NTS").  The NTS is a non-technical summary 
of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") described in part 4 of this letter.   Should you 
wish to refer to the full PEIR at any stage during consultation, a CD copy is enclosed (the enclosed CD also 
contains the NTS and the public information leaflet). The PEIR is also accessible on the Project website 
www.abergellipower.co.uk.   
 
In this letter we have set out an overview of the Project, the applicant APL, the need for gas fired power 
generation, the planning regime under the Planning Act 2008, and how you can respond to this consultation.  
For more detail about the Project and its potential likely significant environmental effects please refer to the 
NTS enclosed with this letter. The relevant sections of the NTS have been listed for your information.  
 
Abergelli Power Limited welcomes your comments on the Project, as set out in this letter and in the NTS.  
Part 6 of this letter contains details on how you should respond. We invite you to provide any comments on 
the enclosed material by Friday 13 February 2015. We will have regard to comments received in the final 
design of the Project and in the assessment and mitigation of its potential environmental effects.  
 
1 
Introduction 
APL proposes to develop the Project on a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  It is proposed that the 
power generation plant would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means that it would have an intermittent 
operating regime (up to 1,500 hours per year), designed to provide back-up generation capacity to respond 
quickly and efficiently to both short-term variation in customer demand and intermittent output from 
renewable power generation.Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power plant could 
enter commercial operation in 2020.  
 
1.1 The Applicant 
APL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power is seeking to develop 
gas fired generation assets at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government drive 
to a low carbon economy. For more information, please refer to the NTS Section 1, 1.4 The Applicant. 
 
1.2 Development Consent Order  
The Project requires a development consent order ("DCO") under the Planning Act 2008. This is because 
the generating capacity of the Project will be more than 50 MW and therefore falls within the definition of a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the Planning Act 2008.  
 
 
 
 
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by a DCO.  The DCO will permit the construction, 
operation and maintenance of the Project. The examining authority for DCO applications is not the Local 
Planning Authority but the Planning Inspectorate.  DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change ("SoS").  The final decision on the application is made by 
the SoS. APL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
 
2 
The Project 
The Project, for which a DCO is sought, consists of three integral main elements. 
 
1) A Power Generation Plant; a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power generation plant consisting of up to 
five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas with a total rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 megawatts (MW). The power plant will have up to 5 stacks, which will be up to 
40m in height. The Power Generation Plant will also include a new access road from either the 
Rhyd-y-pandy Road to the north or the B4489 to the west (the "Access Road") and temporary 
construction compound (the "Laydown Area"). 
2) A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
existing high pressure gas National Transmission System in the vicinity of the site.  
3) A new underground Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.   
For more information see NTS Sections 5.3 Power Generation Plant and Generating Technology, 5.6 Gas 
Connection, and 5.5 Electrical Connection. 
 
3 
The Need for Gas Generation 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out in National 
Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy 
NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure) and EN-4 (Gas 
Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines). EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that  
 
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to 
support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply.” 
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being essential to a 
low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas provides back-up to 
power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent form of energy. As mentioned above, the Project will be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not 
“always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variations in customer demand and 
intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind power.  
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs referred to above and is not an issue for 
consultation.  Please refer to NTS Section 1.5 Need and Benefits of the Project for discussion about the 
need for gas generation projects. 
 
4 
Environmental Information and Likely Significant Effects 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") 
as the Project is classified as ‘EIA development’ under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009. The EIA is considering the likely significant effects of the Project including 
air quality, noise and vibration, ecology, water resources, geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, 
landscape and visual impact, waste management and health, traffic, transport and access, cultural heritage 
and archaeology, socio-economics and cumulative effects with other reasonably foreseeable projects in the 
area.  
 
The PEIR presents the information gathered to date and provides the preliminary findings of APL’s 
assessments as to the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The PEIR does not set out the final findings, but does include information on 
the preliminary mitigation measures proposed.  As part of our statutory consultation under Section 42 of the 
Planning Act 2008, please find enclosed a copy of the NTS of the full PEIR, which presents a summary of 
the information in the PEIR.

Options for the Project 
At this stage the Project design has yet to be finalised. Indeed, the design that will form the basis of the DCO 
application will not be a final detailed design but rather it will be a "Rochdale" envelope within which the 
Project can be constructed (please see Advice Note 9 on the Planning Inspectorate's website at 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Advice-note-9.-Rochdale-envelope-
web.pdf). 
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant  
The site for the Power Generation Plant is on land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea and covers an area 
of approximately 6ha. The Power Generation Plant includes the Generating Equipment, Access Road and 
Laydown Area. Figure 2.1 in NTS shows the areas in which these elements would be located Your views on 
the indicative positions of these areas would be welcome. 
 
There are also two options for the Access Road.  A decision on the options described will be informed by 
consultation feedback as well as additional environmental and technical studies being undertaken. Your 
views on this would be welcome. 
 
5.2 Gas Connection 
An indicative route for the Gas Connection is shown in Figure 2.1 in the NTS.  The connection, in the form of 
a new underground pipeline up to 1.4km in length, would bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System. Your views on this would be welcome.   
 
 
5.3 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage in the Project's development, the DCO may seek the compulsory acquisition of land and rights 
over land, including rights to use land, for the Project together with temporary possession of land during the 
construction and commissioning periods. APL is in discussions with those persons affected and is keen to 
reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of the DCO application.   
 
6 
Consultation  
Consultation with the local community, businesses, and organisations is an important part of the DCO 
process and will help to inform the final design of the Project.  
 
In June 2014, APL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments on its plans.  
 
APL has also briefed the Planning Inspectorate, City and County of Swansea Council, the local Members of 
Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly, Welsh Government Ministers, local community councils and Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the vicinity of the proposed site. Written 
notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was issued to community council clerks and all 
residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural Resources 
Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  Our request for a 
Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping 
Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 August 2014.  
 
Since initial stages of consultation, the project design has evolved in the light of comments received during 
the non-statutory consultation stage, the Scoping Opinion and statutory consultees.  The significant design 
changes which have occurred since the previous round of consultation comprise: a refinement and 
confirmation of the routes for both the Gas and Electrical Connections; a reduction in the application area; 
and a reduction in the maximum height of the stacks from a maximum of 60m to 40m. 
 
 
 
 
 
The information within the NTS describes the Project, as well as the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  We wish to seek your views about the Project 
including the preliminary findings of our assessment work, as described in the NTS, and the Project Access 
Road options summarised above. 
 
Alongside this statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, APL carried out statutory 
consultation under section 47 of the Planning Act. APL wrote to approximately 14,000 residents, businesses 
and institutions in the vicinity of the Project outlining the Project and inviting their views. Four exhibitions 
were held 22 – 25 October allowing those who live in the vicinity of the Project, or those groups and 
organisations who may have a view on the Project, to find out more information and provide APL with any 
comments they may have.

1.2 Development Consent Order  
The Project requires a development consent order ("DCO") under the Planning Act 2008. This is because 
the generating capacity of the Project will be more than 50 MW and therefore falls within the definition of a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the Planning Act 2008.  
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by a DCO.  The DCO will permit the construction,

five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas with a total rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 megawatts (MW). The power plant will have up to 5 stacks, which will be up to 
40m in height. The Power Generation Plant will also include a new access road (the “Access Road”) 
and a temporary construction compound (the "Laydown Area").  
 
As part of the statutory consultation, we proposed two alternative options for the Access Road, these 
were:  
Option 1: Access from Rhyd-y-pandy Road following the route of an existing farm road to the 
north of Abergelli Farm; or  
Option 2: Access from the B4489 using National Grid’s existing road to the Swansea North 
electrical substation and Felindre gas compressor station. This option would require the 
extension of the existing road.  
We indicated during the consultation period that Option 2 was our preferred access option and that 
we were working with National Grid to reach an agreement about the use of their road. We have 
reached a point in our negotiations with the National Grid companies where Option 1 can be 
removed and Option 2 proposed as the Access Road in our application for a Development Consent 
Order.  This is now shown in the updated application boundary for the Project (copy enclosed). 
 
2) A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
existing high pressure gas National Transmission System in the vicinity of the site.  
3) A new underground Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.

Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments on its plans.  
 
 
 
 
 
APL has also briefed the Planning Inspectorate, City and County of Swansea Council, the local Members of 
Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly, Welsh Government Ministers, local community councils and Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the vicinity of the proposed site. Written 
notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was issued to community council clerks and all 
residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural Resources 
Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  Our request for a 
Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping 
Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 August 2014.  
 
Since initial stages of non-statutory consultation, the project design has evolved in the light of comments 
received during the non-statutory consultation stage, the Scoping Opinion and statutory consultees.  The 
significant design changes which have occurred since the previous round of consultation comprise: a 
refinement and confirmation of the routes for both the Gas and Electrical Connections; a reduction in the 
application area; and a reduction in the maximum height of the stacks from a maximum of 60m to 40m. 
 
The information within the NTS describes the Project, as well as the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  We wish to seek your views about the Project 
including the preliminary findings of our assessment work, as described in the NTS, and the Access Road as 
summarised above. 
 
Alongside this statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, APL carried out statutory 
consultation under section 47 of the Planning Act. APL wrote to approximately 14,000 residents, businesses 
and institutions in the vicinity of the Project outlining the Project and inviting their views. Four exhibitions 
were held 22 – 25 October 2014 allowing those who live in the vicinity of the Project, or those groups and 
organisations who may have a view on the Project, to find out more information and provide APL with any 
comments they may have.

Dear  
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent to the National Grid 
compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended 
 
Pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, Abergelli Power Limited ("APL") must consult with a variety 
of persons about its proposals to construct and operate a gas fired power plant project on a site at Abergelli 
Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas connection and integral electrical connection 
(together "the Project"). The persons that APL is required to consult include certain prescribed bodies (such 
as Natural Resources Wales), local authorities within or near the Project site, those with an interest in the 
land affected by the Project (such as owners, tenants and occupiers), and those who may be able to bring a 
claim under certain land compensation legislation for the construction or use of the Project. 
 
For the purposes of this section 42 consultation, please find enclosed a copy of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report Non-Technical Summary ("NTS").  The NTS is a non-technical summary 
of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") described in part 4 of this letter.   Should you 
wish to refer to the full PEIR at any stage during consultation, a CD copy is enclosed (the enclosed CD also 
contains the NTS and the public information leaflet). The PEIR is also accessible on the Project website 
www.abergellipower.co.uk. 
 
In this letter we have set out an overview of the Project, the applicant APL, the need for gas fired power 
generation, the planning regime under the Planning Act 2008, and how you can respond to this consultation.  
For more detail about the Project and its potential likely significant environmental effects please refer to the 
NTS enclosed with this letter. The relevant sections of the NTS have been listed for your information.  
 
Your interest in land in the vicinity of the project was identified recently as part of a regular updating process 
carried out by our land reference team. There have been some changes to the project – primarily relating to 
the proposed access to the site – since statutory consultation was initially carried out and we published the 
PEIR and related documents which are enclosed.  A copy of the current, updated application boundary for 
the Project, taking into account the changes to the proposed access, is also enclosed. 
 
Abergelli Power Limited welcomes your comments on the Project, as set out in the following sections of this 
letter in the NTS, taking into account the updated application boundary for the Project.  Part 6 of this letter 
contains details on how you should respond. We invite you to provide any comments on the enclosed 
material by Monday 23 February 2015. We will have regard to comments received in the final design of the 
Project and in the assessment and mitigation of its potential environmental effects.

Introduction 
APL proposes to develop the Project on a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  It is proposed that the 
power generation plant would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means that it would have an intermittent 
operating regime (up to 1,500 hours per year), designed to provide back-up generation capacity to respond 
quickly and efficiently to both short-term variation in customer demand and intermittent output from 
renewable power generation.Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power plant could 
enter commercial operation in 2020.  
 
1.1 The Applicant 
 
 
 
 
APL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power is seeking to develop 
gas fired generation assets at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government drive 
to a low carbon economy. For more information, please refer to the NTS Section 1, 1.4 The Applicant. 
 
1.2 Development Consent Order  
The Project requires a development consent order ("DCO") under the Planning Act 2008. This is because 
the generating capacity of the Project will be more than 50 MW and therefore falls within the definition of a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the Planning Act 2008.  
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by a DCO.  The DCO will permit the construction, 
operation and maintenance of the Project. The examining authority for DCO applications is not the Local 
Planning Authority but the Planning Inspectorate.  DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change ("SoS").  The final decision on the application is made by 
the SoS. APL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
 
2 
The Project 
The Project, for which a DCO is sought, consists of three integral main elements. 
 
1) A Power Generation Plant; a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power generation plant consisting of up to 
five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas with a total rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 megawatts (MW). The power plant will have up to 5 stacks, which will be up to 
40m in height. The Power Generation Plant will also include a new access road (the “Access Road”) 
and a temporary construction compound (the "Laydown Area").  
 
As part of the statutory consultation, we proposed two alternative options for the Access Road, these 
were:  
Option 1: Access from Rhyd-y-pandy Road following the route of an existing farm road to the 
north of Abergelli Farm; or  
Option 2: Access from the B4489 using National Grid’s existing road to the Swansea North 
electrical substation and Felindre gas compressor station. This option would require the 
extension of the existing road.  
We indicated during the consultation period that Option 2 was our preferred access option and that 
we were working with National Grid to reach an agreement about the use of their road. We have 
reached a point in our negotiations with the National Grid companies where Option 1 can be 
removed and Option 2 proposed as the Access Road in our application for a Development Consent 
Order.  This is now shown in the updated application boundary for the Project (copy enclosed). 
 
2) A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
existing high pressure gas National Transmission System in the vicinity of the site.  
3) A new underground Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.   
For more information see NTS Sections 5.3 Power Generation Plant and Generating Technology, 5.6 Gas 
Connection, and 5.5 Electrical Connection.

The Need for Gas Generation 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out in National 
Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy 
NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure) and EN-4 (Gas 
Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines). EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that  
 
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to 
support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply.” 
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being essential to a 
low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas provides back-up to 
power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent form of energy. As mentioned above, the Project will be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not 
“always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variations in customer demand and 
intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind power.  
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs referred to above and is not an issue for 
consultation.  Please refer to NTS Section 1.5 Need and Benefits of the Project for discussion about the 
need for gas generation projects. 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
Environmental Information and Likely Significant Effects 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") 
as the Project is classified as ‘EIA development’ under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009. The EIA is considering the likely significant effects of the Project including 
air quality, noise and vibration, ecology, water resources, geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, 
landscape and visual impact, waste management and health, traffic, transport and access, cultural heritage 
and archaeology, socio-economics and cumulative effects with other reasonably foreseeable projects in the 
area.  
 
The PEIR presents the information gathered to date and provides the preliminary findings of APL’s 
assessments as to the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The PEIR does not set out the final findings, but does include information on 
the preliminary mitigation measures proposed.  As part of our statutory consultation under Section 42 of the 
Planning Act 2008, please find enclosed a copy of the NTS of the full PEIR, which presents a summary of 
the information in the PEIR.

Options for the Project 
At this stage the Project design has yet to be finalised. Indeed, the design that will form the basis of the DCO 
application will not be a final detailed design but rather it will be a "Rochdale" envelope within which the 
Project can be constructed (please see Advice Note 9 on the Planning Inspectorate's website at 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Advice-note-9.-Rochdale-envelope-
web.pdf). 
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant  
The site for the Power Generation Plant is on land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea and covers an area 
of approximately 6ha. The Power Generation Plant includes the Generating Equipment, Access Road and 
Laydown Area. Figure 2.1 in NTS shows the areas in which these elements would be located. Your views on 
the indicative positions of these areas would be welcome, taking into account the removal of Access Road 
Option 1, as summarised above.  
 
5.2 Gas Connection 
An indicative route for the Gas Connection is shown in Figure 2.1 in the NTS.  The connection, in the form of 
a new underground pipeline up to 1.4km in length, would bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System. Your views on this would be welcome.   
 
5.3 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage in the Project's development, the DCO may seek the compulsory acquisition of land and rights 
over land, including rights to use land, for the Project together with temporary possession of land during the 
construction and commissioning periods. APL is in discussions with those persons affected and is keen to 
reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of the DCO application.   
 
6 
Consultation  
Consultation with the local community, businesses, and organisations is an important part of the DCO 
process and will help to inform the final design of the Project.  
 
In June 2014, APL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments on its plans.  
 
 
 
 
 
APL has also briefed the Planning Inspectorate, City and County of Swansea Council, the local Members of 
Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly, Welsh Government Ministers, local community councils and Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the vicinity of the proposed site. Written 
notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was issued to community council clerks and all 
residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural Resources 
Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  Our request for a 
Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping 
Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 August 2014.  
 
Since initial stages of non-statutory consultation, the project design has evolved in the light of comments

Consultation with the local community, businesses, and organisations is an important part of the DCO 
process and will help to inform the final design of the Project.  
 
In June 2014, APL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments on its plans.  
 
 
 
 
 
APL has also briefed the Planning Inspectorate, City and County of Swansea Council, the local Members of 
Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly, Welsh Government Ministers, local community councils and Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the vicinity of the proposed site. Written 
notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was issued to community council clerks and all 
residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural Resources 
Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  Our request for a 
Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping 
Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 August 2014.  
 
Since initial stages of non-statutory consultation, the project design has evolved in the light of comments 
received during the non-statutory consultation stage, the Scoping Opinion and statutory consultees.  The 
significant design changes which have occurred since the previous round of consultation comprise: a 
refinement and confirmation of the routes for both the Gas and Electrical Connections; a reduction in the 
application area; and a reduction in the maximum height of the stacks from a maximum of 60m to 40m. 
 
The information within the NTS describes the Project, as well as the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  We wish to seek your views about the Project 
including the preliminary findings of our assessment work, as described in the NTS, and the Access Road as 
summarised above. 
 
Alongside this statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, APL carried out statutory 
consultation under section 47 of the Planning Act. APL wrote to approximately 14,000 residents, businesses 
and institutions in the vicinity of the Project outlining the Project and inviting their views. Four exhibitions 
were held 22 – 25 October 2014 allowing those who live in the vicinity of the Project, or those groups and 
organisations who may have a view on the Project, to find out more information and provide APL with any 
comments they may have.

Dear  
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent to the National Grid 
compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended 
 
Pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, Abergelli Power Limited ("APL") must consult with a variety 
of persons about its proposals to construct and operate a gas fired power plant project on a site at Abergelli 
Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas connection and integral electrical connection 
(together "the Project"). The persons that APL is required to consult include certain prescribed bodies (such 
as Natural Resources Wales), local authorities within or near the Project site, those with an interest in the 
land affected by the Project (such as owners, tenants and occupiers), and those who may be able to bring a 
claim under certain land compensation legislation for the construction or use of the Project. 
 
For the purposes of this section 42 consultation, please find enclosed a copy of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report Non-Technical Summary ("NTS").  The NTS is a non-technical summary 
of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report ("PEIR") described in part 4 of this letter.   Should you 
wish to refer to the full PEIR at any stage during consultation, a CD copy is enclosed (the enclosed CD also 
contains the NTS and the public information leaflet). The PEIR is also accessible on the Project website 
www.abergellipower.co.uk. 
 
In this letter we have set out an overview of the Project, the applicant APL, the need for gas fired power 
generation, the planning regime under the Planning Act 2008, and how you can respond to this consultation.  
For more detail about the Project and its potential likely significant environmental effects please refer to the 
NTS enclosed with this letter. The relevant sections of the NTS have been listed for your information.  
 
Your interest in land in the vicinity of the Project was identified recently following enquiries undertaken by the 
project team. There have been some changes to the Project – primarily relating to the proposed access to 
the site – since statutory consultation was initially carried out and we published the PEIR and related 
documents which are enclosed.  A copy of the current, updated application boundary for the Project, taking 
into account the changes to the proposed access, is also enclosed. 
 
Abergelli Power Limited welcomes your comments on the Project, as set out in the following sections of this 
letter in the NTS, taking into account the updated application boundary for the Project.  Part 6 of this letter 
contains details on how you should respond. We invite you to provide any comments on the enclosed 
material by Wednesday 11 March 2015. We will have regard to comments received in the final design of the 
Project and in the assessment and mitigation of its potential environmental effects.

Introduction 
APL proposes to develop the Project on a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  It is proposed that the 
power generation plant would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means that it would have an intermittent 
operating regime (up to 1,500 hours per year), designed to provide back-up generation capacity to respond 
quickly and efficiently to both short-term variation in customer demand and intermittent output from 
renewable power generation. Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power plant could 
enter commercial operation in 2020.  
 
 
 
 
1.1 The Applicant 
 
 
 
 
APL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power is seeking to develop 
gas fired generation assets at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government drive 
to a low carbon economy. For more information, please refer to the NTS Section 1, 1.4 The Applicant. 
 
1.2 Development Consent Order  
The Project requires a development consent order ("DCO") under the Planning Act 2008. This is because 
the generating capacity of the Project will be more than 50 MW and therefore falls within the definition of a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project ("NSIP") under Section 15(2)(c) of the Planning Act 2008.  
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by a DCO.  The DCO will permit the construction, 
operation and maintenance of the Project. The examining authority for DCO applications is not the Local 
Planning Authority but the Planning Inspectorate.  DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change ("SoS").  The final decision on the application is made by 
the SoS. APL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
 
2 
The Project 
The Project, for which a DCO is sought, consists of three integral main elements. 
 
1) A Power Generation Plant; a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power generation plant consisting of up to 
five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas with a total rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 megawatts (MW). The power plant will have up to 5 stacks, which will be up to 
40m in height. The Power Generation Plant will also include a new access road (the “Access Road”) 
and a temporary construction compound (the "Laydown Area").  
 
As part of the statutory consultation, we proposed two alternative options for the Access Road, these 
were:  
Option 1: Access from Rhyd-y-pandy Road following the route of an existing farm road to the 
north of Abergelli Farm; or  
Option 2: Access from the B4489 using National Grid’s existing road to the Swansea North 
electrical substation and Felindre gas compressor station. This option would require the 
extension of the existing road.  
We indicated during the consultation period that Option 2 was our preferred access option and that 
we were working with National Grid to reach an agreement about the use of their road. We have 
reached a point in our negotiations with the National Grid companies where Option 1 can be 
removed and Option 2 proposed as the Access Road in our application for a Development Consent 
Order.  This is now shown in the updated application boundary for the Project (copy enclosed). 
 
2) A new underground Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
existing high pressure gas National Transmission System in the vicinity of the site.  
3) A new underground Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing nearby 400kV Swansea North Substation.   
For more information see NTS Sections 5.3 Power Generation Plant and Generating Technology, 5.6 Gas 
Connection, and 5.5 Electrical Connection.

The Need for Gas Generation 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out in National 
Policy Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the relevant Energy 
NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure) and EN-4 (Gas 
Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines). EN-1 (paragraph 3.6.2) states that  
 
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to 
support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply.” 
 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. As noted above, it is acknowledged by the Government as being essential to a 
low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. In addition, gas provides back-up to 
power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent form of energy. As mentioned above, the Project will be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not 
“always on”) so that it can respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variations in customer demand and 
intermittent output from onshore and offshore wind power.  
 
The need for the Project is established through the NPSs referred to above and is not an issue for 
consultation.  Please refer to NTS Section 1.5 Need and Benefits of the Project for discussion about the 
need for gas generation projects. 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
Environmental Information and Likely Significant Effects 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") 
as the Project is classified as ‘EIA development’ under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009. The EIA is considering the likely significant effects of the Project including 
air quality, noise and vibration, ecology, water resources, geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, 
landscape and visual impact, waste management and health, traffic, transport and access, cultural heritage 
and archaeology, socio-economics and cumulative effects with other reasonably foreseeable projects in the 
area.  
 
The PEIR presents the information gathered to date and provides the preliminary findings of APL’s 
assessments as to the likely significant environmental effects of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The PEIR does not set out the final findings, but does include information on 
the preliminary mitigation measures proposed.  As part of our statutory consultation under Section 42 of the 
Planning Act 2008, please find enclosed a copy of the NTS of the full PEIR, which presents a summary of 
the information in the PEIR.

Options for the Project 
At this stage the Project design has yet to be finalised. Indeed, the design that will form the basis of the DCO 
application will not be a final detailed design but rather it will be a "Rochdale" envelope within which the 
Project can be constructed (please see Advice Note 9 on the Planning Inspectorate's website at 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Advice-note-9.-Rochdale-envelope-
web.pdf). 
 
5.1 Power Generation Plant  
The site for the Power Generation Plant is on land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea and covers an area 
of approximately 6ha. The Power Generation Plant includes the Generating Equipment, Access Road and 
Laydown Area. Figure 2.1 in NTS shows the areas in which these elements would be located. Your views on 
the indicative positions of these areas would be welcome, taking into account the removal of Access Road 
Option 1, as summarised above.  
 
5.2 Gas Connection 
An indicative route for the Gas Connection is shown in Figure 2.1 in the NTS.  The connection, in the form of 
a new underground pipeline up to 1.4km in length, would bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System. Your views on this would be welcome.   
 
5.3 Compulsory Acquisition Rights 
 
At this stage in the Project's development, the DCO may seek the compulsory acquisition of land and rights 
over land, including rights to use land, for the Project together with temporary possession of land during the 
construction and commissioning periods. APL is in discussions with those persons affected and is keen to 
reach agreement, where possible, with those persons prior to submission of the DCO application.

Consultation  
Consultation with the local community, businesses, and organisations is an important part of the DCO 
process and will help to inform the final design of the Project.  
 
In June 2014, APL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed. At the exhibitions and since, APL has received and responded to comments on its plans.

Cymru Welsh Water – who have a water treatment works in the vicinity of the proposed site. Written 
notification in advance of the initial phase of consultation was issued to community council clerks and all 
residents and businesses in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
 
In addition, various statutory bodies including the City and County of Swansea Council, Natural Resources 
Wales, Cadw and utility providers have been consulted regarding the scope of the EIA.  Our request for a 
Scoping Opinion was received by the Planning Inspectorate on 26 June 2014, accompanied by a Scoping 
Report. The formal Scoping Opinion from the SoS was issued on 1 August 2014.

S4C News Item on Abergelli Power Limited, 13/10/14 – Transcript  
The News Presenter:  “A public consultation has begun to discuss plans for a gas power 
station worth £200 million on a farm in Felindre near Swansea.  According to Abergelli 
Power Company, the power station will produce almost 300 megawatt of electricity, enough 
to supply up to 400,000 homes, but there is a mixed response to the plans.”   
 
Iolo James reports:  “With electricity sub-station pylons and gas and water pipes, this part of 
north Swansea County, according to some, is the ideal place to build a gas power station.  
This is exactly the intention of Abergelli Power Company on this site near Felindre.  From 
today, there will be an opportunity for local residents and businesses to learn more and to 
give their views on the scheme worth £200 million.  Abergelli farmland is behind me here, 
and according to the plans, the station will cover an area of 8 acres, providing a back-up 
supply for renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, by producing 299 
megawatts of electricity, enough to supply up to 400,000 homes at peak demand. 
 
“This [image of the station] is what local people may expect if the station is built.  There is a 
promise of jobs, too.  150 during the construction phase and 15 permanent jobs.  But, 
according to some who are campaigning for the use of renewable energy, it’s an 
unnecessary scheme.” 
 
Gareth Clubb, Director – Friends of the Earth: “Any power station will cause greenhouse 
gases.  They (the gases) will be going out into the atmosphere.  And there will also be 
nitrogen dioxide – that will be going out (into the atmosphere), and that can be harmful to the 
health of people in the area of Swansea.  It’s not going to be clean energy for the area of 
Swansea.  It will cause pollution in the long run, and again we say that this is a wholly 
unnecessary investment and development.” 
 
Reporter Iolo James: “According to Abergelli Power, the rules in relation to the industry are 
strict.” 
 
Spokesman for Abergelli Power, Reece Emmitt: “This sort of industry is very highly 
regulated – to operate we’ll need an Environmental Permit that we’ll agree with Natural 
Resources Wales. The important thing to remember is that gas is one of the cleaner burning 
fossil fuels, and all that we will be emitting to air is very similar to what comes out of the side 
of your house if you’ve got gas central heating or a gas boiler.”  
 
Reporter Iolo James: “Even though a number of local people don’t want to speak on 
camera, some of Felindre’s residents told me that they are looking forward to the 
consultation process, a process that comes to an end in mid-November.”
