Executive Summary 
1.1 
Overview of the Project and the Application 
 
The Applicant for the Project is Abergelli Power Limited (APL), a company 
registered in England and Wales (Company Number 08190497) and a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Drax Group PLC (incorporated in England and Wales 
with number 05562053) (Drax), the ultimate holding company for the Drax 
group of companies. Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt 
Power) in 2016.  
 
APL proposes to construct, operate and maintain an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station (the Power Generation Plant) and 
new connections to the gas and electricity networks on land adjacent to the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea, SA5 
7NN (the Project).   
 
The Project is located on open agricultural land approximately 2 km north of 
Junction 46 on the M4, approximately 3 km north of the city of Swansea, 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be 
required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as 
the Order Land.   
 
As the generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant will exceed 50MWe 
it is classed as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the 
Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (PA 2008).  As such, APL is applying to the 
Secretary of State (SoS) for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) 
under section 31 of the PA 2008 for a Development Consent Order (DCO) 
for powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant 
(the Application).  The extent of the works for which Development Consent is 
sought (together with relevant limits of deviation) is referred to as the Order 
Limits.  In addition, APL is seeking powers of compulsory purchase in respect 
of acquisition over the Order Land, in order to facilitate the construction and 
operation of the Project.  
 
Separately, APL will seek planning permission for the Gas Connection under 
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA 1990) and the Electrical 
Connection under either the TCPA 1990 or as permitted development under 
the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 
1995 (GPDO). 
 
The Planning Statement acts as the primary reference document for an 
explanation of the planning issues pertinent to the Application. It forms part 
of the suite of documents accompanying the Application submitted in 
accordance with section 55 of the PA 2008 and Regulation 5 of the APFP 
Regulations.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

1.2 
Relevant Legislative and Policy Framework 
 
Section 104(2) of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on DCO 
applications, the SoS must (inter alia) have regard to any relevant National 
Policy Statement (NPS).   
 
As set out in NPS EN-1, “this National Policy Statement, when combined with 
the relevant technology-specific energy National Policy Statements, provides 
the primary basis for decisions” (paragraph 1.1.1) and that the SoS “should 
start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for 
energy Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects” (paragraph 4.1.2). The 
relevant NPSs in the context of the Project are: 
• NPS EN-1 – The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy  
• NPS EN-2 – National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure  
• NPS EN-4 – National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
(of relevance in respect of the assessment of the Gas Connection 
only and not directly applicable to the Power Generation Plant to 
which the DCO Application relates)  
• NPS EN-5 – National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure (of relevance in respect of the assessment and 
consideration of alternatives for the Electricity Connection only and 
not directly applicable to the Power Generation Plant to which the 
DCO Application relates) 
 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important 
and relevant to the [SoS’] decision”. Relevant UK, Welsh and adopted and 
emerging local development plan policies and evidence that may assist the 
SoS’ decision making is set out within section 5 of this Planning Statement. 
 
Section 104(3) provides that the SoS must decide applications in accordance 
with the relevant NPS(s), unless one of a number of prescribed exceptions 
apply, which includes where the adverse impacts of the proposed 
development would outweigh its benefits (section 104(7). 
 
APL is undertaking an EIA pursuant to the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (EIA Regulations 
2009). Therefore, the project is classed as an EIA development.   
 
In accordance with section 4.2 of NPS EN-1, the Environmental Statement 
(ES) (Document Reference 6.1) considers: 
• aspects of the environment likely to be significantly affected by the 
project, including social and economic effects and how any likely 
significant negative effects would be avoided or mitigated; 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
5 
 
• likely significant effects, including any significant residual effects 
taking account of any proposed mitigation measures or any adverse 
effects of those measures; 
• distinctions between project stages and mitigation measures at those 
stages; and 
• information on how the effects of the Applicant’s proposal would 
combine and interact with the effects of other development (including 
projects for which consent has been sought or granted, as well as 
those already in existence). 
 
The draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1), Explanatory Memorandum 
(Document Reference 3.2), Works Plans (Document Reference 2.3), Land 
Plans (Document Reference 2.2) and Statement of Reasons (Document 
Reference 4.1) explain which elements of the proposals are detailed, which 
remain to be finalised and the parameters for the main plant items. 
1.3 
Need for and Benefits of the Project 
 
The urgent need for energy generation, including gas fired generating 
stations and gas fired peaking plants, is set out within NPS EN-1, the Gas 
Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012), the National Infrastructure Plan (HM 
Treasury, 2014) and Energy Wales – a Low Carbon Transition (2012). In the 
Annual Energy Statement (AES) (latest version published in 2014), the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) (now SoS for BEIS) 
reiterated the need to build new power generation infrastructure and 
acknowledged the need for gas to feature strongly in the energy mix.  
 
The Project would contribute materially to the short and medium term need 
for flexible, reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the transition 
to a low carbon economy. The chosen technology for a peaking plant would 
help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when intermittent renewable sources cannot 
generate electricity.  
 
The construction and operation of the Project would benefit the local 
economy. It is projected that the Project will deliver positive socio-economic 
impacts on the labour market at the construction and decommissioning 
phases through the creation of local jobs and contribution to Gross Value 
Added (GVA).  
 
It is further projected that should the construction, decommissioning or 
operation occur simultaneously with any other projects in the area, that this 
would provide a positive stimulus to the local economy through the provision 
of construction-related training and employment opportunities, supply chain 
linkages and demand for accommodation, food and drink services.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

1.4 
Planning Assessment 
 
The EIA findings, set out within the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and 
referenced in chapter 6 of this Planning Statement support the overall 
conclusion that there are no relevant adverse impacts which hold enough 
significance to outweigh the substantial weight that must be afforded to the 
Project’s contribution towards meeting national energy and climate change 
policies, including meeting the national need for flexible gas generation.  
 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development consent 
applications for energy infrastructure should be assessed “on the basis that 
the Government has demonstrated that there is a need for those types of 
infrastructure and that the scale and urgency of that need is as described for 
each of them in this Part.”  Accordingly, the SoS “should give substantial 
weight to the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008” (paragraph 3.1.4, NPS EN-1). 
 
The Project will result in some adverse effects, as set out within chapter 16 
of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) particularly during construction, in 
relation to: landscape and visual amenity from a number of viewpoints, traffic 
during the peak hour, loss of and disturbance to habitats, noise at sensitive 
receptors, water quality and mineral resources.  The Project will also result in 
some adverse effects during operation, particularly in relation to noise and 
operational lighting from the Power Generation Plant and landscape and 
visual amenity from a number of viewpoints. APL has sought to avoid and to 
minimise adverse effects as far as possible through the design process and 
through mitigation measures secured as part of the draft DCO or in 
development consent obligations.  
 
The construction of the Project would however also deliver benefits to the 
local economy, with projected annual delivery of £7.1 million Gross Value 
Added (GVA) (a measure of the value of goods and services produced) 
during the construction period, which is expected to commence in 2020.  It is 
projected that 25 to 122 construction workers would be required on site during 
the peak construction period.  The operational phase of the Project would 
provide up to an estimated 10 FTE direct jobs and provide approximately 
£0.55m GVA and £0.5m GVA per annum to the local and national economy 
respectively.  The Project will also deliver minor beneficial effects where the 
previously worked land and known mine workings are stabilised and 
remediated if required. 
 
It is acknowledged that the Project would result in some adverse impacts 
during construction and operation.  However, on the basis of paragraphs 
3.1.3 and 3.1.4 of NPS EN-1, and the significant benefits and contribution of 
the Project towards meeting the urgent need for energy infrastructure, as well 
as benefits to the local economy, it is considered that the overall balance of 
factors set out in section 104 of the PA 2008 weighs strongly in favour of the 
grant of consent for the Project. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

Having regard to the requirements of section 104 of the PA 2008, and in the 
absence of sufficient matters to the contrary, there is a compelling case in the 
public interest for the Order to be made in the terms proposed.

of the Application in accordance with the decision-making framework 
established in the PA 2008 at chapter 8. 
2.2 
Project Overview 
 
APL proposes to construct and operate an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
peaking power generating station (the Power Generation Plant) and new 
connections to the gas and electricity networks on land adjacent to the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 
7NN.  These elements are referred to as the Power Generation Plant, the 
Gas Connection, and the Electrical Connection, which together form the 
Project. 
 
The Project is located on open agricultural land approximately 2 km north of 
junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative boundary of the City and 
County of Swansea (CCS).  The land upon which the Project would be 
developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development 
of the Project, is referred to as the Order Land.  
 
As the generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant would exceed 
50MWe it is classed as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
under the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (PA 2008).  As such, APL is 
applying to the SoS for BEIS under section 31 of the PA 2008 for a DCO for 
powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant (the 
Application).  The works for which development consent is sought in the 
Application are described in Schedule 1 of the draft DCO and are referred to 
as the Authorised Development.  These works are for the construction and 
operation of the Power Generation Plant. The extent of the works for which 
development consent is sought in the DCO (together with relevant limits of 
deviation) is shown on the Works Plans (Document Reference 2.3) and 
referred to as the Order Limits. 
 
In addition, APL is seeking powers of compulsory acquisition over the Order 
Land, in order to facilitate the construction and operation of the Project. 
 
Drawing No. J0008302-18-200A, contained within the Annexe to this 
Consultation Report, shows the extent of the Order Land and the Order 
Limits. 
 
Separately, APL will seek planning permission for the Gas Connection under 
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) (TCPA 1990) and 
the Electrical Connection under either the TCPA 1990 or as permitted 
development under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted 
Development) Order 1995 (as amended) (GPDO).  A planning application is 
expected to be submitted for the Gas Connection in summer 2018, following 
EIA screening, and is anticipated to be determined in advance of the 
determination of the Application.  If an application is required for the Electrical 
Connection following EIA Screening, it is also expected to be submitted in 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
10 
 
summer 2018 and is anticipated to be determined in advance of the 
determination of the Application. 
2.3 
The Applicant 
 
The Applicant is APL, an energy development company established for the 
Project and recently acquired by Drax Group plc (Drax).  
 
Drax is responsible for generating 6% of the UKs electricity, predominantly 
via Drax power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy 
producers and is committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, 
displacing more coal off the system and providing additional system support 
to plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables and boost security of 
supply.  
 
Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag 
Energy Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided 
management services to Watt Power in relation to APL.  
 
Stag Energy continues to provide resources to APL through a management 
services agreement. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company 
draws on a depth of experience within a team that has created and delivered 
over 10,000 MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects 
across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
 
Drax currently has three other power generation projects which have either 
already been granted consent under or are being brought forward through 
the PA 2008 process. They are: Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk); Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales 
(www.hirwaunpower.co.uk); and Millbrook Power Ltd in the 'Marston Vale' in 
Bedfordshire (www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  The first two listed projects were 
granted Development Consent in July 2015.  Stag Energy previously 
provided management services to Watt Power in relation to Progress Power 
Ltd, Hirwaun Power Ltd and Millbrook Power Ltd. 
 
APL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. APL recognises the need to 
balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and concerns 
relating to energy projects and believes this balance can be responsibly 
delivered. The Project would be designed and developed to high quality, 
safety and environmental standards. 
 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at 
www.abergellipower.co.uk or www.drax.com.

2.4 
Legislative and Regulatory Context 
Development Consent under the Planning Act 2008  
 
The process for considering proposed NSIPs was established by the PA 2008 
(as amended). 
 
The generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant would exceed 50 
MWe and would therefore be classified as an NSIP under Section 15 of the 
PA 2008.  Accordingly, Development Consent would be required in 
accordance with Section 31 of the PA 2008. 
 
The examination is a predominantly written process led either by a single 
appointed person or a panel, who submit a report with their recommendation 
on an application to the relevant SoS who will take the final decision as to 
whether to make a DCO for a proposed project and in what terms. The 
relevant SoS in relation to the Application is the SoS for BEIS. 
 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development 
associated with the NSIP (“associated development”).  The PA 2008 restricts 
associated development for which consent can be sought under a DCO in 
Wales to development that is associated with a generating station with a 
capacity in excess of 350 MW.  As the Power Generation Plant would have 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW, associated development to the Power 
Generation Plant cannot be included in any application for DCO under the 
PA 2008.  The Application therefore does not seek development consent for 
the Gas Connection or the Electrical Connection.  
 
In addition to seeking development consent for the Power Generation Plant 
in the draft Order, APL is also seeking powers of compulsory acquisition over 
the Order Land (which is shown on the Land Plans (Document Reference 
2.2)), in order to authorise the acquisition of land, the temporary use of land, 
the creation of permanent new rights and to suspend, override and extinguish 
any rights, restrictions, easements or servitudes in order to facilitate the 
construction and operation of the Project.   
 
Development Consent for a NSIP may only be granted by a DCO through an 
application under Section 37 of the PA 2008 to the SoS. 
Wales Act 2017 
 
The Wales Act 2017 (WA 2017) will transfer decision-making powers from 
the SoS (under the PA 2008) to the Welsh Government, in relation to 
electricity generating stations up to a capacity of 350 MW.  However, these 
provisions have not yet come into force.  The date anticipated for devolution 
of these powers to take effect is 1 April 2019.  Accordingly, the consenting 
regime for the authorised development remains the PA 2008.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
12 
 
EIA Regulations 
 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the EIA Regulations) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of 
development that is classed as EIA development.  All development in 
Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (‘Schedule 1 development’) requires an 
EIA.  
 
The definition of a Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating 
stations with a heat output of 300 MWth1 or more (Schedule 1 paragraph 
2(a)).  The thermal output of the Power Generation Plant would be greater 
than 300 MWth and therefore an EIA will be required under the EIA 
Regulations. 
 
The Project is being assessed under the EIA Regulations and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2017 (EIA Regulations 2017).  This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the SoS under the EIA Regulations before the EIA 
Regulations 2017 came into effect. This means that, in accordance with the 
transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 2017, the 
EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
Section 5(2)(a) of the APFP Regulations requires that any ES required 
pursuant to the EIA Regulations, together with any scoping or screening 
opinions or directions, must accompany the Application.  Accordingly, an ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) accompanies this Application. 
2.5 
Composition of the Application 
 
The legislative requirements for applications for a DCO are principally 
contained in the PA 2008, the APFP Regulations and the EIA Regulations. 
 
Section 37 of the PA 2008 governs the content of an application for a DCO, 
including the requirements for the necessary accompanying documents. 
These requirements are specified in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (APFP Regulations). 
 
The Application complies with the requirements of the PA 2008, the APFP 
Regulations, the EIA Regulations and applicable SoS and Planning 
Inspectorate guidance, including Planning Inspectorate Advice Note 6 
(Preparation and submission of application documents, February 2016).  
 
A full list of all documents provided as part of the Application is set out in the 
Introduction to the Applicant (Document Reference 1.1.0). 
                                                      
1 Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’ which is produced as part of the process of 
the combustion of fuel. Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, which is why this is 
a larger value than electrical output.

Area, Access Road, Ecological Mitigation Area and permanent parking and 
drainage are together known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’. 
3.2 
Project Location 
Project Site 
 
The Project Site comprises approximately 35 hectares (ha) (74.1 acres) and 
is located on open land approximately 2 km north of Junction 46 on the M4, 
approximately 3 km to the north of Swansea, approximately 1 km south-east 
of Felindre, and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
 
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse 
grazing. The Project Site is adjacent to the Substation (comprising a 400kV 
and 132 kV substation) and encompasses the existing access road leading 
to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station from the B4489. 
 
Most of the Project Site is improved grassland but there are areas of marshy 
grassland in the south eastern part of the Generating Equipment Site.  There 
are parts of a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within the 
Project Site (Lletty Morfil SINC). A block of broadleaved woodland, classified 
as Ancient Woodland, and a SINC lie to the east.  There are also further 
blocks of Ancient Woodland, also classified as SINCs, to the west 
surrounding the Substation, Felindre Gas Compressor Station, and the 
existing access road leading to these facilities from the B4489.  
 
Within the Project Site there are springs, with their associated streams and 
drainage ditches which discharge into the Afon Llan. The Afon Llan links with 
the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into the Bristol 
Channel. There are no Main Rivers within the Project Site. 
 
Ground levels at the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m above 
ordnance datum (AOD) at the highest point in the north-west corner at Rhyd-
y-pandy Road to approximately 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter, with 
ground levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction. The 
land within the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD. 
Generating Equipment Site 
 
The Generating Equipment Site is located primarily within fields used for 
grazing, bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and poor quality 
hedgerows with substantial gaps in them. The Generating Equipment Site 
and Laydown Area are both crossed by a soft surface horse training track 
known as ‘the gallops’, which runs diagonally north-west to south-east. 
 
The Generating Equipment Site is accessed from Junction 46 of the M4. 
From the M4 vehicles would travel north via the B4489, then head east 
utilising the existing access road from the B4489, followed by a newly 
constructed section of Access Road leading south from the Felindre Gas 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
16 
 
Compressor Station, then crossing east over agricultural land to reach the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
 
The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be 
approximately 2.64 ha. 
Surrounding Area 
 
The surrounding area is at present predominantly rural in character, although 
there is the Felindre Park and Share facility to the south and a substantial 
amount of utility infrastructure in the area. 
 
The National Gas Transmission System, a Water Main and a 
decommissioned oil pipeline cross the Project Site and there is also a network 
of electricity pylons, underground utilities and overhead lines which are 
routed to and from the Substation. The Felindre Water Treatment Works is 
located to the northwest, while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli 
Solar Farm are located to the east of Project Site. A further two solar parks 
are located in the vicinity at Rhyd-y-pandy solar park and Abergelli Farm.  
 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks 
located in and around the Project Site, linking it to the wider area. The closest 
residential dwellings are: Maes-eglwys (approx. 440 m south-east of the 
Generating Equipment Site), Llwynhelig (approx. 590 m to the south east of 
the Generating Equipment Site), Abergelli Farmhouse (approx. 620 m to the 
north of the Generating Equipment Site), Cefn betingau (approx. 650 m east 
of the Generating Equipment Site), Lletty Morfil Farm (approx. 740 m north 
of the Generating Equipment Site) and Felin Wen Farm (approx. 830 m to the 
east of the Generating Equipment Site). 
3.3 
Power Generation Plant 
 
The Power Generation Plant comprises the Generating Equipment, Access 
Road, Laydown Area, Maintenance Compound, Ecological Mitigation Area 
and parking and drainage.  
Generating Equipment 
 
The Generating Equipment is an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW. 
 
A peaking plant which is designed to operate when there is a surge in 
demand for electricity associated with a particular stress event (e.g. where 
there is a sudden demand in power required by consumers or a sudden drop 
in power being generated by plants which are constantly operational such as 
a sudden outage). 
 
An ‘industrial’ type gas turbine would be used for the Project. This type of 
turbine has been selected as it is suited to generating up to 299 MW using 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
17 
 
only one unit, thereby reducing potential effects of noise, air quality and visual 
impacts. Additionally, they are suitable for frequent and fast start-ups, 
flexibility, and high-availability maintenance techniques.   
 
The main equipment in an OCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, including the 
following components: 
• Air inlet filter house; 
• Air inlet duct; 
• Exhaust diffuser; and 
• Auxiliaries, including: 
o Lube oil system; 
o Air dryers; 
o Fuel gas filter package; 
o Instrument air system; 
o Compressor washing; and 
o A stack with an exhaust silencer would also be part of the 
OCGT. 
 
Figure 3-1 shows a simple schematic of an OCGT operation.

Figure 3-1: Schematic of OCGT Operation 
 
 
In addition to the single Gas Turbine Generator at the Generating Equipment 
Site, the following plant and buildings will be present: 
• Raw / Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank would be designed 
to comply with the relevant fire regulations and would be installed 
together with fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable 
extinguishers; 
• Demineralised Water Tank: Required to store demineralised water for 
the Generating Equipment (used for e.g. blade washing); 
• Control Room / office / workshop Building: Required in order to 
monitor the plant operation and house plant controls; 
• Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc.; 
• Transformer Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Generating Equipment to transformers before 
export to the Substation which is part of the NETS.  This would also 
include a generator step-up transformer, unit and other transformers, 
an overhead line gantry and associated equipment; 
• Natural Gas Receiving Station: Required to ensure that gas coming 
from the National Gas Transmission System feeds into the 
Generating Equipment Site at the right flow and pressure conditions. 
This would include a compression station, emergency generator, 
Joule-Thompson boilers and auxiliary control cabinets;  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
19 
 
• Fin-Fan Coolers to provide cooling to the Generating Equipment; 
• Telemetry apparatus including electrical cabinets; and 
• Emergency Generator: A small diesel fired generator to provide 
power for the safe shutdown of the Gas Turbine Generator and 
running of essential security systems in emergency situations

Access Road 
 
A new purpose built Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site from the 
B4489 would be formed by upgrading an existing access road between the 
B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation and construction of a new 
section of road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site. 
 
The existing access road between the B4489 junction and the Substation 
would be used. Two trees currently sited at the northern edge of the road 
would need to be removed to facilitate the passing of abnormal load(s).  
 
The existing National Grid car park is unaffected by the route of the Access 
Road but may be used as initial temporary laydown whilst the construction of 
the new section of road commences. 
Laydown Area 
 
A temporary Laydown Area during construction would be provided for the 
storage of materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking and temporary 
fencing. The Laydown Area would be provided adjacent to the Generating 
Equipment Site. A small permanent area within the Laydown Area is required 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
21 
 
for maintenance during the operational phase of the Project (the Maintenance 
Compound). 
Ecological Mitigation Area 
 
An area has been allocated within the Order Limits as mitigation for any 
habitat loss from permanent land take resulting from the construction and 
operation of the Project. 
Car Parking 
 
During construction, adequate car parking would be provided within the 
Laydown Area. During operation car parking for operational and maintenance 
staff would be provided within the Generating Equipment Site. The Project 
would take into account CCS’s policy on parking standards during the 
operational phase of the Project and implement sustainable transport 
methods where possible.  
Drainage  
 
The Project would require a site foul water drainage system, and an oily water 
drainage system. A surface water drainage system would also be required to 
adequately drain the site and prevent ponding.  
 
To prevent inundation of the Project Site from surface runoff, cut off drainage 
ditches would be placed around the uphill site perimeter. 
3.4 
Gas Connection 
 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable 
gas to be imported to the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and 
pressure to produce up to 299 MW, including a Gas Pipeline and AGI.  
 
The Gas Connection would be in the form of a new AGI and underground 
Gas Pipeline, which is required in order to connect the Generating Equipment 
to the existing National Gas Transmission System so as to provide a reliable 
supply of fuel. 
 
As explained at section 2.4, the Application does not seek development 
consent for the Gas Connection. 
3.5 
Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to 
enable power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. 
The connection would be approximately 900 m in length. It would consist of 
a 400 kV underground cable to the Substation and associated works inside 
the Substation to connect to a gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) bay.  
 
As explained at section 2.4, the Application does not seek development 
consent for the Electrical Connection. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
22 
 
3.6 
Project Stages  
 
The ES (Document Reference 6.1) describes the project stages in line with 
NPS EN-1 paragraph 4.2.3, which are summarised below. 
 
Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months starting in 2020.  
 
The main works associated with the construction phase would be excavation 
and site levelling for new foundations, piling (if required) and the laying of the 
Gas and Electrical Connections, as well as erection of the Generating 
Equipment. 
 
The plant is expected to operate for up to 2,250 hours per year and 1,500 
running hours rolling average over 5 years, supporting National Grid during 
periods of peak demand and system stress. 
 
The Generating Equipment would be designed to have an operational life of 
25 years. It is assumed that the above ground Generating Equipment would 
be demolished and removed after 25 years and the Generating Equipment 
Site re-instated. Any decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar 
duration to construction i.e. 22 months. The detail of future decommissioning 
would be determined following submission of a decommissioning strategy for 
approval by CCS under a requirement of the DCO.

Planning History 
Project Site 
 
Abergelli Farm has previously been subject to a series of planning 
applications for mineral extraction, an electricity generation facility, inert 
landfill and other commercial activities. 
 
Swansea City Waste Disposal Company Ltd gained planning permission for 
the excavation and removal of inert material from landfill site and restoration 
at Abergelli Farm in February 2003 (CCS Ref: 2002/0312), approx. 100 m to 
the west of the Project Site (see application boundary in Figure 3-2). An 
application to amend Condition 1 of this consent to allow the excavation and 
removal of inert material until 31st December 2010 (2007/0907) was 
submitted in December 2007, however the application was undetermined and 
the works have ceased.

In May 2003, planning permission was granted for the change of use of land 
at Abergelli Farm from agricultural use to a horse racing training/facility 
ground (CCS Ref: 2003/0561), adjacent to the west of the Project Site (see 
application boundary in Figure 3-3).  Subsequently, CCS granted outline 
planning permission at this site for the construction of a stable block in August 
2004 (CCS Ref: 2004/0415) and for the construction of two detached dwelling 
houses to provide Horse Trainers and Stable Hands accommodation (CCS 
Ref: 2004/0329). This permission has been implemented and remains 
operational.

Abergelli Glas Ltd gained planning permission for a 10 MW solar farm, 
inverter substations and 2.4m high fencing at land at Abergelli Farm, adjacent 
to the north-east of the Project Site (see application boundary in Figure 3-4), 
in May 2013 (CCS Ref: 2013/0135). This consent has since been the subject 
to a number of Non-Material Amendment (NMA) applications. An NMA was 
first submitted to reduce the number of buildings, solar panels, height of 
fence, height of framework and to omit the met mast (CCS Ref: 
2014/1313/NMA), and was granted permission on 28/10/2014. A subsequent 
application was submitted in September 2014 (2014/1335/DOC) seeking to 
discharge condition 5 of permission 2013/0135. The application was granted 
in December 2014. The consent for the solar farm has been implemented 
and the solar farm is operational.

In October 2015, planning permission was refused for an ”Emergency 
standby electricity generation facility comprising: modern modular diesel 
generator units (up to 14 in total), transformers, diesel storage tanks, 
boundary treatment including acoustic screening, access improvements and 
associated works” at land adjacent to the west of the Project Site (see 
application boundary in Figure 3-5) (CCS Ref: 2015/1716). The application 
was refused on the basis that, in the Council’s view, the positive benefits of 
the development would not outweigh the visual harm to the countryside 
caused by it.

Surrounding Area 
 
The area surrounding Abergelli Farm is predominantly rural but is 
characterised by a substantial amount of utilities and energy infrastructure. 
 
In August 2008, National Grid Electricity Transmission PLC gained planning 
permission for the construction of a new 400kV electricity substation at land 
adjacent to the Project Site, at Heol Llangyfelach in Felindre (CCS Ref: 
2007/2733). The substation incorporated a gas insulated switchgear (GIS) 
building with separate super grid transformers (SGT), associated 
infrastructure works and a sealing end compound. Subsequently, the 
proposals were modified and planning permission was granted for the 
amended scheme in November 2008 (CCS Ref: 2008/1685) with the GIS 
building to be 60m long x 15m wide x 13.5m high. In association with the 
400kV electricity substation, planning permission was granted for an 
overhead electricity line diversion in April 2008 (CCS Ref: 2007/2827).  In 
July 2010 an amendment to the November 2008 permission (CCS reference 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
27 
 
2008/1685) was granted relating to the construction of an amenity building 
(CCS Ref: 2010/0539). The permission has been implemented.  
 
Good Energy Brynwhilach Solar Park Ltd gained planning permission in 
November 2014 for the construction of a 12.69 MW solar park at land at 
Brynwhilach, Felindre Road, adjacent to the southern boundary of the Project 
Site (CCS Ref: 2014/1022).  The solar park consists of up to 47,000 PV 
panels, 8 inverter/transformer stations, 2 substations, storage container, new 
access tracks, and security fencing. Several non-material amendment 
applications have recently been granted including amendments to the height 
and slope of the panels, amendments to the design of substations and 
storage containers, relocation of the compound area and security fencing, the 
use of less fields, a reduction in the solar arrays, and a reduction in the 
number of transformer stations to 4. Pre-commencement conditions have 
been discharged (CCS Refs 2015/1987 & 2017/0507/DOC) indicating that 
the permission has been implemented. A 9 MW solar park, consisting of 
135,000 PV panels, 9 inverter/transformer cabins and a single control 
building at land at Cefn Betingau Farm, approximately 1.5 km to the south-
east of the Project Site, was granted planning permission in August 2013 
(CCS Ref: 2013/0865). Several condition applications have been discharged 
relating to this application (CCS Ref. 2013/1739, 2015/0617 & 2015/0807). 
Several non-material amendment applications have also been submitted 
including an application to replace fencing, and an application granted in 
January 2017, for amendments to Swales, layout, fencing and access, and 
installation of a storage container and satellite system. (CCS Ref.  
2016/3484/NMA). The permission has been implemented and the solar farm 
is operational.  
 
In October 2006, the Welsh Development Agency gained outline planning 
permission for a strategic business park at Felindre, approximately 500m to 
the south of the Project Site, to accommodate emerging industries, high-tech 
manufacturing and high level services (CCS Ref: 2006/0773).  Condition 3 of 
this permission was subsequently varied by planning application 2009/1520, 
(approved in January 2010) to extend the time period for the submission of 
the reserved matters by a further two years.  Planning application 2011/1143, 
approved in October 2011 sought to vary conditions 1 and 3 of outline 
planning permission 2006/0773, to include the internal highway infrastructure 
as a reserved matter and to allow for the phased submission of the reserved 
matters in accordance with the programme of phasing to be approved under 
condition 5 of the permission. Planning permission was granted in November 
2012 for reserved matters (in part) of the means of access and spine access 
road together with associated infrastructure, plot layout and the strategic 
landscaping (CCS Ref. 2012/1035). This permission has been implemented.    
 
In January 2008, temporary planning permission was granted for the use of 
Felindre Business Park for a period of 18 months for the formation of a park 
and ride facility for DVLA staff (CCS Ref: 2007/2513).  This permission was 
extended for a temporary period until September 2013 (CCS Ref: 2009/1585; 
CCS Ref: 2011/1311).  The extent of the DVLA park and ride facility was 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
28 
 
subsequently extended and granted temporary planning permission in 
November 2012 (CCS Ref: 2012/0884), August 2014 (CCS Ref: 2014/0913) 
and October 2016 (CCS Ref. 2016/1270). The DVLA park and ride facility is 
still in use and the current temporary planning permission expires in October 
2018. 
 
In July 2014, planning permission was granted for the construction of a park 
and ride / share car park (approximately 480 spaces) at land to the east of 
Felindre Business Park, approximately 500 m to the south of the Project Site 
(CCS Ref: 2013/1835).  The development comprised new vehicular access, 
security office, toilet, engineering and associated works, including lighting, 
fencing, drainage attenuation and landscaping. The park and ride (Felindre 
Park and Ride) has been built and is operational.   
 
Planning permission was granted in November 2013 for the installation of 
four 5 kW wind turbines (120.7 m in height to blade tip) and associated 
infrastructure at Myle Coch Mawr, approximately 5.7 km from the Project Site 
(CCS Ref: 2013/0795). Pre-commencement conditions have not been 
discharged and it is understood that the permission has not been 
implemented. 
 
Planning permission was granted in November 2013 for the installation of 16 
wind turbines (maximum height to blade tip of 127 m with a hub height of 80 
metres), with a maximum generating capacity of 48 MW, associated tracks 
and ancillary infrastructure at Mynydd y Gwair, approximately 6.4 km from 
the Project Site (CCS Ref: 2013/1221 & 2012/1221). The permission has 
been implemented.  
 
Planning permission was granted in November 2014 for a 6 MW solar park 
at Gelliwern Isaf farm, approximately 2.7 km from the Project Site (CCS Ref. 
2014/0739). Conditions have been discharged (CCS Refs. 2015/0006, 
2015/0020 & 2015/1105) and two non-material amendments have been 
made to the original consent (CCS Refs. 2015/0097 & 2015/1106). The 
permission has been implemented and the solar farm has been built.  
 
Planning permission was granted on appeal on the 10th May 2016 for a 
4.9MW solar park including photovoltaic panels, four inverter stations, centre 
station and associated works (CCS Ref. 2015/1529) at Llettyr Morfil Farm, 
directly to the south-west of the Project Site. Pre-commencement conditions 
have

The Need for the Project 
4.1 
Overview 
 
This chapter sets out why the Project is needed, as a viable proposal to 
contribute towards greater reliability of electricity supply in the UK. Given that 
this Planning Statement provides confirmation that, in APL's view, the 
adverse impacts of the Project do not outweigh its benefits (see the test set 
out in s104(7) of the PA 2008), it is important to consider the need for the 
Project (and the NPS position on need for nationally significant energy 
projects more generally).  
4.2 
The Need for Flexible Gas Fired Power Station Infrastructure: Policy 
Context  
National Policy Statements (NPSs) 
 
When determining an application for a DCO the SoS must have regard to, 
inter alia, any relevant NPSs designated in respect of that type of 
infrastructure (s.104 of the PA 2008). S104(3) makes clear that the SoS must 
decide an application in accordance with any relevant NPS, except to the 
extent that particular circumstances apply (including where the SoS is 
satisfied that the adverse impact of a development would outweigh its 
benefits). 
 
The overarching NPS for Energy is NPS EN-1, which sets out national policy 
for energy infrastructure and explains the UK-wide need for such 
infrastructure. This, along with NPS EN-2 (National Policy Statement for 
Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure) comprises the suite of 
relevant NPSs for this Application.  
 
EN-4 (National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure) and EN-5 
(National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure) are also of 
relevance due to the associated Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.   
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
 
Section 3 of NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, 
confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there is a significant 
need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace capacity that would 
be lost through the closure of existing large coal plants under the Large 
Combustion Plant Directive. Indeed, it states that the decision-maker ”should 
start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for 
energy NSIPs” (paragraph 4.1.2).  
 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that the SoS should “assess all 
applications for development consent for the types of infrastructure covered 
by the energy NPSs on the basis that the Government has demonstrated 
that there is a need for those types of infrastructure and that the scale 
Planning Statement

and urgency of that need is as described for each of them in this Part...” 
[emphasis added]. 
 
Paragraph 3.1.4 of NPS EN-1 states that “The [SoS] should give substantial 
weight to the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008” [emphasis added]. 
 
Paragraph 3.3.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that, “Electricity meets a 
significant proportion of our overall energy needs and our reliance on it is 
likely to increase…”   
 
Paragraphs 3.3.2 – 3.3.6 of NPS EN-1 explain the need to meet energy 
security and carbon reduction objectives.  
 
Paragraph 3.3.4 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that, “There are benefits of 
having a diverse mix of all types of power generation. It means we are not 
dependent on any one type of generation or one source of fuel or power and 
so helps to ensure security of supply.” It acknowledges that different types of 
electricity generation can complement each other as “fossil fuel generation 
can be brought on line quickly when there is high demand and shut down 
when demand is low, thus complementing generation from nuclear and the 
intermittent generation from renewables.” 
 
Paragraph 3.3.5 of NPS EN-1 states that: ”The UK is choosing to largely 
decarbonise its power sector by adopting low carbon sources quickly. There 
are likely to be advantages to the UK of maintaining a diverse range of energy 
sources so that we are not overly reliant on any one technology (avoiding 
dependency on a particular fuel or technology type).” 
 
Paragraph 3.3.7 of NPS EN-1 states that: ”In the UK at least 22 GW of 
existing electricity generating capacity will need to be replaced in the coming 
years, particularly to 2020. This is a result of tightening environmental 
regulation and ageing power stations.”  
 
Paragraphs 3.3.10 – 3.3.12 of NPS EN-1 explain the need for more electricity 
capacity to support an increased supply from renewables.  
 
Paragraph 3.3.11 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that the more renewable 
generating capacity we have the more generation capacity we will require 
overall, and explains that ”If fossil fuel plant remains the most cost-effective 
means of providing such back-up, particularly at short notice, it is possible 
that even when the UK’s electricity supply is almost entirely decarbonised we 
may still need fossil fuel power stations for short periods when renewable 
output is too low to meet demand, for example when there is little wind.” 
 
Paragraphs 3.3.15 – 3.3.24 of NPS EN-1 explain the urgency of the need for 
new electricity capacity.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
31 
 
 
Paragraph 3.3.22 of NPS EN-1 describes the total electricity demand 
anticipated in 2025, and acknowledges that 33 GW of the new capacity by 
2025 would need to come from renewable sources, and that it would be for 
the industry to determine the exact mix of the remaining 26 GW new non-
renewable electricity capacity, activating within the strategic framework set 
by the Government. This paragraph states that, ”based on the UEP high fossil 
fuel and carbon price scenario, the UK would need at least 113 GW of total 
electricity generating capacity (compared to around 85 GW now), of which at 
least 59 GW would be new build.” 
 
Paragraph 3.3.23 of NPS EN-1 states that, “To minimise risks to energy 
security and resilience, the Government therefore believes it is prudent to 
plan for a minimum need of 59 GW of new electricity capacity by 2025”. 
 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 confirms that gas generation will play an 
important role in the UK's energy mix, stating "Fossil fuel power stations play 
a vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies: they can be operated 
flexibly in response to changes in supply and demand, and provide diversity 
in our energy mix. They will continue to play an important role in our energy 
mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon economy...". 
 
Paragraph 3.6.2 of NPS EN-1 gives specific reference to the role of gas in 
providing flexibility to energy supply. It states that ”Fossil fuel generating 
stations contribute to security of energy supply by using fuel from a variety of 
suppliers and operating flexibly. Gas will continue to play an important role in 
the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing 
amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply”.  
 
Paragraph 3.6.8 of NPS EN-1 explains the need for fossil fuel generation, 
and states that although fossil fuel capacity may be replaced by new nuclear 
and renewable generating capacity in due course, ”…it is clear that there 
must be some fossil fuel generating capacity to provide back-up for when 
generation from intermittent renewable generating capacity is low and to help 
with the transition to low carbon electricity generation”. 
 
Paragraph 3.7.7 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that “The urgency of need for 
new generating capacity means that the need for new transmission 
infrastructure that is required to connect that capacity will be similar.”  
Paragraph 3.7.10 adds that “…there is an urgent need for new electricity 
transmission and distribution infrastructure…” and “…the need for any given 
proposed new connection or reinforcement has been demonstrated if it 
represents an efficient and economical means of connecting a new 
generating station to the transmission or distribution network…”. 
 
Paragraph 3.8.19 of NPS EN1 explains that gas is likely to continue to be a 
central part of the national energy mix during the transition to a low carbon 
economy, particularly ”…in the power generation sector, as a reliable source 
of flexible power generating capacity, to back-up intermittent renewables, so 
underpinning security of supply and price stability in the electricity market…”

NPS EN-1 therefore establishes the general need case for energy NSIPs, 
including energy produced by gas generation. 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
(EN-2), National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure (EN-5) 
 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 further emphasises that “Fossil fuel generating 
stations play a vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies and a secure 
and diverse energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon 
economy….”  
 
NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5 do not repeat or add to the needs case 
set out in NPS EN-1, but provide additional policy criteria and assessment 
principles relevant to fossil fuel generating stations. Notably, paragraph 2.2.1 
of EN-2 states that: “…the Government does not seek to direct applicants to 
particular sites for fossil fuel generating stations”. 
 
Paragraph 2.1.2 of both NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5 state separately that, in 
light of the Government’s conclusion that there is a significant need for new 
major energy infrastructure generally, as set out in NPS EN-1, the SoS 
“should act on the basis that the need for the infrastructure covered by this 
NPS has been demonstrated.” 
 
Paragraph 2.19.1 of NPS EN-4 recognises that gas pipelines “provide an 
important transport mechanism for natural gas, petrol, gas oil, heating oil, 
diesel and aviation fuel.” 
 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-5 states, “The new electricity generating 
infrastructure that the UK needs to move to a low carbon economy while 
maintaining security of supply will be heavily dependent on the availability of 
a fit for purpose and robust electricity network.” 
Other Government Policy 
 
The NPSs inform, and have been informed by, other government policy and 
evidence as to the need for viable proposals to contribute towards greater 
reliability of electricity supply in the UK.  
 
PPW paragraphs 12.8.1 – 12.8.21 describe the need for renewable and low 
carbon energy. Paragraph 12.8.6 states that “The Welsh Government’s aim 
is to secure an appropriate mix of energy provision for Wales which 
maximises benefits to our economy and communities, whilst minimising 
potential environmental and social impacts.” 
 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is Government policy that the 
electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of technologies that 
continuously and reliably produce stable and controllable power and that 
within this scenario, gas-fuelled electricity generating technologies can play 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
33 
 
a significant role. In the Annual Energy Statement (AES) (latest version 
published October 2014), the Department of Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC) supported the role of gas in the energy sector and directed the need 
to build new power generation infrastructure.  
 
The AES identifies the need to retain sufficient power generation capacity 
following the rapid closure of existing capacity, and acknowledges the role of 
gas in the energy sector.  The Statement also sets out the Government’s 
long-term direction for reducing energy demand and safeguarding energy 
security, by increasing the proportion of energy from renewable and low 
carbon sources. 
 
The Welsh Government policy statement ‘A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ 
Energy Policy Statement, March 2010’ reflects, in terms of energy production, 
the work of the UK Climate Change Commission and the UK National Policy 
Statements on Energy and Renewables. The statement sets out a framework 
for carbon reduction in Wales, provides targets and advice to local planning 
authorities (LPAs) for implementation of policy into Local Development Plans 
(LDPs). In particular, it aims to maximise energy savings and energy 
efficiency to make producing the majority of the energy that Wales needs 
from low carbon sources that are feasible and less costly. The statement 
recognises energy needs in a modern society will remain considerable. 
 
The ‘Electricity Market Reform White Paper – Planning our electric future: a 
White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity’ (DECC, 2011) 
“sets out the Government’s commitment to transform the UK’s electricity 
system to ensure that our future electricity supply is secure, low-carbon and 
affordable”. A key part of this wide-ranging reform is the introduction of a 
‘Capacity Mechanism’ in order “to guarantee future security of electricity 
supply as a quarter of ageing plant closes during this decade and the 
proportion of intermittent or less flexible low-carbon generation rises” 
(paragraph 1.35).   
 
The White Paper sets out, at page 24, a vision for the Electricity System 
following reform, in which it is stated “The electricity grid has evolved to 
accommodate more localised and intermittent sources of generation, as well 
as being smarter and more responsive.”. A significant focus of the White 
Paper is to decarbonise electricity generation in the long term, although it is 
acknowledged at paragraph 2.4.23 that “Whilst we are going to need new, 
unabated gas in the next few years, we recognise that, in the longer term, it 
is likely that emissions from gas plant will need to reduce if we are to largely 
decarbonise the electricity sector and meeting our climate change targets. In 
doing so, there is likely to be a role for gas plant equipped with CCS [Carbon 
Capture and Storage], which is why new gas plants are required to be built 
carbon capture ready”.  
 
‘The Carbon Plan - delivering our low carbon future’ (HM Government, 2011) 
sets out the Coalition Government’s policies for how the UK will achieve 
decarbonisation within the framework of its energy policy, making the 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

transition to low carbon economy while maintaining energy security and 
minimising costs to customers. Paragraph 2.146 of the Carbon Plan 
recognises that the nature of the electricity network will need to change so 
that 
it 
becomes 
smarter at balancing 
demand and 
supply 
as 
generation/supply become more intermittent and demand increases. In light 
of this the Carbon Plan states that on the way to 2050, some flexible fossil 
fuel plant is likely to be needed to ensure security of supply.  
 
Paragraph 2.147 of the Carbon Plan states that over the next decade, the UK 
will need to invest in new generation capacity to replace the coal and nuclear 
power stations that are set to close by the early 2020s in order to maintain 
our energy security, while meeting our legal commitments to reduce carbon 
emissions and increase renewable electricity generation. Paragraph 2.148 
goes on to outline that to do this, the coming years will see a continuation of 
previous trends, which will include more switching from coal to gas-powered 
generation. Thus, the Carbon Plan reinforces the position set out in the White 
Paper and acknowledges that to meet our energy security needs and make 
the transition to a low carbon economy, gas will continue to play a valuable 
role. 
 
‘Energy Wales – a Low Carbon Transition’ (Welsh Government, March 2012) 
states at page 10 that “Gas will be a key transitional fuel because greenhouse 
gas emissions from gas are significantly less than coal subject to the method 
of extraction. Gas is a flexible, responsive and reliable source of energy which 
can play a key role in the transition to a genuinely low carbon energy system. 
In the short term, gas, nuclear and bio-energy will provide the energy to 
compensate for the intermittency in supply from renewable resources”. 
 
‘Electricity System: Assessment of Future Challenges – Annex (DECC, 
August 2012)’ seeks to fully understand the implications of the challenges 
posed by moving to an energy mix with a greater proportion of intermittent 
and less flexible generation and identify means of addressing them. The 
overall aim is to ensure that the electricity system can facilitate future low 
carbon generation and expected increases in electricity demand in the most 
secure and affordable way, with the most efficient use of assets. Again, there 
is acknowledgement of the continued role for unabated gas-fired generating 
plant. Paragraph 3.8 states that over the next two decades, gas will continue 
to play a key role in the UK’s energy mix alongside other lower carbon 
electricity sources. The paragraph goes on to state that new gas generation 
capacity will be needed to ensure security of supply, and to balance the 
electricity system as more low carbon technology becomes available.  
 
The ‘Electricity Capacity Report’ (ECR) (National Grid, May 2017) 
summarises the modelling analysis undertaken regarding the amount of 
capacity to be secured for delivery in 2018/19 and 2021/22.  The report states 
that there is expected to be an increase in capacity requirements for 2018/19, 
compared to the 2014 ECR, and for 2021/22, when compared to the 2016 
ECR, based on a higher assumed peak demand.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
35 
 
 
The ‘Gas Generation Strategy’ (DECC, December 2012) consolidates the 
range of government policy as set out above in setting out the important role 
for gas generation. It is stated that as a reliable, flexible source of electricity 
it will play a part in any future generation mix, supporting a secure, low-carbon 
and affordable electricity system. It states that “Gas currently forms an 
integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is a reliable, flexible source of 
electricity. Using gas as a fuel in our power stations currently provides a 
significant proportion of our electricity generation (around 40% in 2011)”. 
Moreover, it suggests that there could be as much as 26 GW of new gas 
generation infrastructure required if the decarbonisation target is set at 
200g/CO2/kWh. It also indicates that in 2030 we could need more overall gas 
capacity than we have today, although operating at lower load factors, 
reflecting the role of ‘peaking’ plant in backing up intermittent sources of 
energy generation (Executive Summary). The strategy also presents 
scenarios at Table 2B on page 22 which indicate that up to 41 GW of new 
gas generation capacity will be needed by 2030 to underpin long term 
electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind generation at 
times of peak demand.  
 
The National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, December 2014) provides 
explicit support for this type of project, stating: “New gas plant is also needed 
and will be vital in supplying a backup for less flexible renewable generation 
and ensuring that the system can meet peak electricity demand” (paragraph 
8.4).  Paragraph 8.3 adds that, “Large-scale investment in gas and low-
carbon electricity generation is vital in order to replace ageing energy 
infrastructure, maintain secure energy supplies and meet legally-binding 
environmental targets.” 
 
In October 2016, The Energy and Climate Change Committee published ‘The 
energy revolution and future challenges for UK energy and climate change 
policy — Third Report of Session 2016–17’. The report reflects on upcoming 
challenges for UK energy and climate policy. For energy supply it states that 
“The Government should seek to build investor confidence, to avoid 
exacerbating difficulties in bringing forward investment in new electricity 
capacity and new indigenous resources. The Government should also 
examine the role of the ‘solidarity principle’ in managing potential gas crises, 
specifically how the UK can continue to participate. If excluded from the 
‘solidarity principle’ the UK Government must urgently investigate alternative 
back-up arrangements to ensure security of supply in the event of a crisis” 
(paragraph 111). 
 
The ‘Final Report of the Industrial Strategy Commission’ (Industrial Strategy 
Commission, November 2017) reinforces that “the availability of a secure and 
reliable energy supply is a central concern” and emphasises that there is a 
“pressing need” to decarbonise energy supplies due to the impacts of climate 
change (page 58). 
 
In April 2018, the Welsh Government published the National Development 
Framework (NDF) Issues, Options & Preferred Option - Consultation Paper 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
36 
 
(April 2018). Issue B addresses ‘Climate Change, Decarbonisation and 
Energy’. The Paper states that ”Our aim is to see the deployment of a wide 
range of renewable and low carbon technologies, at all scales, whilst 
recognising that gas will be a key transitional fuel.” Page 8 of Appendix A to 
the Issues and Options Consultation states: “Our aim is to see the 
deployment of a wide range of renewable and low carbon technologies, at all 
scales, whilst recognising that gas will be a key transitional fuel.” Draft NDF 
Objective 3 – Climate change, Decarbonisation and Energy seeks ”To enable 
the transition to a low carbon economy; to enable management of and 
adaption to the consequences of climate change; and to support 
decarbonisation in Wales and help deliver the Welsh Government’s 
greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy targets.” (Draft NDF 
Appendix A – Issues, page 14). Publication of the final NDF is anticipated for 
September 2020. 
4.3 
Discussion 
 
The NPSs set out a clear and urgent need for nationally significant energy 
generating stations and associated infrastructure, including specifically those 
powered by fossil fuels such as gas. This need is clearly set out in NPS EN-
1 paragraphs 3.3.1 – 3.3.34 (The need for new nationally significant electricity 
infrastructure projects) and 3.6.1 – 3.6.7 (The role of fossil fuel electricity 
generation). Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 sets out a clear need for fossil fuel 
generating stations to form part of the energy mix.  Paragraphs 2.1.2 of NPS 
EN-4 and NPS EN-5 respectively explain that the need for associated gas 
and electricity infrastructure is also demonstrated by NPS EN-1. Extracts of 
the key statements with regard to need, as made in the NPSs are provided 
above in section 4.2. 
 
Since publication of the relevant NPSs, other policy and guidance published 
by the UK and Welsh governments provide continuing support for the urgent 
provision of nationally significant energy generating stations, including those 
powered by fossil fuels such as gas. This includes PPW paragraphs 12.8.1 – 
12.8.21, which describe the need for renewable and low carbon energy 
development to aid the transition to a low carbon economy.  
 
The emerging Wales NDF (Issues and Options Consultation, issued April 
2018) sets out various options for energy development in Wales over the 
Framework period. The NDF Issues and Options Consultation sets out 
various options for future development in Wales, including in respect of 
energy infrastructure. Page 8 of Appendix A to the Issues and Options 
Consultation states: “Our aim is to see the deployment of a wide range of 
renewable and low carbon technologies, at all scales, whilst recognising that 
gas will be a key transitional fuel.” 
 
‘Energy Wales: A Low Carbon Transition’ and UK and European policy sets 
out targets on renewable energy and confirms that gas will be a key 
transitional fuel due to its limited greenhouse emissions compared with coal 
and the fact that it is a flexible, responsive and reliable source of energy. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
37 
 
 
Given the above, it can be seen that an array of government policy, both 
Wales and UK-wide, acknowledges the need and central concern for the 
electricity generation mix to incorporate a balance of technologies that 
reliably produce stable and controllable power during the transition to a low 
carbon economy. 
 
The role of gas-fuelled electricity generating technologies is acknowledged 
throughout, with recognition given to the flexibility of gas generation in 
meeting ‘peak’ loads and enabling the grid to accommodate more 
intermittent, low carbon sources such as wind generation. This need is Wales 
and UK-wide due to the national electricity system and the wide dispersal of 
intermittent sources. 
 
At present, peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to the nature of 
the electricity generation mix on the National Grid. Although recently there 
has been a significant increase in the number of proposals for flexible / 
peaking plant in the UK, a large proportion of these are focussed on small 
capacity (c. 20 MWe) liquid fuel fired plants. 
 
Recent UK Government policy directly and indirectly acts to substantially 
reduce coal use in the UK. The Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) as 
implemented in the UK sets emissions limits on existing plant and emissions 
levels that act to prohibit new coal plant.  Nine plants that opted out of the 
LCPD closed by the end of 2015. Furthermore, in February 2015 the leaders 
of the UK’s three largest political parties, issued a joint pledge on 
environmental issues (signed copy published at http://www.green-
alliance.org.uk/resources/Leaders_Joint_Climate_Change_Agreement.pdf) 
which includes the statement that they will “end the use of unabated coal for 
power generation”. This represents a fundamental change to UK and Wales 
policy on coal mining which to date has been specifically to support a diverse 
UK energy supply (see for example, Minerals Planning Policy Wales (2001, 
paragraph 61: “UK coal contributes to energy diversity and supply”) and coal 
use in thermal generation, and will result in a higher reliance on gas 
generation. 
 
In conclusion, there is clearly a significant requirement for further gas 
generation capacity to provide reliable, peaking generation as set out in the 
NPSs as well as other relevant UK and Welsh government guidance. The 
development of the Project, would allow for the rapid, reliable and viable 
provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid, supporting the transition to 
a low carbon economy by balancing some of the considerable scale of 
intermittent sources such as wind being developed UK-wide, and playing an 
important role in meeting the UK’s national energy requirements.

Planning Policy Context 
5.1 
Overview 
 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on 
Applications, the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other documents 
and matters) to any relevant NPS and must decide applications in 
accordance with such relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the 
proposal would outweigh its benefits (or in certain other limited 
circumstances).   
 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important 
and relevant to the Secretary of State’s decision”.   
 
This chapter sets out the relevant planning policies and guidance relevant to 
the Application, including reference to relevant planning guidance primarily 
contained within NPS EN-1 and EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5, as well as adopted 
and emerging PPW and relevant adopted and emerging local planning policy 
prepared by CCS. 
 
An assessment of the Project, in respect of the relevant planning policies and 
guidance contained within this chapter of the Planning Statement, is provided 
in chapter 6 of the Planning Statement. 
5.2 
National Policy Statements 
 
The former DECC, now the Department for BEIS, published 6 NPS for Energy 
in 2011.  NPS EN-1 is a relevant NPS for any energy NSIP, along with the 
relevant technology specific NPS.  For the Application this includes NPS EN-
2 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure.  
 
The Application does not seek development consent for the Gas Connection 
or the Electrical Connection as they are considered to be Associated 
Development.  However, the Application does seek powers of compulsory 
acquisition for the land and rights necessary for the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection.  NPS EN-4 (National Policy Statement for Gas Supply 
Infrastructure) and NPS EN-5 (National Policy Statement for Electricity 
Networks Infrastructure) are therefore relevant to the Application in relation 
to assessment principles and the treatment of alternatives.   
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
 
NPS EN-1 sets out the Government’s overall policy towards the delivery of 
major energy infrastructure. 
 
Section 2 of EN-1 provides the policy context for the development of 
nationally significant energy infrastructure. At paragraph 2.1.2, it states that 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
39 
 
energy is vital to economic prosperity and social well-being and as such it is 
important to ensure that the UK has secure and affordable energy and the 
infrastructure in place to deliver this. 
 
Section 3 of EN-1 considers the need for new nationally significant 
infrastructure projects, which is set out and discussed in chapter 4 of this 
Planning Statement.   
 
Section 4 of NPS EN-1 sets out the general assessment principles by which 
applications relating to energy infrastructure are to be decided. The general 
assessment principles are considered in the context of the Project in chapter 
6 of this Planning Statement. 
 
Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 states that, given the level and urgency of need 
for energy infrastructure, the SoS “should start with a presumption in favour 
of granting consent to applications for energy NSIPs.” 
 
Paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1 explains that the SoS will weigh up a proposal’s 
contribution to meeting the need for energy infrastructure, job creation and 
other long term and wider benefits, against the potential adverse impacts of 
the proposal in question including “any long-term and cumulative adverse 
impacts, as well as any measures to avoid, reduce or compensate for any 
adverse impacts.” 
 
Paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1 continues and explains that the SoS should 
take into account “environmental, social and economic benefits and adverse 
impacts, at national, regional and local levels” whether identified in the NPSs 
or elsewhere, including in local impact reports.  
 
Paragraph 4.1.5 states that other matters that the SoS may consider both 
important and relevant to its decision-making could include Development 
Plan Documents or other documents in the Local Development Framework 
and explains that, “in the event of a conflict between these or any other 
documents and an NPS, the NPS prevails.” The documents included within 
the Unitary Development Plan and emerging Local Development Plan for 
CCS are referenced in section 5.4 of this Planning Statement. 
 
Paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1 confirms that the SoS will have regard to the 
guidance in Circular 11/95, as revised, on “The Use of Conditions in Planning 
Permissions” in agreeing or suggesting requirements in a DCO. Although that 
circular has in part been superseded by advice contained within NPPG 
(published in March 2014), the Applicant notes that the general advice 
remains essentially similar.  
 
Paragraph 4.1.8 states that, “The [SoS] may take into account any 
development consent obligations that an applicant agrees with local 
authorities.”   
 
Paragraph 4.1.9 of NPS EN-1 refers to viability, stating that: “Where the [SoS] 
considers, on information provided in an application, that the financial viability 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
40 
 
and technical feasibility of the proposal has been properly assessed by the 
applicant it is unlikely to be of relevance in IPC decision making (any 
exceptions to this principle are dealt with where they arise in this or other 
energy NPSs and the reasons why financial viability or technical feasibility is 
likely to be of relevance explained).” 
 
Paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that, ”All proposals for projects that 
are subject to the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 
must be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES) describing the 
aspects of the environment likely to be significantly affected by the project.” 
The ES should include an assessment of the likely significant effects of the 
proposed project on the environment, including direct, indirect, secondary, 
cumulative, short, medium and long-term, permanent and temporary, positive 
and negative effects at all stages of the project (paragraph 4.2.1).  Paragraph 
4.2.3 of NPS EN-1 adds that “the [ES] should cover the environmental, social 
and economic effects arising from pre-construction, construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the project.”  When considering cumulative effects, 
paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES should provide information 
on how the effects of the proposal combine and interact with the effects of 
other development, including projects for which consent is sought or granted, 
as well as those already in existence.  
 
In respect of Habitats and Species Regulations, paragraph 4.3.1 of NPS EN-
1 advises applicants to consult with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) (as the 
appropriate statutory body in Wales) and to subsequently undertake an 
Appropriate Assessment if required.  
 
Paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that, “the relevance or otherwise to the 
decision-making process of the existence (or alleged existence) of 
alternatives to the proposed development is in the first instance a matter of 
law, detailed guidance on which falls outside the scope of this NPS.  From a 
policy perspective this NPS does not contain any general requirement to 
consider alternatives or to establish whether the proposed project represents 
the best option.”  However, paragraph 4.4.2 of NPS EN-1 states that 
applicants are obliged to include, as a matter of fact, information about the 
main alternatives that have been considered within the ES, including the main 
reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into account the environmental, 
social and economic effects.   
 
Paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 states that good design for energy 
infrastructure “should produce sustainable infrastructure sensitive to place, 
efficient in the use of natural resources and energy used in their construction 
and operation, matched by an appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic 
as far as possible.”  However, paragraph 4.5.1 also acknowledges that “…the 
nature of much energy infrastructure development will often limit the extent 
to which it can contribute to the enhancement of the quality of the area.” 
 
Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 seeks that proposals are “sustainable and, 
having regard to regulatory and other constraints, are as attractive, durable 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
41 
 
and adaptable (including taking account of natural hazards such as flooding) 
as they can be”.   Further, Paragraph 4.5.3 states that “Whilst the applicant 
may not have any or very limited choice in the physical appearance of some 
energy infrastructure, there may be opportunities for the applicant to 
demonstrate good design in terms of siting relative to existing landscape 
character, landform and vegetation.”  
 
Paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 seeks that applicants “demonstrate in their 
application documents how the design process was conducted and how the 
proposed design evolved. Where a number of different designs were 
considered, applicants should set out the reasons why the favoured choice 
has been selected”.  Further, paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 notes that “in 
considering applications the [SoS] should take into account the ultimate 
purpose of the infrastructure and bear in mind the operational, safety and 
security requirements which the design has to satisfy.” 
 
Paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1 states that “applicants are encouraged” to use 
design review services. 
 
Paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1 states that, “Under guidelines issued by DECC 
(then DTI) in 2006, any application to develop a thermal generating station 
under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 must either include CHP or 
contain evidence that the possibilities for CHP have been fully explored to 
inform the IPC’s consideration of the application.”  Further, paragraph 4.6.7 
of NPS EN-1 advises that the opportunities for CHP should be considered 
from the outset of the site selection process.  
 
Section 4.8 of EN-1 sets out considerations that applicants and the ExA/SoS 
should take into account to help ensure that new energy infrastructure is 
resilient to climate change.  Paragraph 4.8.5 of NPS EN-1 advises that 
applicants “must consider the impacts of climate change when planning the 
location, design, build, operation and, where appropriate, decommissioning 
of new energy infrastructure.”  Paragraphs 4.8.7 and 4.8.9 of NPS EN-1 state 
that energy infrastructure should apply the high emissions scenario when 
taking into account the potential impacts of climate change. 
 
Paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult the National Grid 
and to ensure that there is the necessary infrastructure and capacity within 
an existing or planned transmission or distribution network to accommodate 
the electricity generated.   
 
Paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that “Issues relating to discharges or 
emissions from a proposed project which affect air quality, water quality, land 
quality and the marine environment, or which include noise and vibration may 
be subject to separate regulation under the pollution control framework or 
other consenting and licensing regimes.”    
 
Paragraph 4.11.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult with the HSE 
on matters relating to safety which are relevant to the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
42 
 
 
Paragraph 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1 explains that all establishments wishing to 
hold stock of hazardous substances above a threshold will require Hazardous 
Substances consent, and thus should consult the HSE at the pre-application 
stage.  
 
Section 4.13 of NPS EN-1 advises that energy production has the potential 
to impact on health and wellbeing (paragraph 4.13.1), through increased 
traffic, air or water pollution, dust, odour, hazardous waste and substances, 
noise, exposure to radiation and increases in pests (paragraph 4.13.3).  
Accordingly, the ES should assess these effects and identify any measures 
to avoid, reduce or compensate for these impacts as appropriate (paragraph 
4.13.2).   
 
Paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1 stresses the importance of considering 
possible sources of nuisance and how they may be mitigated or limited at the 
pre-application stage under section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990.  
 
Paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1 outlines that ”Government policy is to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are 
designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project 
development.” 
 
Part 5 of NPS EN-1 explains the potential impacts of energy infrastructure, in 
terms of: air quality and emissions; biodiversity and ecological conservation; 
civil and military aviation and defence interests; coastal change; dust, odour, 
artificial light, smoke, steam and insect infestation; flood risk; historic 
environment; landscape and visual; land use including open space, green 
infrastructure and Green Belt; noise and vibration; socio-economic; traffic and 
transport; waste management; and water quality and resources. 
 
Paragraph 5.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of infrastructure development “can involve emissions to air 
which could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and 
habitats, or on the wider countryside.”  Paragraph 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1 provides 
that the applicant should undertake an assessment as part of the ES, 
describing:  
• “any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects 
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any 
significant emissions from any road traffic generated by the project; 
• the predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after 
mitigation methods have been applied; 
• existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from 
existing levels; and 
• any potential eutrophication impacts.” 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
43 
 
 
With regard to biodiversity and geological conservation for EIA development, 
paragraph 5.3.3 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES “clearly sets out any effects 
on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological or 
geological conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats 
and other species identified as being of principal importance for the 
conservation of biodiversity.”  Appropriate mitigation measures should be an 
integral part of the proposed development and should demonstrate that: 
activities are confined to the minimum areas required during construction; 
best practice is followed during construction and operation; habitats are 
restored after construction works where practicable; and opportunities are 
taken to enhance or create new habitats (paragraph 5.3.18).  
 
Paragraph 5.4.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that civil and military aviation and 
defence interests can be affected by new energy development, and as such 
an assessment of potential effects should be set out within the ES (paragraph 
5.4.10).  In addition, the MoD, CAA, NATS and any aerodrome likely to be 
affected by the proposed development should be consulted (paragraph 
5.4.11).  
 
Paragraph 5.6.1 of NPS EN-1 states that, “during the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure there is potential for the 
release of a range of emissions such as odour, dust, steam, smoke, artificial 
light and infestation of insects.”  Accordingly, applicants are required to 
assess the potential for emissions and the impact on amenity in the ES, in 
particular: the type, quantity and timing of emissions; aspects giving rise to 
emissions; locations affected by the emissions; effects of the emissions on 
identified locations; and measures to be employed in preventing or mitigating 
emissions (paragraph 5.6.5).  Paragraph 5.6.11 advises that mitigation 
measures may be provided in respect of engineering, lay-out or 
administration.  
 
Paragraph 5.7.4 of NPS EN-1 states that application for energy projects of 
1ha or greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 
3 should be accompanied by a flood risk assessment (FRA).  Where 
necessary, paragraph 5.7.18 of NPS EN-1 advises that flood risk should be 
mitigated by making arrangements to manage surface water and the impact 
of the natural water cycle on people and property.  
 
Paragraph 5.8.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in 
adverse impacts on the historic environment.  Accordingly, the applicant is 
required to “provide a description of the significance of the heritage assets 
affected by the proposed development and the contribution of their setting to 
that significance” (paragraph 5.8.8).  
 
Paragraph 5.9.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that the landscape and visual 
effects of energy projects will vary according to the type of development, its 
location and the landscape setting.  Paragraphs 5.9.5 – 5.9.7 advise that the 
applicant should carry out a landscape and visual impact assessment of the 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
44 
 
effects during construction and operation, including light pollution effects on 
local amenity and nature conservation.  Paragraph 5.9.21 notes that reducing 
the scale of the project can help to mitigate the landscape and visual impacts, 
however it is acknowledged that amending the design of proposed energy 
infrastructure may result in a significant operational constraint and reduction 
in function.   
 
Paragraph 5.10.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that an energy infrastructure 
project “will have direct effects on the existing use of the proposed site and 
may have indirect effects on the use, or planned use, of land in the vicinity 
for other types of development.”  Accordingly, the applicants should consult 
the local community (paragraph 5.10.6) and the ES should include an 
assessment of the impact of the proposed development on existing and 
proposed land uses near the project.  Paragraph 5.10.19 notes that there 
may be little that can be done to mitigate the direct effects of the energy 
project on the existing use of the proposed site; however, the effects may be 
minimised through the application of good design principles, including the 
layout of the project.  
 
Paragraph 5.11.1 of NPS EN-1 states that excessive noise can have wide-
ranging impacts on the quality of human life, health, and use and enjoyment 
of areas, as well as on wildlife and biodiversity (paragraph 5.11.2).  Where 
noise impacts arise, paragraph 5.11.4 states that a noise assessment should 
be provided, to include: a description of the noise generating aspects of the 
proposal, identification of noise sensitive areas, the characteristics of the 
existing noise environment, and a prediction of how the noise environment 
will change.  Mitigation measures may include engineering, layout design, or 
administrative measures (paragraph 5.11.12).  
 
Paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1 states that “[t]he construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic impacts 
at local and regional levels.”  Accordingly, an assessment should be 
undertaken of all relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: the 
creation of jobs and training opportunities, the provision of additional local 
services and improvements to local infrastructure, effects on tourism, the 
impact of a changing influx of workers during different phases of the project, 
and cumulative effects.  Mitigation measures could include improvements to 
the visual and environmental experience for visitors and the local community 
through high quality design (paragraph 5.12.9).  
 
Paragraph 5.13.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that “The transport of materials, goods 
and personnel to and from a development during all project phases can have 
a variety of impacts on the surrounding transport infrastructure and potentially 
on connecting transport networks.”  The applicant should therefore undertake 
a transport assessment and consult with the Highways Agency and Highways 
Authority regarding appropriate mitigation (paragraph 5.13.3).   
 
Paragraph 5.14.1 of NPS EN-1 outlines that government policy on hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste is intended to “protect human health and the 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
45 
 
environment by producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever 
possible.”  Paragraph 5.14.6 states that the applicant should set out the 
arrangements proposed for managing waste and include information on the 
proposed waste recovery and disposal system.   
 
Paragraph 5.15.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that infrastructure development can 
have 
adverse 
effects 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning phases on the water environment, including groundwater, 
inland surface water, transitional waters and coastal waters.  Accordingly, the 
applicant should undertake an assessment of “the existing status of, and 
impacts of the proposed project on, water quality, water resources and 
physical characteristics of the water environment as part of the [ES]” 
(paragraph 5.15.2).  Paragraphs 5.15.9 and 5.15.10 advise that the impacts 
on the water environment and local water resources can be mitigated through 
careful design.   
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) 
 
As referred to within chapter 4 of this Planning Statement, paragraph 1.1.1 of 
NPS EN-2 states “Fossil fuel generating stations play a vital role in providing 
reliable electricity supplies and a secure and diverse energy mix as the UK 
makes the transition to a low carbon economy…”. 
 
Paragraph 1.2.1 of NPS EN-2 states that, NPS EN-2, together with NPS EN-
1, provides the primary basis for decisions by the SoS on applications for 
nationally significant fossil fuel electricity generating stations. 
 
Part 2 of NPS EN-2 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specifically associated with fossil fuel 
generating stations.   
 
Paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2 states “it is for energy companies to decide 
which applications to bring forward and the government does not seek to 
direct applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating stations.” 
 
NPS EN-2 notes that “Fossil fuel generating stations have large land 
footprints and will therefore only be possible where the applicant is able to 
acquire a suitably-sized site” (paragraph 2.2.2). It also notes that “Applicants 
should locate new fossil fuel generating stations in the vicinity of existing 
transport routes wherever possible” (paragraph 2.2.6).   
 
Section 2.3 of NPS EN-2 states that government policy criteria for fossil fuel 
generation stations relating to – CHP, Carbon Capture and Storage, climate 
change adaptation, and “good design” – must be met before consent is given. 
 
Section 2.3.13 of NPS EN-2 sets out considerations specifically for fossil fuel 
generating stations in respect of climate change.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
46 
 
 
Paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2 states that, “Applicants should demonstrate 
good design particularly in respect of landscape and visual amenity ...and in 
the design of the project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, 
transport impacts and air emissions.” 
 
Section 2.4 of NPS EN-2 contains additional policy for assessing the potential 
impacts of energy infrastructure projects for fossil fuel generating stations, 
relating to: air emissions; landscape and visual; release of dust by coal-fired 
generating stations; residue management for coal-fired generating stations; 
and water quality and resources. 
 
Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-2 acknowledges that CO2 emissions are a 
significant adverse impact of fossil fuel generating stations.  As such, 
paragraph 2.5.5 of EN-2 states that an assessment should be carried out at 
the initial stages of developing proposals, and paragraph 2.5.8 of EN-2 states 
that the SoS and NRW should be satisfied that the potential adverse impacts 
of mitigation measures are assessed.   
 
Paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2 advises that the main structures of a fossil fuel 
generating station – including the turbine and boiler halls, exhaust gas stacks, 
storage facilities, cooling towers, and water processing plant – are large and 
likely to have an impact on the surrounding landscape and visual amenity.  A 
landscape and visual impact assessment should therefore be included as 
part of the ES, and consideration should be given to the design of the plant, 
the materials to be used, and the visual impact of the stack (paragraphs 2.6.3 
and 2.6.4).  Paragraph 2.6.5 of EN-2 states that mitigation is to minimise 
impact on visual amenity as far as reasonably practicable; however, the 
visibility of a fossil fuel generating station should be given limited weight if the 
SoS is satisfied that the location is appropriate for the project and that it has 
been designed sensitively (paragraph 2.6.10).  
 
Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that the sources of noise and vibration 
from fossil fuel generating stations may include the gas and steam turbines 
and external noise sources such as externally-sited air-cooled condensers.  
Paragraph 2.7.2 of EN-2 states that the ES should include a noise 
assessment, and paragraph 2.7.5 of NPS EN-2 states that mitigation should 
be achieved through “good design”, including enclosure of plant and 
machinery in noise-reducing buildings where possible.  
 
Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that water cooling systems for fossil 
fuel generating stations may have additional impacts on water quality, 
abstraction and discharge.  Where the project is likely to have an effect on 
water quality and resources, Paragraph 2.10.2 of EN-2 states that an 
assessment should be undertaken to “demonstrate that appropriate 
measures will be put in place to avoid or minimise adverse impacts of 
abstraction and discharge of cooling water.”

National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) 
 
NPS EN-4, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for gas supply infrastructure and gas and oil 
pipelines (paragraph 1.2.1).  As noted above, the Application does not seek 
development consent for the Gas Connection.  APL is seeking powers of 
compulsory acquisition for the land rights required for the Gas Connection as 
part of the application. 
 
Part 2 of NPS EN-4 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specific to gas supply infrastructure 
and oil and gas pipelines. 
 
Sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4 set out addition policy for assessing the 
potential impacts of gas and oil pipelines, relating to: noise and vibration; 
biodiversity, landscape and visual; water quality and resources; and soil and 
geology. 
 
Paragraph 2.20.2 of NPS EN-4 states that there are specific noise and 
vibration impacts which apply to gas pipelines, including – “During the pre-
construction phase there could be vibration effects from seismic surveys. 
During construction, tasks may include site clearance, soil movement, ground 
excavation, tunnelling, trenching, pipe laying and welding, and ground 
reinstatement. In addition, increased HGV traffic will be generated on local 
roads for the movement of materials.”  The ES should include an assessment 
of all of the above noise and vibration effects during the pre-construction and 
construction phases (paragraph 2.20.5).  
 
Paragraph 2.21.1 of NPS EN-4 states that the construction of a pipeline can 
impact upon “specific landscape elements within and adjacent to the pipeline 
route, such as grasslands, field boundaries (hedgerows, hedgebanks, 
drystone walls, fences), trees, woodlands, and watercourses.”  Accordingly, 
the ES “should include an assessment of the biodiversity and landscape and 
visual effects of the proposed route and of the main alternative routes 
considered” (paragraph 2.21.3 of EN4).  Where it is not possible to restore 
the landscape to its original state, Paragraph 2.21.3 of EN-4 also states that 
“the applicant should set out measures to avoid, mitigate, or employ other 
landscape measures to compensate for, any adverse effect on the 
landscape.” 
 
Paragraph 2.22.2 of NPS EN-4 advises that “constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect 
watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone 
to flooding and ecological receptors.”  As such, an assessment should be 
provided in the ES where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality, for example through impacts on: ‘groundwater 
recharge or on existing surface water or ground abstraction points; 
associated ecological receptors’, or through: “siltation or spillages, 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
48 
 
discharges from maintenance activities or the discharge of disposals such as 
wastewater or solvents” (paragraphs 2.22.3 and 2.22.4).  
 
Paragraph 2.23.1 of NPS EN-4 states that “it will be important for applicants 
to understand the soil types and the nature of the underlying strata.”  
Accordingly, applicants should consult with the relevant statutory consultees 
at an early stage regarding the potential impact of gas pipelines on soil and 
geology (paragraph 2.23.4).  Paragraph 2.23.2 states that applicants should 
assess the stability of the ground conditions associated with the pipeline 
route, including considering the options for installing the pipeline.  
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) 
 
NPS EN-5, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for electricity networks infrastructure NSIPs 
(Paragraph 1.2.1) and associated development of electrical networks 
infrastructure for other NSIPs. As explained above, the Application does not 
seek development consent for the Electrical Connection.  However, APL is 
seeking powers of compulsory acquisition over the land required for the 
electrical connection in the Application.   
 
Part 2 of NPS EN-5 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specific to electricity networks 
infrastructure. 
 
In respect of climate change adaptation, paragraph 2.4.1 of NPS EN-5 states 
that applicants should set out the extent to which the proposed development 
would be vulnerable and how it would be resilient to: flooding; the effects of 
wind and storms; higher average temperatures; and earth movement or 
subsidence.  
 
Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-5 states that, “proposals for electricity networks 
infrastructure should demonstrate good design in their approach to mitigating 
the potential adverse impacts which can be associated with overhead lines”, 
particularly in respect of: biodiversity and geological conservation; landscape 
and visual; noise and vibration; and EMFs.  
 
Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that there is the potential for large birds 
to collide with overhead power lines, particularly in poor visibility and advises 
on how to mitigate such impacts.  
 
Paragraphs 2.8.4 – 2.8.6 of NPS EN-5 state that applicants should follow 
guidance set out in the Holford Rules when considering the approach to the 
routeing of new overhead lines.  Paragraph 2.8.4 also states that applicants 
should offer “constructive proposals for additional mitigation of the proposed 
overhead lines”, and consider the “potential costs and benefits of other 
feasible means of connection or reinforcement” where the proposed 
overhead line is likely to have a significant visual impact.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
49 
 
 
Paragraph 2.8.8 of NPS EN-5 acknowledges that, whilst the development of 
overhead lines will often be appropriate for meeting the need for new 
electricity lines of 132kV and above, there are cases where overhead lines 
are not appropriate.   
 
Paragraph 2.8.9 of NPS EN-5 notes, “The impacts and costs of both 
overhead and underground options vary considerably between individual 
projects (both in absolute and relative terms). Therefore, each project should 
be assessed individually on the basis of its specific circumstances and taking 
account of the fact that Government has not laid down any general rule about 
when an overhead line should be considered unacceptable.” 
 
Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that, “Power frequency Electric and 
Magnetic Fields (EMFs) arise from generation, transmission, distribution and 
use of electricity and will occur around power lines and electric cables”.  
Paragraph 2.10.15 states that in order to mitigate for EMFs, the applicant 
should consider: height, position, insulation and protection measures; optimal 
phasing of high voltage overhead power lines where possible and 
practicable; and any new Government advice. 
5.3 
Welsh Planning Policy 
Planning Policy Wales (Edition 9, November 2016) and associated 
Technical Advice Notes 
 
PPW (Edition 9, November 2016) sets out the land use planning policies of 
the Welsh Government and is supplemented by 24 topic based Technical 
Advice Notes (TANs). TANs prescribe the Government’s policies on various 
planning issues that shape the preparation of development plans. The 
principles and objectives of TANs prescribe the overarching national 
guidance for specific individual environmental topics.  
 
Both the PPW and TANs are material considerations in determining planning 
applications under the TCPA. These policy documents are relevant and 
important under the PA 2008 regime.  The provisions of the PPW and TANs 
which are of potential relevance to the Application are set out below. 
 
 
PPW Chapter 4: Planning for Sustainability & associated TANs 
 
PPW Chapter 4, ‘Planning for Sustainability’, sets out the principles and 
objectives underpinning the Welsh Government’s approach to planning policy 
for sustainable development.  
 
The definition of sustainable development in Wales is given in PPW Chapter 
4 as: “the process of improving the economic, social, environmental and 
cultural well-being of Wales by taking action, in accordance with the 
sustainable development principle, aimed at achieving the well-being goals.”  
(PPW Figure 4.2). 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
50 
 
 
PPW paragraph 4.2.2 highlights that the planning system provides for a 
presumption in favour of sustainable development to ensure that social, 
economic and environmental issues are balanced and integrated.  
 
PPW Section 4.4 outlines the objectives for the planning system which reflect 
the Welsh Government’s view for sustainable development and the outcomes 
they seek to deliver across Wales. A summary of the relevant objectives is 
listed below: 
• “Promote resource-efficient and climate change resilient settlement 
patterns…”; 
• “Play an appropriate role in securing the provision of infrastructure to 
form the physical basis for sustainable communities (including… 
energy supplies and distribution networks…)”; 
• “Encourage opportunities to reduce waste and all forms of pollution 
and 
promote 
good 
environmental 
management 
and 
best 
environmental practice…”; 
• “Promote a low carbon economy and social enterprises”; 
• “Support initiative and innovation and avoid placing unnecessary 
burdens on enterprises…so as to enhance the economic success of 
both urban and rural areas…”; 
• “Contribute to the protection and improvement of the environment, so 
as to improve the quality of life, and protect local and global 
ecosystems”; 
• “Minimise the risks posed by, or to, development on or adjacent to 
unstable or contaminated land and land liable to flooding”; 
• “Promote quality, lasting, environmentally-sound and flexible 
employment opportunities”; 
• “Contribute to the protection and, where possible, the improvement of 
people’s health and wellbeing as a core component of sustainable 
development and responding to climate change…”; 
• “Promote access to employment, shopping, education, health, 
community, leisure and sports facilities and open and green space, 
maximising opportunities for community development and social 
welfare…”; 
• “Respect and encourage diversity in the local economy…”; 
• “Foster improvements to transport facilities and services which 
maintain or improve accessibility to services and facilities, secure 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
51 
 
employment, economic and environmental objectives, and improve 
safety and amenity…”; 
• “Foster social inclusion by ensuring that full advantage is taken of the 
opportunities to secure a more accessible environment for everyone 
that the development of land and buildings provides…”; and 
• Support the need to tackle the causes of climate change by moving 
towards a low carbon economy…”.  
 
Chapter 4 is supplemented by TAN 6 ‘Planning for Sustainable Rural 
Communities’ (2010) which provides practical guidance on how the planning 
system can contribute to: sustainable rural economies; sustainable rural 
housing; sustainable rural services and sustainable agriculture. TAN 6 
recognises that strong rural economies are essential to support sustainable 
and vibrant rural communities and supports the diversification of the rural 
economy by accommodating the needs of both traditional rural industries and 
new enterprises, whilst minimising impacts on the local community and the 
environment (paragraph 3.1.2).  
 
TAN 12 ‘Design’ (2016) should also be considered in conjunction with 
Chapter 4 of PPW. This TAN sets out the objectives of good design and aims 
to encourage good design in all aspects of development, stating that: “The 
way which development relates to its urban or rural landscape context is 
critical to its success”. The aim should be to achieve good design solutions, 
which maximise the natural landscape assets and minimise environmental 
impact on the landscape. It is particularly important that proposals to amend 
or create new landscape are not considered as an afterthought and that the 
long-term impact of development on the landscape is fully understood. 
 
TAN 18 ‘Transport’ (2007) provides guidance on issues relating to 
sustainable development through transport, so represents a further 
supplementary document to PPW Chapter 4. TAN 18 describes how to 
integrate land use and transport planning and explains how transport impacts 
should be assessed and mitigated. 
PPW Chapter 5: Conserving and Improving Natural Heritage and the Coast 
& associated TANs 
 
PPW Chapter 5 ‘Conserving and Improving Natural Heritage and the Coast’ 
sets out the Welsh Government’s overarching advice on the conservation of 
biodiversity and the coast in a planning context. The chapter sets out 
objectives for conservation that should be delivered via the planning process. 
It includes guidance on integrating the requirements of development and 
conservation, and highlights existing measures for biodiversity conservation 
(legislation and policy) in Wales.  
 
The approach to conservation delivered through PPW is similar to the general 
principles contained within NPS EN-1 which states that development should 
aim to avoid significant harm to biodiversity and geological conservation 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
52 
 
interests through mitigation and consideration of reasonable alternatives. 
Paragraph 5.3.6 of NPS EN-1 does however suggest that the benefits of 
nationally significant low carbon energy infrastructure development may 
include benefits for biodiversity and geological conservation interests and 
these benefits may outweigh harm to these interests.  
 
PPW Chapter 5 is supplemented by TAN 5 ‘Nature conservation and 
Planning’ (2009) which is concerned with the protection of statutorily 
designated site and habitats, the conservation of protected and priority 
species; and protecting and enhancing biodiversity and nature conservation 
in the wider countryside within Wales. 
PPW Chapter 7: Economic Development & associated TANs 
 
For planning purposes, Chapter 7 of the PPW defines economic development 
as development of land and buildings for activities that generate wealth, jobs 
and incomes. PPW paragraph 7.1.1 advises that economic land uses include 
the traditional employment uses (Class B in the Use Classes Order) as well 
as retail, tourism and public services. It is stated in paragraph 7.1.1 that the 
construction and energy sectors are important to the economy and sensitive 
to planning policies.  
 
TAN 23 ‘Economic Development’ (2014) provides additional interpretation to 
Chapter 7. PPW Chapter 7 states that the planning system should support 
economic and employment growth alongside social and environmental 
considerations within the context of sustainable development (paragraph 
7.1.3). TAN 23 contains the concept of ”larger than local planning”, which 
advises that market forces do not respect local authority boundaries and 
therefore the planning system should ensure that it steers development to the 
most efficient and sustainable locations. This means that strategic planning 
for economic development is essential. Paragraph 2.1.1 addresses the need 
to weigh economic benefits and states that it should not be assumed that 
economic objectives are necessarily in conflict with social and environmental 
objectives. The TAN advises that the planning system should positively and 
imaginatively seek win-win outcomes. 
PPW Chapter 12: Infrastructure and Services & associated TANs 
 
Chapter 12 of PPW ‘Infrastructure and Services’ emphasises the importance 
of infrastructure projects to Wales: “Adequate and efficient infrastructure, 
including services such as education and health facilities along with water 
supply, sewers, waste management, electricity and gas (the utilities) and 
telecommunications, is crucial for the economic, social and environmental 
sustainability of all parts of Wales” (paragraph. 12.1.1). The Welsh 
Government aims to secure the environmental and telecommunications 
infrastructure necessary to meet sustainable development objectives, which 
are listed in paragraph 12.1.4 of PPW.  The objectives considered to be 
relevant for the purposes of the Project are listed as follows: 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
53 
 
• to promote the generation and use of energy from renewable and low 
carbon energy sources at all scales and promote energy efficiency, 
especially as a means to secure zero or low carbon developments 
and to tackle the causes of climate change; to promote an integrated 
approach to the provision and renewal of environmental and 
telecommunications infrastructure;  
• to ensure that environmental and telecommunications infrastructure 
is provided in such a way as to enable sustainable development 
objectives to be met, avoiding adverse impacts on the environment 
(including the natural and historic environment), local communities 
and health;  
• to ensure that in considering environmental and telecommunications 
infrastructure account is taken of the impacts of climate change in the 
location, design, build, operation and, where appropriate, the 
decommissioning of new infrastructure (see 4.5 [of PPW6]); and 
• to ensure that the vulnerability of infrastructure to severe weather 
events is minimised and that infrastructure is designed to cope with 
higher average temperatures and increasing risk of storm surges, 
drought and flooding.  
 
Paragraph 12.8.6 of PPW outlines that it is the Welsh Government’s aim to, 
“secure an appropriate mix of energy provision for Wales which maximises 
benefits to our economy and communities, whilst minimising potential 
environmental and social impacts. This forms part of the Welsh Government’s 
aim to secure the strongest economic development policies to underpin 
growth and prosperity in Wales recognising the importance of clean energy 
and the efficient use of natural resources, both as an economic driver and a 
commitment to sustainable development secure an appropriate energy mix 
for Wales whilst avoiding, and where possible minimising, environmental, 
social and economic impacts”.  
 
For the purposes of planning policy, paragraph 12.8.7 of PPW defines “low 
carbon energy” as the term used to cover technologies that are energy 
efficient (but does not include nuclear). PPW figure 12.2 sets out the scales 
of development, for planning purposes, for low carbon and renewable energy 
projects. It acknowledges that an energy project is deemed to be “strategic” 
when it exceeds a threshold of 50 MW for all technologies other than onshore 
wind. Additionally, the PPW document recognises the role of the Secretary 
of State in deciding onshore projects of an installation size of over 50 MW. 
PPW Chapter 13: Minimising and Managing Environmental Risks and 
Pollution & associated TANs 
 
PPW Chapter 13 ‘Minimising and Managing Environmental Risks and 
Pollution’ is concerned with maximising environmental protection for people, 
natural and cultural resources, property and infrastructure; and preventing or 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
54 
 
managing pollution and promoting good environmental practice (paragraph 
13.1.2).  
 
Chapter 13 is supplemented by TAN 15 ‘Development and Flood Risk’ 
(2004), which provides a precautionary framework to guide planning 
decisions within which risks arising from both river and coastal flooding, and 
from additional run-off from development in any location, can be assessed.  
 
PPW Chapter 13 is also supplemented by TAN 11 ‘Noise’ (1997), which 
provides advice on how the planning system can be used to minimise the 
adverse impact of noise without placing unreasonable restrictions on 
development or adding unduly to the costs and administrative burdens of 
business. It outlines some of the main considerations which LPAs should take 
into account in determining planning applications for development which will 
either generate noise or be exposed to existing noise sources. 
PPW Chapter 14: Minerals & associated Minerals TANs (MTANs) 
 
PPW Chapter 14 sets out land use planning policy guidance in relation to 
mineral extraction and related development in Wales, which includes all 
minerals and substances in, on or under land extracted either by underground 
or surface working.  The key principles are: 
• “To provide for an adequate supply of minerals that society needs 
now and in the future, together with protecting and improving 
amenity”; 
• “To protect things that are highly cherished for their intrinsic qualities, 
such as wildlife, landscapes and historic features; and to protect 
human health and safety by ensuring that environmental impacts 
caused by mineral extraction and transportation are within acceptable 
limits; and to secure, without compromise, restoration and aftercare 
to provide for appropriate and beneficial after-use”; 
• “To help conserve non-renewable resources for future generations 
through efficient use, recycling and waste prevention; to protect 
renewable resources from serious harm or pollution; and to promote 
the use of appropriate alternative materials”; and 
• “To ensure an adequate supply of minerals that are needed at prices 
that are reasonable; and to safeguard mineral resources for future 
generations.” 
 
Two MTANs have been produced, one concerning aggregates (MTAN 1, 
March 2004) and the other concerning coal (MTAN 2, 2009).  
 
They set out detailed advice on the mechanisms for delivering the policy for 
coal extraction, through surface and underground working, by mineral 
planning authorities and the coal mining industry and may be material in the 
determination of applications under the TCPA 1990.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
55 
 
 
Accordingly they may, potentially, be considered relevant in relation to NSIP 
applications under the PA 2008, in interpreting land use criteria contained in 
the relevant NPS.  
 
The Project Site is located on land identified within local planning policy with 
coal and sand and aggregate resources (section 2.10) and therefore the two 
MTANs may, potentially be considered relevant in relation to NSIP 
applications under the PA 2008, in interpreting land use criteria contained in 
the relevant NPS.  
Other TANs 
 
TAN 20, ‘Planning and the Welsh Language’ (2017), provides guidance on 
how the Welsh language may be given appropriate consideration in the 
planning system, particularly in respect of LDPs, development management 
and signs and advertisements.  Paragraph 3.1.1 notes that, “Planning 
decisions should be concerned with the use of land rather than the identity or 
personal characteristics of the user.”  
 
TAN 21, ’Waste’ (2014), advises on the role of land use planning in the 
management and control of waste. Guidance is based on the principles of the 
waste hierarchy, which seeks to prevent waste in the first instance, or 
alternatively re-use or recycle waste.   
Draft Planning Policy Wales (Edition 10, February 2018) and associated 
Technical Advice Notes  
 
The Welsh Government consulted on a draft Edition 10 of PPW between 
February and May 2018; however, this edition is at a relatively early stage of 
preparation and Edition 9 remains the latest adopted guidance.   
 
Within Edition 10, PPW has been restructured into policy themes in light of 
the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and policy updated 
to reflect new Welsh Government strategies and policies.  
 
As with previous editions, PPW Edition 10 will be supplemented by a series 
of TANs and policy clarification letters.  
 
Draft PPW Paragraphs 1.22 – 1.24 recognise the role of the planning system 
for transitioning to a low carbon economy and building resilience to climate 
impacts. Paragraph 1.22 acknowledges that “The planning system in Wales 
plays a key role in delivering clean growth and decarbonisation and is also 
crucial in building resilience to the impacts of climate change. The transition 
to a low carbon economy not only brings opportunities for clean growth and 
quality jobs but also has wider benefits of enhanced places to live and work, 
with clean air and water and improved health outcomes.”  
 
Draft PPW Paragraphs 4.99 – 4.163 summarise the Welsh Government’s 
priorities for Energy. Draft PPW paragraph 4.99 states that “The Welsh 
Government is committed to delivering the outcomes set out in our Energy 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
56 
 
Policy Statement Energy Wales: A Low Carbon Transition (2012). Our 
priorities are:  
• Reducing the amount of energy we use in Wales; 
• Reducing our reliance on energy generated from fossil fuels; and  
• Actively managing the transition to a low carbon economy.” 
 
Draft PPW paragraph 4.101 states that “Planning applications for onshore 
generating projects in Wales which have an installed generation capacity of 
between 10MW and 50MW (there is no upper limit for onshore wind 
generating stations) are made directly to the Welsh Ministers under the 
Developments of National Significance (DNS) process. Provisions in the 
Wales Act 2017 devolve all energy generating projects up to 350MW, 
however, these provisions are yet to be commenced.” 
 
Draft PPW paragraph 4.102 recognises the benefits of securing energy from 
a mix of energy sources, stating that “The planning system should secure an 
appropriate mix of energy provision, which maximises benefits to our 
economy and communities whilst minimising potential environmental and 
social impacts.” 
 
Draft PPW paragraphs 4.123 – 4.127 summarise the Welsh Government’s 
direction for renewable and low carbon energy. Paragraph 4.123 states that 
“Planning authorities should facilitate all forms of renewable and low carbon 
energy development, using up to date and appropriate evidence. Planning 
authorities should seek to ensure their area’s full potential for renewable and 
low carbon energy generation is achieved and renewable energy targets are 
met.” 
 
Draft PPW paragraph 4.127 continues that “Planning applications for 
renewable and low carbon energy generation development, which are in 
accordance with development plan policies, should be supported.”  
 
Draft PPW paragraphs 4.1.42 – 4.1.44 sets out the Welsh Government’s 
approach to development management and renewable and low carbon 
energy. Paragraph 4.142 states that “In determining applications for the 
range of renewable and low carbon energy technologies, planning authorities 
should give significant weight to the Welsh Government’s targets to increase 
renewable and low carbon energy generation, as part of our overall approach 
to tackling climate change and increasing energy security”.  
Wales Spatial Plan (2004, updated 2008) 
 
The Wales Spatial Plan was adopted by the Welsh Government in 2004 and 
updated in 2008. 
 
The purpose of the Wales Spatial Plan is “to ensure that what is done in the 
public, private and third sectors in Wales is integrated and sustainable, and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
57 
 
that actions within an area support each other and jointly move towards a 
shared vision for Wales and for the different parts of Wales” (paragraph 1.5). 
The Plan identifies six sub-regions in Wales but does not define these Spatial 
Plan Areas by administrative boundaries, allowing partners to work together 
on common issues in a flexible way.  The Spatial Plan area which the Project 
Site falls under is “Swansea Bay – Waterfront and Western Valleys”. 
 
Chapter 11 recognises that the economy in Wales has a spatial dimension. 
Paragraph 11.1 recognises that while some areas adjoining the English 
border have economic performance characteristics fairly similar to the UK 
average, the more western areas and the former coal-mining areas lag 
behind.  
 
Paragraph 11.6 acknowledges the need to take a joint approach with local 
authorities, travel consortia, and others to tackling regional infrastructure 
problems on issues of housing, transport, water, sewerage, energy, waste 
and ICT. 
 
Chapter 20 relates specifically to the area of “Swansea Bay – Waterfront and 
Western Valleys” where the Project Site is located.  Paragraph 20.1 sets out 
a number of key priorities for the region, including: “improving accessibility”, 
“developing a cutting edge knowledge economy”, “reducing economic 
inactivity” and “ensuring that environmental protection and enhancement are 
fully integrated”.  
Wales National Development Framework (emerging)  
 
The NDF is currently being prepared by the Planning Directorate and will set 
out a twenty-year land use framework for Wales and will replace the current 
Wales Spatial Plan. The NDF will set out where nationally important growth 
and infrastructure is needed and how the planning system can deliver it. 
 
In April 2018, the Welsh Government published the NDF Issues, Options & 
Preferred Option - Consultation Paper (April 2018). Issue B addresses 
‘Climate Change, Decarbonisation and Energy’. The Paper states that “Our 
aim is to see the deployment of a wide range of renewable and low carbon 
technologies, at all scales, whilst recognising that gas will be a key 
transitional fuel.” Page 8 of Appendix A to the Issues and Options 
Consultation states: “Our aim is to see the deployment of a wide range of 
renewable and low carbon technologies, at all scales, whilst recognising that 
gas will be a key transitional fuel.”  
 
Draft NDF Objective 3 – Climate change, Decarbonisation and Energy seeks 
“To enable the transition to a low carbon economy; to enable management 
of and adaption to the consequences of climate change; and to support 
decarbonisation in Wales and help deliver the Welsh Government’s 
greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy targets.” (Draft NDF 
Appendix A – Issues, page 14).  
 
Publication of the final NDF is anticipated for September 2020.

Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) 
 
The Environment Strategy for Wales was published in 2006 and outlines the 
Welsh Government’s long term strategy for the environment of Wales over 
the next 20 years. The purpose of the Strategy is to provide a framework 
within which to achieve an environment that is clean, healthy, biologically 
diverse and valued by the people of Wales, such that by 2026, the Welsh 
environment is thriving and contributing to the economic and social well-being 
and health of all of the people of Wales.  
 
The Environment Strategy has 5 main environmental issues: addressing 
climate change; sustainable resource use; distinctive biodiversity, 
landscapes and seascapes; the local environment; and environmental 
hazards.  For each of the environmental themes, the Strategy explains the 
issues, proposed outcomes and associated indicators and timelines for 
delivery. 
 
The Environment Strategy is currently being reviewed by the Welsh 
Government to ensure that it reflects the relevant commitments in the Natural 
Resource Management Programme. 
5.4 
Local Planning Policy 
City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (Adopted 
November 2008) 
 
The CCS Unitary Development Plan Document (UDP) was adopted in 
November 2008 and comprises the UDP Written Statement and UDP 
Proposals Map.  The UDP is the most up to date Development Plan for the 
area and is used in the determination of planning applications. The UDP sets 
out a range of policies and proposals relating to future development within 
CCS up to 2016. 
UDP Proposals Map & Key Site-Specific Policies 
 
As shown on the UDP Proposals Map (Figure 5-1 and 5-2), the Project Site 
is located on land identified as “Coal” and “Sand and Aggregates”, where 
UDP Policies R2 and R4 respectively apply.  
 
Policy R2 states that development proposals that would affect the working of 
known potential resources will have to be accompanied by a full assessment 
of the potential resource and the impact of the proposal in terms of sterilising 
the resource. Similarly, Policy R4 states that development proposals that 
would affect the working of known potential mineral resources will have to be 
accompanied by a full assessment of the potential mineral resource and the 
impact of the proposal in terms of sterilising the resource. 
 
The Project Site is also located adjacent to the south of a Hazardous 
Installation Consultation Zone and approximately 200 m to the north of a 
Notified High Pressure Mains Buffer, where UDP Policy EV41 applies.  Policy 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
59 
 
EV41 states that development of land in the vicinity of existing hazardous 
installations will not be permitted if there would be a significant risk to life or 
health. 
 
Approximately 300 m to the east of the Project Site, and therefore not affected 
by the Project, is land identified as having known potential for “Crushed Rock” 
mineral resources, where UDP Policy R5 applies. Policy R5 states that 
development proposals that would affect the working of known potential 
mineral resources will have to be accompanied by a full assessment of the 
potential mineral resource and the impact of the proposal in terms of 
sterilising the resource.

Policy EC1 allocates 190 ha of employment land at Felindre Strategic 
Business Park, located approximately 1.5 km to the south-west of the Project 
Site, in order to meet the growth needs of the local economy. 
 
Policy HC1 allocates land at Tircoed, Penllergaer, located approximately 2.5 
km to the south-west of the Project Site, for the delivery of 84 units. 
Other Relevant UDP Policies 
 
The UDP Written Statement sets out the broad vision and strategy for 
development and conservation together with more detailed policies and 
development proposals.  In addition to the site-specific policies set out above, 
the following UDP policies are also considered to be relevant. 
 
The vision for the UDP is for “A sustainable approach to the development of 
a prosperous region focused on a cosmopolitan and multi-cultural City and 
County, which capitalises on its waterfront location. The strategy will be 
based on the conservation of the best we have, whilst making effective 
provision for the promotion of employment, good housing, shopping, leisure, 
tourism, community and education facilities in a safe, accessible, innovatively 
designed, healthy, ecologically rich and visually attractive environment.” 
 
Strategic Policy SP1 states that “sustainable development will be pursued as 
an integral principle of the planning and development process”. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
61 
 
 
Strategic Policy SP2 states that “the countryside will be protected and 
conserved…”. 
 
Strategic Policy SP2 also states that the natural, built, and cultural heritage 
of the County will be protected and enhanced to safeguard from materially 
harmful development. 
 
Policy SP10 states that “Mineral resources will be conserved as far as 
possible. Mineral development will be limited to that which is essential for 
economic growth, with associated environmental disturbance kept to a 
minimum. Restoration and aftercare will be required to be of a high quality. 
Within areas of significant environmental sensitivity, mineral development will 
be resisted.” 
 
Strategic Policy SP11 states that: “the upgrading of infrastructure provision 
and the generation of energy from renewable resources to meet the needs of 
existing and new development will be favoured, provided that environmental 
impact is kept to a minimum”. 
 
Strategic Policy SP12 states that the Council will encourage development 
that makes “efficient use of resources and energy”. 
 
Policy EV1 states that new development should accord with a number of 
objectives of “good design”, including: 
i. “Be appropriate to its local context in terms of scale, height, massing, 
elevational treatment, materials and detailing, layout, form, mix and 
density”; 
ii. “Integrate effectively with adjacent spaces and the public realm”; 
iii. “Not result in a significant detrimental impact on local amenity in terms 
of visual impact, loss of light or privacy, disturbance and traffic 
movements”; 
iv. “Incorporate a good standard of landscape design”; and 
v. “Sensitively relate to existing development patterns and seek to 
protect natural heritage, the historic and cultural environment not only 
on-site, but in terms of potential impact on neighbouring areas of 
importance”. 
 
Policy EV2 states that new development should have regard to the physical 
character and topography of the site and its surroundings by, inter alia: 
i. “Avoiding locations that would have a significant adverse impact on 
prominent buildings, landscapes, open spaces and the general 
including loss of visual amenity, 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
62 
 
ii. Effectively integrating with the landscape, seascape or coastline by 
utilising topography to integrate into the contours of the site and 
avoiding conspicuous locations on prominent skylines and ridges, 
iii. Retaining important views into and out of the site, 
iv. Taking into account and where possible retaining site features 
including existing buildings, topography, landscape, archaeological 
and water features, trees and hedgerows, and, where appropriate: 
v. Undertaking, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of species and 
habitats on site and, where planning permission is granted, 
implementing any necessary mitigation measures, 
vi. Avoiding detrimental effects on the historic environment, 
vii. Locating near transport nodes to encourage an integrated transport 
system, 
viii. Not prejudicing the viability and function of any agricultural land 
adjoining the site, 
ix. Determining whether the proposal would be at risk from flooding, 
increase flood risk off-site, or create additional water run-off, 
development for infrastructure and services, 
x. Having due regard to the implications of the development for 
infrastructure and services, 
xi. Integrating with existing community facilities, 
xii. Utilising landscape and topography to maximise energy efficiency, 
xiii. Having full regard to existing adjacent developments and the possible 
impact of environmental pollution from those developments, as well as 
the creation of any environmental pollution to the detriment of 
neighbouring occupiers (including light, air and noise), 
xiv.Identifying the location of any hazardous installations in the area and 
development that would be at risk from, or prejudice the operational 
use of, hazardous installations, 
xv. Identifying and fully addressing issues of contamination and land 
instability.” 
 
Policy EV3 states that proposals for new development will be required to, 
inter alia, “provide access and facilities for all” and “contribute to a high quality 
public realm”. 
 
Policy EV6 states that the Council will seek to “protect, preserve and 
enhance” Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) and their settings, and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
63 
 
unscheduled archaeological site and monuments and their settings.  Where 
proposals affect sites and areas of archaeological potential, applicants are 
required to undertake an assessment of the impact of development and set 
out measures to preserve, enhance and record features of archaeological 
interest.  Whilst there are some SAMs located within the 5 km study area, 
there are none within the Project Site. 
 
Policy EV12 states that: “The character of lanes and public paths that 
contribute to the amenity, natural and historic qualities of an area will be 
protected… In rural areas, the design of any necessary works should be 
appropriate to the character of the area and should not detract from the 
landscape or suburbanise the area.” 
 
Policy EV21 states that non-residential development in the countryside will 
only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that: 
i. “It is beneficial for the rural economy or rural employment, or 
ii. It meets the overriding social or economic needs of the local 
community, or 
iii. It is an appropriate development associated with farm diversification, 
sustainable tourism and recreation, or nature conservation and does 
not adversely affect the viability of an established farm unit, or 
iv. It provides an acceptable economic use for previously developed land 
or existing building(s) in accordance with Policy EC12 [which concerns 
the conversion and re-use of existing rural buildings], or 
v. It is essential for communications, telecommunications, other forms of 
utility service provision, minerals or renewable energy generation. 
a) Proposals for any of the above would need to demonstrate, where 
relevant, that: The development needs to be located in the countryside 
rather than in a nearby settlement,  
b) The business is viable and financially sustainable, and 
c) The proposal is in accord with conservation and design policies of the 
Plan.” 
 
Policy EV22 states that the countryside will be “…conserved and enhanced 
for the sake of its natural heritage, natural resources, historic and cultural, 
environment and agricultural and recreational value through: (i) The control 
of development; and (ii) Practical management and improvement measures.” 
 
Policy EV30 states that encouragement will be given to the “protection and 
improved management of woodlands, trees and hedgerows which are 
important for their visual amenity, historic environment, natural heritage 
and/or recreation value”.  Priority will be given to: “protecting the remaining 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
64 
 
areas of ancient semi natural woodland and planted ancient woodland sites; 
promoting new planting with species appropriate to the location; and ensuring 
that protection of amenity interests is achieved where management involves 
commercial felling and replanting”. 
 
Policy EV34 states that “Development proposals that may impact upon the 
water environment will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that 
they would not pose a significant risk to the quality and or quantity of 
controlled waters. Initiatives that lead to improvements in the quality of 
surface water will be approved subject to satisfactory ecological and visual 
safeguards.” 
 
Policy EV35 states that “Development that would have an adverse impact on 
the water environment due to: 
i. 
Additional surface water run off leading to a significant risk of flooding 
on site or an increase in flood risk elsewhere, and/or 
ii. 
A reduction in the quality of surface water run-off, 
will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that appropriate 
alleviating measures can be implemented. 
Sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) will be encouraged wherever 
they would be effective and practicable, so as to ensure that 
development does not increase run off, and potentially damage 
important landscape features and protected species and habitats. 
Where SUDS are not provided then any conventional drainage system 
utilised must improve the status quo.” 
 
Policy EV38 states that development proposals on land where there is a risk 
from contamination or landfill gas will not be permitted unless it can be 
demonstrated that “measures can be taken to satisfactorily overcome any 
danger to life, health, property, controlled waters, or the natural and historic 
environment”. 
 
Policy EV40 states that development proposals will not be permitted that 
would “cause or result in significant harm to health, local amenity, natural 
heritage, the historic environment or landscape character because of 
significant levels of air, noise or light pollution”. 
 
Policy EC13 states that development that would result in the loss of the best 
and most versatile agricultural land will not normally be permitted, unless 
“there is an overriding need and:  
i. 
Previously developed land is unavailable, and either 
ii. 
Lower grade land is unavailable, or 
iii. 
Lower grade land is of a higher environmental value.” 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
65 
 
 
Policy R16 states that: “Proposals for major new developments will be 
required to incorporate adequate and effective waste management facilities.” 
 
Policy AS2 states that new developments should be designed to “allow for 
the safe, efficient and non-intrusive movement of vehicles”.  In addition, the 
means of access to new developments should be designed to ensure that 
impacts on the natural, historic and built environment and local communities 
are minimised. 
 
Policy AS3 states that “development that adversely affects the safety, 
enjoyment and convenient use of a Public Right of Way (PROW) will only be 
permitted where an acceptable alternative route is identified”. 
 
Policy AS10 requires new developments to “incorporate appropriate traffic 
management measures to mitigate against significant adverse impacts that

CCS is currently in the process of preparing a new LDP, which upon adoption 
will replace the UDP as the key planning policy document for CCS up to 2025. 
 
As of the date of publication of this document, the preparation of the LDP had 
been subject to the following phases of consultation and engagement: 
• Stage 1: Delivery Agreement (DA) – The DA sets out the timetable 
for preparation of the LDP and the Council’s Community Involvement 
Scheme. The DA was subject to consultation in April and May 2009 
and was updated in 2013; 
• Stage 2: Pre-Deposit Plan Preparation and Involvement – This stage 
included the preparation and collection of background evidence, and 
an invitation for the submission of candidate sites for assessment 
from 2010. A Draft LDP Vision and Objectives document and a Draft 
LDP Strategic Options document were subsequently subject to 
consultation in 2012. Following this, the Draft LDP Preferred Strategy 
was subject to public consultation (via exhibitions, community 
information sessions, presentations and workshops) in 2013, prior to 
the publication of the final LDP Preferred Strategy in July 2014; 
• Stage 3: Pre-Deposit Plan Preparation and Public Consultation – a 
Draft LDP Vision and Objectives document and a Draft LDP Strategic 
Options document were subsequently subject to consultation in 2012. 
Following this, the Draft LDP Preferred Strategy was subject to public 
consultation (via exhibitions, community information sessions, 
presentations and workshops) in 2013, prior to the publication of the 
final LDP Preferred Strategy in July 2014. In December 2014, a Draft 
LDP Proposals Map was published for consultation on proposed sites 
and boundary changes; and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

• Stage 4: Deposit Plan (including consultation on a draft version of the 
LDP) – Further to preceding stages and review of consultation 
feedback, the Deposit LDP was published for consultation between 
July and August 2016. 
 
CCS submitted the Deposit LDP to the Ministers of the Welsh Government 
for independent examination on the 28th July 2017. Following formal 
acceptance on 4th August 2017, the Ministers of the Welsh Government have 
appointed Inspectors to conduct the independent examination and to assess 
the soundness of the LDP.  Examination hearings commenced on 6th 
February 2018 and ran until late March 2018. 
 
The submitted LDP, comprising the Proposals Maps and Written Statement, 
seeks to provide a planning framework that will enable the delivery of 
sustainable development in the right places across the county. 
 
Prior to the commencement of examination hearings, the submitted LDP is 
considered to hold some weight for decision-making purposes based on the 
previous stages of preparation and consultation (listed above).   
 
The examination hearings were scheduled on a topic basis as set out in Table 
5-1.

Following formal closure of the examination hearings, the Inspectors’ report 
will be prepared and submitted to the Council with recommendations 
regarding the LDP.  It is anticipated the LDP would be formally adopted by 
CCS thereafter subject to the Inspectors’ recommendations.   
 
At the closure of the examination hearings and following the publication of 
the Inspectors’ report, the weight to be attached to the draft LDP may change 
based upon the Inspectors’ recommendations.  Upon adoption, the LDP 
would replace the UDP and receive full weight for decision-making purposes. 
Draft LDP Proposals Map & Key Site-Specific Policies 
 
As shown on the draft LDP Proposals Map (Figures 5-3 and 5-4), the Project 
Site is located on land identified as safeguarded “Coal Resources” and “Sand 
and Gravel” resource, where draft LDP Policy RP12 applies. Draft Policy RP 
12 states that “development within mineral safeguarding areas that would 
permanently sterilise identified resources of aggregates and coal will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that:  
• The extraction of the mineral is impracticable, uneconomic or 
environmentally unacceptable;  
• The mineral has already been extracted or can be extracted 
satisfactorily prior to the development taking place;  
• The scale and location of the development would have no significant 
impact on the potential working of the resource; or  
• There is an overriding need for the development.” 
 
The Project Site is also located within proximity of a designated Mineral Buffer 
Zone, where draft LDP Policy RP 14 applies.  Draft Policy RP 14 states that, 
aside from mineral extraction and sensitive non-mineral development, any 
other development proposals will be “carefully assessed to ensure that there 
would be no significant adverse effect on natural heritage, the amenity and 
well-being of neighbouring properties, or the quality and quantity of controlled 
waters.” 
 
Draft Policy CV 2 sets a presumption against development in the countryside, 
except where it is for, inter alia, “necessary infrastructure provision”.  
Development in the countryside is required to ensure that the integrity of the 
countryside is conserved and enhanced.

Development Proposals in the Surrounding Area 
 
 
The Project Site is located approximately 1.2 km south of a Landscape 
Protection Area, where Policy ER5 applies, and a Strategic Search Area, 
where Policy EU 1 applies.  Draft Policy ER 5 states that “development will 
not be permitted that would have a significant adverse effect on the character 
and quality of the landscape and setting of the County”.  Within Special 
Landscape Areas, including the Mawr Uplands approximately 1.2 km north 
of the Project Site, priority will be given to protecting, managing and 
enhancing the character and quality of the area. Draft Policy EU 1 support 
proposals for large scale wind farms and their associated infrastructure within 
the Strategic Search Area. 
 
The Project Site is located approximately 1.4 km to the north west of a 
Strategic Development Area (Policy SD 1(G)). The Project Site is also located 
approximately 900 m north-west of safeguarded land at Morriston Hospital 
(Policy SI 4). Draft Policy SD 1(G) relates to the Strategic Development Area 
and seeks to allocate a new sustainable settlement at land approximately 1.4 
km north-west of M4 J46 at Llangyfelach, to the south-west of the Project 
Site, for “comprehensive mixed use development of up to 850 homes during 
the Plan period, incorporating a mix of low-medium and high density 
residential, a new district centre with commercial units, primary school, a mix 
of public realm, open space and play provision, new community buildings, 
and a strategic business park.” 
 
Draft Policy SI 4 safeguards land adjacent to Morriston Hospital, 
approximately 900 m south-east of the Project Site, for future development, 
restricted to healthcare related uses associated with Morriston Hospital.  
Proposals are required to be “delivered alongside appropriate new and 
enhanced highway infrastructure that will significantly improve the existing 
substandard road access leading to the site”.  A new access road is proposed 
as part of this proposal (Strategic Transport Strategy Table 9.2) to resolve 
road capacity issues from the roundabout immediately north of M4 J46. 
 
Draft Policy RP 7 supports the development of sustainable waste 
management facilities in appropriate rural locations. Supporting paragraph 
2.14.48 notes that preferred areas for new waste management facilities 
include the former Tip site at Felindre, approximately 620 km south of the 
Project Site..  The site at Felindre is identified specifically for the potential to 
accommodate a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Facility which could 
provide heat or power for adjacent proposed developments.   
 
In addition to the proposed sustainable settlement at Llangyfelach (Policy SD 
G), proposed development at the following Strategic Development Areas 
within proximity of the Project Site is allocated within the submitted LDP:  
• Draft Policy SD A seeks to allocate land south of Glanffrwd Road at 
Pontarddulais, approximately 6 km west of the Project Site, for 
comprehensive, residential led, development of up to 720 homes, 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
71 
 
incorporating a primary school, leisure and recreation facilities, public 
open space and appropriate community facilities, employment and 
commercial uses. 
• Draft Policy SD C seeks to allocate land south of A4240, Penllergaer, 
approximately 
4 
km 
south-west 
of 
the 
Project 
Site, 
for 
comprehensive, residential led, mixed use development of up to 750 
homes during the Plan period (and up to 1,000 homes beyond the 
Plan period), incorporating primary school, leisure and recreation 
facilities, public realm, public open space and appropriate community 
and commercial uses. 
• Draft Policy SD E seeks to allocate land north of Clasemont Road, 
Morriston, approximately 1.5 km south of the Project Site, for 
comprehensive, residential led, mixed use development of up to 675 
homes during the Plan period, incorporating primary school, leisure 
and recreation facilities, public realm, public open space and 
appropriate community and commercial uses. 
 
The following draft LDP policies seek to allocate major residential-led 
development at sites within proximity of the Project Site: 
• LDP Policy H1.11 – 60 dwellings at Land at Ramsey Road, Clydach, 
approximately 2.9 km east of the Project Site; 
• LDP Policy H1.21 – 90 dwellings at Land east of Pontarddulais Road, 
Gorseinon, approximately 5 km west of the Project Site;  
• LDP Policy H1.26 – 100 dwellings at Land at Carmel Road and 
Bryntirion Road, Pontlliw, approximately 2.95 km west of the Project 
Site; 
• LDP Policy H1.30 – 50 dwellings at Land north of Llewellyn Road, 
Penllergaer, approximately 3.1 km south west of the Project Site; and
 
 
• LDP Policy H1.31 – 50 dwellings at Land at Bolgoed Road, 
Pontarddulais, approximately 4.3 km north west of the Project Site.
 
 
Other Relevant Draft LDP Policies 
 
The draft LDP Written Statement sets out a vision, strategic objectives and 
growth strategy that addresses development opportunities and issues across 
the county.  In addition to the site-specific policies set out above, the following 
draft LDP policies are also considered to be relevant. 
 
Draft paragraph 1.2.2 sets out the overarching vision of the LDP, that “The 
County will be a desirable place to live, work and visit that: 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
72 
 
• "Capitalises on the distinctive relationship between its vibrant urban 
areas and outstanding rural and coastal environments; 
• Supports a competitive and prosperous economy that acts as a focal 
point for the wider Swansea Bay City Region; 
• Has sustainable, distinct communities, in both urban and rural 
locations, that benefit from sufficient good quality accommodation, 
supporting infrastructure, community facilities and opportunities for 
recreation; 
• Is a thriving City Centre destination that offers excellent shopping 
facilities and supporting leisure and business opportunities, 
capitalising on its proximity to the waterfront; 
• Celebrates and conserves its unique natural heritage and cultural and 
historic environments.” 
 
The draft LDP vision will be delivered through a series of strategic objectives 
relating to “Enhancing Communities, Facilities & Infrastructure”, “Delivering 
Economic Growth and Prosperity”, and “Fostering a High-Quality 
Environment”.  Of the objectives set out in Figure 4, those relevant to the 
Project are set out below: 
• Ensure that communities have a mix of uses and facilities; 
• Facilitate the provision of appropriate infrastructure to support 
communities and businesses; 
• Encourage appropriate development of low carbon and renewable 
energy resources and energy infrastructure; 
• Support the safeguarding and sustainable use of natural resources 
where appropriate; 
• Support development that positions Swansea as an economically 
competitive place and an economic driver for the City Region; 
• Facilitate growth and diversification of the local economy and an 
increase in high value, skilled employment; 
• Promote and enhance a diverse and sustainable rural economy; 
• Promote a sustainable development strategy that avoids significant 
adverse environmental impacts and respects environmental assets; 
• Maintain and enhance green infrastructure networks; 
• Support measures to minimise the causes and consequences of 
climate change; and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
73 
 
• Promote good design that is locally distinct, sustainable, innovative 
and sensitive to location. 
 
Draft Policy PS 1 sets out the Plan’s sustainable development strategy which 
seeks to limit development in the countryside to exceptional circumstances. 
 
Draft Policy PS 2 requires that development enhances the quality of places 
and spaces and responds positively to local context and character.  In 
addition, a number of design principles are set out dependant on the nature, 
scale and siting of the proposal, including, inter alia: 
• “Have regard to important elements of local heritage, culture, 
landscape, townscape, views and vistas;” (paragraph (i)); 
• “Integrate effectively with and enhance the County’s green 
infrastructure network;” (paragraph (iv)); 
• “Provide appropriate parking and circulation areas;” (paragraph (ix)); 
• “Maximise opportunities for sustainable construction, resource 
efficiency and contributions towards increased renewable or low 
carbon energy generation;” (paragraph (xi)); 
• “Ensure resilience is not undermined and does not result in significant 
risk to human health, well-being or quality of life; and 
• “Ensure no significant adverse impact on natural heritage and built 
heritage assets.” (paragraph (xiv)). 
 
Draft Policy PS 4 forms the basis of a Sustainable Employment Strategy, 
which seeks to deliver up to 14,700 additional jobs over the Plan period. 
 
Draft Policy IO 1 states that “development must be supported by appropriate 
infrastructure, facilities and other requirements considered necessary as part 
of the proposal,” which must be provided in a timely and coordinated manner.  
Where necessary, “planning obligations will be sought to ensure that the 
effects of developments are fully addressed in order to make the 
development acceptable.”  
 
Draft Policy IO 2 requires developers to “maximise added benefits from the 
development in relation to the creation of training and job opportunities.” 
 
Draft Policy HC 1 seeks to preserve or enhance the County’s distinctive 
historic and cultural environment by requiring high quality design standards.  
Similarly, draft Policy HC 2 seeks to preserve or enhance the County’s 
buildings and features of historic importance. 
 
Draft Policy HC 3 states that “The Welsh language will be safeguarded and 
promoted throughout the County. Within the Language Sensitive Area, the 
following developments will be required to submit a Welsh Language Action 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
74 
 
Plan setting out the measures to be taken to protect, promote and enhance 
the Welsh Language:  
i. 
Residential development for 10 or more dwellings; and  
ii. 
Retail, commercial or industrial development with a total floorspace 
of 1000 sq.m or more.” 
 
Draft Policy SI 1 states that health inequalities will be reduced and healthy 
lifestyles encouraged by ensuring that development proposals, inter alia, “do 
not result in significant risks to life, human health or well-being, particularly in 
respect of air, noise, light, water or land pollution.” 
 
Draft Policy SI 8 states that “development must be designed to promote safe 
and secure communities and minimise the opportunity for crime”. 
 
Draft Policy ER 1 requires that development proposals take into account the 
following principles to mitigate against the effects of climate change, adapt to 
its impacts, and to ensure resilience: 
• Reduce carbon emissions; 
• Protect and increase carbon sinks; 
• Adapt to the implications of climate change at both a strategic and 
detailed design level; 
• Promote energy and resource efficiency and increase the supply of 
renewable and low carbon energy; 
• Avoid unnecessary flood risk by assessing the implications of 
development proposals within areas susceptible to flooding and 
preventing development that unacceptably increases risk, and 
• Maintain ecological resilience. 
 
Draft Policy ER 2 requires that development maintain or enhance the 
County’s multi-functional green infrastructure network. 
 
Draft Policy ER 6 states: “Development will not be permitted that would result 
in a likely significant adverse effect to sites of international or national nature 
conservation importance. Development that would affect locally designated 
sites of nature conservation importance should maintain or enhance the 
nature conservation interest of the site...” 
 
Draft ER 8 states that development proposals that would have a significant 
adverse effect on the continued viability of habitats and species “…will only 
be permitted where: 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
75 
 
i. 
The need for development outweighs the nature conservation 
importance of the site; 
ii. 
The developer demonstrates that there is no satisfactory alternative 
location for the development which avoids nature conservation 
impacts; 
iii. 
Effective mitigation measures are provided by the developer; and 
iv. 
Any unavoidable harm is minimised by effective mitigation to ensure 
that there is no reduction in the overall nature conservation value of 
the area.”  
 
Draft Policy ER 9 states: “Development proposals will be expected to 
maintain, protect and enhance ecological networks and features of 
importance for biodiversity… Development proposals that could result in a 
significant adverse effect on the connectivity of ecological networks and 
features of importance for biodiversity will only be permitted where: 
i. 
The need for the development outweighs the nature conservation 
value of the site; 
ii. 
It can be demonstrated that there is no satisfactory alternative 
location for the development; 
iii. 
A connected element of the natural resource is retained as part of the 
design of the development; and 
iv. 
Compensatory provision will be made of comparable ecological value 
to that lost as a result of the development.” 
 
Draft Policy ER 10 states that development will not be permitted that would 
cause significant adverse effect to geological or geomorphological Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).  Development that would affect regionally 
important geological or geomorphological sites (RIGs) should maintain the 
geological or geomorphological interests of the site. 
 
Draft Policy ER 11 states: “Development that would adversely affect trees, 
woodlands and hedgerows of public amenity, natural/cultural heritage value, 
or that provide important ecosystem services will not normally be permitted...” 
 
Draft Policy T 1 requires that “Development must be supported by appropriate 
transport measures and infrastructure…”  Development that would have an 
unacceptable impact on the safe and efficient operation of the transport 
network will not be permitted. 
 
Draft Policy T 5 sets out a series of design principles for transport 
infrastructure, including ensuring that the design of development, inter alia: 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
76 
 
• “Allows for the safe, efficient and effective movement of vehicles, 
inclusive of service vehicles;” (paragraph (iii)); 
• “Does not give rise to any significant adverse effect on the natural 
heritage, and the historic and cultural environment is preserved and 
enhanced;” (paragraph (vii)); and 
• “Maintains the character of rural lanes and public paths;” (paragraph 
(viii). 
 
Draft Policy T 7 requires that acceptable alternative routes are identified and 
provided where development “significantly adversely affects the character, 
safety, enjoyment and convenient use of a Public Right of Way…” 
 
In addition to supporting large scale wind farm developments within the 
Strategic Search Area (referenced above), draft Policy EU 1 supports 
proposals for renewable or low carbon energy development across CCS, 
subject to the following criteria: 
a. “The siting, design, layout, type of installation and materials used do 
not have a significant adverse effect on the characteristics and 
features of the proposed location; 
b. The development would not result in unacceptable loss of public 
amenity or public accessibility to the area; 
c. The development would not result in significant adverse effects on 
natural heritage or historic environment, or visual amenity either 
individually or cumulatively; 
d. There would be no significant adverse effect on the Gower AONB; 
e. There would be no significant adverse impact on water quality and 
quantity; 
f. The development would not result in the permanent sterilisation of 
minerals resources; 
g. The development would not compromise the transport network; 
h. The development would not interfere with aircraft operations or 
telecommunications; 
i. There would be no loss of carbon sinks, or that on-site loss can be 
adequately mitigated; and 
j. The satisfactory removal of infrastructure and remediation and/or 
restoration of the natural environment, would be undertaken in 
accordance with an aftercare scheme to be agreed with the Council 
prior to the development being carried out.” 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
77 
 
 
Draft Policy RP 1 seeks to prevent development that would result in a 
“significant risk to: life; human health and well-being; property; controlled 
waters; or the natural and historic environment…” particularly in respect of: 
i. 
“Air, noise or light pollution; 
ii. 
Flood risk;  
iii. 
The quality and quantity of water resources;  
iv. 
Land contamination; 
v. 
Land instability or subsidence;  
vi. 
Sustainable development of mineral resources; and  
vii. 
Sustainable waste management.” 
 
Draft Policy RP 2 requires that: “Where development could lead to exposure 
to a source of air, noise or light pollution, it must be demonstrated that 
appropriate mitigation measures will be implemented, and incorporated into 
the design of the development…” 
 
Draft Policy RP 3 states that: “Development that compromises the quality of 
the water environment, or does not comply with good water resource 
management, will not be permitted.  Development proposals must make 
efficient use of water resources and, where appropriate, contribute towards 
improvements to water quality...” 
 
Draft Policy RP 4 states that development will not be permitted in areas at 
risk of flooding, unless it can be demonstrated that “the development can be 
justified in line with national guidance and is supported by a technical 
assessment that verifies that the new development is designed to alleviate 
the threat and consequences of flooding”. 
 
Draft Policy RP 5 states; “Development proposals on land where there is a 
risk from contamination or landfill gas will not be permitted unless it can be 
demonstrated that measures can be taken to satisfactorily overcome any 
significant risk to life, human health, property, controlled waters, or the natural 
and historic environment.” 
 
Draft Policy RP 6 states: “Development which would create, affect or might 
be affected by unstable or potentially unstable land will not be permitted 
where there would be a significant direct risk to life, human health, property, 
buildings and structures, or the natural heritage on the site or in its vicinity...” 
 
Draft Policy RP 9 requires development to incorporate, as appropriate, 
“adequate and effective provision for the storage, recycling and other 
sustainable management of waste, and allow for appropriate access 
arrangements for recycling and refuse collection vehicles and personnel.”

Supplementary Planning Guidance 
 
CCS has produced Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) to support the 
implementation of adopted UDP planning policies. 
 
The Planning Obligations SPG, published by CCS in March 2010, is an SPG 
document of potential relevance to the Application.  The Planning Obligations 
SPG explains how the Council will use obligations, identify the types of 
development for which obligations can be required, and explain both the legal 
content and the procedures involved when entering into obligations.  
 
The SPG advises that “Planning obligations are secured by a formal deed 
whether “Unilaterally” or by “Agreement". It is anticipated that the majority of 
planning contributions will be secured through the prior completion of a 
Section 106 Agreement…. The Council will consider Unilateral Undertakings 
where they are appropriately worded.” (paragraph 1.3).  
 
The SPG advises that “Only development proposals with significant impacts 
will need an Agreement to be completed before planning permission is 
granted. If an Agreement is required the applicant will be advised of the main 
requirements and reasons. When negotiating the level of contributions that 
will be required, the LPA will take into account any abnormal costs that 
developers may face and any implications to the overall viability of the 
proposal” (paragraph 1.4).  
 
Other SPGs may be of relevance in detailed methodologies in the 
environmental impact assessment, as reported on in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). 
 
Background technical documents prepared to inform the preparation of the 
Deposit LDS may also be of relevance, including the Strategic Flood 
Consequences Assessment, Health Impact Assessment, LDP Equality 
Impact Assessment and Strategic Transport Assessment. Swansea 
Environment Strategy 2006 and Ten Year Progress Review (2016). 
 
The Swansea Environment Strategy (SES), published by Swansea 
Environmental Forum (SEF) in 2006, provides a long-term vision and 
strategic priorities for the natural and built environment in Swansea.  
 
SEF is the lead strategic partnership for all aspects of the natural and built 
environment in the City and County of Swansea. It is an independent 
membership organisation, initially set-up in 1985, which brings together 
individuals, statutory bodies, businesses and voluntary groups to promote 
environmental sustainability and develop collaborative projects to improve 
our natural and urban environments. 
 
The SES establishes a 2020 vision and a series of priorities for:  
• the natural environment and biodiversity;  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
79 
 
• the built environment and energy use;  
• water, land and waste management;  
• sustainable transport and air quality; and  
• environmental awareness and action.

Swansea Local Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 
 
The Swansea Biodiversity Partnership produced the Swansea Local 
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan in 2005.  The document provides a 
strategic framework and series of detailed species and habitat action plans 
looking at how individuals and organisations could work to try and halt 
biodiversity loss in Swansea. 
 
The document was prepared with the following aim: “To conserve, enhance 
and promote the special qualities of Swansea’s unique and ecologically 
diverse natural environment, and to maximise the contribution it makes to the 
social, economic and environmental wellbeing of the area”.

Assessment 
6.1 
Introduction 
 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications, 
the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other documents and matters) 
to any relevant NPS and must decide applications in accordance with such 
relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh 
its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances).   
 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important 
and relevant to [the SoS’s] decision”.   
 
This chapter of the Planning Statement provides an assessment of the 
Project in regard to relevant NPS guidance contained within NPS EN-1 and 
NPS EN-2, as well as other matters which are considered to be both 
“important and relevant” (Section 104, PA 2008).   
 
This chapter is structured as follows: 
• 6.2 National Policy Statements (NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 
and NPS EN-5); 
• 6.3 Welsh Planning Policy (including PPW and associated TANs); 
and 
• 6.4 Local Planning Policy (including CCS UDP and CCS draft LDP).

General Approach 
 
NPS EN-1 sets out the Government’s overall policy towards the delivery of 
major energy infrastructure, as referred to in section 5.2 of this Planning 
Statement. 
 
Part 3 of NPS EN-1 sets out the need for new nationally significant energy 
infrastructure projects, which is considered in Chapter 4 of this Planning 
Statement.  This chapter of the Planning Statement does not therefore 
consider the need for the Project further. 
 
Parts 4 and 5 of NPS EN-1 set out general assessment principles and explain 
potential impacts of energy infrastructure which will be considered in deciding 
applications.  With reference to Chapter 5 of this Planning Statement, this 
section provides an assessment of the Project in respect of Parts 4 and 5 of 
NPS EN-1 as set out in Table 6-1.

General Points 
 
The Power Generation Plant is classified as a NSIP under Section 15 of the 
PA 2008, as explained at section 2.4 of this Planning Statement, and the 
urgent need for the Project is explained at Chapter 4 of this Planning 
Statement.  As such, in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1, there 
should be a presumption in favour of granting consent for the Project.   
 
As explained at section 7.3 of this Planning Statement, and with regards to 
paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1, the Project will provide a number of benefits 
and will contribute to the urgent need for energy generation, as identified 
throughout NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012), and the 
National Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2016-2021 (HM Treasury, 2017). The 
Project would contribute materially to the immediate and medium term needs 
for flexible, reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the transition 
to a low carbon economy.  The chosen technology for a peaking plant would 
help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when intermittent renewable sources cannot 
generate electricity.  Furthermore, as set out in Chapter 14 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), the Project will deliver positive impacts through 
employment creation in construction, operation and decommissioning 
stages; and supply chain linkages for goods and services and workers 
spending in the local economy.   
 
An EIA has been undertaken to consider the likely impacts of the Project in 
respect of air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality and 
resources; geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and 
visual impacts assessment; traffic, transport and access; archaeology and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

cultural heritage; socio-economics; waste; health; and EMF.  The findings of 
the EIA are presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The potential 
adverse impacts of the Project are also summarised at section 7.2 of this 
Planning Statement.  The likely impacts have been minimised wherever 
possible, and other effects avoided through appropriate specification, siting 
and design. 
 
With regards to paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1, the Application has sought to 
consider the provisions of CCS’ UDP and the emerging LDP.  Matters which 
are both important and relevant from the adopted and emerging development 
plan documents are set out and considered in the context of the Application 
at section 6.4 of this Planning Statement. Any conflicts are considered in 
accordance with the decision-making framework in PA 2008 section 104, and 
in light of the clear statement in paragraph 4.1.5 that in the event of a conflict 
between the development plan and NPS, the NPS prevails for the purpose of 
decision making under the PA 2008. 
 
The Applicant has held discussions with CCS during the preparation of the 
requirements set out in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1), in regards 
to paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1 and has sought to propose reasonable and 
appropriate controls necessary for the acceptability of the proposed 
development, in line with established law and practice as outlined in the 
National Planning Practice Guidance and Welsh Government Circular 
16/2014. The requirements also take due account of advice and preferences 
of Welsh agencies such as Welsh Government Transport on previous Welsh 
DCO applications (cf. Hirwaun Power Station; Brechfa Forest Wind Farm) to 
inform drafting of requirements that are reasonable, enforceable and precise. 
The Applicant will continue to engage with CCS and other agencies and 
seeks to record the level of agreement reached as to each requirement, 
within the Statement of Common Ground with CCS, and other agencies if 
relevant, before and during the examination. 
 
Discussions have been held with CCS as to the need for and scope of 
planning obligations, in regards to paragraph 4.1.8 of NPS EN-1, and a 
statement of the proposed Section 106 Heads of Terms (Document 
Reference 10.3) are enclosed in the Application. Further discussions will be 
held with CCS in order to agree a full development consent obligation and 
progress on the draft agreement will be described in a Statement of Common 
Ground to be submitted prior to the Examination’s Preliminary Meeting.  
 
The Applicant has had regard to the anticipated market regime and other 
aspects of viability and technical feasibility at relevant stages of the design 
of the Project, in accordance with paragraph 4.1.9 of NPS EN-1. 
Environmental Statement 
 
An ES (Document Reference 6.1) has been prepared and accompanies the 
Application, in accordance with paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1.  The ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) includes an assessment of all likely significant 
effects at all stages of the Project, in accordance with paragraph 4.2.3 of 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
85 
 
NPS EN-1, in respect of air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality 
and resources; geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and 
visual impacts; traffic, transport and access; archaeology and cultural 
heritage; and socio-economics. 
 
The ES sets out the measures taken to avoid and to mitigate likely significant 
environmental effects, in accordance with paragraph 4.2.2 of NPS EN-1.  
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1, the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) contains information on the cumulative effects of the Project 
in combination with the effects of other development, including projects for 
which consent has been sought or granted, as well as those already in 
existence, in respect of air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality 
and resources; geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and 
visual impacts; traffic, transport and access; archaeology and cultural 
heritage; and socio-economics.  
Habitats and Species Regulations  
 
APL consulted NRW during EIA Scoping, non-statutory meetings and 
statutory Section 42 consultation, as recorded within the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.1.0) and ES (Document Reference 6.1) and in 
accordance with paragraph 4.3.1 of NPS EN-1, with regards to the potential 
ecological impacts of the Project and the potential need for a Habitat 
Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Assessment.  
 
To assist the Examining Authority/SoS in considering whether the Project 
may have a significant effect on a European site, or on any site to which the 
same protection is applied as a matter of policy, either alone or in combination 
with other plans or projects, a HRA Screening Assessment was performed, 
which concluded that there will be no ‘Likely Significant Effects’ either alone 
or ‘in combination’ on the features of the European sites. No further 
assessment, by way of an Appropriate Assessment (Stage 2 of the HRA 
process) is considered necessary, therefore a No Significant Effects Report 
has been prepared to accompany the application (Document Reference 5.5). 
Project Development and Alternatives 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS EN-1, it is not necessary for an 
applicant from a policy perspective to demonstrate that the proposed project 
represents the best option.  As required under the EIA regulations and 
acknowledged in paragraph 4.4.2 of NPS EN-1 the ES (Document 
Reference: 6.1), provides an account of the consideration of the main 
alternatives studied by APL, including:  
• Alternative development sites;  
• Alternative technologies for electricity generation;  
• Alternative layouts and access for the Power Generation Plant; 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
86 
 
• Alternative routes for the Gas Connection; and 
• Alternative solutions for the Electrical Connection. 
 
Additionally, the Consultation Report (Document Reference: 5.1), explains 
the Project’s development and the options that the Applicant has consulted 
on at relevant stages prior to making the Application. Table 5-2 of the 
Consultation Report sets out the Project Consultation Milestones which 
shows the various stages of consultation held. Chapter 10 of the Consultation 
Report explains further how community and other stakeholders have 
influenced considerations as to layouts for the Power Generation Plant and 
alternative options for the Electrical Connection and the Gas Connection 
through a thorough, effective and proportionate consultation process to 
enable the range of potentially interested parties to express their views.  
 
 
Alternative Development Sites 
 
In deciding upon the location of the Project Site, the Applicant undertook a 
detailed feasibility assessment having regard to a number of technical, 
environmental, and economic factors in accordance with NPS EN-1.  The key 
factors considered necessary in selecting a suitable site for a project such as 
this one were broadly fourfold; technical, environmental, economic, and in 
line with local planning policy. 
 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, the Applicant looked at a range 
of sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this nature. This 
search for potential power generation plant sites across the UK was focused 
on areas that were capable of meeting the Applicant’s strategic project 
development criteria:  
• Acceptable proximity to the national gas transmission system & the 
national electricity transmission system or local distribution networks;  
• Located within areas that are net importers of electricity; and 
• Located within areas of compatible land use designation/s. 
 
In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough to 
support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and integral infrastructure) 
and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and electrical connection points 
were both key considerations. 
 
From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to close 
sensitive receptors such as residential properties or sites of ecological 
importance (to avoid unacceptable impacts from noise and visual 
disturbance), the current nature of the surrounding area (to limit impacts on 
the landscape character of the area), previous site uses and land quality (to 
avoid sterilisation of the best and most versatile agricultural land or mineral 
assets) and proximity to sensitive ecological habitats. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
87 
 
 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons: 
• It is in close proximity to a suitable electrical connection point; 
• It is in close proximity to a suitable gas connection point; 
• The Project Site does not include any nationally important 
environmental designations; 
• The land available is of an adequate size to accommodate the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
• The Project Site is largely situated on poor quality agricultural land 
(improved grassland classified as Grade 4 agricultural land); 
• It is in close proximity to similar industrial developments including the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and Swansea North Substation; 
• The surrounding network is within an area of net electricity import; and 
• It is in close proximity to a well-developed road network to the Project 
Site. 
 
The Applicant further considers that the Project Site has been delineated, laid 
out and designed suitably, and proposes appropriate mitigation wherever 
feasible in line with relevant planning policy considerations. Further 
assessment of these considerations is provided elsewhere in Chapter 6 of 
this document.  
 
 Alternative technologies for electricity generation 
 
The following technology options have been considered for the Power 
Generation Plant: OCGT plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; 
Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant and CHP Plant. 
 
OCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant and operating at up to 2,250 hours at the 
Project Site based on the following environmental, technical and feasibility 
considerations: 
• Visual impact: OCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to 
CCGT plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the 
surrounding environment; 
• Water resources: Since no cooling is required for the condensing of 
steam, the cooling requirements of OCGT plants are significantly 
lower than, for example, CCGT plants. The auxiliary cooling 
requirements (for lubrication oil, etc.) would be met via dry air cooling 
through the use of fin-fan coolers or Air Cooled Condensers (ACC). 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
88 
 
The water requirement of a OCGT plant is therefore significantly lower 
than for CCGT plants; 
• Noise and available space: noise levels from an OCGT plant would 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE units 
would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate up to 
299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
• Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential 
that the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed would be 
particularly cost effective, as it would be called upon to operate flexibly 
to balance out the National Grid and meet changing demands of 
customers; and 
• Start-up times: OCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better 
suited to meeting variable demands. 
 
Uncertain market conditions in 2014 led to the consideration of a number of 
different OCGT technologies and, as such, the 2014 PEIR and associated 
formal consultation process was based on the construction and operation of 
between 1 and 5 Gas Turbine Generators. However, greater clarity on the 
capacity 
market 
rules, 
further 
engagement 
with 
the 
equipment 
manufacturers, and consultation with the local community and relevant 
stakeholders has led to the decision that a single Gas Turbine Generator is 
the most appropriate technology solution for the Project. These changes 
have been consulted on in the 2018 PEIR and are reported in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) and Consultation Report (Document Reference 
5.1.0). 
Alternative Layouts and Access for the Power Generation Plant  
 
The design and layout of a OCGT is primarily informed by its operational 
requirements. A limited range of site layouts were examined before 
culminating in the final design, taking into account the following constraints 
which were established through engagement and consultation (as described 
in the Consultation Report, Document Reference 5.1) as well as the technical 
studies supporting the ES (Document Reference 6.1):  
• Avoidance of utilities such as the 1.68 m cast iron water main and the 
decommissioned Oil Pipeline (which bisect the site under the Gallops), 
and the National Gas Transmission System; 
• Avoidance of landfill to north; 
• Avoidance of higher topography to the north west which would be 
more visible in key views; 
• Avoidance of woodland to the east; 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
89 
 
• Avoidance of solar farms to the north, south, east and west; and 
• Avoidance of field boundaries, ancient woodland and mature trees as 
far as reasonably possible (being wildlife/ heritage features). 
 
The final layout of the Project Site has also been determined by the following 
main factors in relation to each of the components:  
• Generating Equipment – The Gas Turbine Generator and stack 
require the largest area of land-take as compared to the other 
components of the Generating Equipment. It is also best practice for 
the layout of the Generating Equipment Site to make the Generating 
Equipment easily accessible by the operators and maintenance staff 
from the control and administration building. These were key 
considerations which influenced the siting of the Generating 
Equipment Site. However, the subsequent identification of a water 
main, which crosses the Generating Equipment Site and Laydown 
Area from northwest to southeast, and discussions with Welsh Water, 
have influenced where the Generating Equipment will be located 
within the Generating Equipment Site.  The Generating Equipment is 
therefore positioned to the north of the Water Main. 
• Access to the Generating Equipment Site – Two options were initially 
considered, comprising an access option from the north via the Rhyd-
y-pandy Road (Option 1) and an access option from the west via the 
B4489 (Option 2). Access Option 2 was the option taken forward in the 
2018 PEIR at the time of Phase 2 statutory consultation and is referred 
to elsewhere in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) as the Access 
Road. The main reasons for this choice included that the majority of 
the public consulted during 2014 supported Access Option 2 in 
preference to Access Option 1, as it would result in a lower adverse 
impact on traffic by using a shorter, more direct route and would avoid 
the roads leading to Morriston Hospital. This option would also 
minimise the amount of construction required, as part of the access is 
existing. 
• Access from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site – Within 
the 2018 PEIR, two options (Option A and Option B) were considered 
for the purpose built new section of Access Road from the Substation 
to the Generating Equipment Site. The key advantage to Option A was 
its complete avoidance of the Ancient Woodland area adjacent to the 
Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station. Option B performed 
better in terms of impacts to National Grid’s current and future planned 
operations, sustainability in relation to materials to be excavated and 
removed, and Project cost. However, consultation feedback in 
response to the 2018 PEIR highlighted the importance of avoiding the 
Ancient Woodland. Therefore, in response to consultation feedback, 
APL undertook to realign the route of the new section of Access Road 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
90 
 
associated with Option B. Option B was modified to curve further south 
and avoid the area of Ancient Woodland. 
Alternative Routes for the Gas Connection 
 
A gas connection feasibility study was undertaken in March 2014 to define 
and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating Equipment 
to a suitable source of fuel gas. This identified Feeder 28 of the National Gas 
Transmission System or a nearby Local Transmission System pipeline as 
possible connection points. 
 
Investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the National Gas 
Transmission System or Local Transmission System pipelines within a 
predetermined Gas Connection Opportunity Area were carried out, 
considering in particular the length, the number of crossings required, 
environmental effects and cost. 
 
Four principal potential connection route options were explored further 
leading to the identification of a single preferred route for the Gas Connection. 
Due regard was paid to relevant factors including environmental, planning, 
safety, engineering and constructability in selecting the preferred route. 
 
Route 2b was chosen as the preferred route for the Gas Connection and is 
therefore the route which has been fully assessed in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  Although not the shortest route, it has lower risks and avoids 
ecologically significant habitats, such as rough pasture and deciduous 
woodland. 
 
 Alternative Solutions for the Electrical Connection 
 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Project in March 2014 
in order to define and evaluate the options available for connecting the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS for the export of electricity.  The Project 
will connect into a Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) generator bay within the 
Substation.  The Applicant received an offer of a Bilateral Connection 
Agreement and Construction Agreement from National Grid Electricity 
Transmission plc (NGET) on 23rd February 2018 (the Connection Agreement) 
to connect the Generating Equipment to the NETS. 
 
Both underground cables and overhead lines were initially considered.  
However, underground cables were selected as the preferred option in order 
to minimise visual impact.  In the 2014 PEIR, it was noted that the cable would 
be installed beneath the road.  It has now been decided that the cable will be 
laid alongside the road for ease of maintenance. 
 
The Electrical Connection Opportunity Area, to the south west of the 
Generating Equipment Site, is the area within which the route for the 
Electrical Connection has been identified. In July 2014, the chosen route was 
identified during a site walkover of the Electrical Connection Opportunity 
Area. A limited number of route corridor options for the Electrical Connection 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
91 
 
were considered, as the most appropriate option i.e. the shortest, most direct 
route from the Generating Equipment Site to the Substation, requiring the 
least amount of land take and avoiding any statutory designated sites or 
valued habitats, was available. This negated the need to assess any less 
favourable options. 
 
 Good Design  
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1, APL has sought to employ 
good design at all stages of the Project’s development. APL has undertaken 
suitable studies of the local habitats, accesses, heritage features and 
landscape to enable the design to respond to place. Suitable setbacks and 
replacement/reinforcement and new planting is proposed to integrate the 
Project into its local ecological and landscape context and provide mitigation 
for habitat loss. Impacts on the drainage regime of the local area will be 
minimised through the provision of ponds and other natural and semi natural 
features providing ecological mitigation. Careful management of soils during 
construction works pursuant to the Outline Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) (Appendix 3.1 of Document Reference 6.2)  shall 
facilitate plant growth. The process of designing these and reasons for design 
choices are set out in: ES (Document Reference 6.1), specifically Chapters 
5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and the Flood Consequences Assessment (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 9.1), and the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1 of 
Document Reference 6.2). The resultant design principles that will guide 
detailed design are set out in the Design Principles Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2) which is secured by a requirement in the draft DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1). 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1, and as set out in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), the siting has sought to demonstrate good design 
having regard to a number of constraints in the immediate vicinity, namely: 
• Avoidance of utilities such as the 1.68 m cast iron water main and the 
decommissioned Oil Pipeline (which bisect the site under the 
Gallops), and the National Gas Transmission System; 
• Avoidance of landfill to north; 
• Avoidance of higher topography to the north west which would be 
more visible in key views; 
• Avoidance of woodland to the east; 
• Avoidance of solar farms to the north, south, east and west; and 
• Avoidance of field boundaries, ancient woodland and mature trees as 
far as reasonably possible (being wildlife/ heritage features). 
 
Furthermore, the Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.4) and Outline Landscape and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
92 
 
Ecology Mitigation Plan (Document Reference 6.3, Figure 3.6) are secured 
by a requirement in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1) and 
demonstrates the applicant’s regard to minimising and mitigating effects on 
the existing landscape, and the reinforcement to the existing landscape 
features that will be provided where possible.  
 
In addition, in accordance with paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1, and as far as 
is reasonably practical, the Power Generation Plant will use materials which 
can be disposed of sustainably (e.g. easily re-usable or recyclable) when the 
plant has reached the end of its life but primarily have been selected for their 
durability and safety across a 25-year lifespan. The technology chosen, 
OCGT, has an inherently low requirement for process water. The Outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.4) will enhance the area’s biodiversity through the retention of 
existing woodland and the planting of belts of trees to increase the amount of 
woodland in the area and the reinstatement of planting where possible and 
appropriate. Careful management of soils will be undertaken during 
construction works pursuant to the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.1) to facilitate plant growth. Habitat management and other 
ecological works will be provided pursuant to the Outline Landscape and 
Ecology Management Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.4). 
Flood risk has been assessed and has informed the layout and levels of the 
Generating Equipment Site and other parts of the Project in the Flood 
Consequences Assessment (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 9.1). 
Accordingly, it is considered that sustainability, durability, and adaptability 
have been suitably considered and are secured in the draft DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1). 
 
The process of design evolution, and the reasons for key design choices, with 
regards to paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1, are documented in the ES, in 
particular, Chapter 5 (Document Reference 6.1) and the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.1), in particular Chapter 10. The Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.1.0) explains the consultation process and the 
responses received which influenced the design. Visual impact, access 
routes/road and landscape treatment were amongst the design matters that 
were influenced by comments from consultees.  
 
The Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2.) draws 
together the findings of the various documents as they relate to design, and 
establish firm and deliverable commitments to good design to guide the 
detailed design. These commitments are secured by a requirement in the 
draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1) to the effect that implementation is 
undertaken substantially in compliance with the Design Principles Statement. 
 
To assist with decision-making under paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1, the 
main operational, safety and security requirements are set out in the ES. The 
authorised works on the Works Plans (Document Reference 2.3) are 
designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the likely operational 
requirements (and thus a deliverable energy generation project) and 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

minimising visual effects.  The Design Principles (Document Reference 10.2) 
also assists in achieving this balance.  The design has also sought to use the 
site layout in the most efficient way, by locating plant items in close proximity 
to connections (e.g. gas and electrical infrastructure) and by locating the 
Power Generation Plant so that it benefits from the maximum screening 
effects of the local topography. The work packages and the Design Principles 
Statement (Document Reference 10.2) are designed to achieve an 
appropriate balance between the likely operational requirements (and thus a 
deliverable energy generation project) and minimising visual effects. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1, APL registered for a 
Design Review in October 2014 which was duly convened in December 2014 
and attended also by a planning officer from CCS. The Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.1.0) sets out the feedback provided by DCfW.  
 
 The applicant will continue to liaise with the local authority, CCS, in agreeing 
detailed designs prior to construction such as on detailed matters as to 
planting and materials through the various requirements attached to the draft 
DCO (Document Reference 3.1) and in compliance with the Design 
Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2). 
 
 Consideration of Combined Heat and Power 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1, the Applicant has given 
due consideration to the potential inclusion of CHP alongside other 
alternatives from the outset of the Project, as set out in Chapter 5 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) and the Combined Heat and Power Technical 
Note (Document 6.2, Appendix 5.1). 
 
A detailed site identification process was undertaken which considered a 
range of sites around England and Wales for gas fired power generation 
plants. Abergelli Farm was identified as appropriate in terms of where it 
connected to the grid, which is a key consideration.  
 
To understand any heat demands in the area, an assessment of the DECC 
online heat map was carried out and this identified no appropriate heat off 
take opportunities proximate to the national gas and electrical networks in the 
locality, even if the chosen technology and operating mode (peaking) were 
capable of providing CHP.  
 
As discussed in Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), APL has 
undertaken a number of further studies in order to refine the technology 
choice and location for the Project. The outcome of these studies has 
determined that a simple OCGT is the most suitable technology choice for a 
peaking plant generating up to 299 MWe at the Project Site. This has been 
determined based on a number of environmental, economic and technical 
considerations.  This peaking plant operating mode is too intermittent for a 
heat offtake, and the OCGT technology involves no steam cycle to form the 
offtake. Based on the information above, it can be concluded that there are 
prohibitive barriers to the application of CHP at the site: 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
94 
 
• There is no existing regional heat market. From local searches, there 
are no suitable heat users of applicable scale available and none able 
to accept the unpredictable supply of heat available. 
• The intermittent and peaking modes of operation of OCGT are 
incompatible with the likely continuous demands of heat users. 
• No potential future heat requirements in the area have been identified 
and none are currently anticipated that would match the irregular 
operational pattern of a peaking plant. 
 
It is therefore considered that due regard has been paid to relevant guidance 
as required by NPS EN-1, both past and current, and that the general 
requirement to provide for CHP should be set aside due to the particular 
operating mode of the proposed Power Generation Plant, which will serve a 
need recognised in NPS EN-1 for flexible gas generation.  
 
 Carbon Capture and Storage and Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) 
 
The Project would not meet or exceed the threshold of 300 MW and so is 
therefore not required to demonstrate Carbon Capture Readiness on the 
basis of section 4.7 of NPS EN-1. 
 
 Climate Change Adaptation 
 
APL has undertaken detailed assessment work to consider the potential 
impacts of climate change for the Project, in accordance with paragraphs 
4.8.5, 4.8.7 and 4.8.9 of NPS EN-1, as set out within the Flood 
Consequences Assessment (Document Reference 6.2; Appendix 9.1).  A 
number of Project alternatives have been assessed by APL, taking into 
account a range of environmental factors, as set out with Chapter 5 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). The ES (Document Reference 6.1) contains a 
number of technical chapters (including chapters relating to air quality, 
ecology, water quality and resources, and geology and ground conditions), 
referred to throughout this Planning Statement, which include consideration 
of the potential impacts of climate change and set out appropriate mitigation 
measures where necessary. 
 
 Grid Connection 
 
As set out in the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0), in 
accordance with paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1, APL has consulted National 
Grid as part of the statutory consultation. Consultation responses were 
subsequently received from both National Grid plc and NGET in November 
2014 and February 2018. 
 
APL entered into a Connection Agreement with NGET on 23 February 2018 
to connect the Generating Equipment to the NETS. The Connection 
Agreement provides for a connection in September 2022. As such it can be 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
95 
 
confirmed that the principle of a connection that provides for the Generating 
Equipment to export its output to the NETS has been secured. 
 
The responsibilities for designing and building the grid connection, and 
consenting the substation extension, are set out in Chapters 4 and 7 
respectively of the Grid Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1) 
and in the details of other consents and licences document (Document 
Reference 5.4).  
 
Accordingly the requirements of NPS EN-1 are considered to be met. 
 
 Pollution Control and Other Environmental Regulatory Regimes 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1, Chapter 2 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) sets out the overall regulatory framework that is 
relevant to the Application. APL acknowledges that some issues may be 
subject to separate regulatory regimes, and has prepared a Details of Other 
Consents and Licenses document (Document Reference 5.4) which sets out 
details of the other consents and licenses required and when they will be 
applied for.  
 
 The requirement for additional consents and licences is also referenced and 
considered within Chapter 6 (Air Quality), Chapter 7 (Noise and Vibration) 
and Chapter 9 (Water Quality) of the ES and would be obtained at the 
relevant stages prior to, during or following the operation of the Project.  The 
Applicant is in ongoing discussions with NRW regarding the Environmental 
Permit that will be required for the Project. 
 
 Safety / Hazardous Substances 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.11.1 and 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1 and as 
documented in the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) the 
Applicant consulted the HSE during statutory consultation.  A response was 
received from HSE in November 2014 and February 2018. 
 
The HSE has advised that the Project will be in close proximity to a number 
of Major Accident Hazard pipelines located mainly to the north of the Project 
Site, being the National Gas Transmission System which the Project seeks 
to connect into. HSE has advised the Applicant to consider the requirement 
for Hazardous Substances Consent if the Project is intending to store or use 
any of the Named Hazardous Substances or Categories of Substances and 
Preparations at or above the controlled quantities.  APL envisages that only 
small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the 
Generating Equipment Site at any time, and such substances will be held in 
secured containers to prevent contaminant migration. Additionally, the 
Project would not impinge on the separation distances required in respect of 
any explosives licensed sites in the vicinity of the Project Site.  
 
It is therefore not anticipated that Hazardous Substances Consent will be 
required and accordingly the Details of Other Consents and Licences 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
96 
 
document (Document Reference 5.4) does not identify this consent being 
required. In the unlikely event it proves to be required, an application would 
be made at the appropriate time. 
 
 Health 
 
It is considered that, due to the nature of the Project, there is the potential for 
adverse effects on human health, primarily relating to exposure to excessive 
levels of noise and exposure to pollutants released during construction or 
operation of the Project.   
 
As such, in accordance with paragraph 4.13.2 of NPS EN-1, the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) assesses the impacts of the Project in respect of 
health and sets out appropriate measures to address these impacts as 
appropriate. Section 15.3) of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), summarises 
the likely effects of the Project on Public Health, as explained further in 
Chapters 6 (Air Quality), 9 (Ground Water Contamination), and 10 (Land 
Contamination) of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). The relevant topic 
chapters describe the risk assessment undertaken, the proposed mitigation 
measures and residual impacts of the Project.  
 
With regard to EMFs, section 15.3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
explains that no significant effects would be expected due to the shielding to 
underground cables from their sheaths and the limited additional works 
above ground taking place in an existing high voltage substation with EMFs 
present and which the public do not access.  
 
In relation to Air Quality, with the measures adopted in the Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1, secured by a requirement in the 
draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1)) dust and particulate health risks 
should not arise, whilst due to the adequate dispersion provided by the stack, 
no significant effects on public health or ecological receptors are likely.  
 
In relation to noise, noise surveys were undertaken at locations agreed with 
CCS and the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) will 
minimise residual impacts during construction to non-significant levels, whilst 
during operation, silencer equipment will minimise residual impacts on the 
identified receptors to non-significant levels during operation.  
 
With regard to pollution and contamination, groundwater and worker health 
impacts are not expected either during construction with the Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) implemented or during operation 
with the operational environmental management plan secured through the 
EP regarding spillages/washing of equipment.  
 
Cumulative effects with other schemes in the area are similarly considered 
likely to be non-significant.  
 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
97 
 
 
Common law nuisance and statutory nuisance 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1, possible sources of 
nuisance have been considered, with mitigation identified where relevant, in 
the Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 (EPA) (Document Reference 5.3).  This document 
explains the condition of the Project Site, and findings as to potential air 
quality impacts, noise levels, artificial lighting and health effects generated by 
the Project during both construction and operation, and concludes that with 
the identified mitigation in place the construction and operation of the Project 
is unlikely to give rise to common law nuisance or statutory nuisance.  
 
The statement concludes that, for all relevant potential sources of nuisance, 
the application of embedded mitigation measures, as identified in the report 
and which are secured in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1), will 
prevent impacts which are considered to have the potential to result in 
statutory nuisance under section 79(1) of the EPA 1990. 
 
Accordingly it is considered that the Project is in accordance with relevant 
NPS policy relating to common law nuisance and statutory nuisance. 
 
 Security Considerations 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1, the Applicant has 
considered appropriate security measures associated with the Project. 
During construction these are governed by the Outline CEMP (Document 6.2, 
Appendix 3.1).  
 
As explained in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), during construction of the 
Project, the perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site will be cleared of 
undergrowth and a permanent or temporary security fence placed with locked 
gates for main and emergency exits (capable of being opened in an 
emergency). Physical management of the Access Road will also be 
employed to ensure the security and safety of all staff. 
 
Lighting columns will be erected around the perimeter of the Generating 
Equipment Site in order to provide security lighting and lighting for safe 
working in dark conditions. The lighting columns would be approximately 8 m 
in height and regularly spaced around the perimeter of the Generating 
Equipment Site. This is outlined in the Outline Lighting Strategy (Document 
Reference 6.2., Appendix 3.6). 
 
No national security considerations have been identified in respect of the 
Project. Further, As documented in the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1.0) no statutory consultation responses were received raising 
relevant security concerns. 
 
Accordingly, it is considered that the Project is in accordance with relevant 
NPS policy in this regard.

 Air quality and emissions 
 
In accordance with paragraphs 5.2.1 and 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1, an 
assessment of the likely impacts, in respect of air quality and emissions, has 
been undertaken in the EIA and findings are presented in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), which is submitted as part of the Application.  The impacts of 
the Project in respect of air quality and emissions have been examined at the 
construction/demolition and operational phases, in compliance with the 
requirements of NPS EN-1. 
 
Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) provides an assessment of 
the impacts on air quality as a result of the Project.  
 
During the construction / decommissioning of the Project, the main potential 
effect is dust generated from construction.  
 
In order to mitigate potential impacts during the construction phase, an 
Outline CEMP has been prepared (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1).  
As part of the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), 
embedded mitigation relating to air quality is to be implemented, including 
dust management measures. Full reference to mitigation measures may be 
found in the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1). With 
the mitigation measures implemented via the Outline CEMP (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), the assessment concludes that no significant 
impacts are anticipated from the construction of the Project. 
 
During operation, Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) concludes 
the magnitude of the impacts on pollutant concentrations are considered to 
be negligible for all pollutant and averaging periods considered within the 
dispersion modelling. As such, impacts on air quality as a result of the Project 
are therefore not considered to be significant.  No additional mitigation or 
monitoring is therefore proposed. 
 
As set out above, and presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), 
following implementation of mitigation there is no expectation of any 
significant adverse impacts in respect of air quality and emissions. 
Accordingly, the proposals meet the aims and requirements of NPS EN-1, 
and thus the Project is considered acceptable in respect of air quality and 
emissions. 
 
 Biodiversity and geological conservation 
 
In accordance with paragraph 5.3.3 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the 
likely effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of 
ecological or geological conservation importance, on protected species, and 
on habitats and other species of principal importance has been undertaken 
in the EIA, and the findings are presented in Chapters 8 (Biodiversity) and 10 
(Geology and Ground Conditions) of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
99 
 
 
The impacts of the Project, in respect of biodiversity and geological 
conservation, have been considered at the construction, operation and 
decommissioning stage (set out below), in compliance with section 5.3 of 
NPS EN-1. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 5.3.18 of NPS EN-1, a variety of measures 
would be used to avoid, minimise and mitigate impacts during construction, 
as set out in the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) and 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 
6.2, Appendix 3.4). 
 
In accordance with paragraph 5.3.8 of NPS EN-1, the areas of work are to 
be delineated carefully to minimise disturbance to local habitats and 
protected species. The Ancient Woodland, trees and habitats have been 
avoided as much as possible during the Project design development. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of NPS EN-1, an Outline Landscape 
and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document 6.2, Appendix 3.4) as secured by 
a requirement in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1) commits to, inter 
alia: replacement habitats and planting, comprising woodland/scrub, 
grassland (acid/marshy grassland mosaic), hedgerow and two wildlife ponds. 
 
NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.3.14 requires that ancient woodland loss or 
deterioration is justified by reference to the benefits (including need) of that 
development in that location compared to the loss of the woodland habitat.  
 
The Project has been designed to avoid Ancient Woodland as far as possible; 
however, construction of the Electrical Connection will lead to a permanent 
loss of a small proportion of Ancient Woodland habitat, which is considered 
to be a significant effect.  
 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.3.14, a justification for this loss 
in the terms required by the NPS is set out below, along with an explanation 
of how it has been minimised and would be compensated for. 
 
The small loss of Ancient Woodland will be due to the Electrical Connection 
only and is considered unavoidable in the context of the Project. The 
alternative road access which was previously consulted on would have a 
number of significant adverse impacts on road users and require 
road/junction widening in various locations, and was the subject of concerns 
during consultation on the two access road options, as documented in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) and Consultation Report (Document Reference 
5.1.0) respectively. APL undertook to realign the route of the new section of 
Access Road associated with Option B and Option B was modified to curve 
further south and avoid the area of Ancient Woodland. The location of the 
Generating Equipment Site and route of the Gas Pipeline have also been 
designed to avoid Ancient Woodland. 
 
is considered that overall the chosen Access Road access offers several 
important benefits (being a much shorter overall route from the motorway 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
100 
 
network both for construction and during operation for 25 years, requiring less 
construction due to its reuse of the existing National Grid access for much of 
its length, and more favoured during consultation from local occupiers and 
statutory consultees). It is further considered that local precedent and the 
substantial relevant mitigation is also relevant and important. The Substation 
and Felindre Gas Compressor Station adjacent involved the loss of ancient 
woodland and resulted in large new woodland planting areas that have 
contributed to the amenity and reinforced the landscape character of the 
area, and act to visually screen the nationally significant infrastructure that 
they surround. 
 
Furthermore, the benefits of the Project as a whole in this location are 
considered to outweigh this small loss of restored ancient woodland. The 
Project is suitably located taking into account all relevant considerations as 
discussed in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), being a location that is 
viable, deliverable, minimises construction impacts to the national gas and 
electrical networks, is away from existing and proposed major population 
areas, has good access, and is in relatively low-lying topography and away 
from all other ecological designations and significant environmental 
constraints.  
 
The Project represents a substantial and deliverable contribution to the 
overall urgent need for flexible generating stations as evidenced in NPS EN-
1, the Gas Generation Strategy, the National Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
2016-2021, and Energy Wales – A Low Carbon Transition 2014, and 
represents a significant scale of economic development at the national and 
local level in accordance with Planning Policy Wales and the CCS UDP and 
emerging LDP, which in line with Paragraph 5.3.14 fall to be weighed against 
a small loss of restored ancient woodland.  
 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.3.4, it is considered that the 
Applicant has taken all reasonable opportunities to benefit ecological 
conservation interests, whilst remaining compatible with safe and practical 
operation of a power station and minimising impacts on the surrounding 
agricultural uses and landscape/vegetation pattern.  
 
Accordingly it is considered that the requirements of NPS policy are met in 
this regard. 
 
 Civil and military aviation and defence interests 
 
In accordance with S42 of the PA 2008, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 
was consulted on the Project. Responses were received from the CAA in 
October 2014 and February 2018, whereby the CAA noted the relatively close 
proximity of Swansea Airport to the development site and recommended that 
consultation takes place with Swansea Airport and that any concerns 
expressed are taken into account. The Project falls outside of the defined 
safeguarding zones requiring statutory consultation with Swansea Airport.  
Notwithstanding this, upon the CAA’s advice, Swansea Airport was supplied 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
101 
 
with information about the Project as part of the consultation process and no 
reply was received.  
 
NPS EN-1 states that the decision maker will wish to be satisfied that the 
effects on civil and military aviation and other defence assets have been 
addressed by the applicant.  In this instance, and taking into account that the 
CAA and NATS raised no objections during statutory consultation (see 
Consultation Report Appendices (Document Reference 5.2; Appendix 9.1), 
the Project is not considered to have any conflicts or require mitigation.  
 
Accordingly, the Project is considered to be acceptable in respect of civil and 
military aviation and defence interests in accordance with section 5.4 of NPS 
EN-1. 
 
 Dust, odour, artificial light, smoke, steam and insect infestation 
 
In accordance with paragraph 5.6.4 of NPS EN-1, a full assessment has 
been undertaken of the potential emissions resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project and is recorded in Chapter 6 
of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), together with appropriate mitigation 
measures.   
 As set out within the Air Quality chapter of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
it is considered unlikely that there will be significant effects on air quality 
associated with the construction and decommissioning of the Project. The 
impacts relating to construction and decommissioning activities are all 
temporary. Furthermore, there are no significant impacts on air quality 
anticipated from the operation of the Project.  
 In accordance with section 5.6 of NPS EN-1, a number of measures would 
be implemented in order to mitigate the potential impact of dust and 
particulate matter emissions. During construction an Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) would be implemented. The Outline 
CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) employs the use of Best 
Practicable Measures (BPM) to minimise the risk of adverse effects from 
construction dust and causing nuisance or damage to flora and fauna. The 
Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) also proposes the 
use of dust monitoring to ensure that dust generated by construction works 
does not exceed levels which could constitute a nuisance. 
 Odours, smoke, steam and insect infestation will not arise with the proposed 
technology choice. In respect of artificial light, the Outline CEMP (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) provides a summary of artificial lighting 
required during the construction of the Project, and the measures employed 
to ensure that the adverse effects of artificial lighting are minimised during 
construction. 
 In accordance with paragraph 5.6.4 of NPS EN-1, and as explained in the 
Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection 
Act 1990 (Document Reference 5.3), the application of mitigation measures 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
102 
 
will prevent any significant adverse impacts arising from the Project in respect 
of these potential issues. The Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of 
the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Document Reference 5.3) has also 
been prepared – fulfilling regulation 5(2)(f) of the AFFP Regulations – to 
assess the condition of the site, potential air quality impacts, noise levels, 
artificial lighting and health effects generated by the Project throughout its 
various stages, concludes “in all cases, the application of embedded 
mitigation measures will prevent impacts which are considered to have the 
potential to result in statutory nuisance under section 79(1) of the EPA 1990.”  
Flood risk 
 The Project Site is greater than 1 ha in area and therefore a Flood 
Consequences Assessment (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 9.1) has 
been undertaken and is submitted as part of the Application, in accordance 
with paragraph 5.7.4 of NPS EN-1. The FCA identifies sources of potential 
flooding, the risk of flooding to the Project Site, the potential impacts of 
flooding to the Project and third parties, and identifies possible measures 
which could reduce flood consequences to acceptable levels. The FCA is 
prepared in accordance with TAN15: Development and Flood Risk.  
 The FCA classifies the proposed development as “highly vulnerable” to 
flooding in accordance with TAN15 classifications. However, the FCA has 
also found that, as the Project Site is in a rural location, minor changes in 
flood routes and flood levels in the immediate vicinity will not have any 
significant impacts on third parties. The Project is considered to have a low 
or negligible impact on flooding in the wider area.  
 The FCA has found that there are not likely to be any significant impacts 
resulting from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project 
with regards to flooding, in accordance with paragraph 5.7.9 of NPS EN-1.  
Accordingly, the Project meets the overall objectives of relevant planning 
policy and is considered acceptable in respect of flood risk. 
 
 Historic environment 
 A full assessment has been undertaken in the EIA of the potential impacts of 
the Project on the historic environment, and the findings are presented in 
Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), in accordance with 
paragraphs 5.8.1 and 5.8.8 of NPS EN-1. 
 The potential for unknown archaeological remains is considered to be low 
across the Project Site, however a large portion of the fields that lie within the 
footprint of the Generating Equipment Site have not been subject to 
significant ground disturbance.  
 A requirement has been included in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1) 
which will require a written scheme of investigation to be prior approved by 
CCS and then to be carried out, in accordance with section 5.8 of NPS EN-
1. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
103 
 
 As set out above and explained in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), it is 
anticipated that, as no significant impacts on archaeology or cultural heritage 
are expected as a result of the Project, the Project meets the aims and 
requirements of relevant planning policy and is considered acceptable in 
respect of the impact on the historic environment. 
 
 Landscape and visual 
 An assessment of the likely landscape and visual impacts of the Project has 
been undertaken and the findings are presented in Chapter 11 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), in accordance with paragraphs 5.9.1, 5.9.5 and 
5.9.7 of NPS EN-1. 
 During the construction of the Project, some potential temporary landscape 
and visual effects will arise from construction activities. Where necessary, 
these will be managed via strategies set out in the Outline CEMP (Document 
6.2, Appendix 3.1).  
 The construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), 
and therefore significant mitigation to limit landscape and visual impacts is 
not anticipated. Nonetheless, section 3.11 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) outlines the mitigation measures which will be implemented during the 
construction phase in order to specifically limit impacts on landscape and 
visual amenity in the surrounding area. These measures include the 
following:  
• The use of tall hoardings to screen views of ground level construction 
activities in relation to sensitive; 
• Materials and machinery will be stored tidily during the construction 
works; 
• Lighting of compounds and work sites will be restricted to agreed 
working hours and those which are necessary for security; 
• Unnecessary removal of vegetation will be avoided; 
• Retention and protection of existing trees; 
• Public roads providing access to construction site will be maintained 
free of dust and mud; 
• The Contractor will clear and clean all working areas and accesses as 
work proceeds and when no longer required for the works; 
• On completion of construction works, all structures, equipment, 
surplus materials, waste, notice boards and temporary fences used 
during construction will be removed from the Project Site with 
minimum damage to the surrounding area; and  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
104 
 
• Prompt reinstatement of areas that are no longer required following 
construction. 
 During the operation of the Power Generation Plant, the main visual impact 
is associated with the stack.  Of the 19 representative viewpoints assessed, 
5 of the viewpoints would experience significant effects once the Project is 
operational. However, much of the Project Site itself will be screened by 
existing vegetation and local topography and this will reduce the visual 
effects. This will be strengthened with planting as part of the Outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.4). Structures on the Project Site have also been designed to 
reduce glare and to assimilate the Project into the surrounding landscape as 
much as possible. It is also notable that OCGT allows a significant reduction 
in stack height compared to other technology types. 
 During operation, landscape mitigation measures will be implemented 
through a requirement in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1) for 
implementation to be in substantial compliance with the outline Landscape 
and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.4) 
and Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan (Document Reference 
6.3, Figure 3.6).  
 Accordingly, it is considered that the design of the Project has been subject 
to detailed consideration and assessment in order to minimise the landscape 
impacts and visual intrusion wherever feasible.  The Project meets the aims 
and requirements of relevant planning policy, and no important and relevant 
considerations arise to the contrary, thus the Project is considered 
acceptable in respect of landscape and visual amenity. 
 
 Land use including open space, green infrastructure and Green Belt 
 The Project has sought to locate away from homes and strategic employment 
and housing proposals in the UDP and emerging LDP, in accordance with 
section 5.10 of NPS EN-1, in particular, to locate away from Policy EC1 
which allocates 190 ha of employment land at Felindre Strategic Business 
Park, located approximately 1.5 km to the south-west of the Project Site, in 
order to meet the growth needs of the local economy.  
 The Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) describes the views of 
the community, including local businesses, during the various consultation 
exercises undertaken in respect of the Project and location of the Project Site.  
 As stated in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the agricultural land 
classification for the land within and surrounding the Project Site is grade 4 
(poor quality agricultural land).  Therefore, the Project Site is considered to 
be suitably sited so as to minimise impacts on high quality, versatile 
agricultural land in accordance with paragraph 5.10.8 of NPS EN-1. 
 The Project Site is predominantly agricultural land, used for keeping horses 
and sheep with associated farm buildings and residential properties. There

will be no deleterious effect upon the farm’s viability from the construction of 
the Project due to the relatively low grade of land it represents (Grade 4, 
suitable for grazing); and the siting and setting out of the Project that will allow 
activities to continue elsewhere on the farmholding.  
 APL has sought to adopt good design principles as part of the Project, 
including its layout, in accordance with paragraph 5.10.19 of NPS EN-1.  As 
set out in the Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2), the 
form, scale, massing and landscaping has been designed so that the Power 
Generation Plant integrates with its surroundings, minimising visual intrusion 
from key viewpoints, and minimises its impacts on nearby land uses such as 
housing, energy developments, and agriculture, through siting and layout. 
 The Project should also be considered against the relevant UDP and 
emerging LDP policies applying to the land it covers. An assessment of 
compliance with these policies is provided at section 6.4 of this Planning 
Statement. 
 
 Noise and vibration 
 An assessment of the likely noise and vibration impacts associated with the 
Project has been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented in 
Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), in accordance with 
paragraphs 5.11.1 and 5.11.4 of NPS EN-1. A Statement of Engagement of 
Section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Document 
Reference 5.3) has also been prepared – fulfilling regulation 5(2)(f) of the 
AFFP Regulations – to assess the existing conditions of the Project Site, 
potential air quality impacts, noise and vibration and artificial lighting 
generated by the Project. The noise and vibration effects have been 
considered at the construction, operation and decommissioning stage, in 
accordance with the requirements of section 5.11 of NPS EN-1. 
 During the construction of the Project, noise will be emitted by construction 
activities for the Generation Equipment Site and Access Road. Noise will also 
be emitted by construction traffic; however this will represent a temporary, 
intermittent noise increase, and will vary as day-to-day progress is made. In 
order to minimise the effects during construction, an Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) will be implemented. Section 6.2 of 
the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) outlines the 
potential sources of nuisance noise created by construction works, and the 
methods of mitigation proposed to limit these impacts. Accordingly, the noise 
and vibration effects of the Project are considered to have been minimised 
as far as is reasonable and are acceptable.  
 During operation of the Power Generation Plant, the assessment for the 
daytime period shows that the magnitude of operational noise impact is 
predicted to be minor adverse and therefore not significant.  
 In accordance with paragraph 5.11.12 of NPS EN-1, the Project Site layout 
design has been considered in detail to ensure that the noise and vibration

Abergelli Power Project  
 
106 
 
impacts 
of 
the 
Project 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning phases are mitigated as far as possible. 
 With regard to noise and vibration, the Project meets the aims and 
requirements of relevant planning policy, and no important and relevant 
considerations arise to the contrary, thus the Project is considered 
acceptable in respect of noise and vibration. 
 
 Socio-economic 
 A socio-economic assessment has been undertaken as part of the EIA and 
is set out within Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), in 
accordance with paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1.  The socio-economic 
assessment identifies the likely significance of effects on the local, regional 
and national economy from the Project including the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Project.  The assessment shows that socio-
economic benefits will be provided by the Project through the creation of local 
and national jobs and workers spending in the local economy. 
 In terms of construction labour impacts, with a construction period estimated 
to last approximately 22 months from early 2020 to 2022, and taking into 
account the type of work likely at this site, the number of construction workers 
onsite per month is estimated to range from 25 to 122 during the peak 
construction period.  
 The annual construction GVA per head in Wales is £76,725, therefore the 
construction phase is likely to deliver £7.1 million GVA to the wider economy 
annually, benefitting the local and Wales economy. Taking into account 
numbers and types of workers, the construction work generated could be 
readily absorbed by the local labour market. 
 Local accommodation availability has been assessed and 100% of workers 
would be able to be accommodated nearby, benefitting hotel and related 
businesses. 
 In terms of ongoing labour impacts, the assessment has found that the 
operational phase of the Project would provide an estimated 10 FTE direct 
jobs.  The net effect, taking account of the leakage, displacement and 
multiplier effects shown above would be 6 additional regional FTE jobs and 
5.5 national FTE jobs.  Based on an average GVA per utility employee in 
Wales of £91,053, the Project’s operation would provide approximately 
£0.55m GVA and £0.5m GVA per annum to the local and national economy 
respectively.   
 Whilst skilled, specialist permanent roles would be needed, the labour market 
locally is likely to be capable of absorbing the requirement: the operational 
workforce requirement accounts for less than 2% of the local electricity and 
gas labour force and less than 1% of the working age, economically active 
and highly skilled, skilled and unskilled labour force.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
107 
 
 Decommissioning impacts are not expected to exceed those of the 
construction phase. Decommissioning will be governed by a strategy for the 
prior approval of CCS pursuant to a requirement in the draft DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1). 
 The baseline situation in respect of tourist attractions and facilities has been 
studied, with a 10 km radius study area defined (Document Reference 6.1, 
Figure 14.2). It has been found that there are a limited number of tourist 
attractions within the tourism study area. Most of the tourist attractions in the 
wider area are located in the city of Swansea.  
 A tourism business survey was undertaken (as recorded in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) where the majority of respondents stated that they expected 
that the Project would have no impact on their business. Some businesses 
felt that they would benefit at the construction phase through related demand 
for accommodation, food and drink, and other services. 
 As set out above, the Project is likely to have a slightly beneficial effect on 
the local and Wales economy, with benefits during construction in particular 
but also during operation, and minimal and localised effects on the small 
number of tourism related businesses in the locality and none in the wider 
area. The Project therefore is considered to comply with the relevant NPS 
and all other relevant and important considerations.  
 
 Traffic, transport and access 
 In accordance with section 5.13 of NPS EN-1, a Transport Assessment has 
been carried out within Chapter 12 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
considering traffic flow, delay, highway safety and other relevant matters. 
 Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road and Footpath LC35B 
passes through the northern part of the Project Site. Where possible, 
connectivity will be maintained by the use of temporary diversions and 
working methods to allow the PROWs to remain open for the majority of the 
construction period. The proposed management of the PROW is set out in 
the Outline CTMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.3) and will be 
developed further in consultation with the PROW Officer at CCS. 
 The Outline CTMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.3) provides a 
framework for addressing the transport issues associated with the movement 
of construction traffic to serve the construction of the Project, including site 
access, routing, signage, HGV and abnormal loads, and operational matters. 
Its purpose is to set out the principles that the developer will follow to manage 
construction traffic during the construction of the Project. This will be secured 
via a DCO requirement (see Document Reference 3.1). With this mitigation 
in place, the assessment has identified that at worst the Project will have a 
moderate adverse effect, restricted to temporary effects at the three PROWs. 
 An Outline Construction Staff Travel Plan (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.3) has been prepared in accordance with paragraph 5.13.4 of 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
108 
 
NPS EN-1. The aim of a Travel Plan is to provide workers with sustainable 
travel choices to get to and from a place of work, and where possible, seek 
to reduce single occupancy vehicle use. Use of the Travel Plan will be 
secured via a DCO requirement.  
 The traffic generation of the Project during the operational phase is expected 
to be minimal, comprising approximately 30 movements per day (two 
movements per staff member for a shift pattern of up to 15 permanent staff).  
The significance of the effect is anticipated to be negligible. 
 In summary, the traffic and transport effects of the Project assessed are 
anticipated to be negligible or minor adverse, with the exception of moderate 
effects which are therefore significant upon PROW during construction.  
However, these effects are temporary and will be minimised through 
implementation of the Outline CTMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 
3.3).  Accordingly, the Project is considered to meet the aims and 
requirements of relevant NPS policy and thus the Project is considered 
acceptable in respect of traffic and transport. 
 
Waste Management 
 In accordance with paragraphs 5.14.1 and 5.14.6 of NPS EN-1, wherever 
practicably possible waste will be avoided; however, where necessary, waste 
will be managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy.  As set out in 
Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) will seek to apply the waste 
hierarchy – consisting of (in order of preference): prevention; re-use; 
recycling; other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and disposal – during all 
phases of the Project as part of their waste prevention and management 
policy.  Measures will include, amongst others, the appropriate storage of 
excavated spoil and testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria to determine 
whether it can be re-used on or off-site (see Chapter 15 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). 
 A small amount of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste is expected to 
arise from the Power Generation Plant during operation. Final types and 
volumes have not yet been confirmed but will be restricted to the following: 
general office wastes; used gas turbine air intake filters; small quantities of 
water from compressor blade washing; separated oil/sludge from any 
oil/water separators on site, and use oil, chemicals or chemical containers; 
and other miscellaneous wastes. Only small quantities of potentially 
hazardous waste are to be stored on the Generating Equipment Site and 
waste will be held in secure containers to prevent contamination migration. 
 During decommissioning, a number of waste types are likely to arise, all of 
which will be suitable for recovery, reuse or recycling. It is not predicted that 
significant quantities of residual waste requiring disposal will arise. There is 
good provision of waste management capacity in South West Wales to cover 
all types of waste arising. All waste generation during the operational phase 
will be handled and stored under appropriate waste management legislation.  
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
109 
 
 As explained in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, there are not predicted to be likely 
significant effects on waste management and public health as a result of the 
Project.  Accordingly, the Project meets the aims and requirements of 
relevant planning policy, and no important or relevant considerations arise to 
the contrary, and thus the Project is considered acceptable in respect of 
waste management. 
 
 Water Quality and Resources 
 An assessment of the impact of the Project on the existing water quality and 
resources has been considered at the construction, operation and 
decommissioning stage (set out below), in compliance with the requirements 
of section 5.15 of NPS EN-1. 
 During construction, the Water Quality and Resources assessment 
(Document Reference 6.1, Chapter 9) considers the principal impacts of the 
works with respect to water quality and resources comprising the following:  
• Pollution impacts on surface watercourses and groundwater 
associated with: 
o increased sediment loads in site runoff containing elevated 
suspended sediment levels disturbed during site clearance; 
o the release of hydrocarbons and oils due to a large number of 
vehicles accessing the site, leakages from temporary oil/fuel 
storage tanks and accidental spillages; and 
o accidental leaks of hazardous materials, such as concrete and 
cement products, which can be contained in uncontrolled wash-
down water and surface water runoff;  
o dewatering of excavations and the discharge of potentially 
polluted/high sediment loading water to the water receptors; 
and 
o pollution from dust and debris. 
 The potential impacts for the Project are very similar to those for the Power 
Generation Plant, which is considered to have the most significant impacts 
on the water environment.  
 During operation of the Power Generation Plant, the key risks to the water 
environment include:  
• Pollution from oil (lubrication etc.) and fuels leakage from storage 
facilities or resulting from accidental spillages during delivery which 
may be carried by surface water runoff discharging to the water 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
110 
 
environment through the proposed surface water drainage system; 
and 
• Water quality impacts associated with treated wastewater discharges. 
 In accordance with paragraphs 5.15.9 and 5.15.10 of NPS EN-1, the design 
of the Power Generation Plant has been subject to detailed consideration and 
assessment in order to minimise the impact on water quality and resources, 
as explained in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and secured 
by the implementation of the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.1) and Outline Surface Water Management Plan (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.2).   
 During operation, as set out in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), NRW will control the quality of water that is discharged from the Project 
Site under the Environmental Permit.  Any surface water contaminated by 
hydrocarbons will be passed through interceptors prior to discharge. 
Operational site drainage will be appropriately designed to meet the needs of 
the Project.  
 Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) sets out that, during 
construction, a series of embedded design mitigation measures will be 
implemented in respect of water resources.  Following the implementation of 
embedded mitigation measures, it is concluded in Chapter 9 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) that impacts associated with the construction, 
operation and decommissioning phases are not significant.   
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) 
 NPS EN-2 is the relevant technology specific NPS for the Application. 
 Part 2 of NPS EN-2 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specifically associated with fossil fuel 
generating stations.  With reference to section 5.2 of this Planning Statement, 
this section provides an assessment of the Project in respect of 2 of NPS EN-

Factors influencing site selection by developers 
 In deciding upon the location of the Project Site, the Applicant undertook a 
detailed feasibility assessment having regard to a number of technical, 
environmental, and economic factors in accordance with paragraphs 2.2.1 
and 2.2.2 of NPS EN-2.  As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, the 
Applicant looked at a range of sites around the UK to support power 
generation plants of this nature. This search for potential power generation 
plant sites across the UK was focused on areas that were capable of meeting 
the Applicant’s strategic project development criteria:  
• Acceptable proximity to the national gas transmission system & the 
national electricity transmission system or local distribution networks;  
• Located within areas that are net importers of electricity; and 
• Located within areas of compatible land use designation/s. 
 In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough to 
support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and integral infrastructure) 
and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and electrical connection points 
were both key considerations, in line with NPS EN-2. 
 From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to close 
sensitive receptors such as residential properties or sites of ecological 
importance (to avoid unacceptable impacts from noise and visual 
disturbance), the current nature of the surrounding area (to limit impacts on 
the landscape character of the area), previous site uses and land quality (to 
avoid sterilisation of the best and most versatile agricultural land or mineral 
assets) and proximity to sensitive ecological habitats. 
 Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons: 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
112 
 
• It is in close proximity to a suitable electrical connection point; 
• It is in close proximity to a suitable gas connection point; 
• The Project Site does not include any nationally important 
environmental designations; 
• The land available is of an adequate size to accommodate the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
• The Project Site is largely situated on poor quality agricultural land 
(improved grassland classified as Grade 4 agricultural land); 
• It is in close proximity to similar industrial developments including the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and Swansea North Substation; 
• The surrounding network is within an area of net electricity import; and 
• It is in close proximity to a well-developed road network to the Project 
Site. 
Government policy criteria for fossil fuel generating stations 
 In accordance with the requirements of section 2.3 of NPS EN-2, APL has 
considered government policy criteria relating to CHP, CCR, Carbon Capture 
and Storage and climate change adaptation, as summarised below and 
explained throughout this Planning Statement and the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  
 Principally, CCR/Carbon Capture and Storage is not applicable to the Project 
as the Project would not meet or exceed the threshold of 300 MW set out in 
section 4.7 of NPS EN-1.  
 In relation to CHP, the CHP Technical Note (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 5.1) explains the consideration given to CHP as sought by NPS 
policy. It has been concluded that there are prohibitive barriers to the 
application of CHP at the site, as there is no existing regional heat market 
and the peaking modes of operation of OCGT are incompatible with the likely 
continuous demands of heat users. 
 APL has undertaken detailed assessment work to consider the potential 
impacts of climate change for the Project, in accordance with paragraph 
2.3.13 of NPS EN-2.  The ES (Document Reference 6.1) contains a number 
of technical chapters (including chapters relating to air quality, ecology, water 
quality and resources, and geology and ground conditions), referred to 
throughout this Planning Statement, which include consideration of the 
potential impacts of climate change and set out appropriate mitigation 
measures where necessary. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
113 
 
 In accordance with paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2, APL has sought to adopt 
good design principles as part of the Project and in respect of landscape and 
visual amenity as explained within the Design Principles Statement 
(Document Reference 10.2).  The form, scale, massing and landscaping has 
been designed so that the Power Generation Plant blends in with its 
surroundings minimising visual intrusion from key viewpoints.   
Impacts of fossil fuel generating stations 
 In accordance with the provisions of section 2.4 of NPS EN-2, an 
assessment of the likely impacts of the Project in respect of air quality, 
emissions, landscape and visual impacts, and water quality and resources 
has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings, including 
appropriate mitigation measures, are presented in Chapters 6, 9 and 11 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
Air quality and emissions 
 An assessment of the likely impacts in respect of air quality and emissions 
has been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented in Chapter 6 
of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), in accordance with paragraph 2.5.2 of 
NPS EN-2.    
 During the construction and decommissioning stages of the Project, the main 
potential effect is dust generated from construction. Accordingly, in order to 
mitigate potential impacts during the construction phase, an Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) has been prepared.  As part of the 
Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), mitigation relating 
to air quality is to be implemented, including dust management measures. 
With the mitigation measures implemented via the Outline CEMP (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), the assessment concludes that no significant 
impacts are anticipated from the construction of the Project. 
 Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) concludes that, during 
operation, the magnitude of the impacts in respect of pollutant concentrations 
are considered to be negligible for all pollutant and averaging periods 
considered within the dispersion modelling. As such, impacts on air quality 
as a result of the Project are therefore not considered to be significant.  No 
additional mitigation or monitoring is therefore proposed. 
 The Project therefore accords with section 2.5 of NPS EN-2, and thus the 
Project is considered acceptable in respect of air quality and emissions. 
Landscape and visual 
 An assessment of the likely landscape and visual impact associated with the 
proposed development has been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are 
presented in Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Number 6.1.0), in accordance 
with paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
114 
 
 The impact on visual amenity has been minimised, in accordance with 
paragraphs 2.6.5 and 2.6.10 of NPS EN-2, through appropriate assessment 
in the Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (Document Reference 10.1, 
Chapter 11) and identification of suitable mitigation, which is secured in the 
Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2) and the Outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.4), secured by requirements in the draft DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1). These provide for planting to screen built structures within 
the Project Site and suitable finishing to larger plant items.  
 The location of the Project and its layout have been explained in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) with reference to visual impact and all other 
relevant considerations and represent extensive efforts to integrate the 
Project into the local and wider landscape through measures such as: the 
selection of OCGT technology with substantially lower stack heights than 
other technologies, the alignment of the larger plant items to minimise 
massing in long views, the location in lower topography in the local context, 
and the retention of existing field boundaries around the Generating 
Equipment Site and Laydown Area.  
 It is noted that the Design Commission for Wales stated in their Design 
Review report in 2014 (see Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) 
in respect of the Project Site location as follows:  
 “There is a clear logic behind the selection of this site for the intended project, 
in terms of existing energy infrastructure and demand. The Design 
Commission supports this well considered and well justified scheme, and 
believes that the design processes that the team are undertaking are guiding 
the project in the right direction. A clear case was made for the need for the 
facility, and it is good to see a new economic use of the farmland.” 
 These design processes have continued since the Design Review, as 
documented in the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) and 
recorded in the Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2) 
secured by requirements of the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1). It is 
considered that visual impacts have been minimised as far as reasonably 
practicable and that the Project represents “Good Design” and a suitable 
location, in accordance with paragraph 2.6.5 of NPS EN-2. 
Noise and vibration 
 An assessment of the likely noise and vibration impacts associated with the 
Project has been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented in 
Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), in accordance with 
paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2.  
 In accordance with paragraph 2.7.5 of NPS EN-2, the siting has been 
selected to avoid major population areas both existing and proposed (such 
as UDP designation EC1, Felindre Business Park) in order to minimise 
impacts on amenity. The design will also minimise noise and vibration 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
115 
 
impacts, as set out further within the Design Principles Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2), by including silencer equipment in the exhaust stack and 
housing gas turbine generators and major compressors in acoustic 
enclosures.  
 Construction noise mitigation measures are included in the Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) and include measures to minimise 
impacts at local residential noise sensitive receptors.  
 With the above mitigation incorporated the residual effects are predicted to 
be non-significant and in accordance with section 2.7 of NPS EN-2, thus the 
Project is considered acceptable in respect of noise and vibration. 
Water quality and resources 
 An assessment of the likely effects on water quality and resources associated 
with the proposed development has been undertaken in the EIA and the 
findings are presented in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), in 
accordance with paragraphs 2.10.1 and 2.10.2 of NPS EN-2. 
 In accordance with section 2.10 of NPS EN-2, a number of measures will be 
implemented to minimise the impacts of the Project on water quality and 
resources: 
• Hydrological protection measures to prevent pollution events, 
including silt traps and/or sedimats, suitable phasing and avoidance of 
stockpiled materials; 
• Appropriately designed oil retaining areas; 
• Adaptation of different platform levels; 
• Provision for all process to be collected in a drain tank removed by 
road tanker and disposed by an accredited company to a designated 
treatment facility off-site; 
• Rainwater to be removed from oil retaining areas by an automatic 
pump to the oily water drainage system; 
• The oily water drainage system will ultimately pass through an 
appropriately designed oil separator before discharging into surface 
water bodies or drainage systems; and 
• Oil unloading areas on site designed to include containment for 
accidental spillage of fuel. 
 Furthermore, it will be necessary to divert some of the watercourses and 
ditches crossing the site which will lead to some loss of habitat in the short 
term, and potentially permanent loss or detriment to existing habitats where 
culverts are unavoidable.  The Project will mostly affect waterbodies within 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
116 
 
and in close proximity to the Project Site. Significant impacts are not expected 
on water sensitive receptors in the wider area. 
 The Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) and Surface 
Water Management Plan (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.2) provide 
mitigation measures in regards to likely impacts of construction on 
Contaminated Land and Groundwater and Surface Water.  In order to ensure 
that there will be no discharges to any surface watercourses as a result of 
construction activities at the Project Site and also to control flood risk, 
construction on site will follow the measures set out in the Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1).  
 Following the implementation of the embedded mitigation measures and 
measures included in the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 
3.1), it is concluded that water quality and resources impacts associated with 
the construction, operation and decommissioning phases are not significant 
and the Project is in accordance with section 2.10 of NPS EN-2.   
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) 
 As noted above, the Application does not seek development consent for the 
Gas Connection.  However, APL is seeking powers of compulsory acquisition 
for the land rights required for the Gas Connection as part of the application.  
Accordingly, the relevant provisions of NPS EN-4 are considered below. 
 In accordance with the provisions of sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4, an 
assessment of the likely impacts in respect of noise and vibration, 
biodiversity, landscape and visual impacts, water quality and resources, and 
ground conditions, has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings 
are presented in chapters 7 – 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
 As required under the EIA regulations and acknowledged in NPS EN-4 as 
well as NPS EN-1, the ES (Document Reference: 6.1) provides an account 
of the consideration of the main alternatives studied by APL, including 
alternative routes for the Gas Connection.  Paragraphs 6.2.29 – 6.2.32 of this 
Planning Statement provide an explanation of the consideration of alternative 
routes for the Gas Connection. 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) 
 As noted above, the Application does not seek development consent for the 
Electrical Connection.  However, APL is seeking powers of compulsory 
acquisition for the land rights required for the Electrical Connection as part of 
the application.  Accordingly, the relevant provisions of NPS EN-5 are 
considered below. 
 In accordance with paragraph 2.4.1 of NPS EN-5, APL has undertaken 
detailed assessment work to consider the potential impacts of climate change 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project

on the Electrical Connection, as explained within the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).   
 In accordance with the provisions of section 2.5 of NPS EN-5, an 
assessment of the likely environmental impacts of the Electrical Connection 
has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings are presented in the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1).  APL has sought to adopt good design as 
explained in the Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2) as 
required by paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-5. 
 As required under the EIA regulations and acknowledged in NPS EN-5 as 
well as NPS EN-1, the ES (Document Reference: 6.1) provides an account 
of the consideration of the main alternatives studied by APL, including 
alternative solutions for the Electrical Connection.  Paragraphs 6.2.33 – 
6.2.35 of this Planning Statement provide an explanation of the consideration 
of alternative solutions for the Electrical Connection. 
 In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.10.1 and 2.10.15 of NPS 
EN-5, APL has undertaken an EMF assessment (see Document Reference 
6.2, Appendix 15.1).  The EMF assessment concludes that the general public 
will not be exposed to any increase in EMFs from the Electrical Connection 
and there will be no significant effects arising from EMFs.

PPW Chapter 4 (and associated TANs) 
 
The Project provides low carbon energy generation and a number of 
employment opportunities, whilst demonstrating high-quality design and 
mitigating potential environmental impacts, as explained within the Design 
Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2) and Environmental 
Statement (Document Reference 6.1).  The Project therefore accords with 
the provisions of PPW Chapter 4 regarding sustainable development. 
PPW Chapter 5 (and associated TANs) 
 
The Project seeks to avoid significant harm to biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests in accordance with the provisions of PPW Chapter 5.  
Several measures have been implemented to limit significant adverse effects 
including the provision of replacement habitats, provision of wildlife ponds 
and replacement planting.  Notwithstanding this, the Project will result in the 
loss of a small proportion of Ancient Woodland and broadleaved semi-natural 
woodland, as explained at Chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
However, the impacts of this are considered to be acceptable when weighed 
against the need and benefits of the Project. 
 
PPW Chapter 7 (and associated TANs) 
 
The Project is consistent in principle with PPW Chapter 7 as the Project 
provides positive economic benefits, as explained in Chapter 14 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). Furthermore, the Project Site is well suited for its 
proposed use as set out the ES (Document Reference 6.1, Chapter 5) and 
this Planning Statement. Therefore, the Project is considered to accord with 
the aims of PPW Chapter 7. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
119 
 
 
PPW Chapter 12 (and associated TANs) 
 
As explained in Chapter 4 of this Planning Statement, government policy 
acknowledges the need and central concern for a balance of technologies in 
the electricity generation mix. Accordingly, the Project will provide additional 
gas generation capacity to provide reliable, peaking generation, compliant 
with the provisions of PPW Chapter 12.   
 
PPW Chapter 13 (and associated TANs) 
 
A full EIA has been undertaken to assess the potential effects of the Project 
and provide appropriate mitigation where required, as explained in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), in accordance with PPW Chapter 13.  A number 
of embedded mitigation measures implicit to the design of the Project and its 
construction and operation have been incorporated as set out in the Outline 
CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), Outline Surface Water 
Management Plan (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.2) and Outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.4).  Chapters 15 and 16 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
conclude that the residual effects of the Project upon socio-economics and 
public health are not significant.  As such the Project is considered to be in 
accordance with PPW Chapter 13. 
 
PPW Chapter 14 (and associated TANs) 
 
In regards to PPW Chapter 14, it is likely that the Project would prevent 
extraction of minerals whilst it is constructed. However, the Project would be 
decommissioned at the end of its useful lifespan (25 years) as secured by a 
requirement in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1), and the resources 
would thereafter be capable of being extracted. It is understood that there are 
no current or imminent prospects of these resources being extracted and 
substantial highway improvements would be required in order to facilitate any 
future mineral extraction.   
 
MTAN 1 and MTAN 2 set out detailed advice on the mechanisms for 
delivering policies for coal extraction, as explained at section 5.3 of this 
Planning Statement.  As explained at section 6.2 of this Planning Statement, 
it is likely that the Project would prevent extraction of coal resources during 
construction; however, it is understood that there are no imminent prospects 
of these resources being extracted and the resources would be capable of 
extraction after decommissioning. 
 
Other TANs 
 
Appropriate consideration has been given to the Welsh language through the 
evolution of the Project and during consultation, as explained in the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0), in accordance with the 
principles of TAN 20.  This has included provision of a range of consultation 
materials in Welsh language for statutory consultation as agreed in advance 
with CCS. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
120 
 
 
In accordance with TAN 21, wherever practicably possible waste will be 
avoided; however, where necessary, waste will be managed in accordance 
with the waste hierarchy.  As set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the Outline CEMP (Document 6.2.0, Appendix 3.1) will seek 
to apply the waste hierarchy – consisting of (in order of preference): 
prevention; re-use; recycling; other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
disposal – during all phases of the Project as part of the waste prevention 
and management policy. 
Draft Planning Policy Wales (Edition 10, February 2018) and associated 
Technical Advice Notes 
 
The Welsh Government consulted on a draft Edition 10 of PPW between 
February and May 2018; however, this edition is at a relatively early stage of 
preparation and Edition 9 remains the latest adopted guidance. As with 
previous editions, PPW Edition 10 will be supplemented by a series of TANs 
and policy clarification letters.  Draft Edition 10 of PPW reinforces the Welsh 
Government’s objectives in respect of the transition to a low carbon economy 
and the recognition of securing energy from a mix of energy sources.  
 
In accordance with the provisions of draft Edition 10 of PPW, the Project 
responds to the need for new energy infrastructure to support the transition 
to a low carbon economy as explained in Chapter 4 of this Planning 
Statement.  This section of the Planning Statement does not therefore 
consider the need for the Project further. 
Wales Spatial Plan (2004, updated 2008) 
 
The Project responds to identified need for energy infrastructure (as 
explained at section 4 of this Planning Statement), delivers positive economic 
benefits (as explained at Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)), 
and seeks to limit adverse environmental impacts (as explained in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1)), in accordance with the overall principles of the 
Wales Spatial Plan and the key priorities for the “Swansea Bay – Waterfront 
and Western Valleys” where the Project Site is located.   
 
The construction of the Project would deliver benefits to the local economy, 
with a requirement for 25 to 122 construction workers on site during the peak 
construction period and projected annual delivery of £7.1 m GVA (a measure 
of the value of goods and services produced).  The operational phase of the 
Project would provide up to an estimated 10 FTE direct jobs and provide 
approximately £0.55 m GVA per annum to the local economy.  The Project 
would therefore support key priorities in the area of Swansea Bay – 
Waterfront and Western Valleys. 
Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) 
 
The Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) seeks to provide a framework to 
achieve a is clean, healthy and biologically diverse environment which 
contributes to economic and social well-being and health. The Project has 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
121 
 
had due regard to the aims of the Environment Strategy for Wales through 
high quality design, limiting environmental impacts through appropriate 
mitigation as required and by delivering positive economic benefits, as 
explained throughout the Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 
10.2) and Environmental Statement (Document Reference 6.1).

Site-Specific Policies 
 
It is likely that the Project would prevent extraction of coal, sand and 
aggregate resources whilst it is constructed. However, the Project would be 
decommissioned at the end of its useful lifespan (25 years) as secured by a 
requirement in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1), and the resources 
would thereafter be capable of being extracted. It is understood that there are 
no current or imminent prospects of these resources being extracted and 
substantial highway improvements would be required in order to facilitate any 
future mineral extraction.  The area is demonstrably suitable for power 
generation infrastructure and locating here would minimise the length of 
connections to the national gas and electricity networks and therefore 
construction impacts. As such the proposals are considered to be compliant 
with the provisions of UDP Policies R2, R4 and R5. 
 
The Project Site is located adjacent to the south of a Hazardous Installation 
Consultation Zone and approximately 200 m to the north of a Notified High 
Pressure Mains Buffer.  As explained in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), it is expected that no significant effects would occur in 
respect of public health, in accordance with UDP Policy EV41. 
 
Developments in Surrounding Area 
 
The Project Site is located 1.5 km north east of Felindre Strategic Business 
Park, allocated for 190 ha of employment land in UDP Policy EC1 in order 
to meet the growth needs of the local economy. This is a brownfield site  
which possesses excellent accessibility and other features that will enable it 
to provide a valuable economic role in the locality and region by being 
developed for a range of employment uses. Were the Project to be located 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
123 
 
at this allocated site, it could result in hazardous installation consultation 
zones being introduced that would limit the density of occupation of buildings 
nearby, and therefore the density/value of employment uses developed at the 
business park, besides the potential for amenity concerns. Therefore, it is 
considered by the Applicant to be unsuitable for the Project compared with 
the chosen Project Site. 
 
The likely cumulative effects associated with the Project and other 
developments have been assessed as part of the EIA, with the findings 
presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), including in respect of 
Felindre Strategic Business Park and housing allocations set out in UDP 
Policy HC1. 
 
Chapter 17 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) concludes that the 
cumulative effects associated with the Project and other developments are 
minor adverse and therefore not significant. 
 
Other Relevant UDP Policies 
 
With regard to the Strategic Policies (in particular Policies SP1, SP2 and 
SP3), the Project: 
• minimises its land take so far as practicable; 
• is located away from homes and in an area of countryside that 
contains substantial amounts of energy infrastructure already; and  
• has been integrated into that landscape through careful siting, layout, 
design 
and 
landscape 
mitigation 
commitments 
through 
implementation of the Design Principles Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2) and the Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.4), and Outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan (Document Reference 6.3, 
Figure 3.6) secured by requirements of the draft DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1). 
 
APL has sought to employ good design at all stages of the Project’s 
development, in accordance with UDP Policies EV1, EV2, and EV40 of the 
UDP.  This includes provision of replacement planting, provision of ponds 
and careful management of soils, pursuant to the Outline CEMP (Appendix 
3.1 of Document Reference 6.2) and the Outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4 of Document Reference 6.2). Amenity is 
considered in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) particularly in respect of 
visual, noise and air quality changes, which could arise from the works during 
construction and operation on properties lying within approximately 1 km of 
the Generating Equipment Site.  Chapter 17 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) summarises that the construction of the Power Generation Plant would 
lead to moderate adverse effects upon visual amenity and minor adverse 
effects upon amenity in respect of transport which are not significant. 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
124 
 
 
UDP Policy EV21 notes that development will only be permitted if it is 
beneficial for the rural economy, or meets the overriding social or economic 
needs of a local community. The need for energy generation as discussed in 
Chapter 4 of this Planning Statement is clear and therefore the Project will 
meet the social and economic needs of the local community.  
 
The Project Site is situated on low grade agricultural land and therefore 
development is compliant with UDP Policy EC13, which directs proposed 
development away from the higher grades of agricultural land.  
 
Summary 
 
The Project is in general compliance with relevant UDP policies.  There 
remains a partial conflict with UDP Policies R2 and R4 (as a small proportion 
of these designations would be permanently sterilised by the pile foundations 
for the Generating Equipment), however, the permanent areas of loss are 
insignificant relative to the overall size of the designated areas.  Overall the 
urgent need for electricity generation, including gas fired generating stations 
and flexible gas and peaking plants, should be accorded substantial weight, 
as set out in a range of national government guidance, national planning 
policy as well as local planning policy (as set out within section 4 of this 
report), including NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012) and 
the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014).  
 
This conclusion is based on section 104 of the PA 2008 which provides that, 
in making decisions on applications, the SoS must decide applications in 
accordance with relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the proposal 
would outweigh its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances); and, 
paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 which states that all development consent 
applications for energy infrastructure should be assessed “on the basis that 
the Government has demonstrated that there is a need for those types of 
infrastructure and that the scale and urgency of that need is as described for 
each of them in this Part”, and states that the SoS “should give substantial 
weight to the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the PA 
2008” (paragraph 3.1.4) [emphasis added].

Site-Specific Policies 
 
With regard to draft LDP Policy RP12, it is likely that the Project would 
prevent extraction of coal, sand and gravel resources whilst it is constructed. 
However, as stated above, the Project would be decommissioned at the end 
of its useful lifespan (25 years) as secured by requirements set out in the 
draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1), and the resources would thereafter be 
capable of being extracted and not permanently sterilised. It is also 
understood that there are no current or imminent prospects of these 
resources being extracted, and any extraction would require substantial 
highway improvements.  
 
As set out above and in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), careful 
consideration has gone into the layout and location of the Project to ensure 
there are no significant adverse effects on natural heritage, landscape and 
the amenity and well-being of neighbouring properties, in accordance with 
draft LDP Policy RP14 and ER5.  
 
The Applicant has made extensive efforts to integrate the Project into the 
local and wider landscape, in accordance with draft LDP Policy ER 5 
through measures including: the selection of OCGT technology with one 
stack, the alignment of the larger plant items to minimise impacts from long 
distance views, the location in lower topography in the local context, and the 
retention of existing field boundaries around the Generating Equipment Site 
and Laydown Area.  
Policies for Developments in Surrounding Area 
 
To the south west, the Generating Equipment Site is located within 1.4 km of 
a Strategic Development Area (Policy SD 1(G)) which seeks to allocate a 
new settlement at land north west of M4 J46 (Llangyfelach). Several other 
site allocations are within the proximity of the Project Site and include land 
south of Glanffrwd Road for residential led development of up to 720 
dwellings located approximately 6 km from Generating Equipment Site 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
127 
 
(Policy SD A), land south of A4240 for residential led mixed use development 
of up to 750 dwellings located approximately 4 km from Generating 
Equipment Site (Policy SD C), and land north of Clasemont Road for 
residential led mixed use development of up to 675 dwellings located 
approximately 1.5 km from Generating Equipment Site (Policy SD E).  It is 
considered that due to the appropriate siting of the Project and associated 
mitigation, the Project would not impede the implementation of the strategic 
allocations.  
 
The Project Site is also within the proximity of safeguarded land at Morriston 
Hospital (Policy SI 4), located approximately 900 m to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site. The policy notes that new healthcare related 
uses are required to deliver new and enhanced highway infrastructure. 
Although the Project Site isn’t within the safeguarded area, the Project 
includes a new access road  to resolve road capacity issues to Morriston 
Hospital from the roundabout immediately north of M4 J46. 
 
The likely cumulative effects associated with the Project and other 
developments have been assessed as part of the EIA, with the findings 
presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), including in respect of the 
draft strategic site allocations and housing allocations set out in UDP Policy 
HC1. 
 
Chapter 17 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) concludes that the 
cumulative effects associated with the Project and other developments are 
minor adverse and therefore not significant. 
Other Relevant LDP Policies 
 
As noted in Chapter 4 of this Planning Statement, the need for the Project is 
clear and therefore it can be considered as “necessary infrastructure 
provision” on a brownfield site within the countryside, in accordance with 
draft LDP Policies PS1 and PS2.   
 
In accordance with draft LDP Policies PS2 and HC1, the Applicant has 
sought to employ good design principles at all stages of the Project’s 
development and has undertaken appropriate studies of local habitats, 
potential access routes heritage features and landscape to enable the design 
to respond to place, whilst ensuring that it can function as required.  
 
Chapter 13 (Document Reference 6.1) on the potential impacts of the Project 
on the historic environment. As set out in the ES, it is anticipated that no 
significant impacts on archaeology or cultural heritage are expected as a 
result of the Project, in accordance with draft LDP Policy HC2, and thus no 
mitigation measures are considered necessary.  
 
As detailed in Chapter 14 (Socio-economic) of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), the Project will have several beneficial impacts including supporting 
construction employment and the possibility of enhanced employment 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
128 
 
opportunities through linkages with employability programmes and colleges, 
in accordance with draft LDP Policies PS4 and IO2.  
 
With regard to draft LDP Policies IO1 and T1, the Project proposes a new 
purpose built Access Road (adhering to design principles) to the Generating 
Equipment Site from the B4489, to be formed by upgrading an existing 
access road. APL has consulted with National Grid on these changes and the 
use of the existing access road has been agreed as presented in the Outline 
CTMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.3). The Outline CTMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.3) provides a framework for 
addressing the transport issues associated with construction of the Project.  
 
In relation to Air Quality, with the measures adopted in the Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) dust and particulate health risks 
should not arise, in accordance with draft LDP Policies SI1, RP1 and RP2, 
due to the adequate dispersion provided by the proposed stack height and 
other associated mitigation measures that the Project proposes. In relation to 
noise, noise surveys undertaken at locations agreed with CCS and the 
Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) will minimise 
residual impacts during construction to non-significant levels, in accordance 
with draft LDP Policies SI1, RP1 and RP2. Regarding pollution and 
contamination, groundwater and worker health impacts are not expected 
either during construction with the Outline CEMP implemented (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1) or during operation in accordance with draft 
LDP Policies SI1, RP1 and RP2. 
 
A number of Project alternatives have been assessed by the Applicant, taking 
into account a range of environmental factors as set out in Chapter 5 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1), which include consideration of potential 
impacts of climate change and suitable mitigation measures in place where 
necessary, in accordance with draft LDP Policy ER1.  
 
Several measures have been implemented to limit significant adverse effects 
on sites of nature conservation importance, ecological networks and habitats 
and Ancient Woodland, including the provision of replacement habitats, 
provision of wildlife ponds and replacement planting, in accordance with draft 
LDP Policies ER6 and ER8.  Notwithstanding this, the Project will result in 
the loss of a small proportion of Ancient Woodland and broadleaved semi-
natural woodland, as explained at Chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1).  The impacts of this are considered to be acceptable when weighed 
against the need and benefits of the Project. 
 
Impacts on PROWs have been minimised as far as practicable in line with 
draft LDP Policy T7.  The magnitude of impacts is anticipated to be low, as 
all users should still be able to make a pedestrian movement, but there will 
be some hindrance in doing so (e.g. due to short term closures/diversions).  
The significance of effect will therefore be moderate adverse, which is 
significant, however the effect will be temporary.

Following the implementation of the embedded mitigation measures and 
measures included in the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 
3.1) and Surface Water Management Plan (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.2) it is concluded that water quality and resources impacts 
associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning phases are 
not significant and comply with good water resource management 
requirements and draft LDP Policy RP3.  
 
With regard to draft LDP Policy RP4, a Flood Consequence Assessment 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 9.1) has been undertaken and 
concludes that the Project will have a low or negligible impact on flooding in 
the wider area. It is also proposed that the Outline Drainage Strategy 
(Document Reference 6.2, Appendix E to the Flood Consequences 
Assessment) will adopt SUDS principles as set out in the SUDS Manual 
(CIRIA C697). 
 
With regard to draft LDP Policy RP5, after implementation of good practice 
methods and mitigation measures such as working within and adhering to an 
Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), the potential effects 
in respect of contamination and landfill gas are considered to be negligible 
and therefore not significant. 
 
With regard to draft LDP Policy RP6, the Applicant will undertake a 
comprehensive ground investigation prior to construction (as per 
requirements in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1)) which will inform 
the foundation design and any remediation required to be undertaken as 
required and as part of the embedded mitigation for the Project. Once 
mitigation has been taken into account, the magnitude of effect is considered 
to be negligible. 
 
With regard to draft LDP Policy RP9, as set out in Chapter 15 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 3.1) will control management of waste. The Outline CEMP 
(Document Reference 6.1) will ensure efficiency of resource use and 
compliance with waste legislation. All Hazardous waste will be segregated by 
type and from other waste streams. All waste oil will be stored in a bunded 
facility until such times that it is collected. Used filters, rags and absorbents 
will be stowed in the hazardous waste container in drums or waste oil bags.  
Summary 
 
The draft LDP holds some weight for the purposes of decision-making 
following recent examination hearings and taking into account the provisions 
of section 104 of the PA 2008 and paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1, however 
the weight to be attached to the draft LDP may change based upon the 
Inspectors’ recommendations.  In conclusion, the Project largely accords with 
the draft LDP and its aim to provide sustainable development.

Likely Benefits and Adverse Impacts 
7.1 
Introduction 
 
A consideration of the balance of benefits and adverse impacts of the Project 
is provided below in recognition of the decision-making framework set out in 
Section 104 of the PA 2008. 
7.2 
Likely Benefits 
 
There are important benefits that need to be considered in respect of the 
Project, which are balanced against the potential adverse impacts as outlined 
below. 
 
Considerable weight needs to be attributed to the urgent need for increased 
electricity generation capacity, including gas-fired generating stations and 
gas-fired peaking plants, as outlined in NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation 
Strategy (DECC, 2012), the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 
2014), and Energy Wales – a Low Carbon Transition (Welsh Government, 
2012).   
 
The Project would contribute materially to the short- and medium-term needs 
for flexible, reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the transition 
to a low carbon economy.  The chosen technology for a peaking plant would 
help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when intermittent renewable sources cannot 
generate sufficient electricity.  
 
PPW Chapter 7 notes that the construction and energy sectors represent 
economic development.  The construction and operation of the Project would 
benefit the Welsh economy, with projected annual delivery of £7.1 million 
Gross Value Added (GVA) (a measure of the value of goods and services 
produced) during the construction period of the Project, which is expected to 
commence in 2020.  It is estimated that the peak construction period would 
require 25 to 122 construction workers on site, and during operation, the 
Project is estimated to provide 10 additional FTE direct jobs (Chapter 14 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1)).  
 
The Power Generation Plant has been laid out to minimise impacts on 
biodiversity and provide all reasonable opportunities to retain or create 
valuable new habitats. A Landscape and Ecology Management Plan 
(Document Reference 6.2) forms part of the Application and is secured by 
requirements of the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1). 
 
The Project demonstrates good design whilst also remaining functional and 
durable for its lifespan and being safe, accessible and of sustainable 
construction, as explained in the Design Principles Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2), the Landscape and Ecology Management Plan (ES Figure 
3.6, Document Reference 6.3) and the Works Plans (Document Reference 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
133 
 
2.3).  The Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) demonstrates 
that advice on design matters has been taken into account throughout the 
design process.   
7.3 
Likely Adverse Impacts  
 
NPS EN-1 and EN-2 identify that energy infrastructure development, 
including fossil fuel generating stations, are expected to have adverse 
impacts in relation to: air quality and emissions, biodiversity and geological 
conservation, flood risk, the historic environment, landscape and visual 
amenity, land use/land take, noise and vibration, socio-economics, traffic and 
transport, waste, and water quality and resources. 
 
Accordingly, the ES (Document Reference 6.1) presents the findings of full 
EIA which has been undertaken to consider the effects of the Project, in 
respect of: air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality and 
resources; geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and 
visual; traffic, transport, and access; historic environment; and socio-
economics. 
 
As explained in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the Project has been 
designed to incorporate embedded mitigation in order to minimise the likely 
adverse impacts as far as reasonably possible.  This includes measures set 
out in the Outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.1), Outline 
CTMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.3) and Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.4). 
 
There are expected to be significant effects on visual amenity from 5 
viewpoints and minor adverse effects (which are not significant) on noise, 
ecology, traffic and water resources during construction. However, these 
effects would be minimised through mitigation measures with the 
implementation of the outline CEMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 
3.1) and the Outline CTMP (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.3), which 
are secured by requirements in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1). 
 
The Project is expected to have a moderate effect on ecology during 
construction through the permanent loss of Ancient Woodland.  However, 
only a narrow strip of ancient woodland is to be removed.  As outlined in the 
Landscape and Ecological Management Plan (Document Reference 6.2, 
Appendix 8.14), APL is committed to delivering high quality, deliverable 
mitigation through provision of replacement woodland/scrub planting. 
Implementation of these measures is secured by requirements set out in the 
draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1).  
 
During operation, the Project is expected to have some significant effects 
experienced by viewpoints representative of residential and recreational 
receptors within close proximity (700 m) to the Project Site where the 
landscape mitigation planting would not be able to reduce the significant 
effects experienced.  However it is notable that the locality is generally 
suitable for energy infrastructure, containing several energy infrastructure 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
134 
 
projects, tall overhead lines, and substations, and it is considered that all 
reasonable efforts have been taken in the siting, layout and design 
commitments to minimise residual impacts, as set out in the Landscape and 
Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.4), the 
Outline Lighting Strategy (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.5) and the 
Design Principles Statement (Document Reference 10.2), each secured by 
requirements set out in the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1). 
 
It is acknowledged that permanent components of the Project are located on 
limited parts of the areas designated under UDP Policies R2 (Coal) and R4 
(Sand/Aggregates), and draft LDP Policy R12 (Sand and Gravel). However, 
the impact on sand/aggregates is considered to be limited by reference to the 
overall physical area directly affected and most of the impact would be 
reversible after decommissioning. The impact on coal resources is limited by 
means of siting the Project close to areas of existing and recently consented 
major infrastructure which give rise to similar effects. It is further considered 
that recent UK government policy decisions substantially reducing the role of 
coal weigh in favour of the Project given the need to ensure future security of 
electricity supply. 
 
The Project will result in some adverse residual effects, as set out within 
chapter 16 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) particularly during 
construction, in relation to: landscape and visual amenity from a number of 
viewpoints, traffic during the peak hour, loss of and disturbance to habitats, 
noise at sensitive receptors, water quality and mineral resources.  The Project 
will also result in some adverse residual effects during operation, particularly 
in relation to noise and operational lighting from the Power Generation Plant 
and landscape and visual amenity from a number of viewpoints.  However, 
all residual effects during construction and operation are considered to be 
minor adverse, with exception of moderate adverse effects on footpaths 
during construction and moderate to major adverse landscape and visual 
effects. 
 
In summary, whilst some adverse impacts are likely, they are of a nature that 
are inherently likely for fossil fuel generating stations, and as such are 
anticipated in relevant guidance and policy (particularly NPS EN-2). The 
Applicant has fully assessed the likely adverse effects of the Project 
throughout the pre-application process and extensive consultation 
undertaken, and all reasonable mitigation has been identified and secured in 
the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1).

Conclusions 
8.1 
Summary 
 
APL proposes to construct and operate an OCGT peaking Power Generation 
Plant and new connections to the gas and electricity networks on land 
adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, 
Swansea SA5 7NN.  APL is applying to the SoS for BEIS under section 31 of 
the PA 2008 for a DCO for powers to construct, operate and maintain the 
Power Generation Plant.  In addition, APL is seeking powers of compulsory 
purchase in respect of acquisition over the Order Land, in order to facilitate 
the construction and operation of the Project. 
 
This Planning Statement has been produced as part of a suite of documents 
accompanying APL’s application to the SoS for BEIS for a DCO. The 
Planning Statement acts as the primary reference document for an 
explanation of the planning issues pertinent to the Application, with regard to 
the relevant National Policy Statements and other important and relevant 
matters. The Planning Statement explains how the Project complies with the 
relevant National Policy Statements and other, policy considerations.   
 
Separately, APL will seek planning permission for the Gas Connection under 
the TCPA 1990 and the Electrical Connection under either the TCPA 1990 or 
as permitted development under the GPDO. 
 
The urgent need for electricity generation, including gas fired generating 
stations and flexible gas and peaking plants, is provided in NPS EN-1, the 
Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012), Energy Wales – a Low Carbon 
Transition (Welsh Government, 2012) and the National Infrastructure Plan 
(HM Treasury, 2014). The Project would contribute materially to meeting this 
need. 
 
The Project will achieve the relevant objectives of the applicable National 
Policy Statements, being NPS EN-1 and NPS EN-2. Considerations as to 
siting, Habitats and Species Regulations, alternatives, good design, 
consideration of Combined Heat and Power, grid and gas connections, 
safety, health, nuisance and security, amongst other matters, have been 
given due regard as demonstrated in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and 
its appendices (Document Reference 6.2), the Design Principles Statement 
(Document Reference 10.2), this Planning Statement (Document Reference 
10.1), the Grid Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1) and the 
Gas Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.2).  
 
The ES (Document Reference 6.1) has also assessed all relevant likely 
significant environmental effects and has proposed appropriate mitigation 
wherever feasible. This is to be secured through compliance with various 
submitted documents and further approvals such as under the proposed 
requirements attached to the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1). 
Planning Statement  
Abergelli Power Project  
 
136 
 
 
It is considered that, on balance, the likely benefits of the Project significantly 
outweigh any potential adverse impacts. These benefits include (amongst 
others), the local and regional economic benefits, and the considerable public 
benefit to meeting the national need for flexible electricity generation. 
 
The Project would allow for the rapid, reliable and viable provision of reserve 
capacity to the National Grid, supporting the transition to a low carbon 
economy by balancing some of the considerable scale of intermittent sources 
such as wind being developed UK-wide, and playing an important role in 
meeting the UK’s national energy requirements. The Project would therefore 
deliver significant national benefits. 
 
In this respect, the Project should be considered in light of paragraph 3.1.4 
of NPS EN-1, which states that, “[t]he [SoS] should give substantial weight to 
the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying [the urgent 
need for energy infrastructure] when considering applications for 
development consent under the [PA 2008]”. 
 
The Applicant has maintained dialogue throughout the pre-application period 
with local authorities, political representatives and other consultees and 
regulators, and will continue to do so at all relevant stages prior to operation, 
if the Order is made. 
 
There are considered to be no likely significant effects in respect of sites 
designated under the Habitats Directive as set out in the No Significant 
Effects Report (Document Reference 5.5), nor species protected thereunder 
as set out in the ES (Document Reference 6.1, Chapter 8). 
 
Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 confirms a presumption in favour of granting 
consent to applications for energy NSIPs. That presumption applies unless 
any more specific and relevant policies set out in the relevant NPSs clearly 
indicate that consent should be refused. It is the Applicant’s view that there 
are no other policy reasons why consent should be withheld. The Applicant 
does not consider that there are any other important or relevant 
considerations including national planning policy or local development plan 
policies which require an alternative position to be taken. 
 
It is our conclusion that, having regard to the requirements of section 104 of 
the PA 2008 there is a compelling case in the public interest for the Order to 
be made in the terms proposed.
