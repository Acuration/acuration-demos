Trading Update
Prior to entering its close period on 1 July 2009, Drax announces the following trading
update.
Trading performance and outlook
The UK market continues to experience low near-term dark green spreads, although our
exposure is mitigated by our strong forward contracted position. If commodity prices remain
at current levels, we anticipate that full year EBITDA for 2009 will be in line with market
consensus.
For 2010 and beyond, commodity markets currently forecast a sharp recovery in prices and
dark green spreads. We have taken the opportunity to accelerate hedging into 2010, locking
into these margins in what remains a volatile and unpredictable trading environment.
We
have already sold approximately 80% of our output for 2010 at higher average margins than
for 2009.
Positions under contract for 2009, 2010 and 2011
As at 12 June 2009, the positions under contract for 2009, 2010 and 2011 were as follows:

Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2007.

Fixed margin power sales include approximately 2.7TWh in 2009 and 5.3TWh in each of
2010 and 2011 in connection with the contract. Under this contract the Group will supply
power on terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices,
and delivering matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting to approximately 4.8 million
tonnes per annum. The contract provides the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green spreads 
which were agreed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006.
We will next update the market on the Group’s contracted positions on 4 August 2009 when
we announce our Half Year Results for the six months ending 30 June 2009.
Distributions to Shareholders
Our distribution policy remains unchanged. For 2009, all excess cash from operations after
meeting business requirements will be distributed, and from 2010 we will target a pay-out of
50% of underlying earnings, adjusted for non-cash accounting items.
Consistent with
previous years, the level of interim dividend for 2009 will take account of the closing cash
position, less working capital, capital expenditure and any other needs of the business.
In a separate announcement issued today, we have announced our intention to raise
approximately £100m via a placing of new ordinary shares.
In order to help support our
investment grade debt rating, the proceeds of the proposed placing will be applied to a part
prepayment of our term debt.
Conference Call
Management will host a conference call for analysts and investors at 9:00am (UK Time)
today. After the call a recording will be made available. Access details for both are set out
below.
