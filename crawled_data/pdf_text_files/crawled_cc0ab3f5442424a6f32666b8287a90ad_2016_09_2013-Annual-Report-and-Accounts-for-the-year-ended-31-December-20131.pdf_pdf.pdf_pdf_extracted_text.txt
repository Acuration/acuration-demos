virtuous cycle
We have made good progress on 
securing supplies of sustainable 
biomass for the near-term;  
we continue negotiations for 
long-term supplies.
We only source sustainable biomass, predominantly 
from sustainably managed forests. These are 
production forests where the rate of growth is at 
least equal to the rate of harvest, which means there 
is no depletion in the forest carbon stock.

In perspective
Our commitment to becoming a 
leading provider of sustainable power 
is stronger than ever. As a Group we 
made significant progress in this 
respect during 2013, from starting the 
construction of wood pellet plant and 
port facilities in the US, through the 
conversion of our first generating unit at 
Drax Power Station to burn sustainable 
biomass in place of coal, to increasing 
sales of renewable power to business 
customers in the UK. 
The energy sector faces many 
challenges. Whether concerns centre 
on security of supply, affordability or 
decarbonisation, as a Group we are 
pleased to say that we are working hard 
to provide power which is secure and 
reliable, cost-effective and low carbon. 
The regulatory framework which shapes 
the UK energy industry fully recognises 
the valuable and strategic role that 
sustainable biomass has to play in the 
energy mix. Importantly, establishing 
that framework will unlock the potential 
of this new and vibrant biomass 
industry and promote growth through 
investment and job creation. 
Our achievements in 2013 position us 
well to secure an attractive future for 
our business and our shareholders.
We are firmly on track to deliver the 
many benefits that biomass has to 
offer as an energy source.
Earnings and dividend
Our earnings (EBITDA(1)) for the year 
were slightly ahead of expectations 
at £230 million.
These are lower than in 2012 
(£298 million) reflecting the increasing 
costs of carbon (£120 million), driven by 
the introduction of the UK government’s 
carbon price support mechanism from 
1 April 2013 and the removal of free 
allowances under the EU ETS.
In accordance with our dividend policy, 
the Board proposes a final dividend in 
respect of 2013 of 8.9 pence per share, 
equivalent to £36 million. This would give 
total dividends for the year of £71 million 
(2012: £97 million).
Corporate reporting
During 2013, a number of changes 
were introduced to the legislation 
and regulations governing reporting 
requirements. The approach we 
have adopted over recent years 
satisfies many of the new disclosure 
requirements. Nevertheless, we have 
incorporated new features in this 
Annual report and accounts which 
enhance some aspects, such as 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting, 
which can be found on page 51 and 
introduce others in our Governance 
section starting on page 64. 
The Board and governance
We have an effective Board with 
good and complementary skills, 
knowledge and experience across 
all directors, both executive and  
non-executive. The Board takes 
the lead in setting the tone for good 
governance throughout the Group. 
As a Board we ensure that our 
conduct is focused on improving 
our business, driving our strategic 
priorities, and behaving responsibly. 
Issues such as succession planning, 
career development and diversity 
are kept under review as a matter 
of course. 
More information can be found in 
the Governance section of the report 
starting on page 64.
Our people
We report on a year that has seen 
unprecedented change across the 
Group. Significant achievements 
have been made by our people and 
my sincere thanks go to all Group 
staff for their tireless commitment 
and hard work.

Fuel
How we maximise value…
 
kWe burn sustainable biomass currently 
in one converted unit, which earns ROCs 
and LECs.
 
kIn our coal units we have the ability 
to burn other fuels, such as petcoke 
and pond fines, which can be 
economically advantageous. 
 
kBy diversifying our fuel sources not only 
are we less reliant on a single fuel type, 
but we are also able to capture value from 
commodity market cycles, and in the case 
of biomass avoid the cost of carbon.
 
kOur investments in the US help secure 
the timely delivery of reliable wood pellet 
supplies to Drax Power Station, and 
consolidate third party and own supplies 
to secure more efficient and cost-effective 
delivery logistics.
Generation
How we maximise value…
 
kThrough our turbine upgrade project we 
secured our position as the most efficient 
coal-fired power station in the UK, and with 
it and our increasing use of biomass we are 
delivering coal and CO2 savings. 
 
kWith leading operational performances 
across all aspects of the generation business, 
from safety to maintenance, we are able to 
deliver high availability and reliability. 
 
kIn addition, the flexibility of our despatch 
allows us to respond quickly to changes 
in demand.
Environment
How we maximise value…
 
kThrough burning increasing volumes of 
sustainable biomass and our efficiency 
improvements we are able to significantly 
reduce the amount of coal we burn, save on 
carbon costs and reduce emissions of CO2.
 
kWe generate additional revenue through 
sales of our by-products, reducing 
disposal costs, and creating its own 
revenue stream. By reducing emissions of 
SO2, we produce gypsum which, like ash, 
is sold to the construction industry. 
 
kWe are investing to continue to 
meet increasingly stringent emission 
control requirements.
Trading
How we maximise value…
 
kAs the largest power station in the UK 
we are able to utilise economies of scale 
through, for example, procuring fuel at 
competitive prices. 
 
kWe are always looking to increase the 
trading options available to us, for example, 
through our retail business. 
 
kWe benefit from having a physical asset 
to trade around and through a seamless 
interface with the operations side of the 
business, enabling us to extract value in all 
market conditions.
Retail
How we maximise value…
 
kWe have already achieved significant 
growth in a competitive marketplace and 
have become established as a recognised 
supplier to businesses across the UK. 
 
kWe have plans to grow further and deliver 
our tailor-made supply contracts to even 
more business customers. 
 
kOur retail business increases the trading 
options available for our power output, 
providing an important, credit-efficient 
and direct route to market, as well as a 
route to market for our ROCs and LECs.

Our notable achievements 
for 2013 were…
Chief Executive’s statement
Looking back at our 
achievements; looking forward 
to the challenges 
and opportunities ahead 
Industry-leading safety performance amidst 
high generation output levels, and significant 
project and construction activity across 
the Group. 
Review of the year
Drax is evolving from its beginnings as 
a power station owner and operator 
to a Group producing predominantly 
renewable power with activities that 
span the supply chain for the provision 
of biomass generated renewable power 
that is sustainable, low carbon, cost-
effective and reliable. During 2013, 
we made important progress in our 
journey to deliver this transformation 
of the Group.
Our vision for Drax is to be a bold, 
customer oriented power generation 
and retail business, driven by biomass 
innovation. Our key initiatives in 2013 to 
enable us to achieve our vision were: our 
biomass fuel supply business in the US, 
our biomass conversion project at Drax 
Power Station, and our programme for 
the expansion of Haven Power Limited 
(“Haven Power”) through growing our 
electricity sales to businesses. In each of 
these we made notable progress during 
the year bringing us closer to both 
achieving our vision and delivering on 
our overriding objective of maximising 
the value of the Drax Group. 
Earnings
Our earnings for 2013 reflect good 
operations and good progress in 
delivering reliable biomass generation. 
As expected, at £230 million EBITDA is 
down on last year (2012: £298 million)
as a result of increased carbon costs 
through both the cessation of the 
carbon emissions allocation under the 
EU ETS and the introduction of the UK 
government’s carbon price support 
mechanism in April 2013.
Securing sustainable 
biomass supplies
Our developments in the US are an 
important part of our business model. 
They help us to optimise the biomass 
supply chain from North America which 
is still in its infancy, but is the main source 
of sustainable biomass fuel. The drivers 
for our upstream investments are 
twofold: securing the timely delivery 
of reliable wood pellet supplies to Drax 
Power Station and consolidating third 
party and own supplies to secure 
more efficient and cost-effective 
delivery logistics.
Construction of two 450 thousand 
tonnes per annum wood pellet plants –  
Amite (Mississippi) and Morehouse 
(Louisiana) – and a port facility at Baton 
Rouge (Louisiana) progressed well during 
the year. All three construction projects 
are progressing to schedule and budget. 
We are targeting the first quarter of 2015 
for the start of commercial operations at 
Amite and Baton Rouge and the second 
quarter for Morehouse, with full capacity 
reached six months later.
Aside from our investments to secure 
a self-supply of sustainable biomass, 
we have made good progress towards 
securing near-term volumes of wood 
pellets from suppliers in the market 
with more than 4 million tonnes 
contracted for April 2014 to March 
2015. We continue our negotiations 
for long-term volumes.
Sustainability is critical to our biomass 
strategy. All our biomass, whether in raw 
fibre or pellet form is procured against 
our own robust sustainability criteria. 
These include requirements for high 
greenhouse gas emission reduction 
and habitats and biodiversity protection, 
as well as due consideration for the 
important socio-economic factors 
in the source areas. 
A programme of independent audits 
verifies that all our suppliers comply with 
our sustainability criteria. 
Our calculations show that the range of 
sustainable biomass materials we have 
burnt over the last few years has a low 
carbon footprint. In 2013, the average 
greenhouse gas emissions were 
significantly below 79gCO2/MJ which is 
the maximum under the UK government’s 
framework for sustainability requirements 
for biomass that are expected to become 
mandatory in 2015. 
UK biomass logistics
Initial long-term contracts have been 
secured with UK port operators to 
provide us with biomass import facilities. 
Further contracts are under negotiation. 
The development of these facilities is 
on schedule. 
We have concluded our first long-term 
freight contracts at fixed prices. We were 
particularly pleased to be able to secure 
through these contracts good protection 
against future increases in oil-related 
freight costs, typically a major component 
of total freight costs. The first 50 of 
the bespoke biomass rail wagons are 
operational transporting biomass from 
the ports to the power station.
Biomass conversion
The conversion of our first generating 
unit to burn sustainable biomass in place 
of coal is proving successful. 
The converted unit was initially fuelled 
using existing storage and distribution 
systems originally built to facilitate 
biomass co-firing. Construction of new 
bespoke facilities for the receipt, storage 
and distribution of biomass remained on 
schedule and within budget throughout 
the year. From September 2013, we began 
to commission the new systems. 
Secured the first private funding to be 
underpinned by the government’s UK 
Guarantees Scheme.

Chief Executive’s statement
By the end of the year the facilities were 
fully supporting the first converted unit, 
overcoming many of the expected 
reliability issues with fuel delivery we 
experienced in the first half of the year. 
This contributed to the improved load 
factor seen in the second half of the year, 
giving a load factor for the full year of 75%. 
Coal-fired generation 
performance 
As in previous years, our load factor at 
80% was high compared to other thermal 
capacity on the system and we delivered 
strong generation output for the fourth 
consecutive year. With good availability 
and reliability throughout 2013 we were 
able to continue to deliver additional 
value to the business through providing 
flexible generation output and balancing 
services to the System Operator, National 
Grid, in support of system stability 
and security.
For the year, our forced outage rate, 
which measures any reduction in plant 
availability excluding planned outages, 
was 6.8%. This is higher than our 
long-term target of 5%. In the first half of 
the year we had a forced outage rate of 
7.6%. During this period we carried out 
performance tests on our boilers using a 
wide range of marginal coal material to 
establish the most economic fuel diet. 
This resulted in a higher number of plant 
integrity issues than we would typically 
expect. The forced outage rate in the 
second half of the year was lower and 
more in line with our long-term target. 
This has been set through extensive 
benchmarking with UK and international 
coal-fired plants to determine the 
optimum balance between performance 
and cost. 
Health and safety
Two planned unit outages were 
undertaken during 2013, and both were 
completed on time and to budget without 
any recordable injuries. With two outages 
and considerable biomass project work 
activity, the number of engineering 
man-hours worked throughout the year 
was significant. Our safety statistics 
for the Group continued to be industry-
leading, reflecting the emphasis we 
place on safety. 
However, we have experienced weaker 
performance in our construction 
activities, particularly at two of our 
construction sites in the US which led to 
an increase in the total recordable injury 
rate. Working with our contractors we 
have significantly increased the safety 
management and supervision at 
these sites.
Retail performance
Selling our output through Haven Power 
continues to provide us with a credit-
efficient route to market for our power 
sales compared to the wholesale 
electricity market. It also provides a 
good route to market for the Renewables 
Obligation Certificates and Levy 
Exemption Certificates earned when 
we generate renewable power. 
During 2013, Haven Power delivered 
another year of substantial growth in a 
highly competitive market with retail 
sales 59% higher, in volume, than in 2012. 
Sales growth remains a key priority for 
the business.
An excellent standard of customer 
service is central to our proposition 
for this business. We are a consistent 
high performer in the Datamonitor 
Energy Users survey and have a good 
renewals record.
Legislative framework – 
contracts for difference 
and capacity market 
In December 2013, the Energy Act 
became law. At the heart of the Act is 
electricity market reform, which will see, 
amongst other things, the introduction of 
Contracts for Difference (“CfD”) providing 
long-term contracts and a stable revenue 
stream enabling investment in low 
carbon generating technologies. 
Electricity market reform also includes 
the introduction of a capacity mechanism 
into the electricity market to mitigate 
future risks to the security of 
electricity supplies.
The government plans to award 
early CfD contracts in Spring 2014. 
These enable investment in advance of 
the CfD mechanism coming into force 
and importantly underpin further work 
on our second and third unit conversions. 
The contracts provide the necessary 
certainty to underpin the long-term 
commitments required to secure the 
supply chain for sustainable biomass 
fuel for these units. This includes term 
contracts for UK port facilities, pellet 
supplies and overseas logistics facilities, 
as well as further direct investment by Drax 
in the supply chain in the UK and overseas. 
Our applications for early CfDs for the 
conversion of two of our units were 
successful with the units provisionally 
ranked equal first amongst 16 projects. 
The strike price for these contracts has 
been confirmed as £105/MWh (in 2012 
prices). Currently, the contracts are 
scheduled to become effective, and so 
allow the first payments, in April 2015, 
subject to EU State Aid clearance. 
Against this timetable we are now 
targeting the conversion of our second and 
third units to biomass in April 2015 and, 
at the earliest, the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In advance of these conversions we intend 
to modify one of our coal units at the power 
station to operate as an enhanced co-firing 
unit from May of this year. As an enhanced 
co-firing unit it will attract 0.9ROC/MWh 
under the Renewables Obligation (“RO”). 
This unit will then be used for the second 
unit conversion in April 2015.
During 2014, we will progress the 
construction works necessary to support 
these conversions as well as the required 
development of the supply chain, including 
further UK port development and the 
fabrication in the UK of more bespoke 
railway wagons. Our target is for three 
converted units to be fully operational and 
supplied with sustainable biomass through 
a well secured supply chain in 2016.
Applications for enduring CfDs are to 
be made in the second half of 2014. 
Any units not converted under the RO 
or the early CfDs will be eligible to apply. 
The government is currently consulting 
on proposals for the contract allocation 
process and budget management under 
the Levy Control Framework which 
sets the limits on the total amount of 
subsidy available.
The government continues to work on 
its proposals to introduce a capacity 
market for electricity. These have not yet 
been finalised, but it is our view that the 
current designs do not make a compelling 
economic case for the Drax coal units. 
All of Haven Power’s customers were 
successfully transferred on to the new 
billing system.
Through Haven Power, increased our retail sales 
of power for the year by 59% (by volume) and our 
forward sales by over 50%.

Legislative framework – 
sustainability criteria
In January 2014, the government 
published the draft RO (Amendment) 
Order 2014 which includes the 
requirement for the Office for Gas and 
Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”) to produce 
guidance on sustainability criteria for 
biomass. We continue to engage with 
government and Ofgem on the 
implementation of these criteria.
We firmly believe that robust, mandatory 
sustainability criteria are vital to maintain 
and enhance public acceptance, and 
ensure that sustainable practices are 
implemented. Together with five other 
European biomass users we are involved 
in the work of the Sustainable Biomass 
Partnership which aims to establish 
and manage a biomass assurance 
framework to demonstrate that solid 
biomass is derived from legal and 
sustainable sources.
Carbon capture and storage 
Together Drax, Alstom UK Limited and 
BOC (a member of The Linde Group) have 
formed the project company, Capture 
Power Limited (“Capture Power”). 
In December 2013, the government 
awarded Capture Power a Front End 
Engineering and Design (“FEED”) contract 
for its planned, state-of-the-art 426MW 
carbon capture and storage (“CCS”) 
demonstration project – the White Rose 
CCS Project. The FEED contract also 
includes the planned development of a 
carbon dioxide (“CO2”) transportation and 
storage solution – the Yorkshire Humber 
CCS pipeline – to be undertaken by 
National Grid.
The award of the contract marks a major 
next step in the UK CCS Commercialisation 
Programme. The FEED study is a two-year 
programme of detailed engineering, 
planning, commercial and financial work 
to finalise and de-risk all aspects of the 
proposal ahead of taking the final 
investment decision and proceeding to 
financial close and the commencement 
of construction. 
The project will be dependent on 
successful outcomes from external 
funding processes and electricity market 
reform mechanisms to incentivise low 
carbon technologies. 
Looking ahead
As noted above, from May this year one of 
our coal units will operate as an enhanced 
co-firing unit burning at least 85% 
biomass. We will use this unit to conduct 
further research and development into 
the types of biomass that can be 
effectively burnt, to develop our optimum 
nitrogen oxides (“NOX”) abatement 
solution on converted units, and to build 
up biomass supplies for the second unit 
conversion in April 2015. 
During the year we will make further 
investments in improving the 
performance of our biomass units. 
Through these investments we are 
confident that we will now be able 
to deliver capacity to the grid from 
a converted unit of 630MW burning 
standard biomass. This is only 15MW 
less than when fuelled with coal. At this 
output our efficiency rates will be just 
0.5 percentage points less than coal 
efficiency rates. This is materially better 
performance than we originally expected 
reflecting further technical progress 
and investment. 
Our overall target is to achieve a capacity 
of 645MW using standard woody 
biomass. We have already demonstrated 
that we can achieve this higher output 
under special conditions when using 
particularly high calorific sustainable 
wood pellets. 
In March this year, we expect to have 
two domes, half of our new 300,000 
tonne biomass storage facility, fully 
operational. We expect the full capacity 
to be operational in the third quarter. 
We anticipate that the Port of Hull facility 
will be fully operational in March 2014 
and the Port of Immingham by the end 
of the year. In the second quarter of 2014 
we envisage there being 100 biomass 
rail freight wagons in operation.
At the earliest, we now expect to convert 
our third unit in the fourth quarter of 
2015. The initial load factor for this unit 
will depend on biomass supply chain 
development. We are moving forward 
with the engineering designs, planning 
and biomass sourcing strategy for the 
conversion of a fourth unit and would 
hope to be able to progress the 
investment decision on this unit as soon 
as the regulatory position is clear with 
a view to conversion in 2016.
We believe that there is significant 
value to the Group in increasing 
our own supplies of wood pellets. 
We are now moving forward with the 
development of new sites to establish 
additional wood pellet plants in the US.
We plan to continue to grow our retail 
sales through Haven Power, which is on 
track to achieve 12–15TWh of annual 
sales over the next few years.
During 2013, we arrived at a lead case 
technical solution to ensure compliance 
with the more stringent emissions 
standards of the Industrial Emissions 
Directive from 2016. The solution involves 
low NOX burners on all six units, selective 
non-catalytic reduction (“SNCR”) 
technology and more selective coal 
procurement. We will trial SNCR and low 
NOX burners on one coal unit and our 
enhanced co-firing biomass unit during 
this year to verify our analysis.
As we move from being a coal-fired 
generator burning some biomass to 
become an integrated Group sourcing 
biomass, generating renewable electricity 
and selling it to business customers, 
the commercial structure of the 
Group will change. As we progress this 
transformation we will remain committed 
to developing in parallel the optimal 
capital structure for the Group. 
We are confident that this transformation 
will deliver an attractive future for the 
business and our shareholders. It will 
also deliver a significant amount of 
cost-effective renewable power to UK 
consumers and make a meaningful 
contribution to the UK’s 2020 climate 
change targets.

Principal performance indicators
Monitoring our performance
Our principal performance indicators provide a snapshot  
of how we are performing against our overriding objective to  
maximise the value of the Drax business, and the progress we are 
making against our strategic initiatives and key priorities.
Grow our 
retail business
Maximise the value 
of the Drax business
Maintain an optimal 
supporting capital 
structure
Includes cash and short-term investments, 
less borrowings net of deferred finance costs
Why we measure
Monitoring net cash ensures an efficient 
capital structure is maintained to support 
our business, alongside sufficient liquidity  
to manage our future obligations.
Comment
As we progress our biomass transformation 
significant capital expenditure has been invested 
during 2013, funded by the term loans and share 
placing proceeds. Lower profits and higher 
volumes of ROC assets held on the balance 
sheet have combined to reduce net cash.
Net sales distributed through our 
retail supply arm, Haven Power
Why we measure
A measure of the rate of growth in our 
retail business.
Comment
Our retail business, Haven Power, continued 
to deliver good growth during 2013, largely 
as a result of the planned expansion of the 
customer base.
The aggregate of net merchant sales 
and net Balancing Mechanism activity
Why we measure
Net sales tracks the volume of power we 
can sell at positive margins.
Comment
Following a record output in 2012, 2013 
net sales were lower reflecting higher 
outage rates. With a double outage and 
the conversion of our first unit to run on 
biomass, we have retained good availability 
levels, allowing us to take advantage of 
good margins available.
Fuel costs excluding carbon divided by 
volume of net sales
Why we measure
The average cost of fuel (excluding carbon 
and including the value of renewable support) 
tracks the fuel cost component of the dark 
green and bark spread achieved, and reflects 
the value captured from effective fuel 
procurement and diversified fuel sources.
Comment
Falling coal prices have driven our average 
fuel costs down over the last three years. 
This has been partially offset by increased 
use of biomass, as biomass is more expensive 
than coal. 
Power revenues divided by volume of 
net sales (includes imbalance charges)
Why we measure
The average achieved price of electricity 
tracks the power price component of the 
dark green and bark spread achieved.
Comment
Our average achieved price of electricity 
reflects the contracted position at the 
start of the year, as well as power prices 
during the period. Following a period of 
volatility in 2011 and early 2012, power prices 
have remained relatively stable through to 
the end of 2013.
Carbon costs divided by volume of 
allowances purchased
Why we measure
The average cost of carbon (excluding 
carbon price support) tracks the carbon 
cost component of the dark green 
spread achieved.
Comment
Market prices for carbon fell dramatically in 
the second half of 2011 and have remained 
low since. The fall in prices reflected 
concerns over the Eurozone economies 
and the risk of oversupply, which are yet 
to be mitigated by political intervention 
as described in Commodity markets.

Why we measure
Load factor tracks our operating 
performance and the competitiveness 
of Drax Power Station.
Comment
Generation output is driven by market 
conditions and plant availability. Output in 
2013 was 26.2TWh, slightly lower than the 
record level of 2012. 
Average percentage of time the units 
were available for generation
Why we measure
Availability tracks our operating 
performance, enabling assessment of, 
and providing guidance for, our operational 
regime and maintenance investment plans.
Comment
From 2013, we present availability for both 
our biomass and coal units separately. 
The operational performance of our coal 
units continues to be industry-leading and 
our first biomass unit is performing very 
well (note: biomass availability is based on 
585MW capacity).
Tonnes of sustainable biomass fuel burnt 
during the year
Why we measure
Measuring the levels of sustainable 
biomass burnt tracks our progress in 
producing power from renewable and 
sustainable sources.
Comment
Following the conversion of our first unit 
to run fully on biomass from April 2013, 
we have seen a significant increase in our 
biomass volumes burnt. We will continue to 
increase these volumes as we progress our 
biomass transformation.
CO2 emissions rate per unit of output
Why we measure
This measure of carbon emissions 
illustrates our progress in reducing the 
carbon footprint of Drax Power Station.
Comment
With our progression towards becoming 
a predominantly biomass-fuelled power 
station, we are realising significant savings 
in carbon dioxide emissions. Our biomass 
unit, converted in April, delivered 2.7 million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide savings in 2013. 
However, there is still work to be done to 
bring this metric down further. 
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: lost time injuries/hours 
worked x 100,000
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: (lost time injuries + worse than 
first aid injuries)/hours worked x 100,000
Why we measure
These injury rate metrics track our health and safety performance and enable us to maintain  
a strong health and safety culture.
Comment
During 2013 we undertook our first conversion of a unit to be fuelled entirely by biomass, as 
well as planned outages for two of our coal units and commenced construction work in the US. 
Alongside this significant activity, our safety record continues to be strong. However, weaker 
safety performance in the US has increased our injury rates during 2013. We have responded 
with greater supervision at these sites and will continue our commitment to delivering a positive 
health and safety culture across our operations.

Marketplace
The structure of the 
electricity market
The electricity market in Great Britain 
is characterised by six large vertically 
integrated companies, with interests 
in both the generation and supply of 
electricity, and a number of smaller 
“independent” companies, some of 
which are purely generation or supply 
companies and others which have an 
interest in both. Drax is an independent 
company, with interests in both 
generation and supply in the market.
Today, the energy mix benefits from 
a diversity of fuel sources, including 
gas, coal, nuclear and renewables. 
This diversity is a key contributor to 
security of supply.
In 2012 (the latest figures available(1)), 
the generating capacity of the UK’s 
major power producers was 81,742MW. 
The final consumption of electricity in 
2012 was approximately 318TWh.
Drax has a 5% share in the generation 
capacity market and typically meets 
7–8% of the UK’s electricity needs. 
Through our retail company, Haven 
Power, we serve businesses of all sizes, 
together accounting for sales of over 
8.1TWh of power in 2013.
The wholesale 
electricity market
Various mechanisms exist to allow 
power to be traded at the wholesale 
level. Trading can take place bilaterally 
or on exchanges, and contracts for 
electricity can be struck over timescales 
ranging from several years ahead to 
on-the-day trading markets. It can 
also be traded for specific periods, for 
example, specific half hours or specific 
seasons. The wholesale electricity 
market trades across three sub-markets:
 
,long-term forward market allowing 
contracts to be struck up to several 
years ahead of delivery in response 
to market participants’ requirements;
 
,short-term bilateral market operated 
through power exchanges which gives 
market participants the opportunity to 
fine tune their contractual positions; 
and
 
,Balancing Mechanism (real-time 
market) through which the System 
Operator accepts offers and bids 
for electricity to enable it to balance 
supply and demand on the system.
Wholesale prices
Power prices are driven by a number 
of factors, such as underlying 
commodity prices, the availability of 
generating capacity on the electricity 
system, and the physical positions taken 
by individual market participants.
The wholesale market operates on 
price and the relative prices of gas 
and coal, along with the operating 
efficiencies of the various power 
stations, will determine which of 
gas-fired generation or coal-fired 
generation is the more expensive and 
so operates at the margin. If gas prices 
are high then gas-fired generation 
becomes the marginal plant. 
As well as selling power through 
the wholesale electricity market, 
we are selling an increasing proportion 
of our output directly to business 
customers through our retail company, 
Haven Power. This provides us with 
a credit-efficient route to market for 
power, as well as a good route to market 
for Renewables Obligation Certificates 
and Levy Exemption Certificates earned 
by our renewable power generation. 
Where we sell  
our power
Complex arrangements and mechanisms govern  
the supply and demand of a product which is not stored,  
yet is vital to everyday life.

 Operational and financial performance
Introduction
Our EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 
2013 was £230 million, compared to 
£298 million in 2012. This reflects the 
increased carbon costs incurred through 
the ending of free carbon dioxide (“CO2”) 
emissions allowances and the introduction 
of the carbon price support (“CPS”) 
mechanism. Together these measures 
added £120 million to our fuel costs in 2013.
Our continued strength in operations 
has allowed us to benefit from attractive 
dark green spreads during the year, 
mitigating to some extent the impact 
of additional carbon costs. 
2013 was a year of significant project 
activity across our operations. 
We undertook a double outage during 
the year, our first unit was converted 
to run fully on biomass in April and 
construction work continues in the UK 
and has commenced in the US on our 
biomass transformation project.
At Haven Power Limited (“Haven 
Power”), our retail business, we have 
continued to deliver good sales volume 
growth, with 8.1TWh of sales in the year 
ended 31 December 2013, compared to 
5.1TWh in 2012.
During 2013, £286 million was invested 
on capital expenditure projects, of which 
£228 million related to our biomass 
transformation plans. At the Drax Power 
Station site this includes the new biomass 
receipt, storage and distribution facilities. 
Commissioning for the facilities required to 
fuel our first biomass unit was completed 
at the end of 2013. In the US Gulf, work 
commenced on the development of two 
wood pellet plants and a port operation, 
targeting commercial operations dates 
in the first half of 2015.
In support of our biomass transformation 
plans, in April 2013 we announced 
that we had secured a £75 million 
amortising loan facility with Friends 
Life, underpinned by a guarantee from 
HM Treasury under the Infrastructure 
UK Guarantee scheme. 
This replaced £50 million of the 
£100 million amortising loan 
facility agreed with the UK Green 
Investment Bank in December 2012. 
Alongside these facilities we have a 
£100 million amortising loan facility 
with M&G UK Companies Financing 
Fund, secured in 2012, and our 
£400 million working capital and 
letter of credit facility.
With £225 million of loans drawn down, 
net cash at 31 December 2013 was 
£71 million. Supported by the proceeds 
of our share placing in 2012 this provides 
the financial platform from which we are 
realising our biomass transformation.
At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, the Board will recommend a 
final dividend for 2013 of 8.9 pence per 
share, taking total dividends for the year 
to £71 million.
This review includes further explanation 
and commentary in relation to our 
principal performance indicators and 
results for the year.
Strength across  
our operations
We have continued to deliver strong operational performance 
during a year of significant project activity. Our EBITDA is lower 
than last year, reflecting increased carbon costs.

EBITDA for the Group is our key measure of

additional carbon costs at a gross margin level, 
see page 34 for more details.
Whilst medium-term earnings are under 
pressure due to the increase in carbon costs, 
our share price rise reflects the strong outlook 
for the Group as it transforms itself into 
a predominantly biomass-fired generator. 
The delivery of our biomass transformation

 Operational and financial performance
Simplifying the numbers
There are two core elements to our gross profit:  
the dark green spread and the bark spread.
Fuel
Our cost of sales comprises fuel costs in respect of generation, grid charges, other retail 
costs and cost of power purchases, the largest element being fuel costs.
Fuel costs in respect of generation rose from £929 million in 2012 to £946 million in 2013. 
This figure includes the cost of coal and sustainable biomass burnt (net of the value of renewable 
support) and carbon allowances purchased. The power station’s output for the year drives the 
requirement for the volume of fuel, although the fuel mix also influences total fuel costs.
In 2013 we entered Phase III of the EU ETS with no free carbon emissions allowances 
from the start of the year, compared to the 9.5 million tonnes of free allowances received 
in 2012. This increased the cost of carbon by £58 million in 2013. In addition, from April 2013 
the CPS mechanism came into effect, creating a levy on our coal purchases, and adding 
£62 million to fuel costs in 2013. In total carbon costs increased by £120 million as a result of 
these two factors in 2013. This was offset to a limited extent by increased biomass burn which 
reduced our carbon emissions allowances requirement.
Volume
In 2013 our net sales were 26.2TWh compared to a record 27.1TWh in 2012. Generation volumes 
are driven by plant availability and commodity market conditions.
Generation increases when availability is high and commodity prices make it profitable for us 
to generate.
Operational performance remained strong in 2013. However with the planned double outage 
and the conversion of our first unit to run on biomass, the load factor for the plant as a whole 
was lower at 80% compared to 82% last year. Dark green and bark spreads remained strong 
in 2013 as described on page 33.
Income
Our revenue is comprised of power sales, ROC and LEC sales, ancillary services income and 
other income, the largest element being power sales, followed by ROC and LEC sales.
We sell power into the wholesale market and through our retail arm, Haven Power, to business 
customers in the Industrial and Commercial and Small and Medium Enterprise markets. 
The revenue achieved is influenced by market prices, the timing of securing the sales and 
power station output.
ROC and LEC sales represent an increasing element of our total revenue as we expand our 
output from biomass generation. This revenue stream is influenced by the number of ROCs 
we generate, the price we can achieve for ROCs in the market and the timing of the sales. 
Haven Power, whilst a low margin business, offers a route to market for the ROC and LEC 
output of our generation business.

Overview
Dark green spread
The difference between the power price  
and the cost of coal and carbon.
Bark spread
The difference between the power price and  
the cost of biomass net of renewable support.
Tomorrow
…as we move towards becoming a predominantly biomass-fired generation business, 
the cost of sustainable biomass, the value of renewable support and therefore the 
bark spread will increasingly drive our profitability.
Sustainable biomass
The cost of biomass burnt is made up of two elements, the gross 
cost of purchasing the fuel, less the value of the renewable 
support receivable. 
The gross cost of the fuel includes the cost of the raw material, 
processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs, and is 
influenced by exchange rates where the fuel is contracted in 
a foreign currency.
The renewable support reflects the value of the ROCs and LECs 
earned through generating electricity from burning sustainable 
biomass. This value is recognised as a reduction in the cost of 
sales when the related biomass is burnt. 
Upon sale the value of the ROCs and LECs is recognised in revenue 
and reversed from cost of sales.
Coal and carbon
The cost of our coal and carbon is driven by market prices at the 
time we secure the purchases. Our aim is to match the timing of 
our coal and carbon purchases to the related power sales in order 
to lock in a margin (or spread). 
We are able to burn a variety of fuels including petcoke, pond fines 
(a coal mining residue) and a wide range of coals, all of which allows us 
to maximise value where alternatives are economically advantageous.
Under the EU ETS we are obliged to submit carbon emissions 
allowances equivalent to the tonnes of carbon we emit through 
burning fossil fuels. The volume of allowances we are required to 
purchase is dependent on the volume and quality of coal we burn 
and the efficiency of the station.
Operational performance
Whilst the market spreads available, in comparison to our short run marginal cost of producing, determine whether it is 
optimal to generate, the operational performance of the power station determines whether we are able to generate and 
benefit from good market spreads.
Our availability metrics show the amount of time we are able to generate if required. This is influenced by both planned and 
forced outage rates. We assess the optimal time to undertake planned outages, based on expected market spreads available. 
In comparison, forced outage rates are driven by the maintenance needs of the plant, for example, leaks in boiler tubes 
requiring repair.
We have a long-term target of 5% for our forced outage rate, set based on extensive benchmarking of industry-leading 
standards. Our operational statistics continue to demonstrate our leadership position in the coal-fired generation sector.
Power
We sell power to the wholesale and 
retail markets.
The price achieved for power sold into the 
wholesale market is based on market prices 
at the time we secure the power. The timing 
of our sales is driven by our hedging strategy, 
but can be influenced by liquidity in the market 
and requirements for collateral.
Our retail business provides an alternative 
route to market for our power, which does 
not usually require us to post collateral. 
Haven Power sells to business customers, 
swapping collateral risk for credit risk which 
can be, and is, managed carefully.
ROC and LEC income
Upon sale to a counterparty, ROC and LEC revenue is recognised, 
moving the value from cost of sales to revenue.
Sales have historically been made following the end of a compliance 
period, causing a peak in revenue, ROC and LEC cost of sales, and cash 
in the third quarter of a year.

Commodity markets
The margins of our generation business are driven by commodity market movements 
and the timing of our fuel purchases and power sales. For our coal generation 
capacity the margins available are reflected in the dark green spread, the difference 
between the price of power we sell and the cost of the coal and carbon we purchase. 
For our newly converted biomass unit, the margins available are reflected in the bark 
spread, the difference between the price of power we sell plus renewable support 
and the cost of the biomass we purchase.
The trends in commodity prices witnessed in the last few years are described in the 
following paragraphs and illustrated in the accompanying charts.
Power and gas
Following a period of volatility in 2011 and early 2012, power prices have remained 
relatively stable over the 18 months to 31 December 2013. The gas market continues 
to drive power prices.
The impact of the Fukushima disaster and limited Japanese nuclear generation 
continued to provide support to the global liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) market 
throughout 2013. UK gas prices remained strong and stable through 2013 with prices 
being pulled upwards towards oil indexed European prices (and international LNG 
prices) in order to attract imports.
European and UK gas prices remain at a premium to US prices, where advances in 
technology are leading to a large supply of low priced shale gas, adding to already 
significant reserves. However, shale gas developments outside the US are in their 
infancy and will in all probability, therefore, have little impact in the short to medium 
term. Furthermore, demand for gas is rising rapidly so that even with the possibility 
of increased shale gas production, global markets may well remain strong.
Coal
Market prices for international coal have fallen steadily from a peak in mid-2011.
Whilst global demand has grown through 2013, the low US gas prices described 
above forced increases in US coal exports. Combined with rising supplies from 
Indonesia and Australia, this has resulted in a weak global short-term market 
characterised by low international prices and high stocks in Europe. With high stock 
levels also being held in China, any increase in Asian demand has been insufficient 
to absorb the excess supply.
These market dynamics, as well as increasing operating costs, have continued to 
put pressure on UK domestic coal producers.
Carbon
Following the dramatic fall in market prices for EU ETS carbon allowances in the 
second half of 2011, amid fears for the Eurozone economies, the downward trend 
continued through 2012 and 2013. 
The combination of slow economic growth and any Phase II surplus bankable into 
Phase III, drove carbon prices to new lows during 2013 before they recovered slightly 
towards the end of the year. 
With an over-supplied market, the main price driver is political intervention and the 
“back-loading” debate (postponing the sales of emissions allowances to restrict 
current supplies). Although the back-loading proposals are not finalised the likelihood 
of implementation has increased with the EU providing the required authorisation for 
the European Commission. However, the timing and the profile of the volumes to be 
removed still remains uncertain.

Marketplace, performance and risk
Overview
Forest product industry 
The global forest product 
industry is already a large, well-
established marketplace, serving 
the building, furniture and paper 
industries with the higher quality, 
more expensive portions of 
the tree. We are able to use the 
thinnings and residues from 
the existing forestry industry 
that sometimes have no other 
alternative use.
Wood pellet market
The raw fibre can be 
turned into pellets to allow 
more efficient handling 
and transportation. 
With third party contracts 
agreed alongside our own 
pellet plants in development, 
we have made good 
progress in 2013 in securing 
the near-term sustainable 
supplies needed for our 
biomass transformation.
Renewable energy
The wood pellets delivered 
to the power station are either 
stored or delivered to our 
converted unit to generate 
renewable power.
Biomass
The majority of biomass used for large scale power generation is priced in US dollars 
or euros. Movements in these exchange rates have driven the changes in biomass 
costs during the period.
At the start of 2013 we saw a weak US dollar, relative to sterling, driving market 
biomass prices down. The dollar recovered mid-way through the year, but 
weakened again towards the end of the year, as can be seen in the chart on page 39. 
As explained in Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts below, the 
extensive foreign currency hedging programme we are putting in place provides us 
with some protection from these fluctuations in exchange rates. However, as a result 
this will inevitably drive some volatility through the unrealised gains and losses line 
in our income statement (a non-cash item, excluded from underlying earnings).
Dark green spread and bark spread
As a result of the relatively stable power prices and low coal and carbon prices, we 
have seen attractive dark green spreads during 2013. However, the introduction of 
both full auctioning of EU emissions allowances from the start of the year and the 
CPS mechanism from April has increased costs for coal-fired generators.
Having fallen during the year, market bark spreads rose at the year end to levels similar 
to those at the start of the year. The movements have principally been driven by 
currency effects described above. 
Looking forward, the UK government’s CPS mechanism, whilst strengthening the 
case for biomass generation, is likely to erode the competitive position of coal-fired 
plant. Our biomass transformation project means the bark spread will become an 
increasingly important element of our gross margin.

(1) Includes £28 million (2012: £17 million) for fuel sales.
The generation gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £430 million, 
compared to £496 million in 2012. Whilst the dark green spreads, which currently 
account for the majority of our gross profit, remained strong the impact of additional 
carbon costs meant that profits for 2013 were lower.
The introduction of the UK CPS mechanism from April 2013 adds a levy to our coal 
purchases and increases the cost of the coal we burn. In addition, from 2013 we entered 
Phase III of the EU ETS with the removal of free CO2 emissions allowances, compared 
to the 9.5 million tonnes of free CO2 allowances received in 2012 under Phase II. 
The combined cost of these measures added £120 million to our fuel costs in 2013.
The rising cost of carbon will continue to erode the profit margins of coal generating 
plant. This very much supports the economic case for the strategy we have 
developed to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator.
Revenue
Total generation revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £1,780 million, 
compared to £1,630 million in 2012.
Excluding £334 million of power purchased in the market (2012: £138 million), our 
generation revenue of £1,335 million was lower than the equivalent comparative for 
2012 (£1,389 million). This decrease reflects the reduction in net power sold (electrical 
output), at an average achieved electricity price (£51.0 per MWh) broadly in line 
with last year (£51.3 per MWh). The output in 2012 represented a record level for the 
plant as a result of the combination of high availability and good margins available in 
the market.
Generation revenue also includes sales of Renewables Obligation Certificates 
(“ROCs”) and Levy Exempt Certificates (“LECs”), totalling £63 million in both 2013 
and 2012. 
We recognise the value of the ROCs and LECs earned as generated, reducing 
fuel costs in respect of generation. The recognition of a sale is matched by a 
corresponding cost of sale. The ROCs and LECs, earned through generating 
electricity from burning biomass, are held on our balance sheet until sold.
The timing of ROC sales is largely driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation 
(“RO”) deadlines and commercial considerations. Consequently, the majority of the 
ROCs generated in 2013 will be sold in 2014.

In April 2013, we converted our first unit to run fully on biomass under the ROC 
regime. As a result of the increased biomass burn and as demonstrated by the table 
at the foot of the opposite page, we have generated considerably more ROCs and 
LECs during the year ended 31 December 2013, than during 2012. 
Total generation revenue includes sales fulfilled by purchasing power in the market. 
We purchase power when the cost of power in the market is below our marginal cost 
of production in respect of power previously contracted for generation and delivery 
by us, and to cover any shortfall in generation during outages. The cost of these 
purchases is included in cost of sales.
Whilst net power sold at 26.2TWh in 2013 reflects a reduction from 27.1TWh in 2012, 
this gross up for power purchased in the market resulted in the overall increase in 
total generation revenue.
Cost of sales
As explained on pages 30 to 31, our fuel costs are driven by a combination of market 
prices at the time of securing the fuel and the mix of different fuels burnt during 
the period. In addition, as noted above UK and EU legislation (CPS mechanism and 
Phase III of the EU ETS) to incentivise renewable energy has increased the cost of 
burning coal.
Our average cost of fuel (excluding CO2 emissions allowances) for the year ended 
31 December 2013 was £27.9 per MWh, compared to £30.6 per MWh in 2012. As the 
largest component of our fuel burnt, coal prices still drive the average fuel cost, with a 
falling international market price contributing to the decrease in the year.
Biomass accounted for 12% of our total fuel burnt by heat content in 2013 (2012: 5%), 
the increase reflecting the conversion of our first unit fuelled by biomass from April 
2013. As we progress our transformation, biomass costs will account for a greater 
proportion of the fuel costs in respect of generation.
Within costs of sales, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel delivered 
to site less the value of renewable support received. The cost of the fuel includes 
raw material and delivery costs. The renewable support reflects the value assigned 
to ROCs and LECs earned through generating electricity from burning biomass. 
The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the net biomass cost. 
As described in Revenue above, upon sale of the ROCs and LECs the income is 
recognised in revenue and the value of the ROC or LEC (previously held in the balance 
sheet) is recorded separately in cost of sales. 
Also included within fuel costs in respect of generation is the cost of CO2 emissions 
allowances purchased. For Phase III of the EU ETS (2013 – 2020) we have no free 
carbon allowances (2012: 9.5 million tonnes) and are therefore required to meet 
the full cost of CO2 tonnes emitted from coal generation through purchases of 
allowances in the market. This resulted in the increase in our purchased allowances 
requirement from 13.1 million tonnes (at an average price of £6.3 per tonne) in 2012 
to 20.3 million tonnes in 2013 (at an average price of £6.1 per tonne), although 
this is offset by the increase in biomass burn, reducing our total CO2 emissions 
allowances requirement.
Generation cost of sales also includes grid charges, which continue to rise as more 
intermittent generation impacts on system balancing costs, and power purchases – 
the cost of power purchased in the market as outlined above.

Health and safety
A significant amount of project work has been undertaken during 2013, with a double 
planned outage and the conversion of our first unit to run on biomass, in place of coal. 
In addition we completed the build of our biomass receipt, storage and distribution 
systems to support this first converted unit, whilst in the US work continues apace 
on the construction of two pellet plants and a port facility.
Against this backdrop we have continued to deliver good safety statistics with a 
lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate of 0.09 and 0.29, respectively, 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to 0.06 and 0.17 in 2012. Our safety 
performance in the UK continues to be industry-leading. However, performance 
at our US construction sites is not yet meeting Drax standards. As described in the 
Chief Executive’s statement we have taken action to bring US performance up to 
our UK standards.
Outage and plant utilisation levels
Biomass
Our first unit was converted to biomass in April using, on a temporary basis, the 
storage and distribution systems originally built for biomass co-firing. Through the 
final quarter we began commissioning our new on-site biomass receipt, storage and 
distribution systems, with those systems required to support our first converted unit 
being completed towards the end of the year. 
Planned outages, mainly in the first half of the year, for scheduled inspections and to 
allow for planned upgrades to the rail loop, resulted in a planned outage rate of 5.4% 
for our biomass unit. The forced outage rate for the period of 6.8% largely reflects 
expected issues for a newly converted unit, and we have seen a steady improvement 
through the period as we gained more experience. Availability for the biomass plant 
for the period was therefore 88%.
The load factor for our biomass unit was initially constrained by the use of temporary 
systems, which resulted in expected reliability issues with fuel delivery. Many of these 
issues were overcome through the introduction of the new facilities towards the end 
of the year. As a result the load factor for the period was 75%.
Coal
We have continued to deliver good operating performance from our coal units. 
The planned outage rate for our coal plant for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 
10%, compared to 9.6% in 2012, reflecting the two unit outages undertaken in both 
years. Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our six 
units once every four years. Consequently, there is an irregular pattern to planned 
outages and associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will 
each undergo a major planned outage. One unit will undergo a major outage in 2014.
The forced outage rate for our coal plant of 6.8% for the year ended 31 December 
2013 (2012: 4.8%) was higher than our long-term target of 5%. We have continued to 
test a wide variety of advantaged fuels, for example coals with lower cost than the 
standard bituminous coal that we burn. In the first half of the year, some of these 
fuels have resulted in a higher number of plant integrity issues than we typically 
experience. However, the testing work is an important component of our drive 
to optimise value from our fuel mix, as well as the work to define our solution for 
compliance with the Industrial Emissions Directive (see Chief Executive’s statement).
Coal plant availability for the year ended 31 December 2013 was therefore 84%. 
Although slightly lower than availability of 86% for 2012, this continues to demonstrate 
a leadership position amongst coal-fired plant. With strong plant despatch economics, 
the resulting load factor of 80% compares favourably with the average for other UK 
coal and gas plants.
The load factor of 80% for the plant as a whole for the year ended 31 December 
2013 was down by 2% on 2012, reflecting a decrease in electrical output (net sales) 
to 26.2TWh in 2013, compared with the record output of 27.1TWh in 2012.

Growth
The strategic value to the Group of Haven Power, the Group’s retail business, is the 
alternative credit-efficient route to market it provides for our power, ROCs and LECs.
Whilst margins in the I&C market are very tight, the volumes available are much 
greater with c. 50% of the total electricity supplied in the UK in 2013 being delivered to 
the I&C market, compared to c.15% delivered to the SME market. In total, the business 
electricity market is c.190TWh per annum, and differs from the wholesale market in 
that collateral support is not usually required for forward power sales. In selling power 
into the retail market, rather than wholesale, the Group swaps collateral risk for credit 
risk, which is managed by assessing the financial strength of our customers.
In addition, Haven Power provides access through this market for the Group’s 
renewable power. The ROCs and LECs, earned through burning biomass in the 
generation business, can be utilised by the retail business.
We are on track to deliver retail sales of 12–15TWh by 2015 at Haven across the I&C 
and SME markets. Haven Power has well established credit management policies, 
with both strong initial acceptance criteria and robust credit management processes, 
coupled with regular monitoring and independent review. This is evident from our 
low bad debt experience to date. During the year we completed the migration of 
customers onto our new billing system, which together with our strong account 
management model, provides the foundation to grow our customer base.
Renewable power and climate change levy exempt power together currently 
account for c.50% of Haven Power sales. With our growth targets for the business, 
Haven Power should utilise all the ROCs generated from our current converted unit 
and a substantial proportion of the LECs from the planned unit conversions.
Gross margin
As Haven Power continues to deliver good volume growth, movements in the 
financial metrics are largely driven by volumes. In the year ended 31 December 2013, 
sales volumes rose 59% from 5.1TWh in 2012, to 8.1TWh. This drove an increase 
in revenue from £451 million in 2012, to £751 million in 2013.
The majority of the growth at Haven Power has come from the more competitive 
I&C market which has a lower gross margin than the SME market. In addition, rising 
grid charges and other retail costs of sales including Feed-in Tariff costs, driven up by 
increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation, combined to drive a gross 
profit of £16 million, up marginally on £15 million in 2012.

Group operating and administrative expenses
Group operating and administrative expenses before depreciation were £215 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to £213 million in 2012, reflecting an 
inflationary increase in our cost base and investment in the growth of both our retail 
business and the operations in the US. 
2012 operating costs included £5 million in relation to compliance measures under 
the Community Energy Savings Programme (“CESP”) which completed last year 
(see page 43 for more details).
We remain focused on achieving strong operational cost performance and we will 
continue to carefully control our underlying cost base.
Group EBITDA
The Group EBITDA is primarily driven by the factors influencing the gross margin. 
The fall in EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2013 to £230 million, from 
£298 million in 2012, is therefore a result of the increasing costs of carbon following 
the removal of free carbon allowances under Phase III of the EU ETS and the 
introduction of the CPS mechanism during 2013.
Whilst these additional costs and the government’s trajectory for increasing CPS over 
time, erode the profitability of our coal-fired generation plant, they strengthen the 
case for biomass generation. We are making a significant investment in our biomass 
transformation; however our financial performance must be viewed in this context 
until our biomass operations reach an appropriate scale.
Depreciation
Depreciation was £65 million for the year ended 31 December 2013, compared 
to £59 million in 2013. As we continue to invest in our biomass transformation, 
our depreciation charge will increase as new investment comes on stream over 
the coming years.

Overview
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts
The Group enters into forward contracts for the sale of power and the purchase of 
coal, biomass and carbon emissions allowances which are the elements which make 
up the gross profit of the business as described on pages 30 to 31. In addition, where 
contracts for the purchase of fuel or carbon allowances are denominated in a foreign 
currency, the Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts. 
These contracts aim to de-risk the business, providing secure cash flows into the 
future. The accounting for these contracts at rising volumes increases volatility in 
the unrealised gains and losses line in the income statement.
Where possible, we take the own use exemption for contracts entered into and held 
for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward domestic coal 
and biomass contracts and therefore we do not reflect their value in our accounts 
until the contracts close out (unlike derivatives which we mark-to-market).
Forward contracts which meet the definition of derivatives under IFRS and do not 
qualify for the own use exemption, are included in our accounts at their fair value 
at the balance sheet date, derived largely by reference to market prices at that 
date. Unrealised gains and losses arise on the movements in the fair value of these 
contracts between balance sheet dates. 
Where the derivative contracts meet the definition of an effective hedge under 
IFRS, the movement in their fair value is recognised through the hedge reserve, 
a component of shareholders’ equity in the balance sheet. This is largely the case 
for our forward power and carbon contracts, as well as some of our forward foreign 
exchange contracts.
Where they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge (from an accounting 
perspective, even though they represent an economic hedge), the movement in 
their fair value is reflected in the income statement as an unrealised gain or loss on 
derivative contracts. This encompasses some of our forward foreign exchange and 
financial coal contracts.
Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised through the income statement 
were £110 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to £36 million in 
2012. In both years the figure was largely driven by movements in the fair value of 
our forward foreign exchange contracts.
These contracts reflect an extensive hedging programme to support our biomass 
procurement activities. The programme covers all contracted and a substantial 
proportion of as yet un-contracted but forecast purchases and provides a significant 
degree of protection from adverse currency movements.
A weakening US dollar at both year ends resulted in unrealised losses on these 
contracts, as market rates were preferential in comparison to contracted rates. 
The volumes of these contracts have increased significantly during the year as we 
look to de-risk the business by securing our cash flows in sterling.
In considering mark-to-market movements, it is important to recognise that 
profitability is driven by our strategy to deliver market level dark green or bark spreads, 
not by the absolute price of any single commodity at any given date. We therefore 
look to underlying profit (excluding unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts) as our performance indicator.
For more information on our derivative contracts see note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Interest
Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2013 were £23 million compared 
to £14 million in 2012, the increase predominantly arising from the interest paid 
on borrowings, as we drew down £100 million in December 2012 and a further 
£125 million in April 2013.

The 2013 tax credit of £20 million, compares to a £26 million tax charge in 2012. 
The reduction is driven by the £22 million impact of a 3% reduction in corporation tax 
rates (2012: £15 million from a 2% reduction). In addition, the 2013 tax charge includes 
the impact of research and development claims, now agreed with HMRC, resulting in 
a credit of £7 million in respect of prior years. 2012 includes the impact of a revision to 
previous years’ capital allowances claims agreed with HMRC, resulting in a tax credit 
of £8 million recognised in the comparative period.
The underlying effective rate of tax (excluding the after tax impact of unrealised 
gains and losses on derivative contracts) is 0% in 2013, compared to 15% in 2012, the 
difference arising predominantly from the impact of the corporation tax rate changes 
as described above. 
In 2014 we expect underlying rates to more closely align with UK corporation 
tax rates.
The tax paid during the year was £18 million (2012: £54 million), principally reflecting 
lower profitability and tax rates in 2013 as described in Liquidity and capital resources. 
These payments were offset by tax refunds in respect of prior year credits noted 
above, bringing net taxes paid for 2013 to £11 million (2012: £51 million).
Profit after tax and earnings per share
Profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £51 million, compared to 
£164 million in 2012, driving basic earnings per share of 13 pence in 2013, compared 
to 44 pence in 2012.
We measure underlying earnings per share (excluding the after tax impact of 
unrealised gains and losses) as this strips out the volatility on our derivative 
contracts (non-cash items) which do not meet hedge effectiveness criteria under 
IFRS as described above. With underlying profit after tax of £142 million in 2013 
(2012: £193 million), underlying earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 
2013 was 35 pence per share, compared to 52 pence in 2012.
The reduction in underlying earnings per share in 2013 principally reflects the impact 
of additional costs of carbon on our profitability as outlined above.

Overview
Cash generated from operations
Cash generated from operations of 
£171 million in 2013, compared to 
£263 million in 2012, incorporates a fall in 
EBITDA caused by the rising cost of carbon. 
This is compounded by the increase in 
ROC and LEC assets of £121 million, 
following the conversion of our biomass 
unit. As noted above, the value of our ROCs 
and LECs generated is held in the balance 
sheet until the assets are sold to a third 
party – the timing of which is driven by RO 
deadlines and commercial considerations. 
This outflow was only partially mitigated 
by the inflows from reductions in carbon 
assets and working capital. 
Net cash used in investing activities
Purchases of property, plant and 
equipment of £302 million in 2013 
(2012: £206 million) are reflective of the 
significant amount of investment across 
the business as we continue to invest in 
our biomass transformation, see more 
detail on page 42.
Net cash flows from financing activities
In order to support our biomass 
transformation we completed a 
refinancing, which included a share 
placing and the drawing down of 
£100 million against our loan facilities 
towards the end of 2012, subsequently 
enhanced in 2013 with the drawing down 
of an additional £125 million against our 
loan facilities, as described in Financing 
and cash flow management.
Net cash
From £402 million at 31 December 2012 the 
decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 
£104 million during the year leaves cash 
and short-term investments of £287 million 
at 31 December 2013. Increased borrowings 
have been used to support cash generated 
from operations in funding the capital 
investment programme. As such net 
cash (after deducting borrowings) is 
lower at 31 December 2013 at £71 million 
compared to £311 million in 2012.

Financing and cash flow management
In April 2013, we agreed a new £75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends 
Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK 
Guarantee Scheme. This replaced £50 million of the £100 million amortising term 
loan facility agreed with the Green Investment Bank, signed in December 2012. 
The new loan facility enhances the existing financing structure executed last year 
by providing additional liquidity to the Group and ensuring a smoother profile of debt 
maturities. Furthermore, the all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive. 
The financing structure also incorporates the remaining £50 million amortising term 
loan from the Green Investment Bank, a £100 million amortising term loan facility with 
the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a £400 million working capital and letter 
of credit facility. The term loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from four to eight 
years, whilst the working capital and letter of credit facility is due to mature in April 2016. 
In addition, a commodity trading facility also executed in December 2012, allows us to 
transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades (dark green spreads) at attractive 
prices without the requirement to post collateral. This facility has been operating 
well, offering trading counterparties access to the security package available to our 
senior lenders. Combined with other steps taken over the past three years to limit 
our requirements to post collateral, this is allowing the Group to operate comfortably 
with a sub-investment grade business model. 
Finally, towards the end of 2013 we completed our first ROC monetisation facility. 
As described above, cash for ROC sales can often flow back to renewable generators 
some time after the associated power was produced. This can result in significant 
working capital absorption, with ROC income often received more than 12 months after 
we have paid for the related biomass. We have agreed an £80 million facility with Lloyds 
Bank Commercial Finance Limited, which allows Drax to sell ROC receivables. 
Capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions were £286 million in the year ended 31 December 2013, 
compared to £224 million in 2012. This includes £228 million on our biomass 
transformation project (2012: £180 million). 
At the Drax Power Station site we completed the commissioning of the new receipt, 
storage and distribution systems for our first converted unit by the end of 2013, 
and we expect to have largely completed the on-site investment required to support 
three converted units by the end of 2014. These systems will provide us with the 
ability to unload rail wagons efficiently, store up to around 300 thousand tonnes 
of biomass on-site and deliver it direct to the combustion system. 
Our investment in upstream supply chain infrastructure continues, with the 
construction of our two pellet plants in Mississippi and Louisiana and our port 
development at Baton Rouge (also Louisiana) having started in the Summer. 
All three projects remain on schedule and on budget. We are targeting the first half 
of 2015 for commercial operations to begin reaching full capacity within six months.
We expect to spend £650–£700 million in total on progressively converting three 
generating units to biomass together with the supporting infrastructure and 
systems required, completing the two US pellet plants and port facility and ensuring 
compliance with the requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”).
Extensive research has been undertaken over the past few years to determine the 
optimal solution for IED compliance. As described in the Chief Executive’s statement, 
a lead solution has been identified and initial trials towards this will commence in 2014. 
The estimated capital cost is £75 million to £100 million over four years.
In addition, as described in the Chief Executive’s statement, we have now developed 
technical solutions to deliver output of 630MW in a biomass unit, with efficiency 
only 0.5% lower than that of a coal unit. We estimate that capital investment of 
approximately £90 million (over three years) is required to secure these performance 
improvements. Beyond this, we are evaluating further investments in the supply 
chain, (including options for additional pelleting facilities in the US) and the 
conversion of a fourth unit to biomass.

Overview
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future 
developments, performance and position including principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out in the Chief Executive’s statement, this Operational and financial 
performance review and the Principal risks and uncertainties section which follows. 
Our cash flows and borrowing facilities are described above. In addition, notes 19 
to 21 to the consolidated financial statements explain our approach to capital risk 
management and give details of financial instruments and hedging activities, and 
exposure to credit, counterparty and liquidity risk.
We have significant headroom in our new banking facilities, a recent history of cash 
generation, strong covenant compliance, and good visibility in near-term forecasts, 
due to our progressive hedging strategy. Our Business Plan, taking account of our 
capital investment plans and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
demonstrates that we expect to be able to operate within the level of our current 
banking facilities.
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
and continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing these 
financial statements.

Capital risk management 
See page 128
Seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the Winter 
period and lower despatch in the Summer months, when prices are lower and plant 
availability is affected by planned outages.
Accordingly, cash flow during the Summer months is materially reduced due to the 
combined effect of lower prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are 
increased during this period due to major planned outages. The Group’s £400 million 
working capital and letter of credit facility assists in managing the cash low points in 
the cycle where required (see Financing and cash flow management).
Contingent liability
We were obliged under CESP to deliver energy saving measures to domestic 
consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain during the period 1 October 
2009 to 31 December 2012. We entered into an agreement with a third party, 
pursuant to which the third party was obliged to deliver our CESP obligation for a total 
cost of £17 million. The third party failed to comply fully with its obligation under the 
agreement, leaving a significant shortfall against our CESP obligation. Having notified 
the counterparty of our contractual claim for breach of contract we continue to 
consider legal options available to us. We entered into further agreements with 
additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable.
At this stage it is not possible to predict whether any enforcement action may be 
imposed. No additional provisions have been recognised in respect of this matter 
as we are not able to reliably measure what the financial impact, if any, might be. 
See note 34 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Future developments
Regulatory developments
As set out in the Chief Executive’s statement, in December we received confirmation 
from the government that two Drax units are provisionally ranked equal first among 
the applications for Investment Contracts under the Final Investment Decision 
Enabling Contracts for Difference (“CfD”).
Looking forward, if awarded, this would result in our units operating under three 
different regimes; coal, biomass under the RO and biomass under the CfD. We are 
participating in the CfD process as it develops through to finalised Investment 
Contracts, which are expected to take effect from April 2015.
As outlined in the Chief Executive’s statement, we will modify one of our coal units 
during 2014 to operate as an enhanced co-firing unit, enabling us to support a full 
conversion in April 2015. However, in the interim, the operation of one of our units as 
enhanced co-firing, receiving 0.9ROC/MWh, rather than 1ROC/MWh applicable to 
a converted unit, will have a corresponding impact on the profits achievable in the 
near-term.
Also in December 2013 Capture Power Limited, the consortium of Drax, Alstom 
UK Limited and BOC (a member of The Linde Group) was awarded the Front 
End Engineering and Design contract, for its planned 426MW oxy-combustion 
demonstration project located on the Drax Power Station site.
A two-year process now commences with the negotiation of an engineering, 
procurement and construction contract and a CfD contract, all dependent 
on successful funding applications and adequate incentives for low carbon 
technologies from the electricity market reform. Drax has committed to invest 
£4 million in the project during this initial phase.

Overview
Distributions
Distribution policy
The Board has previously committed to distribute 50% of underlying earnings (being 
profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts) in each year. Underlying earnings 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 were £142 million.
As detailed in the Chief Executive’s statement, we are transforming our business 
to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator, vertically integrated 
through the biomass supply chain to retail sales to business customers. As our 
business model changes we will develop, in parallel, an optimal capital structure 
and distribution policy, aligned to the future of the business.
Dividends paid
On 18 February 2013 the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 24 April 2013, to pay a final dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 of 10.9 pence per share (£44 million). The final dividend was 
paid on 17 May 2013.
On 29 July 2013, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months 
ending 30 June 2013 of 8.7 pence per share (£35 million), representing 50% of 
underlying earnings for the period. The interim dividend was paid on 11 October 2013.
Dividends proposed
At the forthcoming AGM the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution 
is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 
of 8.9 pence per share (£36 million), payable on or before 16 May 2014.
Shares will be marked ex-dividend on 23 April 2014.

A structured approach  
to risk management
The effective management of risks within the Group  
underpins the delivery of our key priorities.
Drax Group plc 
Annual report and accounts 2013
46
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group has a comprehensive 
system of governance controls in place 
to manage risks. Policies have been 
established in key areas of the business 
such as trading, treasury, production 
and health and safety to ensure that 
these risks are managed in a controlled 
manner and in accordance with the 
policies set by the Board.
Internal control and 
risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. A process has been 
established for identifying, evaluating, 
determining risk appetite and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group 
and this has been in place for the year 
under review up to the date of approval 
of the 2013 Annual report and accounts. 
The process is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and 
can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Risk management committees
During the year the Group enhanced 
its risk management system with 
the establishment of a Group Risk 
Management Committee. It is chaired by 
the Director of Corporate Affairs and its 
members are the chairs of each of the 
business risk management committees. 
The Group Risk Management Committee 
is responsible for monitoring the risk 
management process on a Group wide 
basis. It also oversees the process 
in relation to cross-Group risks and 
assists the business risk management 
committees in risk analysis and 
identification of best practice, and 
provides additional assurance on the 
risk control environment to the Audit 
Committee and the Board. 
There are six business risk 
management committees:

Overview
Marketplace, performance and risk
Risk management process
The key elements of the risk 
management process are as follows:
Risk identification – risks faced by 
the Group are identified during the 
formulation of the Business Plan. 
Senior management and risk owners, 
with the assistance of the risk 
management committees, periodically 
review the risks to ensure that the risk 
management processes and controls in 
their area are appropriate and effective, 
and that new risks are identified.
Risk analysis – the basic causes of each 
risk are considered, and the impact and 
likelihood of it materialising is assessed. 
Risk registers are used to document 
the risks identified, level of severity and 
probability, ownership and mitigation 
measures for each risk. The risk registers 
are reviewed by the risk management 
committees on at least a quarterly basis.
Risks are then logged with reference 
to impact and probability as follows:
Probability
Low 
Medium 
High
Impact
Low 
Medium 
High
Risk appetite is identified by reference 
to the same criteria. The analysis enables 
decisions to be taken as to how that 
risk should be managed by applying 
mitigation measures to align the 
risk with the identified risk appetite.
Risk monitoring and assurance – 
the Board is ultimately responsible for 
this system of risk management and 
internal control. The Audit Committee 
reviews the suitability and effectiveness 
of risk management processes and 
controls on behalf of the Board. 
Risk management committees assist the 
executive directors in the operation and 
implementation of the risk management 
process, and provide a source of 
assurance to the Audit Committee that 
the process is operating effectively. 
Internal control
In addition, the Group has a 
comprehensive and well defined 
internal control system with clear 
structures, delegated authority levels 
and accountabilities. 
The Group has a system of planning and 
monitoring, which incorporates Board 
approval of a rolling five year Business 
Plan and approval, towards the end 
of each year, of operating and capital 
expenditure budgets for the year ahead. 
Performance against the budget is 
subsequently monitored and reported to 
the Board on a monthly basis. The Board 
also receives monthly reports on 
trading risk exposure as compared to 
the pre-set limits, and monitors overall 
Group performance against a Scorecard 
which shows progress against a set of 
financial, operating, safety and other 
targets set at the start of the year. 
Performance is reported formally to 
shareholders through the publication of 
Group results. Operational management 
makes frequent reports on performance 
to the executive directors.
The Group also has processes in 
place for business continuity and 
emergency planning.
Through the Audit Committee, the 
Board has implemented a programme 
of internal audit reviews of different 
aspects of the Group’s activities. 
The programme, which is reviewed and 
updated annually, is designed so that, 
over time, all facets of the business 
are reviewed to ensure appropriate 
systems of control are in place and are 
working effectively or, where they are 
not, deficiencies are rectified by timely 
and appropriate action. In agreeing 
the actions to be taken in response to 
each report, the aim is always to embed 
internal controls, including measures 
intended effectively to identify and 
manage risk, within each area of the 
Group’s operations. In parallel with its 
work in relation to internal audit, the 
Audit Committee also satisfies itself 
that an action plan, for dealing with 
points raised by the external auditor in 
their yearly management letter is being 
properly addressed by management.
With the assistance of the Audit 
Committee, the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control. It has reviewed the reports of the 
Audit Committee, which has considered 
all significant aspects of internal control 
including financial, operational, trading, 
compliance, social, environmental and 
ethical risks in accordance with the 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors 
on the UK Corporate Governance Code”.
Following its review, the Board 
determined that it was not aware 
of any significant deficiency or 
material weakness in the system 
of internal control.

Context
Liquidity in the power and ROC markets 
is dependent on there being a sufficient 
number of counterparties willing to 
trade actively
Risk
 
, The market structure and consolidation of 
the existing generation and supply businesses 
in the UK could result in a reduction in the 
number of active participants in the market 
with whom we are able to trade power and 
other commodities, including ROCs.
Potential impact
 
, Inability to hedge short to medium-term 
exposure to electricity prices through 
wholesale market trading.
 
, Increased exposure to short-term 
market volatility.
 
, Inability to sell all of our electricity output, 
or ROCs.
 
, Lower revenues and increased costs to achieve 
trading objectives.
 
, Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated objective and key priorities
Principal risks and uncertainties
Commodity market price risk
Counterparty risk
Power and renewables market liquidity risk
Context
The commodity markets in which 
we trade are inherently volatile, and 
generation remunerated through 
the Renewables Obligation increases 
the risk in relation to the ROC market 
Risk
 
, We are exposed to the effect of fluctuations 
in commodity prices, particularly the price 
of electricity and gas, the price of coal and 
sustainable biomass (and other fuels), the price 
of CO2 emissions allowances and the market 
price of ROCs.
Potential impact
 
, Volatility in financial results.
Associated objective and key priorities
Context
The recent recession and uncertain 
economic growth potentially impact 
on counterparty risk
Risk
 
, We rely on third party suppliers for the 
delivery of fuel and other goods and services. 
We purchase a significant quantity of our fuel 
under contracts with a number of large UK and 
international suppliers, so are exposed to the 
risk of non-performance by these suppliers.
 
, We enter into fixed price and fixed margin 
contracts for the sale of electricity to a number 
of counterparties, so are exposed to the risk of 
failure of one or more of these counterparties.
Potential impact
 
, Additional costs associated with securing 
fuel and other goods and services from 
other suppliers.
 
, Failure to secure fuel from other suppliers 
resulting in limitation of operations.
 
, Adverse effect on cash flow and earnings 
arising from the failure of one or more of the 
counterparties to whom we sell power.
Associated objective and key priorities
Examples of mitigating activities
 
, Well understood progressive hedging 
strategy with forward power and ROC sales 
combined with corresponding purchases 
of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when 
profitable and appropriate to do so.
 
, Apply for conversions under the CfD regime, 
removing some income volatility from 
key commodity exposures.
Examples of mitigating activities
 
, Diversified fuel supply in terms of source 
and counterparties.
 
, Diversified logistics routes.
 
, Target to optimise holding of fuel stocks.
 
, Close monitoring and reporting of 
concentration risk in suppliers and 
power counterparties.
 
, Full suite of power counterparties with 
strong credit ratings.
 
, Power trading contracts generally include 
provisions that force counterparties to post 
collateral where their credit rating drops, 
subject to certain restrictions.
 
, Close monitoring and reporting of potential 
credit and collateral risk.
Examples of mitigating activities
 
, Grow direct sales through Haven Power, 
our electricity supply business.
 
, Initiatives to be active and responsive make 
Drax an attractive business partner.
 
, Oppose structural changes that impact 
our market access, such as clearing 
and margining.
 
, Work with other independent generators 
(via Independent Generators Group) to 
achieve positive market and regulatory 
changes to improve liquidity.
 
, Secure longer-term structured deals when 
profitable to do so.
 
, Apply for conversions under the CfD regime, 
reducing our reliance on the liquidity of the 
ROC market.

Overview
Marketplace, performance and risk
Biomass market risk
Plant operating risk
Regulatory and political risk
Context
The biomass market is still in its relative 
infancy and investment in the supply 
chain is required
Risk
 
, We could fail to secure sustainable biomass 
supplies and/or logistics arrangements 
which meet our hurdle return rates and 
operational requirements.
 
, Most of the sustainable biomass that we can 
procure is priced in foreign currency which 
increases our exposure to fluctuations against 
sterling and poses a risk to profitability.
Potential impact
 
, Inability to progress the biomass 
growth strategy. 
 
, Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated objective and key priorities
Context
Equipment failure and the impact 
on personnel and operations
Risk
 
, Plant failure may be caused by the 
underperformance or outright failure of plant, 
transmission assets or other equipment and 
components including the IT systems used to 
operate the plant or conduct trading activities. 
The duration of the resultant forced outages is 
influenced by the lead time to manufacture and 
procure replacement components and to carry 
out repairs.
 
, As we progress our plans to convert to a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, we 
are exposed to a broader range, and increased 
level, of technical risk. Whilst successful first 
conversion of a unit to biomass has been achieved, 
further units are planned.
 
, Good progress has been made on our US 
investments however, project execution 
risk remains.
Potential impact
 
, Personnel injury.
 
, Lower revenues.
 
, Increased costs and contractual penalties.
 
, Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated objective and key priorities
Context
The government’s market reform 
agenda is driven predominantly 
by the need to move to a sustainable, 
low carbon energy sector which delivers 
affordable supplies to customers whilst 
maintaining security of supply over 
the longer term. Laws and regulations 
are many and complex, are frequently 
changing, and becoming ever more 
stringent, particularly in relation 
to environmental matters
Risk
 
, Changes to the current regulatory regime 
surrounding renewables, CPS mechanism 
and other legislation could adversely affect 
our biomass strategy.
 
, The EU, UK and local environmental and 
health and safety laws and regulations cover 
many aspects of our operations including 
limits on emissions to air and water, noise, soil/
groundwater contamination, waste, and health 
and safety standards.
Potential impact
 
, Less funding available for plant retrofit/
investment costs to meet increasingly stringent 
environmental requirements.
 
, Lower load factors/generation levels.
 
, Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated objective and key priorities
Examples of mitigating activities
 
, Contract with suppliers where a robust 
operational plant and logistics infrastructure 
is already in place; work with new suppliers to 
help develop such infrastructure.
 
, Invest in the supply chain whilst in its infancy 
to ensure security and timing of supplies.
 
, Hedge currency exposures or secure 
contracts in sterling to the extent that it 
is appropriate.
Examples of mitigating activities
 
, Comprehensive risk-based plant investment 
and maintenance programme.
 
, Maintaining a trained and 
competent workforce.
 
, Strong health and safety culture.
 
, Target to optimise holding of spare 
components for use in the event of plant 
failure, particularly long lead time items.
 
, Business continuity plan for IT systems.
 
, Ensure adequate insurance in place to cover 
losses from plant failure where possible.
 
, Significant amounts of research and 
development work have been undertaken 
in terms of handling and burning biomass.
Examples of mitigating activities
 
, Briefing, representation and engagement 
at EU and UK level.
 
, Development of abatement and alternative 
generation options.
 
, Apply for conversions under the CfD 
regime and grandfathered ROC regime to 
provide increased certainty over future 
revenue streams.
 
, Pricing of biomass contracts to allow for 
adverse commodity market movements.
 
, Regular third party assurance over 
system effectiveness.
 
, Strong safety culture and related training.

Sustainable business review
Our approach to a 
sustainable business
We have a major role to play in helping to 
protect and enhance the environment. 
This is in line with the wider goals of 
sustainable development. Our approach 
contributes to a sustainable, low carbon 
economy and offers opportunities for 
economic growth and job creation. 
We operate our business within a 
framework of increasingly stringent and 
challenging legislative and regulatory 
requirements. We are, however, mindful 
of the still tougher expectations of 
our wider stakeholder group. For us, a 
sustainable business is about achieving 
a balance between the commercial and 
regulatory rigours of the competitive 
sector and operating responsibly.
The Board establishes the policies in 
respect of sustainable development, 
such as our business conduct, 
environmental, and health and safety 
programmes. The Board’s policies are 
implemented by dedicated specialists 
who make sure effective processes 
and procedures are in place to assure 
compliance and to identify and to report 
on risks and opportunities.
As in previous years we have continued 
to invest, not only to comply with 
environmental and health and safety 
requirements, but, where practicable, 
to go further. In 2013, we retained our 
presence in the FTSE4Good Index 
Series, which is designed to measure 
the performance of companies that 
meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards and facilitate 
investment in those companies.
Materiality
Given the diversity of our stakeholders 
there are a wide range of topics 
and performance measures on 
which we could report. In determining 
which to report we consider their 
materiality in terms of their relevance 
to the Company and their importance 
to stakeholders.
Throughout this Annual report and 
accounts we aim to report on topics 
and performance measures that 
represent our significant environmental, 
social and economic impacts and those 
that would substantively influence 
the assessments and decisions of 
stakeholders. Further sustainability 
reporting is available on our website 
at: www.drax.com/sustainability/
Committed to  
sustainability
Sustainability underpins all that we do and the future of  
our business encompasses all three aspects of sustainable 
development – environmental, social and economic.

Sustainable business review
Overview
Our environment
Towards a low 
carbon economy
We have an important role to play in 
the transition of the UK towards a low 
carbon economy whilst maintaining 
secure and affordable supplies of 
electricity. For us, a sustainable business 
principally implies delivering on our 
strategic carbon abatement initiative 
to generate increasing amounts of 
electricity from sustainable biomass 
in place of coal.
During 2013, significant progress 
was made on executing our plan 
to transform the business into a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled 
generator. We converted our first 
generating unit to burn sustainable 
biomass in place of coal at the 
beginning of April. Through increasing 
the amount of sustainable biomass 
burnt in place of coal we will 
significantly reduce our carbon 
footprint from 2012 levels. 
Our electricity supply business, 
Haven Power, has been successful 
in selling the increased output of 
renewable power generated from our 
biomass conversion to our customers. 
Renewable power sales are exempt 
from the Climate Change Levy so 
even after our price premium many 
customers can make savings whilst 
enjoying the benefits of power from 
sustainable biomass.
In partnership with Alstom UK Limited 
and BOC (a member of the Linde Group) 
and in association with National Grid, we 
are involved in a Front End Engineering 
and Design (“FEED”) study to develop a 
426MW oxy-combustion carbon capture 
and storage (“CCS”) demonstration 
plant at the Drax Power Station site. 
The viability of the project is dependent 
on external funding and the introduction 
of a market mechanism to support low 
carbon technology uptake. To that 
end we are participating in UK and EU 
funded programmes. 
Environmental performance 
and compliance
Environmental compliance of our power 
station and associated landfill site is 
managed through an environmental 
management system. This system is 
externally certified to the international 
standard ISO 14001 and is subject to 
external audit twice a year.
We completed a trial with the 
Environment Agency in 2013 as part 
of the Environmental Permitting 
Compliance Assurance Scheme. 
The scheme is intended to reduce 
regulatory burden on the best 
performing sites, whilst maintaining 
an adequate level of oversight through 
combining assessment of specific legal 
compliance with certification to ISO 
14001. The effectiveness of the scheme 
is being assessed by the Environment 
Agency and we await their proposals.
There were no major breaches of our 
environmental consents during 2013.
Emissions to air
In accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 we set out our carbon reporting 
information for direct emissions 
(“Scope 1”) from activities such as 
fuel combustion and processing, and 
indirect emissions (“Scope 2”) being 
the equivalent emissions created 
by the generation of the electricity, 
heat or steam we purchase. Scope 1 
for Drax covers the emissions arising 
from burning fossil fuels, namely 
coal, to generate electricity and the 
operation of some of our plant at the 
power station, for example, our flue-gas 
desulphurisation system. The Group’s 
Scope 2 emissions arise mainly from 
electricity purchased to run operations 
across our various sites.
We are also required to disclose 
emissions of biologically sequestered 
carbon, which includes emissions 
released through burning biomass 
to generate electricity. 
Through implementing our strategy 
to become a predominantly biomass-
fuelled generator we aim to reduce 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. As a 
result there will be a rise in biologically 
sequestered carbon emissions. 
We collate data on our carbon dioxide 
emissions from fuel combustion as 
part of our measurement and reporting 
plan under the EU ETS. This includes 
all Scope 1 and the biologically 
sequestered carbon figures. For Scope 
2 reporting we use the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
and the Government’s published GHG 
conversion factors to determine the level 
of carbon emissions.
Drax Group plc 
Annual report and accounts 2013

Sustainable business review
The majority of our emissions arise 
through the combustion of fossil 
fuel for generating electricity. As this 
single figure can shadow smaller, but 
still important trends, we have set a 
materiality threshold of 100 thousand 
tonnes, equivalent to approximately 
0.5% of the reporting year’s emissions, 
to ensure we strike the right balance 
between demonstrating important 
trends and limiting data to a 
meaningful level.
Carbon dioxide emissions, calculated 
under the EU ETS, as a ratio of electricity 
generated, before deductions for that 
used on-site, is a principal performance 
indicator for the Group. This metric 
has also been selected for mandatory 
carbon reporting.

Beyond carbon dioxide we manage 
all our emissions effectively and have 
maintained high levels of investment 
in flue gas desulphurisation and 
combustion control systems to ensure 
compliance with environmental limits. 
All emissions in 2013 were within the 
limits set by the Environment Agency.
Looking ahead, work continues to 
develop a solution to comply with the 
emission limits which will be in place 
beyond 2016 under the Industrial

Disposals to land
We have continued to invest in site 
infrastructure to maximise the sale 
of ash products into the construction 
industry and to reduce the disposal 
of surplus ash to landfill. In 2013, ash 
was sold in conformity with European 
construction product standards and in 
compliance with the Waste Recycling 
Action Programme quality protocol.
This has helped us to sell over 80% 
of the 1.3 million tonnes of ash 
produced in 2013 as replacement for 
virgin aggregates and as a cement 
replacement product.
In 2013, construction was completed on 
the lightweight aggregate production 
facility on-site, which is owned and 
operated by Lytag Ltd, a company based 
in Escrick, North Yorkshire. The facility 
manufactures lightweight aggregate 
from pulverised fuel ash.
Any unsold ash is sent to the power 
station’s ash disposal site, Barlow 
Mound. The completed area of the site 
has been fully restored for use as farm 
land and woodland.
We pay landfill tax on the ash disposed 
of to the site. Through the Landfill 
Communities Fund, we are able to 
claim a tax credit for our donations 
to recognised Environmental Bodies. 
We have worked with Groundwork 
North Yorkshire since 2001 on projects 
designed to help mitigate the effects 
of landfill upon our local community. 
During 2013, we contributed £73,000 
towards local community-based projects 
designed to bring about sustainable 
environmental benefits and contribute 
to the social and economic regeneration 
of the area.
We continue to manage waste from 
our operations in a responsible manner. 
In 2013, we met our target to divert 90% 
of non-ash waste from landfill.

Note:
(1)  Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations.
The increase in the injury statistics 
above arose from weaker performance 
at two of our US construction sites. 
Working with our contractors we 
have significantly enhanced safety 
management and supervision at 
these sites.
Attaining leading performance
The lost time injury rate and total 
recordable injury rate for 2013 at 0.09 
and 0.29 respectively remain industry-
leading. This performance was achieved 
in the context of significant construction 
work that took place during the year. 
Over one-third of the 6.9 million hours 
worked across the Group was in higher 
risk construction activities. Our safety 
record continues to compare very 
favourably with that of our sector 
peers and international benchmarks. 
Amongst global comparator coal-fired 
power stations we are ahead of the 
European and World Pacesetter group 
for total recordable injury rate.
We have retained certification of our 
Health and Safety Management System 
to the internationally recognised 
Occupational Health and Safety 
standard, OHSAS 18001, at the Drax 
Power Station site and for our biomass 
pellet plant, based at Goole in the 
East Riding of Yorkshire. The standard 
is approved by Lloyd’s Register 
Quality Assurance.
In addition to this, we were once again 
awarded the The Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents Gold Medal 
Award having achieved Gold Award 
standards for nine consecutive years.
Safety leadership and recognition
We are constantly striving to 
improve the critical safety leadership 
contribution required from first line 
supervisors. The expectations of both 
management and supervisors continue 
to be reaffirmed in the Safety Leadership 
Charter, which is based on the Health 
and Safety Executive’s approach to 
achieving a balance between the 
systems and behavioural aspects of 
management, treating health and safety 
management as an integral part of good 
management generally, rather than as a 
stand-alone system.
A Health and Safety Advisory Committee 
(“HESAC”), which brings together a range 
of employees, including trade union 
representatives, safety representatives, 
occupational health and management 
team members, continues to play a vital 
role in facilitating staff consultation on 
health and safety issues, and driving 
standards upwards.
Our active involvement with the 
programmes of our trade body, Energy 
UK, and the Coal Generators Forum, 
GENSIP, continues to provide new ideas 
and a stimulus to drive our health and 
safety improvement efforts forward.
Health and wellbeing
We are committed to promoting the 
health and wellbeing of all our staff 
and ensuring a professional response 
to first aid and emergency situations 
should any occur. We have published 
occupational health policies which 
address industrial disease risks, 
and our occupational health team 
undertakes regular programmes to 
screen colleagues in accordance with 
risk, exposure and Health and Safety 
Executive requirements. 
Health and wellbeing-based 
programmes and initiatives are 
run throughout the Group to raise 
awareness and promote a healthy 
lifestyle. All of the UK workforce 
is represented in formal joint 
management-worker health and 
safety committees that help monitor 
and advise on occupational health 
and safety programmes. 
“We are committed to 
developing and maintaining 
a positive health and 
safety culture.”

Employees
Employment
The Group employed 1,280 people 
at the year end, an increase of 
10%. The pie charts provide a 
breakdown of headcount across 
the Group’s businesses. Most of our 
employees work full-time and are 
on permanent contracts.
At Drax Power Limited the annual staff 
turnover rate for 2013 was only 5%, 
most of which was due to retirements. 
Haven Power’s annual staff turnover 
rate was indicative of the business and 
demographic profile of the workforce, 
although following a number of 
initiatives to improve staff retention 
it fell from 36% in 2012 to 24% in 2013. 
Five employees left our US operations in 
2013, resulting in an annualised turnover 
rate of 21%.
Gender split both across the Group 
and the senior management team is 
illustrated in the pie charts. Our biggest 
challenge continues to be attracting 
female applicants, whether apprentices, 
graduates or more senior roles, to 
production and engineering positions. 
The Board’s policy on diversity is given 
in the Nominations Committee report 
on page 77.
Employee engagement
Some 51% of the Group’s workforce is 
covered by collective bargaining, and 
for the remainder who are employed 
on individual employment contracts 
we have representative employee 
consultation and information 
arrangements in place. An annual 
employee engagement survey is 
conducted at Haven Power, and at 
Drax Power an employee survey and a 
stress survey, as designed by the Health 
and Safety Executive, is conducted in 
alternate years. The surveys allow for 
analysis, feedback and action plans. 
We use a variety of communication 
channels to ensure that all colleagues 
are kept fully informed of developments 
in the Group’s operations and provided 
with the opportunity to give feedback.
Employee policies and relations
We have a suite of policies designed to 
support our people at work, including 
those to assist, where appropriate, a 
variety of work/lifestyle preferences, 
procedures for raising grievance or 
safety concerns, and diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace. We make 
every effort to provide long-term 
employment security and we maintain 
high standards in employment practices. 
Learning and development
Our personal and career development 
processes across the Group are designed 
to equip all our people with the technical 
skills, management and leadership 
competencies, and personal behaviours 
needed to achieve our Business 
Plan. All employees receive annual 
performance and development reviews. 
Each year, Drax Power Limited 
recruits for the four-year apprentice 
training programme covering power 
station operations and engineering 
maintenance. In 2013, we took on eight 
apprentices across the three disciplines 
of mechanical, electrical, and control 
and instrumentation.
This year, 12 participants in our supervisor 
development programme were each 
awarded a Certificate in Professional 
Development from Coventry University. 
We also commenced a structured 
two-year UK graduate development 
programme for 15 recent graduates who 
have joined various departments across 
the Group.
During the year, Drax and the 
trade union, Unite, signed a learning 
agreement committing to working 
in partnership to promote and 
support lifelong learning and 
ensuring equal access to learning 
opportunities. The agreement’s 
aims include establishing a learning 
culture within the workplace, and 
supporting employees to gain skills 
and qualifications to support their  
future employability and the 
business’ needs.

Limited recruits for the

We have a structured process of 
succession planning for senior roles 
with a specific career management 
discussion integrated within the existing 
appraisal process. The process identifies 
succession potential and gaps, which 
in turn inform individual development/
recruitment planning.
Reward and recognition
We benchmark our reward packages at 
every level in the organisation against 
the industry sector and the market as a 
whole, nationally or locally, as appropriate 
to the role. We also participate in 
specialist industry meetings to exchange 
information and developments in 
employment policy.
Through a range of share plans we 
encourage all UK employees to build 
a personal stake in the ownership of 
the business.

Overview
Our stakeholders
Engaging with 
our stakeholders
Like most businesses, our stakeholders 
are many and diverse, including our 
shareholders, employees, customers, 
energy consultants, suppliers, the 
local community, government, non-
governmental organisations, regulators, 
opinion formers and the media. 
Communication with all our stakeholders 
is considered to be an essential part 
of our business and we aim to be open 
and transparent in all that we do.
Business conduct
We are committed to high ethical 
standards and to conducting our 
business with honesty, integrity and 
in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations. Honesty and integrity 
not only underpin how we do business, 
but how we expect our customers, 
suppliers, agents, partners, contractors 
and consultants to do business, whether 
in the UK, US or beyond. 
In order to prevent bribery and 
corruption we take responsibility 
for maintaining a culture within 
the Group in which bribery is never 
acceptable. In protecting fundamental 
human rights, Drax does not tolerate the 
use of underage workers or any concept 
of forced labour, at the same time 
ensuring our suppliers’ activities have 
a minimal impact on the environment 
and local communities. Any supplier 
found to be complicit in a breach of such 
standards, either directly or indirectly, 
will be barred from further participation 
in our supply chain activities.
The Group’s Code of Business Ethics 
establishes the rules and framework 
under which employees should base 
their decision making. Employees are 
expected to follow not only the letter 
of the Code, but the spirit.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy 
provides a confidential means for 
our employees to speak up with 
confidence. The policy provides 
guidance on how to make a disclosure 
of information, in good faith, relating 
to safety, fraud or other illegal or 
unethical conduct that they may have 
witnessed or are concerned about.

Sustainable business review
Supply chain
Non-fuel procurement
We take a balanced approach to our 
supply chain and we look to use suppliers 
and working partners from diverse 
backgrounds, in particular, small and 
medium-sized suppliers in the local 
community where possible.
Sustainability is an essential element of 
good procurement practice and takes 
account of wider social, economic and 
environmental factors in addition to the 
conventional criteria of price, quality 
and service. By applying these wider 
principles our procurement practices 
go beyond meeting simple tender 
requirements to delivering improved 
value and real cost savings throughout 
the supply chain. 
Coal procurement
We buy coal from a range of sources 
with the objectives of managing our 
commercial exposures, environmental 
obligations and diversity of supply. 
We purchase around 40% of our coal 
from UK deep and surface mines with 
the remainder coming from major supply 
basins around the world, including the 
US, Colombia and Russia.
When buying from overseas we have 
continued to require, through our 
contracts, minimum standards with 
suppliers in respect of compliance with 
legislation, human rights, labour relations, 
health and safety arrangements and 
business ethics. In order to support our 
focus on responsible procurement, we 
have joined the Bettercoal initiative, a 
not-for-profit organisation that promotes 
continuous improvement in corporate 
responsibility in the coal supply chain.
Biomass sustainability  
and procurement
It is a prerequisite that all our biomass 
must be purchased from sustainable 
sources. To ensure this we have 
implemented a sustainability policy 
which embeds comprehensive criteria 
into our procurement activities. 
Our Biomass Sustainability Management 
System ensures commitment to 
our policy.
We are leading the introduction of 
credible sustainability standards 
into biomass procurement activities. 
Our procurement process is designed to 
ensure that the production and delivery 
of biomass will:
 
,significantly reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions compared to coal-
fired generation;
 
,not result in a net release of carbon 
from the vegetation and soil of either 
forests or agricultural lands;
 
,not endanger food supply or 
communities where the use of 
biomass is essential for subsistence 
(for example heat, medicines, 
building materials);
 
,not adversely affect protected 
or vulnerable biodiversity and, 
where possible, give preference 
to biomass production that 
strengthens biodiversity;
 
,deploy good practices to protect and/
or improve soil, water (both ground 
and surface) and air quality;
 
,contribute to local prosperity in the 
area of supply chain management and 
biomass production; and
 
,contribute to the social wellbeing of 
employees and the local population in 
the area of the biomass production.
We work collaboratively with our 
suppliers to ensure compliance with 
the UK government’s sustainability 
criteria. Confidence in the sustainability 
of the biomass is achieved through a 
programme of information exchange, 
documentary evidence, due diligence 
activities and independent third 
party verification.
Customer relations
Customers and their consultants are 
at the heart of our retail business. All of 
our customers have named account 
managers who are responsible for 
the service that we deliver. We have a 
growing reputation for providing good 
service and this supports a good level 
of renewal at the end of customers’ 
supply contracts.
During 2013, Ofgem introduced new 
requirements under its retail market 
review, including a requirement to treat 
customers fairly. Despite being already 
compliant with many of the changes 
we took the opportunity to improve 
our customer service and, in particular, 
our assurance of fair treatment.
There is currently unprecedented 
change that touches virtually all 
elements of the retail market value 
chain and during the year we ran 
a number of events for customers, 
prospective customers and their 
consultants to inform them about 
selected developments. 
For our larger customers, we introduced 
an online portal providing 24/7 
access to bills and statements as well 
as consumption data and flexible 
purchasing information. 
Investor relations
We are committed to delivering 
shareholder value. We communicate 
our results and prospects to our 
shareholders in an accurate and timely 
manner using a variety of channels. 
In addition to the Annual General 
Meeting, we communicate through 
our Annual report and accounts, Half 
year report and Interim Management 
Statements. All of these documents 
are made available on our website at 
www.drax.com. Significant matters 
relating to trading and the development 
of the business are disseminated to the 
market by way of announcements via a 
regulatory information service and those 
announcements appear as soon as 
practicable on our website.
Announcements are frequently followed 
up with either conference calls or 
presentations to provide further detail 
and greater understanding. In addition, 
face-to-face meetings are held with 
our major institutional shareholders, 
and other potential investors in the 
Group, again to assist them in their 
understanding of the announcements, 
and also to ensure that the Board is 
aware of their views and concerns. 
To aid our communication with private 
investors, the investor section of our 
website has been developed to be a 
readily accessible and transparent 
source of information to enhance 
understanding of the business.

Sustainable business review
Overview
Public affairs
As in previous years, we maintained 
our engagement with public affairs 
audiences on issues with implications 
for our business. With energy policy 
still high on the political agenda we 
had significant engagement with 
Parliamentarians and officials at all 
levels on issues including forthcoming 
environmental legislation, renewables 
policy and market reform issues.
The form of engagement was varied 
and included both face-to-face and 
written briefings, participation in public 
consultations, written evidence to 
inquiries, and visits by Parliamentarians 
and officials to Drax Power Station. As in 
the past, trade association membership 
proved useful during the year. The ability 
to meet with and discuss issues of the 
day with other interested parties has 
facilitated presentation of collective 
positions on energy policy matters.
No political donations were made 
in the UK or elsewhere during 2013 
(2012: nil), and the Group’s contact with 
those active in the political arena has 
been and will continue to be aimed 
solely at the promotion of the Group’s 
business interests.
The definitions of EU political 
expenditure are broad and there 
is uncertainty about the extent to 
which normal business activities, 
which might not be thought to be 
political expenditure in the usual sense, 
could be considered to be political 
expenditure within the meaning of 
the legislation. The Company wishes 
to avoid any inadvertent infringement 
of the legislation and each year, 
through a resolution at the Annual 
General Meeting, seeks the authority 
of shareholders to incur expenditure 
for the Company and its subsidiaries for 
such purposes of £100,000.
Community relations
We are committed to being a good 
neighbour to our local community 
and our “caring for the community” 
philosophy involves being part of 
local and regional communities. 
Our involvement takes the form of 
sponsoring a variety of local charities 
and fundraising events, promoting our 
own campaigns which focus on the 
three themes of youth sport, education 
and the environment, and maintaining 
open communication channels and 
good working relationships with the 
region’s key opinion formers.
Sponsorship and fundraising
During 2013, the Group gave financial 
support of £200,000 (2012: £182,000) 
in total across a range of charitable and 
non-charitable community causes. 
Of that total, charitable donations 
amounted to £142,000 (2012: £127,000).
Education in the community
We provide a choice of educational 
experiences hosted by our team of 
power station guides and, at times, 
technical experts. A state-of-the-art 
visitor centre is of particular interest 
to students of all ages allowing them 
to explore the properties of electricity, 
discover how a power station works 
and consider the environmental issues 
related to electricity generation.
Another visitor opportunity exists at 
our nature reserve that lies at the heart 
of our ash disposal site. Established as 
a sanctuary for over 100 species of 
wildlife, it is specially designed to help 
schoolchildren understand more about 
the natural habitat and ecology of 
the area.
Campaigns such as “Cricket in the 
Community”, “Art in the Community” 
and the “Community Pride Awards” are 
now established in the annual calendar 
of community events and continue to 
prove popular.
Visitors to Drax
During 2013, we played host to 
some 10,000 visitors. The appeal of 
discovering more about how power 
is produced and the sheer scale of 
the site and its associated activities 
attracts schools and colleges as well 
as business organisations, and local 
and professional associations. 
“During 2013, we played host 
to some 10,000 visitors.”

Corporate governance
Chairman’s letter
I am pleased to present the Group’s Corporate governance 
report for 2013 on behalf of our Board. This report is intended  
to provide you with a clear and meaningful explanation of  
what governance means to us and how it guides our decision 
making. Good governance at all levels is a cornerstone of 
management within the Group and it is the Board that sets 
the tone and takes the lead. 
As Chairman, it is my role to ensure that Drax is led by an 
effective Board. The Board believes that good practice 
should flow throughout the Group, which in turn should 
guide the decisions taken on a daily basis. If we achieve this, 
then we can be sure that we are taking the right actions 
for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
During 2013, we continued to strengthen our internal control 
and risk management processes to ensure that they remain 
effective and are embedded in operations as the Group’s 
business evolves in scope and dimension.
An important part of my role is to ensure that the Board 
contains the right balance of skills, expertise and experience. 
We have an established policy which ensures that diversity 
(including gender diversity) is one of the factors taken into 
account when considering appointments to the Board and 
other senior roles.
The Board has reviewed the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and we comply with it except currently in 
relation to provisions on tendering the audit process. A more 
detailed report on our corporate governance arrangements 
is set out on the following pages.
Charles Berry 
Chairman
A commitment to  
good governance
Drax is committed to good corporate governance, 
which is a cornerstone to a successful and  
sustainable company.
Charles Berry  
Chairman
Our governance framework 
 
How the Board functions 
The Board receives regular reports on performance against 
the Business Plan and periodic business reports from senior 
management. Directors are briefed on matters to be 
discussed at meetings by papers distributed in advance 
of Board and committee meetings. 
The Board has adopted a policy whereby directors may, in the 
furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. During 2013, no director 
sought independent professional advice pursuant to 
the policy. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board 
on all governance matters, ensuring good information flows 
within the Board, its committees and senior management, and 
ensuring that Board processes are complied with. He is also 
responsible for compliance with the Listing, Prospectus, 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Companies Act. 
In his role as Director of Corporate Affairs, he is also 
responsible for advising the Board on legal matters and 
has responsibility for the Company Secretarial, External 
Communications, Group Legal and Human Resources 
functions, and for the management of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management framework and processes. 
The Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) give the 
directors power to authorise conflicts of interest. The Board 
has adopted a procedure, that has operated effectively, by 
which situations giving rise to potential conflicts of interest 
are identified to the Board, considered for authorisation 
and recorded. 
The Articles also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in 
group companies without restriction (e.g. so as to appoint a 
director to the board of a group company without this 
counting as a conflict requiring authorisation). 
Each director has the benefit of a deed of indemnity from the 
Company and its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
liabilities incurred, in either case arising out of the bona fide 
discharge by the director of his or her duties. The Company 
has also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of 
legal action against directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Selection, appointment, review and re-election 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles (which provide 
that one-third of directors shall retire by rotation each year 
and are eligible for re-election by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”), and in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Company will continue to 
propose all directors for annual re-election. Accordingly, each 
of the current directors will retire at the forthcoming AGM 
and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.  
The evaluation of the Board described below concluded that 
the directors offering themselves for re-election continue 
to demonstrate commitment, management and industry 
expertise in their particular role and perform effectively. 
The re-election of each director is recommended by the 
Board. Details of the service contracts for the executive 
directors and letters of appointment for the non-executive 
directors are set out in a table on page 94.

Corporate governance 
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will 
be appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the 
Board being satisfied as to the director’s performance and 
commitment, and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate 
AGM, may be renewed by mutual agreement. However, it is 
the Board’s policy not to extend the aggregate period of 
service of any independent non-executive director beyond 
nine years, and any proposal made to extend a non-executive 
director’s aggregate period of office beyond six years is the 
subject of a rigorous review. Such reviews in cases where a 
director remains in office after six years, will be conducted 
annually, as part of the evaluation of the Board. 
The Board is satisfied that all the directors are able to devote 
sufficient time to their duties as directors. 
Performance reviews and directors’ development 
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the 
Group. The Board conducted a review of its effectiveness 
and that of its committees with the assistance of external 
facilitation during the period 2007 to 2011. In 2012, the 
performance review was undertaken internally, led by the 
Chairman and facilitated by the Company Secretary. In 2013, 
we have reverted to using an external facilitator in Armstrong 
Bonham Carter. The review concluded that each of, the Board, 
its individual directors and its committees continued to be 
effective. No significant areas of concern were identified. 
The review did, however, give rise to some suggestions 
to improve the overall effectiveness of the Board. In the light 
of these comments, the Board will continue to develop 
its processes in the areas of strategy development, people 
leadership and the monitoring of risk. 
 
During the year, the Chairman held a meeting with the 
non-executive directors in the absence of the executive 
directors, and the Senior Independent Director held a 
meeting with the non-executive directors without the 
Chairman being present, as required by provision A.4.2 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board is committed to the development of all employees 
and directors and has reviewed and will periodically continue 
to review each director’s development requirements and 
make appropriate arrangements to address them. All new 
directors receive an induction, including being provided with 
information about the Group and their responsibilities, 
meetings with key managers and visits to the Group’s sites.  
In addition, each non-executive director visits operational sites 
both in the UK and the US. Periodically, they also meet with 
senior management to be briefed on the Group’s business and 
specific Board training days are arranged, where appropriate, 
involving presentations on relevant topics.

Details of the work of the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees are given in the respective reports 
of those committees. The terms of reference for the 
committees are reviewed annually by each committee and 
then by the Board and are available on the Group’s website 
at www.drax.com 
In April 2013 a Group Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”) 
was established to coordinate the activities of the six 
established operational risk committees. As the Group’s 
business has become more complex, the GRMC now provides 
greater oversight of the risk management process in the 
Group, group risk optimisation and cross group risk issues. 
Two meetings of the GRMC have been held this year. 
The purpose of the GRMC is to: 
�
�
Risk Register. 
�
cross-Group risks. 
�
disagree on materiality or probability of a shared or 
common risk. 
�
units and identify areas where best practice in one area can 
be transferred to another. 
�
 
�
of internal controls. 
�
and policies. 
Directors’ interests, indemnity arrangements 
and other significant agreements 
Other than a deed of indemnity between each director, the 
Company and each of its subsidiaries in respect of claims 
made and personal liability incurred as a result of the bona fide 
discharge of the directors’ responsibilities, a service contract 
between the executive directors and a Group company, or 
as noted in the Remuneration Committee report, no director 
had a material interest at any time during the year in any 
contract of significance with the Company or any of its 
subsidiary undertakings. 
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
The Board has reviewed the independence of each 
non-executive director. None of the non-executive directors 
who has served during the year had any material business or 
other relationship with the Group, and there were no other 
matters that were likely to affect their independence of 
character and judgement. The Board therefore considers 
all of the non-executive directors to be independent. 
Board and Board Committee attendance 
The table below shows the number of meetings and attendance at them by directors of the Board, Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees during 2013. The number in brackets represents the maximum number of meetings that each 
individual was entitled to and had the opportunity to attend.

Governance
Overview
Corporate governance 
Time commitment 
Under the terms of his letter of appointment, the Chairman is 
expected to commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to 
fulfil his role. 
Under the non-executives’ letters of appointment, the time 
commitment each is expected to give in respect of 
membership of the Board, is 12 to 15 full days a year. That 
includes attendance at Board meetings, the AGM, one annual 
Board strategy day and at least one site visit per year. In 
addition, they are expected to devote appropriate preparation 
time ahead of each meeting. The time commitment expected 
in respect of their membership of committees of the Board, 
notably the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees, is an additional three to four full days a year 
in each case. 
Corporate governance 
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, details of which are given in this Corporate 
governance report and the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committee reports set out on pages 73 to 98. 
The various sections of this report contain in summary certain 
provisions of the Company’s current Articles of Association 
(the “Articles”) and applicable English law concerning 
companies (the Companies Act 2006). This is a summary only 
and the relevant provisions of the Articles or the Companies 
Act should be consulted if further information is required. 
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing 
on 1 January 2013, there has been full compliance with the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
issued in September 2012 and applicable for this financial 
year, and this compliance is illustrated in the details set out in 
this report. However, the Board has, on the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee, taken the decision not to comply for 
the time being with provision C.3.7. of the Code, to put the 
external audit contract out to tender at least every ten years. 
A detailed explanation is included within the Audit Committee 
report on page 75. 
Internal control 
Details of the Group’s system of internal control and risk 
management are contained in the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section together with the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open 
relationship with the Group’s major shareholders and 
communicates directly with them, offering the opportunity 
to meet in order that he can understand their views on the 
Group, be it corporate governance issues or any other points 
they might wish to raise. 
The Board also reviews and discusses the investor feedback 
from post-results investor meetings conducted by the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director in the UK, Europe and the 
US. These took place following both the preliminary and half 
year results announcements in 2013. Makinson Cowell 
Limited, an independent capital markets consultancy firm and 
part of the KPMG Group, is engaged by the Group to advise 
and assist in relation to communications with shareholders. 
The Company’s private registered shareholders hold, in 
aggregate, approximately 0.6% of the issued share capital. 
The Board is as interested in their concerns as it is in the 
concerns of institutional and corporate shareholders. All 
shareholders are free to put questions to the Board at the 
AGM. Questions asked in person at the AGM will receive an 
oral response whenever possible. Otherwise a written 
response will be provided as soon as practicable after the 
AGM. Questions asked at other times will normally receive a 
written response. Shareholders attending the AGM will have 
an opportunity to meet informally with the directors 
immediately after the meeting. 
All information reported to the market via a regulatory 
information service also appears as soon as practicable on 
the Group’s website. 
The directors consider that this Annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Pages 1 to 57 provide an assessment of the Group’s affairs. 
The Annual report and accounts is available to shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the AGM. Registered 
shareholders receive a Form of Proxy which provides for 
a shareholder to vote in favour or against, or to indicate 
abstention as an alternative on each separate resolution. 
Particulars of aggregate proxies lodged are announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and placed on the Group’s website 
as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the AGM.

Issue of shares 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Companies Act”) relating to authority and pre-emption rights 
and to any resolution of the Company in a General Meeting, all 
unissued shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the 
directors and they may allot (with or without conferring a right 
of renunciation), grant options over or otherwise dispose of 
them to such persons, at such times and on such terms as 
they think proper. 
During the period, 978,768 ordinary shares in the Company 
were issued as follows: 
� 600,248 shares under the rules of the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) to 305 
participants who held options under the 3-year 2010 Grant 
which matured on 1 May 2012 and four individuals who had 
retired from the Group; and 
� 378,520 shares under the rules of the Group’s Bonus

Authority to purchase own shares 
At the AGM held on 24 April 2013, shareholders resolved 
to authorise the Company to make market purchases of up to 
10% of the issued ordinary share capital. At the forthcoming 
AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew this authority. 
Details are contained in the notice of the AGM. 
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares 
during 2013.  
Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares are 
set out in the Articles. The Articles may only be changed by 
the shareholders by special resolution. 
Variation of rights 
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to 
any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of 
the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value 
of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an 
extraordinary resolution passed at a separate General Meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At every such separate General 
Meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or 
representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of 
the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares 
held as Treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the 
holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly 
provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed 
to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking 
pari passu with them. 
Transfer of shares 
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be 
effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form 
or in any other form acceptable to the directors and may be 
under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by 
or on behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully 
paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor 
shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the 
name of the transferee is entered in the register. All transfers 
of shares which are in uncertificated form may be effected by 
means of the CREST system. 
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of 
transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it:  
a) is in respect of only one class of share; and  
b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) 
accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such 
other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to 
show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if 
the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person 
on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do). 
The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, 
in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason 
therefore, refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being 
fully paid shares) provided that, where any such shares are 
admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to 
prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place 
on an open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to 
register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid 
or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. 
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they 
shall send within two months after the date on which the 
letter of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company, 
to the allottee or transferee, notice of the refusal. 
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the 
Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, 
for a transfer of shares to take place. 
The Articles provide that the directors must give reasons 
for any refusal to register a transfer of shares in accordance 
with the Companies Act.

Overview

Shares in uncertificated form 
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be held 
in uncertificated form and title to such shares may be 
transferred by means of a relevant system or that shares of 
any class should cease to be held and transferred. Subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act, the CREST Regulations 
and every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or 
order for the time being in force concerning companies and 
affecting the Company. The provisions of the Articles shall 
not apply to shares of any class which are in uncertificated 
form to the extent that the Articles are inconsistent with the 
holding of shares of that class in uncertificated form, the 
transfer of title to shares of that class by means of a relevant 
system or any provision of the CREST Regulations. 
Voting 
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or 
restrictions as to voting attached by, or in accordance with, 
the Articles to any class of shares, on a show of hands every 
member who is present in person at a General Meeting shall 
have one vote and, on a poll, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which 
he/she is the holder. It has been the Company’s practice since 
incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual 
General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings. 
Shares are held by the trustee on behalf of employees in 
respect of the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights 
attached to such shares are not directly exercisable by the 
employees. The employee may direct the trustee on how to 
vote at the AGM and the trustee may only cast its vote in 
respect of shares/voting rights over which it has received 
a valid direction from employees. 
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint 
a proxy, who need not be a member of the Company, to 
exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and 
vote on their behalf at a General Meeting or class meeting. 
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a 
General Meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy 
is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that member. A member that is a 
corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on 
its behalf at a General Meeting or class meetings as a 
corporate representative. 
Deadlines for exercising voting rights 
Votes are exercisable at a General Meeting of the Company 
in respect of which the business being voted upon is being 
heard. Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in 
relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. 
The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms 
of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting. 
Restrictions on voting 
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, 
be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her to vote 
either personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to 
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation 
to shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently 
payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share 
remains unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to 
vote if he/she has been served with a notice after failing to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests 
in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act. 
Interests in voting rights

Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditor 
So far as each person who is a director at the date of 
approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information, being information needed by the auditor in 
connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is 
unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow directors, each 
director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a director to ascertain any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This 
information is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.  
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act, 
a resolution is to be proposed at the AGM for the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group. 
A resolution will also be proposed authorising the directors to 
determine the auditor’s remuneration. The Audit Committee 
reviews the appointment of the auditor, the auditor’s 
effectiveness and relationship with the Group, including the 
level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Further 
details on the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee 
are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 73 to 76. 
Directors’ report 
The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the 
group, together with the financial statement and auditor’s 
report for the year ended 31 December 2013. The Corporate 
governance section set out on pages 64 to 71 forms part of 
this report. 
No significant events since the balance sheet date have 
arisen. An indication of likely future developments in the 
business of the Company and details of research and 
development activities are included in the Strategic report on 
pages 1 to 57. 
Information about the use of financial instruments by the 
Company and its subsidiaries is given in note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Governance
Overview
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.  
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
directors are required to: 
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
� make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
� state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and 
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
In preparing the group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: 
� properly select and apply accounting policies; 
� present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;  
� provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity's financial 
position and financial performance; and 
� make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue 
as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Responsibility statement  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
� the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
� the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and 
� the Annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Main activities during the year 
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in 
accordance with an agreed annual work plan. The routine 
items which are put to each meeting are as follows:  
�the Committee’s rolling annual plan review, reports from the 
internal audit function on the progress of their programme 
for the year including fee analysis and new internal audit 
reports. The Committee continues to focus on specifically

�at these meetings, the Committee received reports from 
management and the external auditor on the application 
of accounting policies on significant estimates and 
judgements made in preparing the financial statements, 
and on the methods used to account for any significant or 
unusual transactions. Our principal accounting policies are 
set out in the notes to the accounts. In respect of all such 
matters, the external auditor concurred with the judgements 
made by management and the Committee was satisfied 
that the accounting policies were applied appropriately 
and the estimates and judgements made were appropriate.

Audit Committee report 
Reviewing the 2013 Annual report and accounts 
At the meeting in February 2014, the Committee reviewed 
the content of the 2013 Annual report and accounts, 
alongside a paper on accounting issues and judgements 
impacting the accounts. The significant issues and 
judgements considered were as follows:�
�ROCs and LECs – The value of ROCs and LECs is recognised 
as they are earned through generating electricity from 
burning biomass. Accordingly, the value is deducted from 
the cost of the biomass burnt and held on the balance 
sheet until sold. The valuation is necessarily based on 
assumptions regarding future sales prices of 
these instruments in the market. The Committee was 
satisfied that the assumptions made by management 
were appropriate and that the Company’s accounting 
policy for ROCs and LECs has been applied in a manner 
consistent with the previous year (see note 13 to the 
consolidated financial statements). 
�Derivatives – As explained in more detail in note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements, the Group enters into 
commodity contracts to manage its exposure to 
commodity price movements and forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to 
transactions denominated in currencies other than sterling. 
The Committee gained assurance regarding the valuation 
of and movements in the Group’s derivative contracts 
through management reports on derivative valuations 
supported by market data, detailed reports of the year 
end positions, and discussion with management 
regarding the approach taken to fair value measurement 
and the application of hedge accounting. The Committee 
also noted that an independent review of internal controls 
over certain aspects of trading and treasury activities 
during the year had raised no significant issues. 
�Property, plant and equipment – The net book value of the 
Group’s property, plant and equipment was £1.6 billion at 
31 December 2013 (see note 11 to the consolidated financial 
statements). The useful economic lives of assets making 
up a large proportion of this balance are based on the 
assumed economic life of the Drax Power Station as a 
whole. This assumption therefore has a material impact on 
the depreciation charge in the income statement and the 
carrying value of the assets concerned. The Committee 
received a report on the outcome of a full review by 
management of the useful economic life of Drax Power 
Station and was satisfied that the 35 year life set in 2004 
remained appropriate.  
Explanation of the critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions is set out in detail in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
In addition, other matters relating to the application of 
accounting policies or accounting treatment have been 
considered during the year at the February, July and 
November 2013 meetings, and again at the February 2014 
meeting in relation to our financial reports: 
�
assumptions in relation to obligations under the Community 
Energy Savings Programme, retirement benefit obligations 
(pension), taxation and impairment. Further detail on 
these areas can be found in note 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
�
application of accounting policies or accounting treatment 
(carbon, coal and biomass stock) and new items in the 
financial statements (oil and freight trading and port 
contracting) were reviewed. Where applicable our 
accounting policies are set out in the relevant note to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
The Committee met twice in the absence of management 
with each of the external (February and July) and internal 
auditor (April and November). No matters of concern were 
drawn to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. 
The Committee’s understanding with both the external and 
internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become 
aware of any matters occasioning them material concern, 
they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention 
via the Chairman of the Committee. Nothing was subject 
to this procedure in the course of the year.  
In addition to the routine items outlined above, there were 
a number of specific items which are put to the meetings 
as follows:

At the meeting in February 2014, in line with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit Committees, the 
Committee undertook a review of its own effectiveness and 
concluded that the composition of its membership, the 
manner in which it operates and the reviews that it 
undertakes throughout the year all contribute to the 
continued effective functioning of the Committee.  
these included the accounting judgements, estimates and 
in addition, other accounting issues, namely in relation to 
Drax Group plc

External auditor effectiveness 
At the February 2014 meeting, the Committee reviewed 
the effectiveness of the external auditor, Deloitte LLP. 
This process incorporated feedback from management and 
key individuals across the Group, as well as its own experience. 
The assessment considered the robustness of the audit 
process, the quality of delivery of the audit plan, the quality 
of reporting on findings and recommendations to the 
Committee and management, and the quality of the audit 
team and service provided. 
Having reviewed Deloitte’s performance during the year and 
satisfied itself of their continuing independence and 
objectivity within the context of applicable regulatory 
requirements and professional standards (see below), the 
Committee has invited the Board to recommend the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) and a resolution to that 
effect appears in the notice of the AGM. 
Independence of the external audit 
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy, in accordance 
with which the Committee annually reviews the quality and 
cost effectiveness of the external audit and the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. The Auditor 
Independence Policy can be found on the Company’s website 
at www.drax.com 
The provisions of the Policy include: 
� seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in its professional 
judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from 
it an account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s 
independence and the objectivity of the audit partner 
and staff;  
� a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to 
conduct non-audit work under which: 
–�the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain 
categories of work, including those where they may be 
required to audit their own work or make management 
decisions, or where the auditor would act in an advocacy 
role for the Group;  
–�there is a clear process of approval for engaging the 
auditor to conduct other categories of non-audit work, 
subject to financial limits;  
–�all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit 
work are reported to the next meeting of the Committee;  
–�the balance between the fees paid to the external 
auditor for audit and non-audit work is monitored by 
the Committee; and  
� a policy on the employment by the Group of former 
employees of the external auditor, the essence of which 
is to require a period of two years to elapse between the 
cessation of an individual’s association with the auditor 
and appointment to any financial reporting oversight role 
within the Group. 
The Committee receives reports from the external auditor 
on its own processes and procedures to ensure its 
independence and objectivity and to ensure compliance 
with the relevant standards. 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the 
year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 113. The external 
auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for 
the Group audit every five years and the current audit partner, 
Carl Hughes, has been in place for five years. His successor, 
James Leigh, will take responsibility in respect of the 
2014 audit. 
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s 
choice of external auditor. 
Audit tendering 
As set out in the Corporate governance section, the  
Committee recommended that the Board decide not to 
comply for the time being with provision C.3.7 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), as revised in 
September 2012, which stipulates that the external audit 
contract should be put out to tender at least every ten years.  
Deloitte LLP has been the auditor of the Drax group of 
companies since 1999, and was appointed as auditor of Drax 
Group plc on its incorporation in 2005. During this period the 
audit has not been put out to tender. In order to comply with 
the new Code provision effective for this financial period, we 
would need to put the audit out to tender for the 2014 year 
end. The rationale for non-compliance reflects the importance 
we place on the period of transformational change the 
business is undergoing to become a predominantly biomass-
fired power station. The incumbent auditor has accumulated 
knowledge and experience that allows it to carry out effective 
and efficient audits during this period of change and provide 
insightful and informed challenge. In addition, to conduct a 
thorough competitive audit tender process would require 
substantial Board and management participation at a time 
when the transformation of the business is placing greatly 
increased demands on them.  
In coming to a recommendation the Committee considered 
how, notwithstanding its recommendation to defer putting 
the external audit contract out to tender, the Group would 
adhere to the principle of the Code to maintain an appropriate 
relationship with the auditor. The independence and the 
effectiveness of the external auditor are reviewed annually by 
the Committee and no weakening in the level of the auditor's 
scepticism or in its desire to challenge management's 
judgements and assumptions in relation to financial reporting 
has been noted. In addition, there is a well-established policy
and fees paid to the external auditor for audit and non-audit 
services are reviewed at each Committee meeting, with 
gated authority to approve non-audit services
without the Committee's approval. 
In the light of these policies and procedures, the Committee  
is satisfied that an appropriate relationship has been 
maintained with the auditor.  
The Committee has undertaken to review this decision 
on an annual basis, including consideration of legislative 
developments, with the current intention of going through 
a full audit tender process for the 2016 year end, in line with 
the completion of the substantial part of the biomass 
transformation project.

Overview
Audit Committee report 
Internal audit 
Grant Thornton UK LLP undertakes the Group’s internal audit 
function. The Committee periodically reviews whether the 
internal audit function is likely to be more effective or efficient 
if provided internally. In view of the nature and scope of the 
Group’s business and its management structure, the Committee 
considers that it continues to be more effective and efficient 
for core internal audit functions to be undertaken by an 
external service provider, augmented as appropriate by 
additional reviews that require specialist expertise. 
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding 
the internal audit programme and reviews undertaken. 
Recommendations are made to management for process 
improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal 
audit reports reviewed by the Committee during 2013 
included: stock management (coal and biomass); by-product 
revenue; purchasing and expenditure processes from 
budgeting through to payment of invoices; compliance with 
the Bribery Act; key financial controls over business planning 
and capital budgeting; IT key controls and portfolio 
management; review of the US operations key controls; 
controls over capital project management; review of demand 
forecasting and credit risk management at Haven Power 
Limited (“Haven Power”) as well as key financial controls 
over revenue and indirect taxes at Haven Power. 
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, 
maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal 
and external auditor. 
Fair, balanced and understandable view 
At the February 2014 meeting, the Committee reviewed 
the content of this Annual report and accounts and advised 
the Board that, in its view, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit 
Committee on 18 February 2014.

The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee’s 
proceedings to the following Board meeting and, subject to 
redaction in the event that they include personal information, 
the minutes of each meeting of the Committee are circulated 
to all members of the Board. 
At its meeting in November, the Committee reviewed the 
succession plan in relation to senior management roles. The 
succession plan was considered to be appropriate taking into 
account the size and management structure of the Group. 
The Committee also reviewed the composition of the Board 
and concluded that following the appointment of an 
additional non-executive director at the start of the year and 
the retirement of Tim Barker in April, the composition of the 
Board was appropriate for the business at this time.  
During the course of the year, the Committee undertook a 
senior management evaluation and development exercise with 
the assistance of Russell Reynolds Associates. The objective 
was to identify the particular attributes and development needs 
of potential successors to board and Executive Committee 
roles. Various targeted development programmes have been 
identified and implemented for particular individuals to 
enhance the quality of potential internal successors. 
The Committee recognises the strength that can be achieved 
through diversity in its wider sense in the Group’s management. 
In particular, it is the Board’s policy to ensure that the proportion 
of women on the Board is one of the considerations for Board 
and senior management appointments. That policy is 
implemented as part of the recruitment and selection process. 
Further details of gender diversity in the Group are included in 
the Corporate and social responsibility section of the Annual 
report and accounts. 
The Company’s Articles provide that directors retire by rotation. 
However, the UK Corporate Governance Code provides that all 
directors should be subject to annual re-election. The Company 
adopted the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
on the annual re-election of all directors at the beginning of 2011. 
At the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
held on 24 April 2013, Tim Barker retired as a director of the 
Company and from the committees on which he served. 
The Committee initiated a review of the effectiveness of the 
Board, its committees and individual directors and the outcome 
is reported in the Corporate governance report on page 66.  
The Board met on 11 February 2014, following the completion 
of the Board evaluation process, and determined that all of the 
directors who are the subject of annual re-election will retire 
at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election. The evaluation of the Board described on 
page 66 concluded that the directors offering themselves for 
re-election continue to demonstrate commitment to their 
particular role and perform effectively. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
by prior arrangement during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office. They will also be available for 
inspection at the venue, prior to the AGM, details of which 
are contained in the Notice of Meeting. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Nominations 
Committee on 18 February 2014.

Annual statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
This is my first year as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and I would first like to thank my predecessor, Tim Barker, 
for his contribution as Chairman and his assistance during the handover period.  
In last year’s report we adopted a number of the improved reporting measures which are now legislative requirements under 
the Large and Medium sized Companies (Accounts and Reports) (Amendments) Regulations 2013. This year we have made 
further changes to reflect both the final Regulations and published investor guidance. The remuneration report is in two parts: 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy sets out the proposed policy for three years between the 2014 Annual General Meeting and 
the 2017 Annual General Meeting; the annual report on remuneration sets out payments and awards made to the directors 
and details the link between company performance and remuneration for the financial year ending on 31 December 2013. 
Tim Barker noted in last year’s report that we would be reviewing executive remuneration to ensure that it properly reflects 
changes to the business and directors’ roles. The Committee has undertaken this review during 2013. We are grateful for the 
support and assistance from shareholders received during our consultation on the proposed changes to directors’ remuneration 
and on the proposed remuneration policy.  
The context for this year’s review of executive remuneration is the progress in the implementation of Drax’s biomass strategy, 
which is transforming the business from a position of having a limited life, to one with a sustainable long-term future with 
opportunities to develop. Since 2008 the executive team has led the way in the UK in the fuelling of coal plants with 
sustainable biomass.  
The Committee reviewed with careful consideration the extent to which the scope and dimensions of the executive director 
roles have increased, namely:  
1) Biomass strategy  
Consistent with positioning itself as a major player in renewables generation, Drax is well advanced with its programme to 
invest around £700 million to transform Drax into a predominantly renewable generator through biomass. One of Drax’s six 
generating units has been converted to biomass, and the significant construction and engineering project at Drax will provide 
the infrastructure to enable the plant to receive, process and handle biomass to fuel its converted units.  
Providing cost effective biomass fuel to these units will be an essential element of Drax’s long-term success. To this end, 
management is leading the establishment of an international supply chain involving long-term biomass supply contracts, rail 
and port facilities, shipping arrangements and the development of biomass processing facilities. This development already 
includes a US subsidiary business which is constructing biomass pelleting plants and port facilities, and international expansion 
can be expected to continue. 
Sustainability of biomass sources is crucial. Drax has taken a leading position in pressing for the implementation of robust 
sustainability standards.

2) Trading strategy 
As a result of implementing the biomass strategy the business has the potential for much enhanced returns as compared to 
coal but it has introduced a greater dimension into its trading. Drax has moved from a position of hedging the three legs of 
the dark green spread (the difference between the revenue from electricity generation and the costs of buying coal and carbon 
allowances) on a short to medium-term basis, to a position where, because of the need for long-term contracting to develop 
the biomass market, most of it in jurisdictions outside the UK, a more complex trading strategy is being operated. This involves 
treasury and commodity trading activities to manage risks associated with long-term contracting of biomass, foreign exchange, 
freight, and oil, together with the management of collateral risk to ensure that the business remains robust to a sub-investment 
grade debt rating. In addition, Drax is managing the increasing compliance obligations associated with financial regulation. 
3) Haven Power 
Haven Power joined the Group in 2009, and has developed from a relatively small supplier to small and medium sized businesses, 
into a business with a significant industrial and commercial customer base playing an increasingly important and integrated role 
in the Group’s trading strategy.  
4) Market regulation 
Renewable plant is currently made economically viable through the Renewables Obligation (RO). Drax management has, for 
many years, been actively engaged with government in promoting reforms which will achieve increased certainty to support 
investment in renewables, particularly biomass. To date, this has been achieved through the setting of RO bands and 
grandfathering of the RO. The UK government’s Electricity Market Reform package includes other measures, particularly in 
relation to contracts for differences and capacity payments, which will be critical to Drax’s strategy and commercial choices. 
Active engagement in the development and implementation of these measures, and the commercial decisions arising from 
them, will continue to be central to Drax’s strategy and future success.  
Change to executive directors’ terms 
The review led the Committee to conclude a need to reflect these changes in the executives’ remuneration. The strategic 
complexity of the business is high at this point in our development, and the decisions made by our executive directors in the 
coming years will be critical for the long-term future of the Company.  
Following consultation with our ten largest shareholders, the Committee decided to make a number of changes to the structure 
of the executive directors’ remuneration.  
Annual bonus potential will be increased from 2014 so that the Chief Executive’s target annual bonus will increase from 
65% to 75% of salary, and the target annual bonus of the other executive directors will increase from 60% to 70% of salary. 
Maximum bonus will continue to be capped at twice the target bonus, i.e. 150% and 140% respectively.  
The proportion of the annual bonus to be deferred into shares for three years will be increased from 25% to 35%. 
We have also decided to increase directors’ shareholding requirements. The Company’s guidelines currently require executive 
directors to build up a shareholding to the value of their annual salary. The Committee has decided to increase this to 175% of 
salary for the Chief Executive and 125% of salary for the other executive directors. 
The Committee is confident that we have a strong executive team, and the new remuneration arrangements are designed to 
retain the team to deliver the opportunities that have been created for shareholders and to reward the executives for that delivery. 
During the year the Committee also reviewed the terms of executive directors’ service agreements, following which the Company 
entered into new service agreements with all four of the executive directors. The main changes to the contracts were to amend 
notice provisions so that all directors’ contracts are terminable on 12 months’ notice from either party, to enable the Company 
to make phased payments in lieu of notice and to ensure that there are appropriate restrictions on the directors’ ability to work 
for competitors or solicit staff after leaving the Company.  
Wider employee population 
In respect of the wider employee population in the Group, a two year pay agreement was implemented for employees in the 
collective bargaining unit, resulting in annual basic pay increases of RPI plus 0.4% for 2013 and 2014, plus any annual incremental 
progression for employees not yet at the top of their pay scale. 
Executive director basic pay increased by 3.50% during 2013, whilst the average annual change in basic pay for all other Group 
employees employed continuously from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013 was 5.02%.  
Last year’s report noted that the Committee had agreed that additional steps should be taken to make employees aware of 
the likely level of their retirement benefits and to encourage them to review their contributions. It also noted that additional 
contributions by the Group may be needed dependent upon the terms applicable to the relevant schemes. I am pleased 
to report that the awareness sessions have been very effective.  
We have now successfully implemented pension auto-enrolment for our UK employees. 93.50% of all Group employees in the 
UK are now members of a Drax occupational pension scheme.

Overview
Remuneration Committee report 
Assessment of remuneration relating to 2013 and 2014 targets 
At its meeting in February 2014 the Committee considered a number of matters on remuneration either paid in or relating to 2014. 
The Annual report on remuneration includes details of the Committee’s assessment of 2013 performance. As expected, 2013 
profits were lower than in 2012 due to the additional cost of carbon. Nevertheless it was a significant year of achievement for 
the Company. In particular, the conversion of the first generating unit to burn sustainable biomass, the associated supply chain 
developments, the regulatory developments towards contracts to determine the earnings of further biomass units, and the 
volume growth of the retail business are all major steps towards securing the Company’s long-term future. The Committee’s 
assessment of the Scorecard was at 1.52, which means that the cap of 1.5 applies. We also assessed the executive directors’ 
performance against their performance objectives as being towards the upper end of the range between target and maximum. 
As a result of the combination of the corporate and personal scores, annual bonuses for 2013 to be paid in March 2014 will be 
capped at the maximum level. The details of the scoring are set out on page 90 of the Annual report on remuneration. 
The Committee also considered targets for 2014. These have been established to be at least as challenging as those for 2013. 
A description of the 2014 corporate targets is set out in the Annual report section of this report, with such detail as can be 
provided whilst safeguarding commercial confidentiality. 
The Committee also considered the vesting of the Bonus Matching Plan awards made in 2011, which were conditional upon 
performance over the three years from the start of 2011 to the end of 2013. As described in the Policy section of this report, 
the awards are 50% based on the Company’s relative Total Share
average of the Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The Company’s TSR over the period was 107%, which was in the upper quartile 
of the comparator group, and the Committee therefore confirmed vesting of the whole of the TSR element of the award. 
The average scorecard score over the same period was 1.48. As a result, the Committee determined that 97.16% of the 
Scorecard Award element would vest. 
The Committee also agreed to the grant of 2014 Bonus Matching Plan awards to the executive directors to the value of 150% 
of their 2013 annual bonus, and subject to the same performance conditions as described in the policy section of this report. 
Directors’ remuneration policy 
This remuneration policy, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), will be effective from 
immediately after the AGM on 23 April 2014 and binding upon the Group until the close of the 2017 AGM. There are no planned 
changes to the policy over the three year period to which it relates. 
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: 
� give effect to existing remuneration commitments in accordance with directors’ contracts of employment; 
� pay market rates of total remuneration; 
� ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward; 
� award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of 
strategic objectives and personal performance;  
� ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan strategic objectives;  
� ensure that payments on termination of employment are linked to performance and the exercise of good faith; and 
� allow the Committee an element of discretion to enable recruitment or termination situations to be managed in the best 
interest of the Group.

Remuneration policy report  
Section 1 
Key components of remuneration 
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to support the delivery of business performance and creation 
of shareholder value. We set out in the table below the remuneration policy, and in the notes following the table we provide a 
commentary on differences between this policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally.  
The following table sets out the policy relating to the key components of executive director remuneration:  
Remuneration 
component 
How this component  
relates to Group strategy 
How this component operates in practice 
Performance measures and  
maximum potential value 
i) Base salary Base salary helps to 
attract, reward and retain 
the right calibre of 
executive to deliver the 
leadership/management 
needed to execute the 
Group’s vision and 
business plan. 
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and experience, 
and market level. 
To determine market level, the Committee reviews remuneration 
data on executive positions at companies which the Committee 
consider to be appropriate comparators.  
The comparator companies are selected, with advice from the 
Committee’s remuneration advisers, taking into account relevant 
comparator factors such as, but not limited to, sector, size, and 
international presence. 
On appointment, an executive director’s base salary is set at the 
market level, or below if the executive is not fully experienced 
at this level. 
Where base salary on appointment is below market level to reflect 
experience, it will over time, be increased to align with the market 
level, subject to performance. 
Base salaries of all executive directors are generally reviewed 
once each year.  
Reviews cover: individual performance; experience; development 
in role; and market comparisons.  
The base salaries of executive directors 
in post at the start of the policy period 
and who remain in the same role 
throughout the policy period will not 
usually be increased by a higher 
percentage than the average annual 
percentage increase in salaries of all 
other employees in the Group. 
The only exceptions are where: 
(i) an executive director has been 
appointed at below market level to 
reflect experience. In this case, the 
maximum annual increase to base salary 
will be 5% over the normal maximum; or 
(ii) there is a particular reason for a higher 
increase, such as a change in the scope 
or nature of responsibilities. 
In the case of the Production Director 
and the Retail and Trading Director, 
some further adjustment is envisaged 
to reflect increasing scope of roles and 
increasing experience. The maximum 
increase to base salary in any year will 
be 5% over the normal maximum.

Performance measures and  
maximum potential value 
ii) Annual 
bonus 
The award of annual 
bonuses is directly linked 
to personal performance 
and to the achievement 
of the annual Business 
Plan targets. 
The multiplicative 
formula is designed to 
ensure that bonus 
payments for high 
personal performance 
are moderated where 
business performance 
is below target, or 
vice versa. 
Strategic and Business plan targets are set by the Board as part of 
the Business Plan approval process. 
The Committee determines Group performance measures using 
a Scorecard.  
The Scorecard shows executive directors’ annual targets 
and measures of performance (low, target and stretch), 
and weightings. 
Score is zero if performance is below the low measure. 
Maximum score is attributed to the stretch measure.  
The Scorecard is amended each year in line with business strategy 
and objectives. 
Summary Scorecard and performance results are published 
in the Annual report on remuneration.  
To determine the actual bonus awards, the following formula is used: 
Chief Executive’s bonus 
Target bonus is 75% of base salary 
Actual bonus = basic salary x 75% x company score 
x personal score 
Bonus is capped at 150% of salary 
Other directors’ bonus 
Target bonus is 70% of salary 
Bonus = basic salary x 70% x company score x personal score 
Bonus is capped at 140% of salary 
Clawback 
The Committee may require a director to repay to the Company such 
amount of any annual bonus payment as it considers appropriate 
in circumstances of financial misstatement, misconduct or if 
assessment of a performance condition is found to have been 
based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information, or in other 
circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the 
operation of the clawback provision.. 
In these circumstances, Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) clawback 
provisions may also apply (see BMP below).

Group performance measures 
Group performance measures include 
financial, production, strategic and other 
Business Plan objectives.  
These measures and weightings are 
determined by the Board and adopted 
by the Committee. 
Individual performance measures 
The Remuneration Committee 
determines the personal objectives for 
the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive 
proposes personal objectives for the 
other executive directors, which are 
reviewed and approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. Generally, 
all executive directors will be awarded a 
single score based on their collective 
performance in providing effective day to 
day leadership of the Group as a unified 
leadership team. Personal scores may 
differ in circumstances of exceptional 
over or under performance. 
iii) Deferred 
annual 
bonus 
This is the deferred 
portion of annual bonus. 
The aim of deferral is to 
further align executives 
to the interests of 
shareholders, by linking 
share based reward to 
long-term sustainable 
performance. 
35% of any annual bonus is settled in shares deferred for three years. 
No performance conditions are used other than continued service. 
If the executive leaves the Group before the normal vesting day, 
the shares will vest (pro-rated to the date of leaving) only if the 
termination is for a specified reason including redundancy, 
retirement or death in service, or, if for any other reason, at the 
discretion of the Committee. In any other circumstances the award 
is forfeited. 
100% of the shares will vest subject to 
continued employment up to the date 
of vesting.

Performance measures and  
maximum potential value 
iv) Bonus 
Matching 
Plan (“BMP”) 
  
This is the long-term 
incentive plan for 
executives.  
It links long-term share 
based incentives to Total 
Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) and to the 
achievement of Business 
Plan strategic targets. 
The Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) is a long-term performance 
share plan. 
Under the BMP, executive directors receive an annual grant 
of conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the amount of 
the executive’s annual bonus for the prior year.  
It is the Committee’s policy to grant BMP awards to executive 
directors at 1.5 times the amount of the annual bonus unless the 
performance of the director or of the business makes an award 
at that level inappropriate. No payment is made for the shares.  
Vesting is conditional upon service and performance conditions, 
and shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions determined by the 
Committee. To the extent that vesting is determined by reference 
to Company Scorecard performance, at the end of the three year 
performance period, the Committee will review each of the annual 
results going into an average Scorecard calculation and has the 
discretion to adjust the final outcome based on events over the 
period to ensure that the result is consistent with the underlying 
performance progression of the business. In exercising its 
discretion the Committee will have particular regard to progress 
against the strategic objectives incorporated in the Scorecard. 
If the executive leaves the Group before the normal vesting day, 
the shares will vest (pro-rated to the date of leaving and phased 
over the normal cycle of the performance periods) only if the 
termination is for a specified reason including redundancy, 
retirement or death in service, or, if for any other reason, at the 
discretion of the Committee. In any other circumstances the award 
is forfeited. 
Performance condition override 
The Committee will include an override provision in each grant 
under the BMP. This will give the Committee discretion to 
determine that no vesting shall occur or vesting shall be reduced 
if there are circumstances (relating to the Company’s overall 
performance or otherwise) which make vesting as calculated by 
reference to the performance conditions alone inappropriate.  
Clawback 
If a repayment of bonus is required (see “annual bonus” above) the 
Committee shall also make an appropriate reduction in the number 
of shares that may vest under the BMP (in respect of an award 
made pursuant to the annual bonus payment subject to the 
clawback).  
The Committee may also reduce the number of shares under a 
BMP award in circumstances of financial misstatement, or if 
assessment of a performance condition is found to have been 
based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information, or in other 
circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the 
operation of the clawback provision.. 
Maximum number of shares granted 
equals shares to the value of 1.5 x annual 
bonus for prior year. 
Maximum vesting of shares three years 
later is subject to performance. 
There are two vesting performance 
measures (vesting threshold is 15% in 
both measures): 
i) Up to 50% of shares vest subject to 
TSR performance over three years 
relative to FTSE51–150 as follows: 
Below median = 0% vesting 
At median = 15% vesting (threshold) 
Upper quartile = 100% vesting. 
ii) Up to 50% of shares vest subject to 
Company Scorecard performance 
averaged over the three year 
performance period, as follows:  
Score <1 = 0% vesting 
Score 1 = 15% vesting (threshold score) 
Score 1.5 = 100% vesting 
The three year average company 
performance score is capped at 1.5. 
Example: 
Year 1 Score 1.8 
Year 2 Score 1.4 
Year 3 score 1.4 
Three year BMP performance score = 1.5 
For both the TSR and Scorecard 
conditions vesting between 15% 
and 100% is on a straight-line 
interpolation. 
In accordance with the rules of the BMP, 
Dividend Shares are awarded at the time 
and in the event that shares vest. They 
are calculated based on the dividends 
paid following the initial award until the 
award vests. 
v) Pension 
Pension provision is one 
of the components to 
attract, reward and retain 
the right calibre of 
executive in order to 
ensure delivery of the 
leadership and 
management needed to 
execute the Group’s 
vision and business plan. 
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of 
the Group’s defined contribution pension plan. The employer’s 
contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary. 
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have 
contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension 
schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject 
to normal statutory deductions; or a combination of pension 
contributions up to the HMRC Annual Allowance with the 
remainder as cash in lieu of pension. 
Maximum is 20% of base salary.

Performance measures and  
maximum potential value 
vi) Other 
benefits 
In general, other benefits 
aim to align directors’ 
total remuneration 
broadly with the market.  
In particular, all-employee 
share plans incentivise 
sustained long-term 
performance and 
strengthen teamwork by 
enabling all employees to 
share in the success of 
the business. The plans 
are vehicles for aligning 
staff remuneration with 
TSR performance. 
Executive directors receive a car allowance, life assurance (x4 salary), 
the opportunity to participate in all-employee share plans on the 
same basis as other employees, annual private health assessment 
and annual private medical cover. 
Relocation expenses and/or second base expenses are paid where 
appropriate in individual cases. Directors’ relocation expenses are 
determined on a case by case basis. The policy is designed to assist 
the director to relocate to a home of similar standing. 
 
vii) Share 
ownership 
The Group’s share 
ownership guidelines 
align the interests of 
executives with 
shareholders. 
The share ownership guideline is that the Chief Executive should 
retain shares to the value of 175% of base salary and other directors 
should retain shares to the value of 125% of base salary. Until this 
level is reached, directors who receive shares by virtue of share plan 
awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of 
the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and national 
insurance contributions). Only shares that have actually vested 
count towards the threshold. 
 
Differences between the policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally 
The following differences apply between the remuneration of directors and the policy on the remuneration of employees generally: 
� executive directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for BMP. However, there are differences in terms of levels 
of grant. 
� annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, and the requirement to defer a portion of annual bonus applies only to 
executive directors. 
� employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus subject to Company 
performance and continued employment, whereas directors and all other UK based employees participate in a discretionary 
bonus scheme.  
� hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments.

Non-executive directors 
Remuneration component 
How this component operates in practice 
Annual fee 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive 
directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors. These are determined in the light of:
� fees of chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed companies selected for comparator 
purposes on the same basis as for executive directors;  
� the responsibilities and time commitment; and 
� the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience. 
The Chairman receives an annual fee. 
Non-executive directors receive an annual base fee. 
Additional annual fees are paid: 
� to the Senior Independent Director (which includes the fee for chairing a Board Committee other 
than the Audit Committee); 
� to the Chair of the Audit Committee; 
� to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee; and 
� to the Chair of any other Committee (this is not paid to the Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
if he or she is also the Chairman of the Board). 
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed periodically against market comparators. They were last 
reviewed in July 2013. Current fee levels are shown in the annual report on remuneration. 
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any performance related remuneration 
arrangements. 
Travel expenses 
Reimbursement of reasonable travel and accommodation expenses as applicable. 
Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus, pension or 
any of the share-based reward plans. The Chairman’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a 
notice period of one month. 
 
Section 2 
Approach to recruitment remuneration 
The Committee will apply the core principles on page 80 and the remuneration components set out in the table on pages 81 to 
84 determine the remuneration of newly appointed directors. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the 
experience of the director being appointed. Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the 
market level, subject to good performance. In relation to directors appointed from outside the Company, where the Committee 
considers it to be necessary to secure the appointment of the director, the Committee may: 
� pay “sign-on” compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share 
incentives (subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the right 
of the Company to clawback any amount which is subsequently paid to the executive by the former employer, and to 
clawback an appropriate proportion of the payment if the executive leaves soon after appointment). 
� make appropriate payments in circumstances where a director is relocated from outside the UK. 
 
Section 3 
Service agreements 
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
prior notice. 
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of 
termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director 
during the contractual notice period.

Section 4  
Remuneration scenarios 
The composition and value of the executive directors’ remuneration packages at below threshold, target and outperformance 
scenarios under the Drax Group remuneration policy are set out in the charts below: 
Notes: 
(1)� Annual bonus threshold is assumed at 25% of maximum, target at 50% of maximum and outperformance at 100% of maximum bonus.  
(2)� The BMP award threshold is assumed at 15% of maximum award and outperformance 100% of maximum, with target representing the average of the two.  
(3)� The award of conditional shares under the BMP is based on the individual’s prior year annual bonus and therefore it is assumed that corresponding threshold, target 
and maximum bonus is earned for calculating threshold, target and maximum BMP award under each scenario. 
 
Section 5  
Policy on loss of office 
If an executive director’s employment is brought to an end by either party and if it is necessary to determine a termination 
payment, the Committee’s policy, in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the director, is to determine a 
director’s termination payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The termination payment will be calculated 
based on the value of base salary and contractual benefits that would have accrued to the director during the contractual 
notice period. The Committee will seek mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment to a leaving director 
when appropriate to do so, having regard to the circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may, for example, 
be appropriate to consider mitigation if the director has secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would not be applicable 
to a contractual payment in lieu of notice.  
In addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights. No service agreement includes any 
provision for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need 
to be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances. 
All bonus payments are discretionary benefits. The Committee will consider whether a departing director should receive an 
annual bonus in respect of the financial year in which, and/or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated 
to reflect the period of the performance year completed at the date of termination. The Committee will take into account 
performance; co-operation with succession; and any breach of goodwill and adherence to contractual obligations/restrictions. 
If the termination is by the Company on less than the specified notice in the director’s service agreement, the Committee will 
also consider whether the director should receive an annual bonus in respect of any period of the financial year following 
termination for which the director has been deprived of the opportunity to earn annual bonus. If the employment ends in any of 
the following circumstances, the director will be treated as a “good leaver” and the director will be eligible for a bonus payment: 
� redundancy; 
� retirement; 
� ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company; and  
� death.

If the termination is for any other reason a bonus payment will be at the discretion of the Committee. It is the Committee’s policy 
to ensure that any such bonus payment properly reflects the departing director’s performance and behaviour towards the 
Company. Therefore the amount of any such payment will be determined as described in the table on page 82, taking into 
account (i) the director’s personal performance and behaviour towards the Company and (ii) the Group performance. If a bonus 
payment is made, it will normally be paid as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Group performance element has been 
determined for the relevant period. There may be circumstances in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the bonus 
payment to be made earlier, for example, on termination due to ill-health, in which case, “on-target” Group performance score 
shall be assumed.  
No element of any such bonus payment shall be deferred.  
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the director under the BMP 
should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee will be in accordance with the rules of the BMP (as approved by 
shareholders). In summary, the rules of the BMP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date of employment termination) 
if employment ends for any of the following reasons: 
� redundancy; 
� retirement; 
� ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company; 
� change of ownership; and  
� death. 
If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the BMP require the Committee to exercise its discretion. In doing so it 
will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular the performance of the Company; the director’s performance and 
behaviour towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; as well as a range of other relevant 
factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date. The rules of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where 
awards vest, deferred bonus shares vest as soon as reasonably practicable following termination. Awards, which vest subject to 
satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will be (time) pro-rated and will be phased over the performance cycle of 
the relevant awards.  
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving director is fair and appropriate 
taking account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may be minded to award an 
annual bonus payment and/or permit the vesting of BMP awards include: 
� the director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice; and 
� the director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements. 
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is: 
� poor performance; or 
� the director does not continue to perform effectively following notice; or 
� the director is departing to join a competitor.  
 
Section 6 
Context 
Wider employee population 
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the 
Group.  
It is the Committee’s policy that annual salary increases for executive directors should not exceed the average annual salary 
increase for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the 
nature or scope of responsibilities. 
Views taken from the employee population 
In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, the Group discusses executive remuneration policy and 
provides details of the process by which the Committee establishes executive remuneration packages. The information 
provided includes details of the benchmarking of executive director remuneration as well as information benchmarking the pay 
of employees in the collective bargaining unit with pay elsewhere in the industry.

Governance
Overview
Remuneration Committee report 
Environmental, social and governance issues 
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the 
remuneration of executive directors. Specific measures can be included in the balanced Corporate Scorecard. The Committee is 
able to consider those issues in considering whether to exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score, and in considering the 
performance conditions override under the BMP, as described on page 83. 
Shareholder engagement 
The Company holds regular meetings with its largest shareholders, and the Committee takes into account any views or 
representations of shareholders relating to executive remuneration.  
The Company has consulted its ten largest shareholders in relation to the formulation of its directors’ remuneration policy.

Plant and operations  
12.5% Targets relate to availability and outage rates with a specific target related to 
the first converted biomass unit availability. The coal forced outage rate is 
determined as appropriate to plant and operations characteristics in the year, 
and based on a long-term target of 5%. Specific biomass targets remain

Regulatory objectives  
10% Targets related to progress towards achieving support for biomass 
generation under the Contract for Differences (“CfDs”) structure on 
appropriate terms and on progress towards sustainability requirements that 
are appropriately robust and manageable. At the end of the year two Drax 
generating units had been ranked first equal in the application process for 
investment CfDs, and government’s position on sustainability standards 
reflected many of the Company’s recommendations. Accordingly the 
Committee assessed the score as between target and stretch. 
1.75
Conversion facilities  
10% Targets were against the budget and schedule for the capital works 
associated with the biomass conversion and biomass burnt during the year. 
Specific targets remain confidential. The Committee assessed performance 
as between target and stretch based on actual performance.  
1.20
Biomass supply 
10% The target related to the overall volume of biomass contracted for supply 
with a view to securing volume for three converted units. The specific targets 
remain confidential. The Committee assessed performance as having 
achieved the stretch target. 
2.00
US asset investment  
10% Targets related to the schedule and budget for construction of assets 
in the US and for O&M mobilisation. The targets remain confidential.

The Committee assessed the performance of each of the executive directors against the general and specific objectives. 
The executive directors, as members of the Executive Committee, were assessed as providing effective day to day leadership 
of the Group as a unified leadership team. All of them exceeded the specific personal targets. Accordingly, each was assessed 
with a personal score of 1.40. 
For 2013 bonus awards, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of base 
salary respectively. Their maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively. 75% of any bonus award is paid in cash and 25% is 
deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a “good leaver” 
before the shares vest.

Notes: 
(1) In accordance with the BMP Rules, Dividend shares are only awarded, at the time and in the event that, awards actually vest. No Dividend shares are awarded where 
the initial awards lapse. The number of Dividend shares awarded is calculated based on the actual dividends paid to ordinary shareholders in the period following the 
initial award up until the award vests.  
(2) The Deferred Awards referred to above are the share awards made in respect of the deferral of cash bonus awarded each year. Those share awards operate under the 
rules of the BMP.  
(3) Details of the conditions subject to which the above awards will vest are given on page 83. 
(4) The face value of the awards is calculated based on the share price on 31 December 2013.

Total pension entitlements for defined contribution schemes (audited information) 
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of the Group’s defined contribution pension plan with either 
an employer contribution of 20% of base salary, or have contributions to a personal pension, or cash in lieu of pension, or a 
combination of any of these up to a maximum contribution of 20% of base salary. 
No director was a member of the defined benefit scheme. 
Payments for loss of office 
No executive directors left the business during the year and therefore no payments for loss of office were made to directors 
during the financial year. Tim Barker, a non-executive director, retired from the Board on 24 April 2013. No payment for loss of 
office was made.

Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited information) 
During the year the shareholding guidelines required executive directors who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or 
who receive deferred bonus shares to retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance 
contributions) until the value was equal to their annual salary. From 2014 the requirement has been increased so that the value 
to be built up is 175% and 125% of salary respectively for the Chief Executive and other executive directors. Only shares that have 
actually vested count towards the threshold. The following table shows the executive directors’ shareholdings and share 
interests at 31 December 2013.

Provision of shares for share plans – dilution 
In accordance with the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers, the Company can satisfy awards under all its share plans 
with new issue shares or shares issued from treasury up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10-year 
period to employees under all its share plans. Within the 10% limit, the Company can only issue (as newly issued shares or from 
treasury) 5% of its issued share capital to satisfy awards under the discretionary or executive plans. 
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of 
the shares in issue at the date of this report.

Value of £100 invested 
The following graph shows how the value of £100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2008 has changed and compares 
that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices. 
These indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Company’s shareholders may judge their 
relative returns given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices. 
The graph reflects the TSR (determined according to usual market practice) for the Company and each of the indices referred 
to on a cumulative basis over the period from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2013.

Percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration compared with the wider employee population 
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s salary, benefits and bonus between 2012 and 2013 
compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for a group of employees. The 
Committee has selected all Group employees below executive director level based in the UK, as these are the vast majority of 
Group employees and provide the most appropriate comparator. It excludes employees based in the US, which is a newly 
established business with only 33 employees at the end of 2013.

Overview
Remuneration Committee report 
Advisers to the Committee 
The adviser to the Committee for the year was PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”). PwC is an independent adviser appointed 
by the Committee in October 2010, following a competitive tender process, to advise on market practice and remuneration of 
executive and non-executive directors. 
From time to time the Group engages PwC to provide financial, taxation and related advice on specific matters. The Committee 
will continue to monitor such engagements in order to be satisfied that they do not affect PwC’s independence as an adviser to 
the Committee. 
PwC was paid £105,000 during 2013 in respect of advice given to the Committee. 
The Committee also considers the views of the Chief Executive regarding the performance and remuneration of the other 
executive directors and senior staff.  
The Committee is also advised by Philip Hudson, the Company Secretary and by Richard Neville, the Head of Human Resources. 
Other matters 
Wider employee population 
The average pensionable pay of an executive director is 8.48 times the average of pensionable pay for all UK employees within 
the Group.

the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the related group notes 1 to 35 and the related Parent Company only notes 1 to 8. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted  
has been applied in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).  
Going concern  
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement contained within Operational and financial 
performance that the group is a going concern. We confirm that: 
� we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and 
� we have not identified material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern which we believe would need to be disclosed in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement  
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:  
Audit risks and key judgements  
How the scope of our work responded to that risk  
The useful economic life and carrying value 
of fixed assets  
We focused on testing the validity and valuation of a sample of additions by 
agreeing back to third party evidence. We reviewed management assumptions 
over the carrying value and useful economic life of the key plant by consideration 
of external market data and other benchmarking. We also considered whether  
The valuation of commodity contracts  
Our work focused on testing management’s judgements and calculations 
including testing a sample of trades undertaken and the assumptions involved 
in determining valuation and hedge effectiveness. 
The valuation of Renewable Obligation 
Certificates (ROCs).  
We verified the number of ROCs generated in the period either to third party 
evidence or tested internal calculations where applicable. We reviewed and 
compared management’s valuation of ROCs to external market data. 
Valuation of coal and biomass stocks 
We tested the underlying weighted average cost calculation to source data and 
benchmarked this against industry pricing.  
We also attended and considered the results of external surveys completed on 
the coal stockpile held at the Drax site and obtained, on a sample basis, external 
confirmation for stock held by third parties. 
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 74. Our audit procedures relating to these matters were 
designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual 
accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described 
above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.

Overview
Independent auditor’s report 
Our application of materiality  
We determined planning materiality for the group to be £10 million, which is approximately 7% of normalised pre-tax profit 
and below 1% of equity. We use normalised pre-tax profit to exclude the effect of volatility from unrealised gains or losses on 
derivative contracts, as determined/described in note 9. We determined that normalised pre-tax profit is an appropriate base for 
determining materiality as shareholders place significant value on the income statement. We agreed with the Audit Committee 
that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.2 million, as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our group audit scope focused primarily on the audit work at three locations. All of these were subject to a full audit. These 
three locations represent the principal business units within the group’s two reportable segments and account for all of the 
group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. The group audit team continued to follow a programme of 
planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the audit team visits each of the two most significant 
locations where the group audit scope was focused every year.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
� the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and  
� the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or  
� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
� the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.  
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.  
Directors’ remuneration  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters or our review.  
Corporate Governance Statement  
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.  
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report  
Under the International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in 
the annual report is:  
� materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or  
� apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or  
� otherwise misleading.  
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

106 Annual report and accounts 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
General information 
Simplifying the numbers… Throughout this document these boxes will explain in plain English what the disclosures mean, 
and why they are important to understanding our financial position and performance. In general, the notes to the financial 
statements include additional information required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or other 
regulations to facilitate a better, more detailed understanding of the primary financial statements set out on pages 102 to 106. 
Delivering our biomass strategy… Where relevant to do so, we have set out key elements of our business model and strategy 
(see pages 17 to 19) and how pursuit of this has impacted our financial results. 
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. The address of the Company’s 
registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. 
The principal operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 4 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which 
follow these consolidated financial statements. The principal activities of the Group are the sourcing of fuel in the US and at 
Drax Power Station, the generation and sale of electricity at Drax Power Station, and the sale of electricity to business customers 
by Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”). 
Basis of preparation 
This section describes the accounting standards we have followed in preparing these financial statements and the 
interpretation of accounting standards into accounting policies which are relevant to our Group. Wherever possible, we have 
explained how our accounting policies work in practice within the relevant note to the consolidated financial statements, 
and have not sought to repeat that information here. We have also made some changes in the way we present our income 
statement this year, which are described in detail below. We have not changed any of our accounting policies this year, 
nor have any new accounting standards had a material effect on our financial statements.  
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as explained in Operational and financial performance 
on page 43, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at 
fair value.  
Basis of consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by 
the Company, made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The impact of all intra-group transactions is eliminated on consolidation. 
Accounting policies 
Those accounting policies that are material to the understanding of our financial statements have been incorporated within the 
relevant note or are set out below: 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, 
VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies. 
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms 
or prevailing market rates as applicable. 
Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the risks 
and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party, that being when the ROC or LEC is transferred to 
the account of that third party.  
Revenue from the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction 
of agreed discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, 
supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to 
be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed is calculated based on consumption statistics 
and selling price estimates.

Overview
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Basis of preparation (continued) 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the 
income statement. 
Foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using 
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such operations are translated to sterling using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation 
of these operations are recognised in reserves. 
Presentation of financial statements 
During 2013 the Group conducted a review of its financial statements and concluded that an alternative presentation of the 
income statement would result in more relevant information for users in accordance with IAS 1. 
As a result of this review, the Group now presents EBITDA as a separate line item on the face of the income statement. 
EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts. 
As a result of this change, it has also been necessary to split depreciation and amortisation out from operating and 
administrative expenses. 
EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure reviewed by the Board, as described in note 4. Presentation on the face 
of the income statement joins up the financial statements with the commentary in Operational and financial performance, 
and also the segmental disclosure provided in note 4. The revised presentation will be maintained in future periods. 
In addition, underlying profit after tax for the year has been presented on the face of the income statement for the first time. 
Underlying profit after tax excludes the post-tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, and is used 
under our current distribution policy to calculate proposed dividends for the period. A reconciliation from profit for the year 
attributable to equity holders to underlying profit after tax is provided in note 9. 
The reconciliation of operating and administrative expenses disclosed in the prior year to the current presentation is as follows: 
2012 
2012 – Revised
Operating and administrative expenses 
(£271.0m)
(£212.5m)
Depreciation and amortisation 
– 
(£58.5m)
Total 
(£271.0m)
(£271.0m)
Applying the previous presentation to the current year results would result in operating and administrative costs for 2013 of 
£279.9 million.

Overview
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of income and expenditure recorded during the period. These estimates 
are based on our reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions that require judgement, but the actual amount may 
ultimately differ from the initial or subsequent estimates.  
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The most important of these judgements – those that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the 
amount recognised in the financial statements – are as follows: 
Property, plant and equipment – Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices 
prevailing at each balance sheet date. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment 
where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value 
of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future 
cash flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is 
therefore subjective. 
Derivatives – Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recorded for each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair values of 
derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves. Forward price 
curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement 
of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon 
readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally 
extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how 
future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued 
using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the 
option, discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around 
future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective. 
ROCs and LECs – ROCs and LECs are stated within the balance sheet at fair value on the date of recognition and subsequently 
written down to net realisable value where appropriate. Inherent in the calculation of this fair value and in the estimate of net 
realisable value is an assumption regarding future sales prices in the market. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions 
used in the valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ. 
Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
CESP – The Group has a contingent liability in respect of the Community Energy Saving Programme (“CESP”). The assessment 
of whether to make a provision for such a liability requires judgement. See note 34 for further details. 
Pensions – The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet 
date. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, 
and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that 
the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market 
conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions. 
Taxation – In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and 
expenditure for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and 
consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date 
unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely 
than not that they will be recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting 
income streams. 
Impairment – The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting 
policy detailed in note 10. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use 
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.

Segmental reporting 
We view our operational business as two distinct areas – or segments – the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station 
(“Generation”) and the supply of power to business customers (“Retail”). The respective financial performance of these 
segments is shown here (and described in far greater detail in Operational and financial performance starting on page 28). 
The costs incurred by our US business, which is still in the development phase, during the current and previous year have 
been included in the Generation segment. 
The Generation business segment spans all three core activities of the Group in that it incorporates sourcing, generation 
and supply (through its sales to the wholesale electricity market). 
The Retail business segment contributes to the supply activities of the Group, through sales direct to the small and medium 
enterprise and industrial and commercial markets. 
Grow our retail business… The information below clearly demonstrates the good sales volume growth achieved by Haven 
Power, our retail business, in the year.  
Information reported to the Board and for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is 
organised into two operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board 
on a regular basis is EBITDA.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the 
management accounts, and accordingly no separate asset disclosure is made here. However, spend on key capital projects 
is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2013 was £228 million (2012: £180 million), of which 
£117 million relates to construction of assets within our US business.  
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements. The revenue and results of both reporting segments presented are subject to 
seasonality as detailed in Operational and financial performance, page 43. 
Major customers 
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 includes an amount of £222.3 million (2012: £355.7 million and £221.8 million) 
derived from a single customer (2012: two customers), representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the year. These 
revenues arose in the generation segment.  
Operating expenses 
This note sets out the material components of the “Operating and administrative expenses” line on our consolidated income

Overview
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
Taxation 
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount payable on this year’s taxable profits 
(which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items upon which we are 
required to pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which 
reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules. 
The tax (credit)/charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2013 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement. 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered 
more likely than not that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Changes in the rate of corporation tax 
Following the announcement of the 2013 Budget, the Finance Act 2013 (the “Act”) was enacted by Parliament in July 2013. 
The Act confirmed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014, and a further reduction in 
corporation tax to 20% from 1 April 2015, both of which were substantively enacted during the year, and therefore have been 
reflected in the deferred tax balances below.

Earnings per share 
Earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary 
share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be 
issued under our employee share schemes – see note 25), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were 
exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated 
(note 8). Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of fair value movements on derivative contracts from earnings. 
Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period.

Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. 
All of our goodwill relates to the acquisition of Haven Power, our retail business, in 2009. Other intangibles include amounts 
paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.

Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven Power cash-generating unit. At 31 December 
2013, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting its cash generative profile; accordingly 
a sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.  
The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions in this 
calculation relate to the discount rate and future cash flows. Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. The first five years of cash 
flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board. Future cash flows have been taken in perpetuity, 
assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash 
flows from Haven Power is 8% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.  
Carbon assets 
Carbon assets arise upon the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the 
current financial year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment. 
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation 
for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and the 
market price at the balance sheet date. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our business. 
The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation is calculated by taking that cost, net of 
any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is 
simply its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date. 
We construct many of our assets under long-term projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated 
until they are ready for us to use in the way intended. 
Delivering our biomass strategy… Additions this year include a further £228 million on our biomass transformation project, 
which remains on schedule and budget. Key developments in 2013 included the commissioning of the new receipt, storage 
and distribution systems at Drax Power Station required to support our first converted unit, and the commencement of 
construction of two wood pellet plants in Mississippi and Louisiana and a port facility at Baton Rouge in the US.  
Accounting policy 
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade 
discounts and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment in value. Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.  
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant limited to the expected decommissioning date of the 
power station). The estimated useful lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently:

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological 
obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment. Residual values are based on prices prevailing 
at each balance sheet date. 
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Impairment 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication 
that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by 
reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset (value in use) or sales value net of expenses. If an 
asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The discount rate 
applied to future cash flows for this purpose is a pre-tax rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and 
reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

Inventories 
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumables that we use in the process of generating electricity. This note shows the cost 
of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year, including items at Drax Power 
Station, and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations. 
Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value. 
The cost of fuel stocks includes the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under 
the UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/handling costs. 
Delivering our biomass strategy… The increasing cost of carbon, including the carbon price support mechanism, added 
£120 million to our fuel costs in 2013. The relative economics of coal and biomass generation going forward underpins our 
transformation strategy.

ROC and LEC assets 
We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result 
of burning renewable biomass to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not 
yet sold.  
Delivering our biomass strategy and growing our retail business… As we generate more of our electricity by burning 
renewable biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC and LEC assets we generate will increase. As Haven 
Power grows, it provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs and LECs. 
ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and initially measured at fair value (reducing 
the cost of biomass in the income statement) based on anticipated sales prices. At each reporting date the Group reviews the 
fair value of ROC and LEC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales prices. Any impairments required are 
recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.

Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables represents amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but 
not yet been paid for. The note includes prepayments, which are amounts paid by us for which we are yet to receive the 
goods or service in return (e.g. carbon emissions allowances we have paid for that will be utilised in future years). 
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of the receivable.

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties. At 31 December 2013, the Group 
had amounts receivable from five (2012: five) significant counterparties within the generation business, representing 69% 
(2012: 78%) of trade receivables, all of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms. The ageing 
profile, beyond a month, of the Group’s receivables continues to be immaterial. Counterparty risk is discussed in note 21. 
Management does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, does not believe that a 
further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of £5.6 million (2012: £4.7 million). 
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience, and includes £5.6 million in relation to Haven 
Power (2012: £4.6 million).  
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU ETS. 
Accruals at 31 December 2013 include £9.2 million (2012: £59.0 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability 
to deliver CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.  
Borrowings 
Borrowings are chiefly comprised of bank loans with fixed maturity repayment profiles between 2016 and 2020.  
Maintaining an optimal capital structure… In 2012 we executed a refinancing of our existing facilities, replacing them with a 
£400 million revolving credit facility which matures in April 2016, two new term loans of £100 million each with Prudential 
M&G and the UK Green Investment Bank, and a commodities trading line that allows trading counterparties to benefit from 
the security package offered to our senior lenders instead of us posting collateral for certain volumes of trades. 
In April 2013, we agreed a new £75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from 
HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaced £50 million of the £100 million facility with the 
UK Green Investment Bank, above. 
The new loan facilities, which were fully drawn at the year end, enhance the financing structure executed in 2012 by 
providing additional liquidity and a smoother profile of debt maturities. 
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial 
instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the income 
statement over the life of the instrument.

Derivative financial instruments 
We enter into forward contracts for the sale of electricity, as well as the purchase of coal, sustainable biomass and CO2 
emissions allowances. We use financial coal contracts to swap floating for fixed prices (or vice versa) on fixed volumes of 
coal, and enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to transactions denominated in 
currencies other than sterling. 
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price 
risk, and foreign currency risk (see note 21). 
The accounting rules for derivative contracts are complex – we must account for them at fair value, which is in essence the 
difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and that we could achieve in the market now, at the balance 
sheet date. The tables and narrative below provide additional detail around these values, how they are calculated and the 
changes in underlying market conditions that drive their movements. 
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties… A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. 
Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative 
contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over 
cash flows into the future. 
Accounting policy 
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded 
from fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held 
for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from 
domestic sources. 
Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, 
with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 27) to the extent that the contracts are designated as 
effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. 
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current 
assets or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities. 
Fair value accounting 
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, 
financial coal (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market and 
recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows:

Total unrealised losses on derivative contracts

(141.8)
Unrealised losses recognised in the income statement are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward foreign 
exchange contracts in both the current and prior year. Currency markets were volatile in 2013, which can be seen on the graph 
on page 39, with the US dollar (in which many of our fuel purchases are denominated) closing 2013 weaker than in 2012. This, 
combined with the significant increase in the volume of currency contracts as we look to secure our sterling cash flows, drives 
the income statement movement. 
Unrealised losses recognised in the hedge reserve reflect principally the fair value changes on our forward foreign exchange 
contracts that are designated in effective hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39. These are predominantly forward 
contracts for the purchase of US and Canadian dollars for highly probable future fuel purchases. 
Fair value measurement 
� Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not 
excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. 
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted 
market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the 
current ask price. 
� Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is 
determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument. 
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to 
contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host 
contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts. 
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: 
Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities; 
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  
The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by 
comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.  
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.  
Other financial instruments 
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables 
and receivables arising from our operations. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents (note 16), short-term investments (note 15), trade and other receivables (note 14), and trade and 
other payables (note 17) generally have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate to their fair 
value. The Group’s borrowings (note 18) relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of 
which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.

Financial risk disclosures 
IFRS require us to provide information that assists you in understanding the nature and extent of risks arising from the 
financial instruments we hold, described in the two previous notes. Such risks include liquidity, credit and counterparty risk. 
We also describe below the wider financial risks that we manage using financial instruments, for example how derivative 
contracts minimise our exposure to commodity market and foreign currency risk. 
Risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign 
currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses 
on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance.  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the 
risk management committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 46) which identify, evaluate and hedge 
financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, 
sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have 
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so. 
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales with corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances 
when profitable to do so. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they 
reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.  
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different 
maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at 
a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.  
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range 
of domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts 
are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of 
CO2 emissions allowances.  
Commodity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items 
at the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.  
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s: 
� profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 would increase/decrease by £6.3 million (2012: increase/decrease 
by £5.4 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to financial coal derivatives; and 
� other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £27.0 million (2012: decrease/increase by £32.0 million) mainly as a result 
of the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power. 
Interest rate risk 
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to 
mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps 
outstanding at the balance sheet date; however this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information 
about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included below. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at 
the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the 
balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.  
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 would decrease/increase by £1.0 million (2012: decrease/increase by £0.2 million) as a 
result of the changes in interest payable during the period.

21. Financial risk disclosures (continued) 
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass 
purchases in US dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros. As we progress our 
biomass transformation plans, we are entering into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange contracts. Exchange 
rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Foreign currency sensitivity 
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s: 
� profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 would decrease/increase by £198.9 million (2012: decrease/increase 
by £86.5 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered into 
in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and 
� other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £49.6 million (2012: decrease/increase by £1.1 million) as a result of the 
changes in the fair value of hedged foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Liquidity risk 
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board 
of directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. 
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding 
for business requirements.  
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include 
both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived 
from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Counterparty risk 
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is 
exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or 
fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.  
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure 
of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or 
increase the risk profile of the Group. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, 
as summarised below:

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £5.6 million (2012: £4.7 million).  
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. 
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company 
guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased 
credit default swaps. 
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage 
credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the 
maturity profile.

Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge reserve), less net cash. Net cash comprises borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash 
and cash equivalents in note 16 and short-term investments in note 15. Equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company 
comprises issued capital, capital reserves, and retained profits, excluding the hedge reserve (see Consolidated statement 
of changes in equity). Maintaining an optimal supporting capital structure is one of the Group’s key priorities, and as such, 
our performance is detailed within Operational and financial performance. The capital structure of the Group is as follows:

Provisions 
We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning, demolishing and remediating our 
generation assets at the end of their useful economic lives. The amount represents the present value (i.e. it is discounted to 
reflect the time value of money) of the expected costs. Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount, and as 
such by their nature are estimated. 
Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value 
of the expected costs. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows 
have built in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant 
and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included 
in interest payable and similar charges.

The initial provision and subsequent estimation increases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and are being 
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs (note 6). 
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis.

Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is principally an accounting adjustment to reflect the tax charges or credits that are expected to arise in the 
future, as a result of differences between the accounting and tax rules relating to certain transactions that happened before 
the end of the current year.  
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset as there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future associated taxable 
profits is probable.  
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £6.1 million at 31 December 2013 
(2012: £4.0 million) in respect of UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income. 
Issued equity 
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares issued, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.  
Maintaining an optimal capital structure… In October 2012 we placed 36.5 million shares (9.9% of our issued capital at that 
time) raising net proceeds, after transaction costs, of £187.7 million to help fund the capital investment required for our biomass 
transformation. During 2013 this cash has driven investment in our US-based supply chain infrastructure, as described in 
Operational and financial performance. 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of 
its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account (note 26) records the difference between the nominal value of shares 
issued and the fair value of the consideration received, unless merger relief criteria within Companies Act (2006) are met, in 
which case the difference is recorded in retained earnings.

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. 
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends. 
Issued under employee share schemes 
On 8 March 2013, a total of 367,438 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of 
the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan granted in 2010. From 1 May 2013 a further 593,026 shares were issued in satisfaction 
of options vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan, also granted in 2010. 
Additionally, on 31 January, 28 March and 11 April a total of 2,669 shares, 2,805 shares and 1,748 shares, respectively, were 
issued on early exercise of options under the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan by three separate individuals whose 
employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement.  
Share-based payments 
We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) for directors and senior 
executives, and the Savings-Related Share Option (“SAYE”) Plan for all qualifying employees. We incur a cost in respect of 
these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the 
number of options outstanding. 
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the relevant 
vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.

Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) 
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership shares in any one tax year. 
Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any Partnership shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with 
the cost of Matching shares borne by the Group. There were no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching share plan 
in 2012, or 2013.

Bonus Matching Plan  
The BMP was introduced in 2009. Under the scheme, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made 
at £nil consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. 
A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an index (determined 
in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years. For awards made from 2011, a proportion of the shares vesting is 
conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2013, 2012 and 2011 
BMP awards of £6.1 million, £5.8 million and £5.5 million, respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan  
In April 2013 participation in the SAYE Plan was offered to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees 
to acquire shares at a price of 493 pence (2012: 410 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price 
determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts. 
The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE Plan of £0.8 million (2012: £0.2 million) is being charged to 
the income statement over the life of the relevant contracts.

The fair value of share-based payment awards was determined as follows: 
SIP – based on price paid at award dates; 
BMP – Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting; and 
SAYE – Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

Share premium and other reserves 
The share premium account reflects amounts received in respect of issued share capital (see note 24) that exceed the 
nominal value of the shares issued. 
Other equity reserves reflect the impact of some of our historical transactions, which are described under the table below.

The capital redemption reserve arose when the Group completed a share buy-back programme in 2007. 
The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005.  
Movements in share premium during 2013 reflect amounts received from the issue of shares under the Group’s employee 
share schemes. 
Hedge reserve 
The hedge reserve is a component of our equity reserves. Changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts for purchases 
and sales of commodities and foreign currencies are recognised here, to the extent that they qualify as effective hedges 
under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature, and we 
take delivery of the associated commodity or currency. 
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties… As described in note 19, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for 
the purpose of commercial hedging; however not all of these contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are recognised in the income 
statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and securing 
market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.�
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow 
hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, 
along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash 
flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the 
hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market 
at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within 
the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. 
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. For FX contracts, this is when the associated foreign 
currency transaction is recognised. Further information in relation to the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is 
included in note 19.

Retirement benefit obligations 
We operate a defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a 
pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled to annual pensions on 
retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension. 
The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, by contrast provides a retirement benefit that is 
dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme. 
The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is twofold – the current/past service cost is the increase in the 
overall liability to pay benefits earned by current employees of the Group in the current/previous periods, the net interest cost 
reflects the unwinding of the pension deficit over time, offset by income earned by the scheme’s assets. 
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group 
in respect of the current period.  
Defined contribution scheme 
The Group operates two defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan and Haven Power Personal 
Pension Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 
Years ended 31 December

As at 31 December 2013, contributions of £0.7 million (2012: £nil) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been 
paid over to the scheme. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
Defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group (“DPG”) section of the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme (“ESPS”). This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through 
being existing members of another part of the ESPS.  
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:  
�
�
Investment risk 
The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Group holds a significant proportion of 
growth assets (equities, hedge funds and property) which, though expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is 
monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Group’s long term objectives. 
Interest rate risk 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the Group’s liabilities, 
although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Group’s bond holdings. 
Longevity risk 
The majority of the Group’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, 
so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme. 
Inflation risk 
The majority of the Group’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation 
will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected or only 
loosely correlated with inflation, meaning an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most 
cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect against extreme inflation. 
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks and other demographic risks. 
The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement. 
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. See note 34 for details. 
The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, as a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 
2010. A valuation with an effective date of 31 March 2013 is currently ongoing. Future valuations are required by law at intervals 
of no more than three years, therefore the next valuation will take place on or before 31 March 2016.

136 Annual report and accounts 2013
 
The initial results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2013, taking into account 
experience over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic 
assumptions. The principal assumptions used are as follows: 
�

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 
3.2 
2.9
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 
4.4 
4.0
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. 
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2013 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years (2012: 26 years) 
after retirement if they are male and for a further 29 years (2012: 28 years) after retirement if they are female. 
Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners (currently aged 45) is assumed to be 28 years 
and 31 years respectively (2012: 27 years and 30 years respectively). 
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair 
value of the plan assets, determined as follows:

(1) Under the Group’s long-term asset strategy, 60% of assets are invested in ‘return generating’ asset classes – of which 5% is invested in emerging market equity. 
The remaining 40% of assets are invested in ‘liability-matching’ asset classes. 
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate and government bonds. Less than 1% has a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower). 
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.  
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical 
markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted 
capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for 
each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme. 
Drax Group plc 
138 Annual report and accounts 2013
 
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have 
a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the 
sensitivity of the pension deficit at 31 December 2013 to changes in these assumptions: 
(Decrease)/Increase in net liability 
£m
0.25 percentage point increase/decrease to: 
Discount rate 
(9.8)/10.2
Inflation rate (RPI)(1) 
8.6/(8.5)
1 year increase/decrease to: 
Life expectancy for men and women 
5.8/(5.9)
(1)� The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation. The impact of corresponding decreases in these variables 
is included here. 
The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional 
contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income. 
The history of experience adjustments is as follows:

The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (70%), former employees of the Group who 
are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (25%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to 
be made, or the duration of the liabilities, is currently 22 years. 
The Group expects to contribute £17.3 million to its pension plans during the 12 months ended 31 December 2014.  
The Company intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the last triennial valuation, over the period to 31 December 2018.

Capital and other financial commitments 
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a certain, contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) 
that are not recorded within our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include 
contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction 
of assets and contracts for the provision of services.  
Delivering our biomass strategy… We have made good progress towards securing near-term volumes of sustainable wood 
pellets and continue with negotiations for long-term supplies, which is reflected in the level of future commitments to 
purchase fuel, set out below.

Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control; 
the payment either cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely. 
Community Energy Saving Programme 
Drax Power Limited (“Drax Power”) was obliged under the Electricity and Gas (Community Energy Saving Programme) Order 
2009 (“CESP”) to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain during 
the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012 (the “Obligation Period”). Drax Power’s obligation was to deliver 895,138 
lifetime tonnes of CO2 savings. It entered into an agreement with a third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged 
to deliver its CESP obligation, for a total cost of £17 million. The third party has failed to comply fully with its obligation under 
the agreement, leaving a significant shortfall against Drax Power’s CESP obligation. Drax Power is considering legal proceedings 
for breach of contract against the third party. 
Drax Power entered into further agreements with additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable. 
Having taken account of the additional measures under those arrangements. the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets 
(“Ofgem”) announced in May 2013 that Drax Power had achieved 37.1% of its CESP target at the end of the obligation period. 
At the same time Ofgem also announced that it was launching an investigation into those companies that had failed to achieve 
their targets, including Drax Power. 
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (“the Authority”) is the enforcement authority in relation to CESP. Subject to the 
findings of Ofgem’s investigation, it will produce a statement of case or decide that there is no case to answer. In the case of the 
former, a recommendation to an enforcement committee of the Authority will be made on enforcement action. The Authority 
has wide powers of enforcement, including issuing a penalty or other means of enforcement. Ofgem has also indicated that a 
settlement committee of the Authority will be established to consider proposals made by obligated parties to settle investigations.

Drax Group plc 
140 Annual report and accounts 2013
 
Representatives of Drax Power had an initial meeting with the Ofgem enforcement team in June 2013, following which it 
received a formal information request. Drax Power is co-operating fully with the investigation and has provided a full response 
to the information request. In January 2014, Drax Power submitted responses to further information requests. Ofgem informed 
Drax Power that it now needed to consider these, and expected to communicate the next steps in the investigation in Autumn 
2014, or earlier if possible. Those next steps will be to issue a statement of case, close the investigation, or update the timeframe 
for doing so. As a result, it is not possible to predict accurately what, if any, enforcement action may be taken at this stage. 
In the absence of any communication on enforcement subject to the findings of the investigation, it is not practicable to 
measure reliably the financial impact, if any. Accordingly no provision has been recognised within the consolidated financial 
statements in relation to this matter. 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (“GMP”) 
The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for 
males. This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 32). At present, the 
methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no 
allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated 
financial statements. 
Related party transactions 
A related party is either an individual with control or significant influence over the Group, or a company that is linked to us by 
investment or a related individual. Our primary related parties are our key management personnel. 
Remuneration of key management personnel 
The remuneration of the directors, who are considered to be the key management personnel of the Group, is set out below 
in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 “Related party disclosures”. Further information about the 
remuneration of individual directors, together with the directors’ interests in the share capital of Drax Group plc, is provided 
in the audited part of the Remuneration Committee report.

Notes to the Company balance sheet 
 
1. Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and law. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below, and have been consistently applied to both years presented. 
Cash flow statement 
The cash flows of the Group are included in the Consolidated cash flow statement of Drax Group plc, whose accounts are 
publicly available. Accordingly, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 “Cash flow statements” not 
to publish a cash flow statement. 
Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption granted by paragraph 3(b) of FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” 
not to disclose transactions with other group companies. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
(A) Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment. 
(B) Financial instruments 
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of 
shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received, unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act (2006) are 
met, in which case the difference is recorded in retained earnings. 
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.  
Short-term investments – Short-term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions, with a maturity 
of greater than three months at inception. 
3. Profit and loss account 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss 
account for the year. The Company’s profit and loss account was approved by the Board on 18 February 2014. Drax Group plc 
reported a profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 of £77.7 million (2012: £99.6 million). 
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking 
and a proportion was re-charged to the Company.  
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £20,000 
(2012: £20,000).

Fixed asset investments relate entirely to subsidiary undertakings of the Company. 
The capital contribution consists of two elements: a £108,806,000 (2012: £4,578,000) capital injection into a subsidiary, and 
£5,756,000 (2012: £4,760,000) in relation to the share-based payment charge associated with the Savings-Related Share 
Option Plan and Bonus Matching Plan schemes, which arises because the beneficiaries of the scheme are employed by 
subsidiary companies. For more information see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

Shareholder information 
 
Beneficial owners and “information rights” 
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, 
receive information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. In order for this to happen, you must contact the third 
party registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications by beneficial owners of shares where the shares are 
held by third party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder and not to Drax or Equiniti. 
ShareGift 
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing 
to dispose charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no 
capital gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. 
Further information can be obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org. 
Share frauds (“Boiler room scams”) 
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message 
in the correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. At the time 
of this report, the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such as those 
outlined are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. Below is the advice from the Financial 
Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).  
Beware of share fraud  
Fraudster use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if 
you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.  
How to avoid share fraud  
� Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.�
� Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.�
� Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA. 
� Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.�
� Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.�
� Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.�
� Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.�
� Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.�
� Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money. �
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!  
Report a scam  
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, 
where you can find out more about investment scams.  
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.  
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.��
