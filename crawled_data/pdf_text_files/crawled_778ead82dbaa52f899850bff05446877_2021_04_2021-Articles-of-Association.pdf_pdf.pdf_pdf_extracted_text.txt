any existing shares, any shares may be allotted or issued with, or have attached to them, such 
preferred, deferred or other rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, transfer,

5 
Allotment 
5.1 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts and to any relevant authority of the Company 
required by the Companies Acts, the Board may allot (with or without conferring rights of 
renunciation), grant options over, offer or otherwise deal with or dispose of any new shares or 
rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares, to such persons (including the 
Directors themselves), at such times and generally on such terms and conditions as the Board 
may decide, provided that no share shall be issued at a discount to its nominal value. 
5.2 
The Board may, at any time after the allotment of any share but before any person has been 
entered in the Register as the holder, recognise a renunciation thereof by the allottee in favour of 
some other person and accord to any allottee of a share a right to effect such renunciation and/or 
allow the rights represented thereby to be one or more participating securities, in each case upon

6

Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts and to any special rights for the time being

and in such manner as these Articles may provide or the Directors may determine.

brokerage may be satisfied by the payment of cash, the allotment of fully or partly paid shares,

8 
Trusts not to be recognised 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by these Articles, as required by law or as ordered by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not recognise any person as holding any 
share on any trust, and the Company shall not be bound by or required in any way to recognise 
(even when having notice of it) any equitable, contingent, future, partial or other claim to or 
interest in any shares other than an absolute right of the holder to the whole of the share. 
9 
Certificated and uncertificated shares 
9.1 
Notwithstanding anything in these Articles to the contrary, any shares in the Company may be 
issued, held, registered, converted to, transferred or otherwise dealt with in certificated or in 
uncertificated form and converted from uncertificated form to certificated form in accordance with 
the Regulations and practices instituted by the Operator of the relevant system.  The provisions 
of these Articles shall not apply to any uncertificated shares to the extent that such provisions are 
inconsistent with:

9.1.2 
the transfer of title to shares by means of the relevant system; or 
9.1.3 
any provision of the Regulations.

Without prejudice to the generality and effectiveness of the foregoing: 
9.2.1 
references in these Articles to a requirement on any person to execute or deliver an instrument 
of transfer or certificate or other document shall, in the case of uncertificated shares, be treated 
as references to a requirement to comply with any relevant requirements of the relevant system 
and any relevant arrangements or regulations which the Board may make from time to time 
pursuant to Article 9.2.4; 
9.2.2 
the Company shall enter on the Register the number of shares which are held by each member 
in uncertificated form and in certificated form and shall, in the case of uncertificated shares, 
maintain the Register in each case as is required by the Regulations and the relevant system 
and, unless the Board otherwise determines, holdings of the same holder or joint holders of 
shares in certificated form and in uncertificated form shall be treated as separate holdings but 
where such holdings are in the same form, they shall be treated as a single holding; 
9.2.3 
a class of share shall not be treated as two classes by virtue only of that class comprising both 
certificated shares and uncertificated shares or as a result of any provision of these Articles or 
the Regulations which applies only in respect of certificated shares or uncertificated shares; 
9.2.4 
the Board may make such arrangements or regulations (if any) as it may from time to time in its 
absolute discretion think fit in relation to the evidencing and transfer of uncertificated shares and 
otherwise for the purpose of implementing and/or supplementing the provisions of these Articles 
in relation to uncertificated shares and the Regulations and the facilities and requirements of the 
relevant system and such arrangements and regulations (as the case may be) shall have the 
same effect as if set out in these Articles;  
9.2.5 
the Board may utilise the relevant system to the fullest extent available from time to time in the 
exercise of the Company’s powers or functions under the Companies Acts or these Articles or 
otherwise in effecting any actions; and 
9.2.6 
the Board may resolve that a class of shares is to become a participating security and may at 
any time determine that a class of shares shall cease to be a participating security.

Where any class of shares in the capital of the Company is a participating security and the 
Company is entitled under any provisions of the Companies Acts or the rules made and practices 
instituted by the Operator of any relevant system or under these Articles to dispose of, forfeit, 
enforce a lien or sell or otherwise procure the sale of any shares which are held in uncertificated 
form, such entitlement (to the extent permitted by the Regulations and the rules made and 
practices instituted by the Operator of the relevant system and subject to the arrangements and 
regulations referred to in Article 9.2.4) shall include the right to: 
9.3.1 
request or require the deletion of any computer-based entries in the relevant system relating to 
the holding of such shares in uncertificated form; and/or 
9.3.2 
require any holder of any uncertificated shares which are the subject of any exercise by the 
Company of any such entitlement, by notice in writing to the holder concerned, to change his 
holding of such uncertificated shares into certificated form within such period as may be 
specified in the notice, prior to completion of any disposal, sale or transfer of such shares, or 
direct the holder to take such steps (by instructions given by means of the relevant system or 
otherwise) as may be necessary to dispose of, sell or transfer such shares; and/or 
9.3.3 
appoint any person to take such other steps (by instructions given by means of the relevant 
system or otherwise) in the name of the holder of such shares as may be required to effect a 
transfer of such shares and such steps shall be as effective as if they had been taken by the 
registered holder of the uncertificated shares concerned; and/or 
9.3.4 
transfer any uncertificated shares which are the subject of any exercise by the Company of any 
such entitlement by entering the name of the transferee in the Register in respect of that share 
as a transferred share; and/or 
9.3.5 
otherwise rectify or change the Register in respect of that share in such manner as may be 
appropriate; and 
9.3.6 
take such other action as may be necessary to enable those shares to be registered in the 
name of the person to whom the shares have been disposed of, sold or transferred or as 
directed by him.  
9.4 
The Company shall be entitled to assume that the entries on any record of securities maintained 
by it in accordance with the Regulations and regularly reconciled with the relevant Operator 
register of securities are a complete and accurate reproduction of the particulars entered in the 
Operator register of securities and shall accordingly not be liable in respect of any act or thing 
done or omitted to be done by or on behalf of the Company in reliance on such assumptions.  In 
particular, any provision of these Articles which requires or envisages that action will be taken in 
reliance on information contained in the Register shall be construed so as to permit that action to 
be taken in reliance on information contained in any relevant record of securities (as so 
maintained and reconciled). 
SHARE CERTIFICATES 
10 
Right to certificates 
10.1 
On becoming the holder of any share in certificated form, every person (except a recognised 
person in respect of whom the Company is not by law required to complete and have ready for 
delivery a certificate) shall be entitled, without charge, to have issued within two months after 
allotment or lodgement of a transfer (unless the terms of issue of the shares provide otherwise) 
one certificate for all of the shares of that class registered in his name.  Such certificate shall 
specify the number and class of the shares in respect of which it is issued and the amount or 
respective amounts paid up thereon. 
10.2 
The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate in respect of shares held 
jointly by two or more persons.  Delivery of a certificate to the person first named on the Register 
shall be sufficient delivery to all joint holders. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 11 - 
10.3 
Where a member (other than a recognised person) has transferred part only of the shares 
comprised in a certificate, he shall be entitled without charge to a certificate for the balance of 
such shares. Where a member receives more shares of any class, he shall be entitled without 
charge to a certificate for the extra shares of that class. 
10.4 
No certificate shall be issued representing shares of more than one class or in respect of shares 
held by a recognised person. 
10.5 
This Article 10 does not apply to uncertificated shares. 
11 
Replacement certificates 
11.1 
Any two or more certificates representing shares of any one class held by any member may at 
his request be cancelled and a single new certificate for such shares issued in lieu without 
charge on surrender of the original certificates for cancellation. 
11.2 
If any member shall surrender for cancellation a share certificate representing shares held by him 
and request the Company to issue in lieu thereof two or more share certificates representing 
such shares in such proportions as he may specify, the Board may, if it thinks fit, comply with 
such request. 
11.3 
Share certificates may be renewed or replaced on such terms as to provision of evidence and 
indemnity (with or without security) and to payment of any exceptional out of pocket expenses, 
including those incurred by the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such 
indemnity and security, as the Board may decide, and on surrender of the original certificate 
(where it is defaced, damaged or worn out), but without any further charge. 
11.4 
In the case of shares held jointly by several persons, any such request as is mentioned in this 
Article 11 may be made by any one of the joint holders. 
11.5 
This Article 11 does not apply to uncertificated shares. 
12 
Share Certificates Sent at Holder’s Risk 
12.1 
Every share certificate sent in accordance with these Articles will be sent at the risk of the 
member or other person entitled to the certificate.  The Company will not be responsible for any 
share certificate lost or delayed in the course of delivery. 
LIEN ON SHARES 
13 
Lien on shares not fully paid 
The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on each of its shares which is not fully paid, 
for all amounts payable to the Company (whether presently or not) in respect of that share to 
the extent and in the circumstances permitted by the Companies Acts.  The Board may waive 
any lien which has arisen and may resolve that any share shall be exempt wholly or partially 
from the provisions of this Article 13. 
14 
Enforcement of lien by sale 
The Board may sell all or any of the shares subject to any lien at such time or times and in such 
manner as it may determine.  However, no sale shall be made until such time as any money in 
respect of which such lien exists is presently payable or the liability or engagement in respect of 
which such lien exists is liable to be presently fulfilled or discharged, and until notice in writing 
shall have been served on the holder or the person (if any) entitled by transmission to the 
shares, demanding the amount due or specifying the liability or engagement and demanding 
payment or fulfilment or discharge thereof and giving notice of intention to sell if default in 
payment, fulfilment or discharge shall continue for 14 clear days after service of such notice.  
For giving effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person to execute an 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 12 - 
instrument of transfer of the shares sold in the name and on behalf of the holder or the person 
(if any) entitled by transmission in favour of the purchaser or as the purchaser may direct.  The 
purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of any purchase consideration nor shall 
his title to the shares be affected by any act, omission, irregularity or invalidity relating to or 
connected with the proceedings in reference to the sale. 
15 
Application of proceeds of sale 
The net proceeds of any sale of shares subject to any lien, after payment of the expenses of 
sale, shall be applied in or towards satisfaction of so much of the amount due to the Company 
or of the liability or engagement (as the case may be) as is presently payable or is liable to be 
presently fulfilled or discharged.  The balance (if any) shall (on surrender to the Company for 
cancellation of the certificate for the shares sold, and subject to a like lien for any money not 
presently payable or any liability or engagement not liable to be presently fulfilled or discharged 
as existed on the shares before the sale) be paid (without interest) to the holder or the person (if 
any) entitled by transmission to the shares so sold. 
CALLS ON SHARES 
16 
Calls 
Subject to the terms of allotment of shares, the Board may from time to time make calls on the 
members in respect of any money unpaid on the shares of any class held by them respectively 
(whether in respect of nominal value or premium) and not payable on a date fixed by or in 
accordance with the terms of issue.  A call may be required to be paid by instalments.  Each 
member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days' notice specifying when and where 
payment is to be made and whether or not by instalments) be liable to pay the amount of every 
call so made on him as required by the notice.  A call shall be deemed to have been made at 
the time when the resolution of the Board authorising such call was passed or (as the case may 
require) any person to whom power has been delegated pursuant to these Articles serves 
notice of exercise of such power.  A call may, before receipt by the Company of any sum due 
thereunder, be either revoked or postponed in whole or part as regards all or any such 
members as the Board may determine.  A person on whom a call is made shall remain jointly 
and severally liable with the successors in title to the shares held by that person for all calls 
made upon that person notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of 
which the call was made.   
17 
Liability of joint holders 
The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of all calls in 
respect thereof. 
18 
Interest on calls 
If the whole of the sum payable in respect of any call is not paid on or before the day appointed 
for payment, the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay all costs, charges and 
expenses that the Company may have incurred by reason of such non-payment, together with 
interest on the unpaid amount from the day appointed for payment thereof to the day of 
payment (both days inclusive) at the rate fixed by the terms of the allotment of the share or in 
the notice of the call or, if no rate is so fixed, at 15 per cent per annum (or such lower rate as 
the Board may determine).  The Board may waive payment of such costs, charges, expenses or 
interest in whole or in part. 
19 
Rights of member when call unpaid 
Unless the Board otherwise determines, no member shall be entitled to receive any dividend or 
to be present and vote at a general meeting or at any separate general meeting of the holders 
of any class of shares either in person or (save as proxy for another member) by proxy, or be 
reckoned in a quorum, or to exercise any other right or privilege as a member in respect of a 
share held by him unless and until he shall have paid all calls for the time being due and 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 13 - 
payable by  him in respect of that share, whether alone or jointly with any other person, together 
with interest and expenses (if any) payable by such member to the Company.   
20 
 Sums due on allotment treated as calls 
Any sum payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of 
the nominal value of the share or by way of premium or as an instalment of a call, shall for the 
purposes of these Articles be deemed to be a call duly made.  If it is not paid, the provisions of 
these Articles shall apply as if such amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call. 
21 
Power to differentiate 
The Board may make arrangements on the allotment or issue of shares for a difference as 
between the allottees or holders of such shares in the amount and time of payment of calls. 
22 
Payment in advance of calls 
The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any 
part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid on the shares held by him.  Such payment in advance 
of calls shall extinguish pro tanto the liability on the shares in respect of which it is made. The 
Company may pay interest on the money paid in advance, or so much of it as exceeds the 
amount for the time being called up on the shares in respect of which such advance has been 
made, at such rate as the Board may decide.  The Board may at any time repay the amount so 
advanced on giving to such member not less than three months' notice in writing of its intention 
to do so, unless before the expiration of such notice the amount so advanced shall have been 
called up on the shares in respect of which it was advanced.  
FORFEITURE OF SHARES 
23 
Notice if call not paid 
If any member fails to pay the whole or any part of any call or any instalment of any call on or 
before the day appointed for payment, the Board may at any time serve a notice in writing on 
such member or on any person entitled to the shares by transmission, requiring payment, on a 
date not less than 14 clear days from the date of the notice, of the amount unpaid and any 
interest which may have accrued thereon and any costs, charges and expenses incurred by the 
Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice shall name the place where the payment 
is to be made and state that, if the notice is not complied with, the shares in respect of which 
such call was made will be liable to be forfeited. 
24 
Forfeiture for non-compliance 
If the notice referred to in Article 23 is not complied with, any share in respect of which it was 
given may, at any time before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited 
by a resolution of the Board to that effect which shall state the date of forfeiture.  Such forfeiture 
shall include all dividends declared or other money payable in respect of the forfeited shares 
and not paid before the forfeiture. 
25 
Notice after forfeiture 
When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be served on the person who 
was before forfeiture the holder of the share or the person entitled to such share by 
transmission (as the case may be).  An entry of such notice having been given and of the 
forfeiture with the date thereof shall forthwith be made in the Register in respect of such share.  
However, no forfeiture shall be invalidated by any omission to give such notice or to make such 
entry as aforesaid. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 14 - 
26 
Forfeiture may be annulled 
The Board may, at any time before any share so forfeited has been cancelled or sold, re-allotted 
or otherwise disposed of, annul the forfeiture, on the terms that payment shall be made of all 
calls and interest due thereon and all expenses incurred in respect of the share and on such 
further terms (if any) as the Board shall see fit. 
27 
Surrender 
The Board may accept a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited. In such case, references 
in these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrender. 
28 
Disposal of forfeited shares 
Every share which is forfeited shall on forfeiture become the property of the Company.  Subject 
to the provisions of the Companies Acts, any forfeited share may be sold, re-allotted or 
otherwise disposed of, either to the person who was the holder before forfeiture or otherwise 
entitled to the share, or to any other person, on such terms and in such manner as the Board 
shall determine.  The Board may, for the purposes of the disposal, authorise some person to 
transfer the share in question and may enter the name of the transferee in respect of the 
transferred share in the Register, notwithstanding the absence of any share certificate being 
lodged in respect of the share and may issue a new certificate to the transferee.  An instrument 
of transfer executed by that person shall be as effective as if it had been executed by (as the 
case may be) the holder (if any) of, or the person entitled by transmission to, the share.  The 
Company may receive the consideration (if any) given for the share on its disposal. 
29 
Effect of forfeiture 
A shareholder whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the 
shares forfeited and shall, in the case of a holder of certificated shares, surrender to the 
Company for cancellation the certificate for such shares.  He shall nevertheless be liable to pay 
to the Company all calls made and not paid on such shares at the time of forfeiture, and interest 
thereon at 15 per cent per annum (or such lower rate as the Board may determine) from the 
date of the forfeiture to the date of payment (both dates inclusive), in the same manner in all 
respects as if the shares had not been forfeited, and to satisfy all (if any) claims, demands and 
liabilities which the Company might have enforced in respect of the shares at the time of 
forfeiture, without any reduction or allowance for the value of the shares at the time of forfeiture 
or for any consideration received on their disposal. 
30 
Extinction of claims 
The forfeiture of a share shall involve the extinction at the time of forfeiture of all interest in and 
all claims and demands against the Company in respect of the share and all other rights and 
liabilities incidental to the share as between the holder if any whose share is forfeited or the 
person entitled by transmission to the forfeited share (as the case may be) and the Company, 
except only such of those rights and liabilities as are by these Articles expressly saved, or as 
are by the Companies Acts given or imposed in the case of past members. 
31 
Evidence of forfeiture 
A statutory declaration by a Director or the Secretary that a share has been forfeited in 
pursuance of these Articles, and stating the date on which it was forfeited, shall, as against all 
persons claiming to be entitled to that share, be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated.  
The declaration, together with the receipt by the Company for the consideration (if any) given for 
the share on the sale or disposition thereof and a certificate for the share delivered to the 
person to whom the same is sold or disposed of, shall (subject if necessary to the execution of 
an instrument of transfer) constitute a good title to the share.  Subject to the execution of any 
necessary transfer, such person shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall be 
discharged from all calls made prior to such sale or disposition and shall not be bound to see to 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 15 - 
the application of any purchase consideration, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any 
act, omission, irregularity or invalidity relating to or connected with the proceedings in reference 
to the forfeiture or disposal of the share.  Such person shall not (except by express agreement 
with the Company) become entitled to any dividend which might have accrued on the share 
before the completion of the sale or disposition thereof. 
DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS 
32 
Failure to disclose interests in shares 
32.1 
Where a member, or any other person interested in shares held by that member, has been 
issued with a notice pursuant to the Companies Acts requiring such person to provide information 
about his interests in the Company’s shares (a Section 793 Notice) and has failed in relation to 
any shares (the default shares, which expression includes any shares issued after the date of 
such notice in respect of those shares) to give the Company the information required within the 
prescribed period from the service of the notice, the following sanctions shall apply unless the 
Board otherwise determines: 
32.1.1 
the member shall not be entitled (in respect of the default shares) to be present or to vote 
(either in person or by representative or by proxy) at any general meeting or at any separate 
meeting of the holders of any class of shares or on any poll, or to exercise any other right 
conferred by membership in relation to any such meeting or poll; and 
32.1.2 
where the default shares represent at least 0.25 per cent in nominal value of the issued shares 
of their class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares): 
(a) any dividend or other money payable in respect of the shares shall be withheld by the 
Company, which shall not have any obligation to pay interest on it, and the member 
shall not be entitled to elect, pursuant to Article 140 (Payment of scrip dividends), to 
receive shares instead of that dividend; and 
(b) no transfer (other than an excepted transfer) of any shares held by the member shall be 
registered unless: 
(i) 
the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information 
required; and 
(ii) 
the member proves to the satisfaction of the Board that no person in default as 
regards supplying such information is interested in any of the shares the subject 
of the transfer. 
32.2 
For the purposes of Article 32.1.2, the Board may only exercise its discretion not to register a 
transfer of shares in uncertificated form if permitted to do so by the Regulations, and it may 
determine to treat shares of a member in certificated and uncertificated form as separate 
holdings and apply the sanctions only to the former or to the latter or make different provisions for 
the former and the latter. 
32.3 
Where the sanctions under Article 32.1 apply in relation to any shares, they shall cease to have 
effect (and any dividends withheld under Article 32.1.2 shall become payable): 
32.3.1 
if the shares are transferred by means of an excepted transfer but only in relation to the shares 
transferred; or 
32.3.2 
at the end of a period of seven days (or such shorter period as the Board may determine) 
following receipt by the Company of the information required by the Section 793 Notice and the 
Board being satisfied that such information is full and complete. 
32.4 
Where, on the basis of information obtained from a member in respect of any share held by him, 
the Company issues a Section 793 Notice to any other person, it shall at the same time send a 
copy of the Section 793 Notice to the member, but the accidental omission to do so, or the 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 16 - 
non-receipt by the member of the copy, shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the application of 
Article 32.1. 
32.5 
Where default shares in which a person appears to be interested are held by a Depositary, the 
provisions of this Article 32 shall be treated as applying only to those shares held by the 
Depositary in which such person appears to be interested and not (insofar as such person's 
apparent interest is concerned) to any other shares held by the Depositary. 
32.6 
Where the member on which a Section 793 Notice is served is a Depositary acting in its capacity 
as such, the obligations of the Depositary as a member of the Company shall be limited to 
disclosing to the Company such information relating to any person appearing to be interested in 
the shares held by it as has been recorded by it pursuant to the arrangements under which it was 
appointed as a Depositary. 
32.7 
For the purposes of this Article 32: 
32.7.1 
a person, other than the member holding a share, shall be treated as appearing to be interested 
in that share if the member has informed the Company that the person is, or may be, so 
interested, or if the Company (after taking account of any information obtained from the member 
or, pursuant to a Section 793 Notice, from anyone else) knows or has reasonable cause to 
believe that the person is, or may be, so interested; 
32.7.2 
interested shall be construed as it is for the purpose of Section 793 CA 2006; 
32.7.3 
reference to a person having failed to give the Company the information required by a Section 
793 Notice, or being in default as regards supplying such information, includes, without 
limitation, reference: 
(a) to his having failed or refused to give all or any part of it; and 
(b) to his having given information which he knows to be false in a material particular or his 
having recklessly given information which is false in a material particular; 
32.7.4 
prescribed period means 14 days; 
32.7.5 
excepted transfer means, in relation to any shares held by a member: 
(a) a transfer by way of or pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer for the Company 
(within the meaning of the Companies Acts); or 
(b) a transfer in consequence of a sale made through a recognised investment exchange or 
any other stock exchange outside the United Kingdom on which the Company's shares 
are normally traded; or 
(c) a transfer which is shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be made in consequence of 
a bona fide sale of the whole of the beneficial interest in the shares to a person who is 
unconnected with the member or with any other person appearing to be interested in 
the shares.  For the purposes of this sub-paragraph (c), any associate (as defined in the 
Insolvency Act 1986) shall be included in the class of persons who are connected with 
the member or any person interested in such shares.  
32.8 
Nothing contained in this Article 32 shall be taken to limit the powers of the Company under the 
Companies Acts to apply to the court for an order imposing restrictions on a person’s shares.  
UNTRACED MEMBERS 
33 
Power of sale 
33.1 
The Company shall be entitled to sell at the best price reasonably obtainable any share of a 
member, or any share to which a person is entitled by transmission, if and provided that: 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 17 - 
33.1.1 
during the period of 12 years immediately prior to the date on which a notice referred to in 
Article 33.1.2 is sent to that person (the relevant period), the Company has paid at least three 
cash dividends (whether interim or final) on the share and no cash dividend payable on the 
share has either been claimed or cashed;  
33.1.2 
on or after expiry of the relevant period, the Company has sent a notice to that person’s last 
known address or the address at which service of notices may be effected under these Articles, 
giving notice of its intention to sell the shares. Before sending such notice, the company must 
have used such efforts as it considers reasonable to trace the relevant holder or person entitled 
by transmission; and 
33.1.3 
during the further period of three months following the date on which the notice was sent to that 
person, the Company has not received any communication in respect of such share from the 
member or person entitled by transmission. 
33.2 
To give effect to any sale of shares pursuant to this Article 33, the Board may authorise some 
person to transfer the shares in question and may enter the name of the transferee in respect of 
the transferred shares in the Register, notwithstanding the absence of any share certificate being 
lodged in respect thereof, and may issue a new certificate to the transferee.  An instrument of 
transfer executed by that person shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the holder of, 
or the person entitled by transmission to, the shares.  The purchaser shall not be bound to see to 
the application of any purchase consideration, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any 
act, omission, irregularity or invalidity relating to or connected with the proceedings in reference 
to the sale. 
33.3 
If, during the relevant period referred to in Article 33.1 or during any period ending on the date 
when all the requirements of Articles 33.1.1 to 33.1.3 have been satisfied, any additional shares 
have been issued in respect of those held at the beginning of, or previously so issued during, any 
such period and all the requirements of Articles  33.1.2 to 33.1.3 have been satisfied in regard to 
such additional shares, the Company shall also be entitled to sell the additional shares.  
34 
Application of proceeds of sale 
The net proceeds of sale shall belong to the Company which shall account to the member or 
other person entitled to such share for an amount equal to such net proceeds by carrying all 
money in respect thereof to a separate account.  The Company shall be deemed to be a debtor 
to, and not a trustee for, such member or other person in respect of such money.  Money 
carried to such separate account may either be employed in the business of the Company or 
invested in such investments as the Board may from time to time think fit.  No interest shall be 
payable to such member or other person in respect of such money and the Company shall not 
be required to account for any interest earned thereon. If no valid claim for the money has been 
received by the Company during a period of two years (or such other period as the Board may 
decide) from the date on which the relevant shares were sold by the Company under this Article 
34, the money will be forfeited and will belong to the Company. 
TRANSFER OF SHARES 
35 
Form of transfer 
Subject to such of the restrictions of these Articles as may be applicable, each member may 
transfer all or any of his shares which are in certificated form by instrument of transfer in writing 
in any usual form or in any form approved by the Board.  Such instrument shall be executed by 
or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer of a share which is not fully paid up) 
by or on behalf of the transferee.  The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such 
share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect of it.  All instruments 
of transfer which are registered may be retained by the Company. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 18 - 
36 
Right to refuse registration 
36.1 
The Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register any transfer of a share (or 
renunciation of a renounceable letter of allotment) unless: 
36.1.1 
it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up; 
36.1.2 
it is in respect of only one class of shares; 
36.1.3 
it is in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees; 
36.1.4 
it is duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty (if so required); and 
36.1.5 
it is delivered for registration to the Office or such other place as the Board may from time to 
time determine, accompanied (except in the case of (a) a transfer by a recognised person 
where a certificate has not been issued, (b) a transfer of an uncertificated share or (c) a 
renunciation) by the certificate for the share to which it relates and such other evidence as the 
Board may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor or person renouncing and the 
due execution of the transfer or renunciation by him or, if the transfer or renunciation is 
executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person to do so, 
provided that the Board shall not refuse to register a transfer or renunciation of a partly paid 
share on the grounds that it is partly paid in circumstances where such refusal would prevent 
dealings in such share from taking place on an open and proper basis on the market on which 
such share is admitted to trading. 
36.2 
Without prejudice to Article 36.1, the Board may refuse to register a transfer of an uncertificated 
share in such other circumstances as may be permitted or required by the Regulations and the 
relevant system. 
36.3 
Transfers of shares will not be registered in the circumstances referred to in Article 32 (Failure to 
disclose interests in shares).   
37 
Notice of and reasons for refusal 
37.1 
If the Board refuses to register a transfer of a share it shall, as soon as practicable and in any 
event within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send 
notice of the refusal to the transferee.  At the same time as it sends the transferee notice of the 
refusal to register a transfer, the Board will provide the transferee with its reasons for the refusal.  
Any instrument of transfer which the Board refuses to register shall (except in the case of 
suspected or actual fraud) be returned to the person depositing it.   
37.2 
The first sentence of Article 37.1 applies to uncertificated shares as if the reference to the date 
on which the transfer was lodged with the Company were a reference to the date on which the 
appropriate instruction was received by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with the 
facilities and requirements of the relevant system.  The second and third sentences of Article 
37.1 do not apply to uncertificated shares. 
38 
Fees on registration 
No fee shall be charged for registration of a transfer or on the registration of any probate, letters 
of administration, certificate of death or marriage, power of attorney, notice or other instrument 
relating to or affecting the title to any shares.  
39 
Other powers in relation to transfers 
Nothing in these Articles shall preclude the Board from recognising a renunciation of the 
allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person or from authorising any 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 19 - 
person to transfer that share in accordance with any procedures implemented pursuant to 
Article 14 (Enforcement of lien by sale). 
TRANSMISSION OF SHARES 
40 
On death 
If a member dies, the survivors or survivor, where he was a joint holder, and his executors or 
administrators, where he was a sole or the only survivor of joint holders, shall be the only 
persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his shares. Nothing in these 
Articles shall release the estate of a deceased member from any liability in respect of any share 
which has been solely or jointly held by him. 
41 
Election of person entitled by transmission 
41.1 
Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of any 
member, or of any other event giving rise to a transmission of such entitlement by operation of 
law, may, on such evidence as to his title being produced as the Board may require, elect either 
to become registered as a member or to have some person nominated by him registered as a 
member.  If he elects to become registered himself, he shall give notice to the Company to that 
effect.  If he elects to have some other person registered, he shall execute an instrument of 
transfer of such share to that person. All the provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer of 
shares shall apply to the notice or instrument of transfer (as the case may be) as if it were an 
instrument of transfer executed by the member and his death, bankruptcy or other event as 
aforesaid had not occurred.  Where the entitlement of a person to a share in consequence of the 
death or bankruptcy of a member or of any other event giving rise to its transmission by operation 
of law is proved to the satisfaction of the Board, the Board shall within two months after such 
proof cause the entitlement of that person to be noted in the Register. 
41.2 
For the purposes referred to in Article 41.1, a person entitled by transmission to a share in 
uncertificated form who elects to have some other person registered shall either: 
41.2.1 
procure that instructions are given by means of the relevant system to effect the transfer of such 
uncertificated share to that person; or 
41.2.2 
change the uncertificated share into certificated form and execute an instrument of transfer of 
that certificated share in favour of that person. 
42 
Rights on transmission 
Where a person becomes entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of any 
member, or of any other event giving rise to a transmission of such entitlement by operation of 
law, the rights of the holder in relation to such share shall cease.  However, the person so 
entitled may give a good discharge for any dividends and other money payable in respect of it 
and shall have the same rights to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of the share, 
except that he shall not, before he is registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in respect 
of it to receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any meeting of the Company or at any separate 
meeting of the holders of any class of shares.  The Board may at any time give notice requiring 
any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share.  If the notice is 
not complied with within 60 days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends 
and other money payable in respect of such share until the requirements of the notice have 
been complied with. 
ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL 
 
 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 20 - 
43 
Sub-division and Fractions 
43.1 
Whenever as the result of any consolidation, division or sub-division or redenomination of shares 
any holders would become entitled to fractions of a share, the Board may, on behalf of those 
holders would become entitled to fractions of a share, deal with the fractions as it thinks fit 
including by aggregating and selling them or by dealing with them in some other way.   
43.2 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Board may treat shares of a holder in 
certificated form and in uncertificated form as separate holdings in giving effect to sub-divisions 
and/or consolidations and may cause any shares arising on sub-division or consolidation and 
representing fractional entitlements to be entered in the Register as shares in certificated form 
where this is desirable to facilitate the sale thereof.   
43.3 
For the purposes of any sale of consolidated shares pursuant to Article 43.1, the Board may 
authorise a person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with, 
the directions of the purchaser, and the transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of 
any purchase consideration, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any act, omission, 
irregularity or invalidity relating to or connected with the proceedings in reference to the sale.  In 
respect of uncertificated shares, the Board may authorise some person to transfer and/or require 
the holder to transfer the relevant shares in accordance with the facilities and requirements of the 
relevant system. 
43.4 
Any resolution authorising the Company to sub-divide its shares or any of them may determine 
that, as between the shares resulting from the sub-division, any of them may have any 
preference, advantage or deferred or other right or be subject to any restriction as compared with 
the others. 
VARIATION OF CLASS RIGHTS 
44 
Sanction to variation 
If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into shares of different classes, any of 
the rights for the time being attached to any shares (whether or not the Company may be or is 
about to be wound up) may from time to time be varied or abrogated in such manner (if any) as 
may be provided in these Articles by such rights or, in the absence of any such provision, either 
with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the 
issued shares of the relevant class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) 
or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders 
of shares of the class duly convened and held in accordance with the Companies Acts.  
45 
Class meetings 
All the provisions in these Articles as to general meetings shall, with any necessary 
modifications, apply equally to every meeting of the holders of any class of shares.  The Board 
may convene a meeting of the holders of any class of shares whenever it thinks fit and whether 
or not the business to be transacted involves a variation or abrogation of class rights.  The 
quorum at every such meeting shall be not less than two persons present (in person or by 
proxy) holding at least one-third of the nominal amount paid up on the issued shares of the 
relevant class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) provided that a 
person present by proxy is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxy is 
authorised to exercise voting rights.  Every holder of shares of the class (other than a holder of 
treasury shares), present in person or by proxy, may demand a poll.  If at any adjourned 
meeting of such holders a quorum is not present, one person holding shares of the relevant 
class (whatever the number of shares held by him but excluding any shares of that class held 
as treasury shares) who is present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum. 
46 
Deemed variation 
Subject to the terms of issue of or rights attached to any shares, the rights for the time being 
attached to any shares shall not be deemed to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 21 - 
of any new shares ranking pari passu in all respects (save as to the date from which such new 
shares shall rank for dividend) with or subsequent to those already issued or by the reduction of 
the capital paid up on such shares or by the purchase or redemption by the Company of its own 
shares or the sale of any shares held as treasury shares in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Acts and these Articles. 
MEETINGS OF MEMBERS 
47 
Annual general meetings 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, annual general meetings shall be held at such 
time and place as the Board may determine. 
48 
Convening of general meeting other than annual general meeting 
48.1 
The Board may convene a general meeting, other than an annual general meeting, whenever it 
thinks fit.  If there are within the United Kingdom insufficient members of the Board to convene 
such a general meeting, any Director may call such a general meeting. 
48.2 
At any general meeting convened on a members’ requisition or by the requisitionists no business 
shall be transacted except that stated by the requisition or proposed by the Board.   
49 
Notice of general meetings 
49.1 
A general meeting shall be convened by such notice as may be required by law from time to time. 
49.2 
The notice of any general meeting shall include such statements as are required by the 
Companies Acts and shall in any event specify: 
49.2.1 
whether the meeting is convened as an annual general meeting or any other general meeting; 
49.2.2 
the place, the day and the time of the meeting; 
49.2.3 
the general nature of the business to be transacted at the meeting; 
49.2.4 
if the meeting is convened to consider a special resolution, the text of the resolution and the 
intention to propose the resolution as such; and 
49.2.5 
with reasonable prominence, that a member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint one 
or (provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share held by 
the member) more proxies to attend and to speak and vote instead of him and that a proxy need 
not also be a member. 
49.3 
The notice shall be given to the members (other than any who, under the provisions of these 
Articles or of any restrictions imposed on any shares, are not entitled to receive notice from the 
Company), to the Directors and to the Auditors and to any other person who may be entitled to 
receive it. 
50 
Participation in General Meetings 
50.1 
The Board may make any arrangements it decides fit to allow those entitled to do so to attend 
and participate in any general meeting. 
50.2 
Unless the notice of meeting says otherwise or the Chair of the meeting decides otherwise, a 
general meeting will be treated as taking place where the Chair of the meeting is at the time of 
the meeting.  
50.3 
Two or more persons who may not be in the same place as each other attend and participate in a 
general meeting if they are able to exercise their rights to speak and vote at that meeting. A 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 22 - 
person is able to exercise the right to speak at a meeting if that person can communicate to all 
those attending the meeting while the meeting is taking place. A person is able to exercise the 
right to vote at a meeting if that person can vote on resolutions put to the meeting (or, in relation 
to a poll, can vote within the required time frame) and that person’s vote can be taken into 
account in deciding whether or not such resolutions are passed at the same time as the votes of 
others attending the meeting.  
50.4 
When deciding whether a person is attending or participating in a meeting by means of an 
electronic facility, it is immaterial where that person is or how that person is able to communicate 
with others who are attending and participating. 
50.5 
Where holders of, and persons entitled by transmission to, shares can participate at a general 
meeting by means of an electronic facility, any document required to be on display or available 
for inspection will be made available for the required period in electronic form to those persons 
entitled to inspect it and this will satisfy any such requirement. 
51 
Electronic Facilities and Satellite Meetings 
51.1 
The Board may decide to let persons entitled to attend and participate in a meeting to do so by 
simultaneous attendance and participation by means of an electronic facility. Shareholders 
present in person or by proxy by means of such electronic facility will be counted in the quorum 
for, and entitled to participate in, the meeting. 
51.2 
The Board may also decide to let persons entitled to attend and participate in a meeting to do so 
by simultaneous attendance and participation at a satellite meeting place anywhere in the world 
(referred to in these Articles as a satellite meeting). Shareholders present in person or by proxy 
at satellite meeting places shall be counted in the quorum for, and entitled to participate in, the 
general meeting. The satellite meeting will be treated as taking place where the Chair of the 
meeting is at the time of the meeting and the powers of the Chair will apply to the satellite 
meeting. 
51.3 
Any general meeting at which electronic facilities are available and any satellite meeting will be 
duly constituted and its proceedings valid if the Chair is satisfied that adequate facilities are 
available to enable all members attending the meeting by whatever means and at all the meeting 
places to participate in the business for which the meeting has been called. 
51.4 
All persons seeking to attend and participate in a general meeting by way of electronic facility are 
responsible for having in place the necessary means to enable them to do so. Subject to the right 
of the Chair to adjourn a general meeting under these Articles, any inability of a person to attend 
or participate in a general meeting by means of electronic facility, or any interruption to a person 
being so able, shall not invalidate the proceedings of that meeting. 
51.5 
Nothing in these Articles authorises or allows a general meeting to be held exclusively on an 
electronic basis.  
52 
Omission to send notice or non-receipt of notice 
52.1 
The accidental omission to give or send notice of any meeting or, in cases where it is intended 
that it be given or sent out with the notice, any other document relating to the meeting including 
an appointment of proxy to, or the non-receipt of either by, any person entitled to receive the 
same shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting. 
52.2 
A member present in person or by proxy at a meeting shall be deemed to have received proper 
notice of that meeting and, where applicable, of the purpose of that meeting. 
53 
Postponement of general meetings  
If the Board, in its absolute discretion, considers that it is impractical or unreasonable for any 
reason to hold a meeting on the date or at the time or place (or places in the case of a satellite 
meeting) specified in the notice calling the meeting or by means of any electronic facility 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 23 - 
available for that meeting, it may postpone or move the meeting, or change, cancel or introduce 
any electronic facilities or make other alterations in respect of the meeting (or do any of these 
things). The Board shall take reasonable steps to ensure that notice of the date, time and place 
(or places in the case of a satellite meeting) of the postponed meeting is provided to any 
member trying to attend the meeting at the original time and place (or places in the case of a 
satellite meeting). Notice of the business to be transacted at such postponed meeting shall not 
be required. If a meeting is postponed in accordance with this Article 53, the appointment of a 
proxy will be valid if it is delivered and received as required by these Articles not less than 48 
hours before the time appointed for holding the postponed meeting. The Board may also 
postpone, move or make other arrangements in respect of any meeting which has been 
rearranged under this Article 53.  When calculating the 48 hour period mentioned in this Article 
53, the Directors can decide not to take account of any part of a day that is not a working day. 
PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 
54 
Quorum 
54.1 
No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present when the 
meeting proceeds to business.  Save as otherwise provided in these Articles, two persons 
entitled to attend and to vote on the business to be transacted, each being a member so entitled 
or a proxy for a member so entitled or a duly authorised company representative which is a 
member so entitled, shall be a quorum. 
54.2 
In calculating whether a quorum is present for the purposes of Article 54.1, if two or more 
persons are appointed as proxies for the same member or two or more persons are appointed as 
corporate representatives of the same corporate member, only one of such proxies or only one of 
such corporate representatives shall be counted. 
55 
If quorum not present 
If within five minutes (or such longer interval as the Chair in his absolute discretion thinks fit) 
from the time appointed for the holding of a general meeting a quorum is not present, or if 
during a meeting such a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting, if convened by or upon  the 
requisition of members, shall be dissolved.  In any other case, the meeting shall stand 
adjourned to such day (being not less than 10 clear days after the original meeting) and at such 
time and place as the Chair (or, in default, the Board) may determine.  If at such adjourned 
meeting a quorum is not present within five minutes from the time appointed for holding the 
meeting, one person entitled to vote on the business to be transacted, being a member so 
entitled or a proxy for a member so entitled or a duly authorised company representative which 
is a member so entitled, shall be a quorum. 
56 
Chair 
The Chair (if any) of the Board shall preside as Chair at every general meeting of the Company.  
If there is no Chair or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time 
appointed for holding the meeting, or is unwilling to act as Chair, the Deputy Chair (if any) of the 
Board shall (if present and willing to act) preside as Chair at such meeting.  If neither the Chair 
nor the Deputy Chair is present and willing to act, the Directors present shall choose one of their 
number to act or, if there is only one Director present, he shall preside as Chair if willing to act.  
If no Director is present and willing to act, the members present (in person or by proxy) and 
entitled to vote on the business to be transacted shall choose one of their number to preside as 
Chair of the meeting. 
57 
Entitlement to attend and speak 
Each Director shall, notwithstanding that he is not a member, be entitled to attend and speak at 
any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares of the 
Company.  The Chair may invite any person to attend and speak at any general meeting where 
he considers this will assist in the deliberations of the meeting. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 24 - 
58 
Power to adjourn 
The Chair may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present, and shall, if so 
directed by the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time (or indefinitely) and from place 
to place as the meeting shall determine.  However, without prejudice to any other power which 
he may have under these Articles or at common law, the Chair may, without the need for the 
consent of the meeting, interrupt or adjourn any meeting (whether or not it has commenced or a 
quorum is present) from time to time and from place to place, or for an indefinite period, if he is 
of the opinion that it has become necessary to do so in order to secure the proper and orderly 
conduct of the meeting or to give all persons entitled to do so a reasonable opportunity of 
attending, speaking and voting at the meeting or to ensure that the business of the meeting is 
properly disposed of. 
59 
Notice of adjourned meeting 
Whenever a meeting is adjourned for 3 months or more or indefinitely, at least seven clear days' 
notice, specifying the place, the day and time of the adjourned meeting and the general nature 
of the business to be transacted, shall be given in the same manner as in the case of an original 
meeting.  Save as aforesaid and subject to the Companies Acts, no member shall be entitled to 
any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at any adjourned meeting. 
60 
Business of adjourned meeting 
No business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business which might 
properly have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. 
61 
Accommodation of members and security arrangements 
61.1 
The Board may, for the purpose of controlling the level of attendance and ensuring the health 
and safety of those attending at any place specified for the holding of a general meeting, from 
time to time make such arrangements as the Board shall in its absolute discretion consider to be 
appropriate and may from time to time vary any such arrangements in place or make new 
arrangements therefor.  The entitlement of any member or proxy to attend a general meeting at 
such place shall be subject to any such arrangements as may be for the time being approved by 
the Board. In the case of any meeting to which such arrangements apply the Board may, when 
specifying the place of the meeting: 
61.1.1 
direct that the meeting shall be held at a place specified in the notice at which the Chair of the 
meeting shall preside (the Principal Place); and  
61.1.2 
make arrangements for simultaneous attendance and participation at satellite meeting places or 
by way of any other electronic means by members otherwise entitled to attend the general 
meeting but excluded from the Principal Place under the provisions of this Article 61, or who 
wish to attend at satellite meeting places or other places at which persons are participating via 
electronic means provided that persons attending at the Principal Place and at satellite meeting 
places or other places at which persons are participating via electronic means shall be able to 
see, hear and be seen and heard by, persons attending at the Principal Place and at such other 
places, by any means.  Such arrangements for simultaneous attendance at any of such other 
places may include arrangements for controlling the level of attendance in any manner at any of 
such other places (as stated above), provided that they shall operate so that any members and 
proxies excluded from attending at the Principal Place are able to attend at one of the satellite 
meeting places or other places at which persons are participating via electronic means.  For the 
purposes of all other provisions of these Articles any such meeting shall be treated as taking 
place and being held at the Principal Place. 
61.2 
The Board may direct that any person wishing to attend any meeting should provide evidence of 
identity and submit to such searches or other security arrangements or restrictions (including 
relating to health and safety) and/or other arrangements as the Board shall consider appropriate 
in the circumstances. Where a meeting is held partly by means of an electronic facility, the Board 
may make any arrangements and impose any requirement or restriction that is necessary to 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 25 - 
ensure the identification of those taking part by this means and the security of the electronic 
facility. The Board shall be entitled in its absolute discretion to refuse entry to (physically or 
electronically), or eject from, any meeting any person who fails to provide such evidence of 
identity or to submit to such searches or to otherwise comply with such security or other 
arrangements or restrictions.   
62 
Orderly conduct 
The Chair shall take such action or give such directions as he thinks fit to promote the orderly 
conduct of the business of the meeting as laid down in the notice of the meeting.  The Chair’s 
decision on matters of procedure or arising incidentally from the business of the meeting shall 
be final, as shall his determination as to whether any matter is of such a nature. 
VOTING AND POLLS 
63 
Method of voting 
63.1 
A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting held partly by means of an electronic facility will 
be decided on a poll, which poll votes may be cast by such electronic or other means as the 
Board decides are appropriate.  Any such poll will be treated as having been validly demanded at 
the time fixed for the holding of the meeting. Subject to this, at any general meeting a resolution 
put to a vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless (before or on the 
declaration of the result of the show of hands) a poll is duly demanded.  Subject to the provisions 
of the Companies Acts, a poll may be demanded by: 
63.1.1 
the Chair of the meeting; or 
63.1.2 
at least five members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the resolution; or 
63.1.3 
a member or members present in person or by proxy representing not less than 10 per cent of 
the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution (excluding 
any voting rights attached to shares held as treasury shares); or 
63.1.4 
a member or members present in person or by proxy holding shares conferring a right to vote 
on the resolution, being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less 
than 10 per cent of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right (excluding 
shares in the Company conferring a right to vote on the resolution held as treasury shares). 
63.2 
The Chair may also demand a poll before a resolution is put to the vote on a show of hands. 
63.3 
At general meetings, resolutions shall be put to the vote by the Chair and there shall be no 
requirement for the resolution to be proposed or seconded by any person.   
64 
Chair's declaration conclusive on show of hands 
Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the Chair of 
the meeting that a resolution on a show of hands has been carried, or carried unanimously or by 
a particular majority, or lost, or not carried by a particular majority, and an entry to that effect in 
the book containing the minutes of proceedings of the Company, shall be conclusive evidence 
of the fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded for or against such 
resolution. 
65 
Objection to or error in voting 
No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter or to the counting of, or failure to 
count, any vote, except at the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll at which the vote objected 
to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs.  Any objection or error shall be referred to 
the Chair of the meeting and shall only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if 
the Chair decides that the same is of sufficient magnitude to vitiate the resolution or may 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 26 - 
otherwise have affected the decision of the meeting.  Any vote which is not disallowed at such a 
meeting or poll shall be valid for all purposes.  The decision of the Chair on such matters shall 
be final and conclusive. 
66 
Amendment to resolutions 
66.1 
If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled out 
of order by the Chair of the meeting, any error in such ruling shall not invalidate the proceedings 
on the substantive resolution.   
66.2 
In the case of a resolution duly proposed as a special resolution, no amendment thereto (other 
than an amendment to correct a patent error) may be considered or voted on.   
66.3 
In the case of a resolution duly proposed as an ordinary resolution, no amendment thereto (other 
than an amendment to correct a patent error) may be considered or voted on, unless either (a) at 
least 48 hours prior to the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which 
such ordinary resolution is to be proposed, notice in writing of the terms of the amendment and 
intention to move the same has been lodged at the Office or (b) the Chair of the meeting in his 
absolute discretion decides that it may be considered or voted on.  The Chair of the meeting may 
agree to the withdrawal of any proposed amendment before it is voted on at the meeting. 
67 
Procedure on a poll 
67.1 
A poll duly demanded on the election of the Chair of a meeting or on any question of 
adjournment shall be taken forthwith.  A poll duly demanded on any other matter shall be taken in 
such manner (including the use of ballot or voting papers or electronic means, or any 
combination thereof) and at such time and place, not being more than 30 days from the date of 
the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the poll was demanded, as the Chair shall direct. The 
Chair may appoint scrutineers who need not be members.  No notice need be given of a poll not 
taken immediately if the time and place at which it is to be taken are announced at the meeting at 
which it is demanded.  In any other case, at least seven clear days' notice shall be given, 
specifying the time and place at which the poll is to be taken.  The result of the poll shall be 
deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 
67.2 
The demand for a poll (other than on the election of the Chair of the meeting or any question of 
adjournment) shall not prevent the continuance of the meeting for the transaction of any 
business, other than the question on which a poll has been demanded.  If a poll is demanded 
before the declaration of the result on a show of hands and the demand is duly withdrawn, the 
meeting shall continue as if the demand had not been made. 
67.3 
The demand for a poll may be withdrawn at any time before the poll is taken, but only with the 
consent of the Chair of the meeting.  A demand so withdrawn shall not invalidate the result of a 
show of hands declared before the demand was made. 
67.4 
On a poll votes may be given in person or by proxy.  A member entitled to more than one vote 
need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 
68 
Votes of members 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, to any special terms as to voting on which any 
shares may have been issued or may for the time being be held and to any suspension or 
abrogation of voting rights pursuant to these Articles, at any general meeting, every member 
who is present in person shall, on a show of hands, have one vote and every member present 
in person shall, on a poll, have one vote for each share of which he is the holder. 
69 
Votes of joint holders 
If two or more persons are joint holders of a share, then in voting on any question, the vote of 
the senior who tenders a vote (whether in person or by proxy) shall be accepted to the 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 27 - 
exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders.  For this purpose, seniority shall be determined 
by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the Register.

Votes of member suffering incapacity 
70.1 
Where, in England or elsewhere, a receiver or other person (by whatever name called) has been 
appointed by any court claiming jurisdiction in that behalf to exercise powers with respect to the 
property or affairs of any member on the ground (however formulated) of mental disorder, the 
Board may, subject to the Companies Acts, in its absolute discretion, on or subject to the 
production of such evidence of the appointment as the Board may require, permit such receiver 
or other person to vote in person or, on a poll, by proxy on behalf of such member at any general 
meeting.  
70.2 
Evidence to the satisfaction of the Board of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the 
right to vote shall be deposited at the Office, or deposited or received at such other place or 
address as is specified in accordance with these Articles for the deposit or receipt of 
appointments of proxy, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting 
or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised, and in default the right to vote 
shall not be exercisable.  When calculating the 48 hour period mentioned in this Article 70, the 
Directors can decide not to take account of any part of a day that is not a working day.  
PROXIES AND CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES 
71 
Voting by proxy 
71.1 
Any person (whether a member of the Company or not) may be appointed to act as a proxy and 
more than one proxy may be appointed provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to a different share or shares held by the member.   
71.2 
Every proxy who has been appointed by one or more members entitled to vote on the resolution 
shall, on a show of hands, have one vote unless Article 71.3 applies.  
71.3 
Every proxy who has been appointed by more than one member entitled to vote on the resolution 
shall, on a show of hands, have two votes, one vote for and one against the resolution if: 
71.3.1 
one or more of the members instructed him to vote for and one or more of the members 
instructed him to vote against the resolution; or 
71.3.2 
one or more of the members instructed him to vote for the resolution and one or more of the 
members gave him discretion as to how to vote and he exercises his discretion by voting 
against the resolution; or 
71.3.3 
one or more of the members instructed him to vote against the resolution and one or more of 
the members gave him discretion as to how to vote and he exercises his discretion by voting for 
the resolution. 
71.4 
Every proxy who has been appointed by one or more members entitled to vote on the resolution 
shall, on a poll, have one vote for each share held by his appointor(s). 
71.5 
The appointment of a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and voting in person on 
a show of hands or on a poll on any matters in respect of which the proxy is appointed. In the 
event that and to the extent that a member personally votes his shares, his proxy shall not be 
entitled to vote and any vote cast by a proxy in such circumstances shall be ignored. 
71.6 
When two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are received in respect of the same 
share for use at the same meeting and in respect of the same matter, the one which is last validly 
received (regardless of its date or of the date of its execution or submission) shall be treated as 
replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share.  If the Company is unable to 
determine which appointment was last validly received, none of them shall be treated as valid in 
respect of that share. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 28 - 
72 
Form of proxy 
72.1 
The appointment of a proxy shall, subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts:  
72.1.1 
be in writing, in any common form or in such other form as the Board may approve, and (i) if in 
writing but not in electronic form, made under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly 
authorised in writing; or, if the appointor is a corporation, under its common seal or under the 
hand of some officer or attorney or other person duly authorised in that behalf; or (ii) if in writing 
in electronic form, submitted by or on behalf of the appointor and authenticated; 
72.1.2 
be deemed (subject to any contrary direction contained in it) to confer authority on the proxy to 
exercise all or any rights of his appointor to demand or join in demanding a poll and to speak at 
any meeting and to vote (whether on a show of hands or on a poll) on any resolution or 
amendment of a resolution put to the meeting in respect of which the proxy is given, as the 
proxy thinks fit;  
72.1.3 
unless the contrary is stated in it, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the 
meeting to which it relates; and 
72.1.4 
where it is stated to apply to more than one meeting, be valid for all such meetings as well as 
for any adjournment of any of such meetings.  
72.2 
The Board may allow a proxy for a holder of any shares in uncertificated form to be appointed by 
electronic communication in the form of an uncertificated proxy instruction.  The Board may also 
allow any supplement to the uncertificated proxy instruction or any amendment or revocation of 
any uncertificated proxy instruction to be made by a further uncertificated proxy instruction. 
72.3 
The Board may decide what method should be used to determine at what time the instruction or 
notification is treated as being received by the Company.  The Board may treat any notification 
purporting or expressed to be sent on behalf of a holder of a share in uncertificated form as 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending the instruction to send it on behalf of 
that holder. 
72.4 
For the purposes of this Article 72, an uncertificated proxy instruction is a properly authenticated 
dematerialised instruction, and/or other instruction or notification, if sent through a relevant 
system to a participant in that system chosen by the Board to act for the Company.  The 
uncertificated proxy instruction may be in any form and subject to any terms and conditions that 
the Board deems appropriate, but always subject to the facilities and requirements of the relevant 
system. 
73 
Deposit or receipt of proxy 
73.1 
The appointment of a proxy and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is 
authenticated, or a copy of such authority certified notarially or in some other way approved by 
the Board, shall:

in the case of an appointment not in electronic form (including any such power of attorney or 
other authority) be deposited at the Office, or at such other place (within the United Kingdom) as 
is specified in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjourned meeting or in 
any appointment of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the meeting, not less than 48 
hours (or such shorter time as the Board may determine) before the time appointed for holding 
the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the appointment proposes to 
vote; or 
73.1.2 
in the case of an appointment in electronic form (including any such power of attorney or other 
authority), where an address has been specified for the purpose of receiving documents or 
information in electronic form: 
(a) in the notice convening the meeting; or 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 29 - 
(b) in any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the meeting; or 
(c) in any invitation in electronic form to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation 
to the meeting, 
be received at such address not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Board may 
determine) before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the 
person named in the appointment proposes to vote; or 
73.1.3 
in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is demanded, be deposited or received as 
aforesaid after the poll has been demanded and not less than 24 hours (or such shorter time as 
the Board may determine) before the time appointed for taking the poll; or 
73.1.4 
in the case of a poll not taken forthwith but taken not more than 48 hours after it was demanded, 
be delivered at the meeting at which the poll was demanded to the Chair of the meeting or any 
Director, the Secretary or some other person authorised for the purpose by the Company. 
73.2 
When calculating the periods mentioned in this Article 73, the Directors can decide not to take 
account of any part of a day that is not a working day. 
74 
Maximum validity of proxy and revocation of proxy 
74.1 
An appointment of proxy not deposited, delivered or received in the manner specified in 
Article 73 shall be invalid.  No appointment of proxy shall be valid after the expiry of 12 months 
from the date named in it as the date of its execution or the date of its submission, except at an 
adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting, in cases where 
the meeting was originally convened within 12 months from such date. 
74.2 
A vote given, or demand for a poll made, by a proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the death or 
mental disorder of the principal or the revocation of the appointment of proxy, or of the authority 
under which the appointment of proxy was executed, or the transfer of the share in respect of 
which the appointment of proxy is given, unless notice in writing of such death, mental disorder, 
revocation or transfer shall have been received by the Company at the Office, or at such other 
place or address as has been appointed for the deposit or receipt of appointments of proxy: 
74.2.1 
in the case of a meeting or adjourned meeting, at least 48 hours before the commencement of 
the meeting or adjourned meeting; 
74.2.2 
in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it was demanded, at least 24 hours before 
the taking of the poll; and 
74.2.3 
in the case of a poll not taken forthwith but taken not more than 48 hours after it was demanded, 
at the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 
74.3 
When calculating the 48 hour period mentioned in this Article 74, the Directors can decide not to 
take account of any part of a day that is not a working day. 
75 
Corporate representatives 
A corporation (whether or not a company within the meaning of the Companies Acts) which is a 
member may, by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise such person or 
persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the 
Company or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares.  A Director, the 
Secretary, or some person authorised for the purpose by the Secretary, may require any 
representative to produce a certified copy of the resolution so authorising him or such other 
evidence of his authority reasonably satisfactory to such Director, Secretary or other person 
before permitting him to exercise his powers. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 30 - 
76 
Validity of votes by proxies and corporate representatives 
76.1 
A vote given by a proxy or by a corporate representative shall be valid for all purposes 
notwithstanding that the proxy or corporate representative has failed to vote in accordance with 
the instructions of the member by whom the proxy or corporate representative was appointed and 
the Company shall be under no obligation to check any vote so given is in accordance with any 
such instructions. 
76.2 
Any objection to the qualification of any person voting at a general meeting or to the counting of, 
or failure to count, any vote must be made at the meeting or at the time any poll is taken (if not 
taken at the meeting or adjourned meeting) at which the vote objected to is tendered.  Any 
objection made in due time shall be referred to the Chair whose decision shall be final and 
conclusive.  If a vote is not disallowed by the Chair it is valid for all purposes.   
76.3 
The Company may require reasonable evidence of the identity of any proxy appointed by a 
member and of the member himself. 
76.4 
Where the appointment of a proxy is expressed to have been or purports to have been executed 
by a duly authorised person or on behalf of a member:  
76.4.1 
the Company may treat the appointment as sufficient evidence of that person’s authority to 
execute the appointment of proxy on behalf of that member; and 
76.4.2 
the member shall, if requested by or on behalf of the Company, send or procure the sending of 
any authority under which the appointment of proxy has been executed, or a certified copy of 
any such authority, to such address and by such time as is required for the submission of 
appointments of proxy under Article 73 and, if the request is not complied with in any respect, 
the appointment of proxy may be treated as invalid.

existing Board, but the total number of Directors shall not at any time exceed any maximum 
number fixed by or in accordance with these Articles. 
79 
Power of Board to appoint Directors 
Without prejudice to the power of the Company in general meeting under these Articles to 
appoint any person to be a Director, the Board shall have power at any time to appoint any 
person who is willing to act to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the 
existing Board, but the total number of Directors shall not exceed any maximum number fixed 
by or in accordance with these Articles.  Any Director so appointed shall retire at the first annual 
general meeting of the Company following his appointment and shall not be taken into account 
in determining the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting.  
80 
Appointment of executive Directors 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Board, or any committee authorised by the 
Board, may from time to time appoint one or more Directors to hold any employment or 
executive office (including that of Chief Executive or Managing Director) for such term and 
subject to such other conditions as the Board, or any committee authorised by the Board, thinks 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 31 - 
fit in accordance with Article 99.  The Board, or any committee authorised by the Board, may 
revoke or terminate any such appointment without prejudice to any claim for damages for 
breach of any contract between the Director and the Company. 
81 
Eligibility of new Directors 
No person, other than a Director retiring (by rotation or otherwise), shall, unless recommended 
by the Board for election, be appointed or re-appointed a Director at any general meeting 
unless, not less than seven nor more than 42 clear days before the date appointed for the 
meeting, notice in writing duly executed by a member (other than the person to be proposed) 
qualified to vote at the meeting of the intention to propose that person for appointment or re-
appointment, stating the particulars which would, if he were so appointed or re-appointed, be 
required to be included in the Company's register of Directors, together with notice executed by 
that person of his willingness to be appointed or re-appointed, is lodged at the Office.

83 
Retirement at annual general meetings 
83.1 
At every annual general meeting all the Directors at the date of the notice convening the annual 
general meeting shall retire from office and may offer themselves for re-appointment by the 
members. 
84 
Removal by ordinary resolution 
In addition to any power of removal conferred by the Companies Acts, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution remove any Director before the expiration of his period of office, but without 
prejudice to any claim for damages which he may have for breach of any contract of service 
between him and the Company, and may (subject to these Articles) by ordinary resolution 
appoint another person who is willing to act to be a Director in his place.  Any person so 
appointed shall be treated, for the purposes of determining the time at which he or any other 
Director is to retire, as if he had become a Director on the day on which the person in whose 
place he is appointed was last appointed a Director. 
85 
Vacation of office by Director 
Without prejudice to the provisions for retirement (by rotation or otherwise) contained in these 
Articles, the office of a Director shall be vacated if:

he resigns by notice in writing delivered to, or, if in electronic form, received by, the Secretary at 
the Office or tendered at a Board meeting; 
85.2 
he ceases to be a Director by virtue of any provision of the Companies Acts, is removed from 
office pursuant to these Articles or the Companies Acts, or becomes prohibited by law from being 
a Director; 
85.3 
he becomes bankrupt, has an interim receiving order made against him, makes any arrangement 
or compounds with his creditors generally or applies to the court for an interim order in 
connection with a voluntary arrangement or enters into any analogous or similar procedure in any 
jurisdiction; 
85.4 
by reason of his mental health a court makes an order which wholly or partly prevents him from 
personally exercising any powers or rights he would otherwise have; 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 32 - 
85.5 
he is being treated by a registered medical practitioner who gives a written opinion to the 
Company stating that the Director has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a 
director and may remain so for more than three months; 
85.6 
both he and his alternate Director appointed pursuant to the provisions of these Articles (if any) 
are absent, without the permission of the Board, from Board meetings for six consecutive months 
and the Board resolves that his office be vacated; or 
85.7 
he is requested to resign by notice in writing addressed to him at his address as shown in the 
Company’s register of Directors and authenticated by all the other Directors (without prejudice to 
any claim for damages which he may have for breach of any contract between him and the 
Company) and, for this purpose, a set of like notices each authenticated by one or more of the 
Directors shall be as effective as a single notice authenticated by the requisite number of 
Directors. 
86 
Resolution as to vacancy conclusive 
A resolution of the Board declaring a Director to have vacated office under the terms of 
Article 85 shall be conclusive as to the fact and grounds of vacation stated in the resolution. 
ALTERNATE DIRECTORS 
87 
Appointments 
87.1 
Each Director (other than an alternate Director) may, by notice in writing delivered to or, if in 
electronic form, received by the Secretary at the Office, or in any other manner approved by the 
Board, appoint any other Director or any person approved for that purpose by the Board and 
willing to act, to be his alternate. 
87.2 
No appointment of an alternate Director who is not already a Director shall be effective until his 
consent to act as a Director in the form prescribed by or required pursuant to the Companies Acts 
has been received at the Office. 
87.3 
An alternate Director shall not be counted in reckoning any maximum or minimum number of 
Directors prescribed by these Articles. 
87.4 
An alternate Director shall, in addition to any restrictions which may apply to him personally, be 
subject to the same restrictions as his appointor.   
88 
Participation in Board meetings 
Every alternate Director shall (subject to his giving to the Company a postal address within the 
United Kingdom, or an electronic address, at which notices may be served on him) be entitled to 
receive notice of all meetings of the Board and all committees of the Board of which his 
appointor is a member and, in the absence from such meetings of his appointor, to attend and 
vote at such meetings and to exercise all the powers, rights, duties and authorities of his 
appointor (except as regards power to appoint an alternate).  A Director acting as alternate 
Director shall have a separate vote at Board meetings for each Director for whom he acts as 
alternate Director (and who is not present) in addition to his own vote (if any) as a Director, but 
he shall count as only one for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. A 
signature by an alternate Director of any resolution in writing of the Board or a committee of the 
Board shall be as effective as signature by his appointor (unless contrary provision is made in 
the alternate Director’s appointment). 
89 
Alternate Director responsible for own acts 
Every person acting as an alternate Director shall be an officer of the Company, shall alone be 
responsible to the Company for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the 
agent of the Director appointing him. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 33 - 
90 
Interests of alternate Director 
The provisions of Articles 118-125 (inclusive) (Directors’ Interests) shall apply to an alternate 
Director to the same extent as if he was a Director and for the purposes of those provisions an 
alternate Director shall be deemed to have an interest which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, 
with the interest of the Company if either he or his appointor has such an interest.  The 
provisions of Articles 154 and 155 (Indemnity) shall also apply to an alternate Director to the 
same extent as if he was a Director.  An alternate Director shall not be entitled to receive from 
the Company any fees in his capacity as an alternate Director, except only such part (if any) of 
the fees payable to his appointor as his appointor may by notice in writing to the Company 
direct.  Subject to this Article 90, the Company shall pay to an alternate Director such expenses 
as might properly have been paid to him if he had been a Director. 
91 
Revocation of appointment 
An alternate Director shall cease to be an alternate Director: 
91.1 
if his appointor revokes his appointment; or 
91.2 
if his appointor ceases for any reason to be a Director, provided that if any Director retires but is 
re-appointed at the same meeting, any valid appointment of an alternate Director which was in 
force immediately before his retirement shall remain in force as though the Director had not 
retired; or 
91.3 
if any event happens in relation to him which, if he were a Director otherwise appointed, would 
cause him to vacate office; or 
91.4 
if he resigns his office by notice in writing to the Company. 
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION, EXPENSES AND PENSIONS 
92 
Directors' fees 
The Directors (other than alternate Directors and other than any Director who for the time being 
is appointed to hold any employment or executive office in accordance with these Articles) shall 
be entitled to receive by way of fees for their services as Directors such sum as the Board, or 
any committee authorised by the Board, may from time to time determine (not exceeding 
£1,500,000 per annum in aggregate or such other sum as the Company in general meeting by 
ordinary resolution shall from time to time determine).  Such sum (unless otherwise directed by 
the resolution of the Company by which it is voted) shall be divided among the Directors in such 
proportions and in such manner as the Board, or any committee authorised by the Board,  may 
determine or, in default of such determination, equally (except that in such event any Director 
holding office for less than the whole of the relevant period in respect of which the fees are paid 
shall only rank in such division in proportion to the time during such period for which he holds 
office). Any fees payable pursuant to this Article 92 shall be distinct from any salary, 
remuneration or other amounts payable to a Director pursuant to any other provisions of these 
Articles or otherwise and shall accrue from day to day. 
93 
Expenses 
Each Director shall be entitled to be repaid all reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses 
properly incurred by him in or about the performance of his duties as Director, including any 
expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board or any committee of the Board or general 
meetings or separate meetings of the holders of any class of shares or of debentures of the 
Company. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 34 - 
94 
Additional remuneration 
If by arrangement with the Board, or any committee authorised by the Board, any Director shall 
perform or render any special duties or services outside his ordinary duties as a Director and 
not in his capacity as a holder of employment or executive office, he may be paid such 
reasonable additional remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in 
profits or otherwise) as the Board, or any committee authorised by the Board, may from time to 
time determine. 
95 
Remuneration of executive Directors 
The salary or remuneration of any Director appointed to hold any employment or executive 
office in accordance with the provisions of these Articles may be either a fixed sum of money, or 
may altogether or in part be governed by business done or profits made or otherwise 
determined by the Board, or any committee authorised by the Board, and may be in addition to 
or in lieu of any fee payable to him for his services as Director pursuant to these Articles. 
96 
Pensions and other benefits 
The Board, or any committee authorised by the Board, may exercise all the powers of the 
Company to provide pensions or other retirement or superannuation benefits and to provide 
death or disability benefits or other allowances or gratuities (whether by insurance or otherwise) 
for, or to institute and maintain any institution, association, society, club, trust, other 
establishment or profit-sharing, share incentive, share purchase or employees' share scheme 
calculated to advance the interests of the Company or to benefit, any person who is or has at 
any time been a Director or employee of the Company (or of any company which is (a) a 
holding company or a subsidiary undertaking of the Company or (b) allied to or associated with 
the Company or with any such holding company or subsidiary undertaking or (c) a predecessor 
in business of the Company or of any such holding company or subsidiary undertaking), and 
any member of his family (including a spouse or former spouse) and any person who is or was 
dependent on him, provided that no benefits (except such as may be provided for by any other 
Article) may be granted to or in respect of a Director or former Director who has not been 
employed by, or held an executive office or place of profit under, the Company or any body 
corporate which is or has been its subsidiary undertaking or any predecessor in business of the 
Company or any such body corporate without the approval of an ordinary resolution of the 
Company.  For such purpose the Board may establish, maintain, subscribe and contribute to 
any scheme, institution, association, club, trust or fund and pay premiums and, subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Acts, lend money or make payments to, guarantee or give an 
indemnity in respect of, or give any financial or other assistance in connection with, any of such 
matters.  The Board may procure any of such matters to be done by the Company either alone 
or in conjunction with any other person.  Any Director or former Director shall be entitled to 
receive and retain for his own benefit any pension or other benefit provided under this Article 
96 and shall not be obliged to account for it to the Company. 
POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD 
97 
Powers of the Board 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, these Articles and to any directions given by 
special resolution of the Company, the business of the Company shall be managed by the 
Board, which may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating to the management 
of the business or not. No alteration of these Articles and no such direction given by the 
Company shall invalidate any prior act of the Board which would have been valid if such 
alteration had not been made or such direction had not been given.  Provisions contained 
elsewhere in these Articles as to any specific power of the Board shall not be deemed to limit 
the general powers given by this Article 97. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 35 - 
98 
Powers of Directors if less than minimum number 
If the number of Directors is less than the minimum for the time being prescribed by these 
Articles, the remaining Director or Directors shall act only for the purposes of appointing an 
additional Director or Directors to make up such minimum or of convening a general meeting of 
the Company for the purpose of making such appointment.  If there is no Director able or willing 
to act, any two members may summon a general meeting for the purpose of appointing 
Directors.  Subject to the provisions of these Articles, any additional Director so appointed shall 
hold office only until the dissolution of the first annual general meeting of the Company following 
his appointment unless he is re-elected during such meeting. 
99 
Powers of executive Directors 
The Board may from time to time delegate or entrust to and confer on any Director holding 
executive office (including a Chief Executive or Managing Director) such of its powers, 
authorities and discretions (with power to sub-delegate) for such time, on such terms and 
subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, and the Board may from time to time revoke, withdraw, 
alter or vary all or any of such powers. 
100 
Delegation to committees 
100.1 
The Board may delegate to any committee appointed by the Board (consisting of one or more 
Directors and (if thought fit) one or more other persons) any of its powers, authorities and 
discretions (including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, all powers, authorities 
and discretions the exercise of which involves or may involve the payment of remuneration to or 
the conferring of any other benefit on all or any of the Directors) for such time, on such terms and 
subject to such conditions as it thinks fit.   
100.2 
Any such committee shall, unless the Board otherwise resolves, have power to sub-delegate to 
sub-committees any of the powers, authorities or discretions delegated to it.   
100.3 
A majority of the members of any committee or sub-committee shall be Directors and no 
resolution of a committee or sub-committee shall be effective unless a majority of those present 
and voting on the resolution when it is passed are Directors or alternate Directors. 
100.4 
The Board may confer any of its powers, authorities and discretions either collaterally with, or to 
the exclusion of and in substitution for, all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions of the 
Board in that respect and may from time to time revoke, withdraw, alter or vary any of such 
powers, authorities and discretions and discharge any such committee or sub-committee in whole 
or in part.  Insofar as any power, authority or discretion is so delegated, any reference in these 
Articles to the exercise by the Board of such power, authority or discretion shall be construed as 
if it were a reference to the exercise of such power, authority or discretion by such committee or 
sub-committee.   
100.5 
The meetings and proceedings of any such committee or sub-committee consisting of more than 
one person shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of these Articles regulating the 
meetings and proceedings of the Board, so far as the same are not superseded by any 
regulations made by the Board under this Article 100. 
101 
Delegation to individual Directors 
The Board may entrust to and confer upon a Director any of its powers, authorities and 
discretions (with power to sub-delegate) upon such terms (subject to the Companies Acts) and 
subject to such conditions and with such restrictions as it may decide and either collaterally 
with, or to the exclusion of and in substitution for, its own powers, authorities and discretions.  
The Board may from time to time revoke or vary any of such powers, authorities and discretions 
but no person dealing in good faith and without notice of the revocation or variation shall be 
affected by it.

The Board may establish any local or divisional boards or agencies for managing any of the 
affairs of the Company in any specified locality, either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and 
may appoint any persons to be members of such local or divisional board, or any managers or 
agents, and may fix their remuneration.  The Board may delegate to any local or divisional 
board, manager or agent so appointed any of its powers, authorities and discretions (with power 
to sub-delegate) and may authorise the members for the time being of any such local or 
divisional board, or any of them, to fill any vacancies and to act notwithstanding vacancies; and 
any such appointment or delegation may be made for such time, on such terms and subject to 
such conditions as the Board may think fit.  The Board may confer such powers, authorities and 
discretions either collaterally with, or to the exclusion of and in substitution for, all or any of the 
powers, authorities and discretions of the Board in that respect and may from time to time 
revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any of such powers, authorities and discretions.  Subject to 
any terms and conditions expressly imposed by the Board, the proceedings of any local or 
divisional board or agency with two or more members shall be governed by such of these 
Articles as regulate the proceedings of the Board, so far as they are capable of applying.   
103 
Power of attorney 
The Board may, by power of attorney or otherwise, appoint any person or persons to be the 
agent of the Company and may delegate to any such person or persons any of its powers, 
authorities and discretions (with power to sub-delegate), in each case for such purposes and for 
such time, on such terms (including as to remuneration) and subject to such conditions as it 
thinks fit.  The Board may confer such powers, authorities and discretions either collaterally 
with, or to the exclusion of and in substitution for, all or any of the powers, authorities and 
discretions of the Board in that respect and may from time to time revoke, withdraw, alter or 
vary any of such power, authorities and discretions.   
104 
Powers of delegation 
The power to delegate contained in Articles 100.4, 101, 102 and 103 shall be effective in 
relation to the powers, authorities and discretions of the Board generally and shall not be limited 
by the fact that in certain Articles, but not in others, express reference is made to particular 
powers, authorities or discretions being exercised by the Board or by a committee authorised by 
the Board. 
105 
Exercise of voting power 
The Board may exercise or cause to be exercised the voting power conferred by the shares in 
any other company held or owned by the Company, or any power of appointment to be 
exercised by the Company, in such manner in all respects as it thinks fit (including the exercise 
of the voting power or power of appointment in favour of the appointment of any Director as a 
director or other officer or employee of such company or in favour of the payment of 
remuneration to the directors, officers or employees of such company) and a Director may vote 
on and be counted in the quorum in relation to any of these matters. 
106 
Provision for employees 
The Board may exercise any power conferred on the Company by the Companies Acts to make 
provision for the benefit of persons (including, subject to the Companies Acts, Directors, former 
Directors or shadow Directors) employed or formerly employed by the Company or any of its

Overseas registers

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES 
109 
Board meetings 
Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Board may meet for the despatch of business, 
adjourn and otherwise regulate its proceedings as it thinks fit. 
110 
Notice of Board meetings 
One Director may, and the Secretary at the request of a Director shall, summon a Board 
meeting at any time on reasonable notice.  Notice of a Board meeting shall be deemed to be 
properly given to a Director if it is given to him personally or by word of mouth or sent in writing 
to him at his last known address (or any other address given by him to the Company for that 
purpose).  A Director may waive the requirement that notice be given to him of any Board 
meeting, either prospectively or retrospectively.  A Director who does not supply the Company 
with the information necessary to ensure that he receives notice of a meeting before it takes 
place is deemed to have waived his entitlement to notice of such meeting.   
111 
Quorum 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business may be determined by the Board and, 
until otherwise determined, shall be two persons, each being a Director or an alternate Director.  
A duly convened meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present shall be competent to 
exercise all or any of the authorities, powers and discretions for the time being vested in or 
exercisable by the Board.  Subject to these Articles, any Director who ceases to be a Director at 
a meeting of the Board may continue to be present and to act as a Director and be counted in 
the quorum until the termination of the meeting if no other Director objects and if otherwise a 
quorum of Directors would not be present.  
112 
Chair of Board 
The Board may appoint one or more of its body as Chair or Joint Chair and one or more of its 
body as Deputy Chair of its meetings and may determine the period for which he is or they are 
to hold office and may at any time remove him or them from office.  If no such Chair or Deputy 
Chair is elected, or if at any meeting neither a Chair nor a Deputy Chair is present within five 
minutes of the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present shall choose one of 
their number to be Chair of the meeting.  In the event there are two or more Joint Chairs or, in 
the absence of a Chair, two or more Deputy Chairs present, the Joint Chair or Deputy Chair to 
act as Chair of the meeting shall be decided by those Directors present.  Any Chair or Deputy 
Chair may also hold executive office under the Company. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 38 - 
113 
Voting and the Chair’s casting vote 
Questions arising at any meeting of the Board shall be determined by a majority of votes.  In the 
case of an equality of votes the Chair of that meeting shall have a second or casting vote. 
114 
Electronic participation in meetings 
114.1 
Any Director or his alternate may validly participate in a meeting of the Board or a committee of 
the Board by means of conference telephone or any other form of communications equipment, 
(provided that all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear and speak to each other 
throughout such meeting), by a series of telephone calls from the Chair of the meeting or by 
exchange of communication in electronic form addressed to the Chair of the meeting.  
114.2 
A person so participating by being present or being in telephone communication with or by 
exchanging communication in electronic form with those in the meeting or with the Chair of the 
meeting shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting and shall accordingly be 
counted in a quorum and be entitled to vote. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place 
where the largest group of those participating is assembled or, if there is no group which is larger 
than any other group, where the Chair of the meeting is. 
114.3 
A resolution passed at any meeting held in the above manner, and authenticated by the Chair of 
the meeting or the Secretary, shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting 
of the Board (or committee, as the case may be) duly convened and held.  
115 
Resolution in writing  
115.1 
A resolution in writing authenticated by (subject as otherwise mentioned in Article 115.1) all the 
Directors for the time being entitled to receive notice of a Board meeting (or all the members of a 
committee of the Board for the time entitled to receive notice of such committee meeting), shall 
be as valid and effective for all purposes as a resolution duly passed at a meeting of the Board 
(or committee, as the case may be).  
115.2 
Such a resolution: 
115.2.1 
need not be authenticated by a Director who is prohibited by these Articles from voting thereon 
or whose vote would not have counted on the resolution, or by his alternate; 
115.2.2 
must be authenticated by sufficient Directors to form a quorum at a Board meeting (or 
committee meeting); 
115.2.3 
may consist of several documents in the same form each authenticated by one or more of the 
Directors or members of the relevant committee; 
115.2.4 
need not be authenticated by an alternate Director if it is authenticated by the Director who 
appointed him; and 
115.2.5 
if authenticated by an alternate Director, need not also be authenticated by his appointor. 
116 
Minutes of proceedings 
116.1 
The Board shall cause minutes to be made in books kept for the purpose of recording: 
116.1.1 
all appointments of officers and committees made by the Board; and 
116.1.2 
the names of Directors present at every meeting of the Board, of a committee of the Board, of 
the Company or of the holders of any class of shares or debentures of the Company, and all 
orders, resolutions and proceedings of such meetings. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 39 - 
116.2 
Any such minutes, if purporting to be authenticated by the Chair of the meeting at which the 
proceedings were held or by the Chair of the next succeeding meeting or the Secretary, shall be 
prima facie evidence of the matters stated in such minutes without any further proof. 
116.3 
Any such minutes shall be retained for at least 10 years from the date of the appointment or 
meeting and shall be kept available for inspection in accordance with the Companies Acts.   
117 
Validity of proceedings 
All acts done by a meeting of the Board, or of a committee of the Board, or by any person acting 
as a Director, alternate Director or member of a committee shall, notwithstanding that it is 
afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any person acting as 
aforesaid, or that such person was disqualified from holding office or had ceased to hold office 
or were or was not entitled to vote on the matter in question, be as valid as if such person had 
been duly appointed, and was duly qualified and had continued to be a Director, alternate 
Director or member of a committee and entitled to vote. 
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 
118 
Power of the Board to authorise conflicts of interest 
118.1 
The Board may authorise any matter (as defined in Article 118.2) proposed to it in accordance 
with these Articles which would, if not so authorised, involve a breach by a Director of his duty to 
avoid conflicts of interest under the Companies Acts. 
118.2 
A matter means any matter which relates to a situation (a relevant situation) in which a Director 
has, or can have, an interest which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the 
Company (including the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity, whether or not 
the Company could take advantage of it, but excluding any situation which cannot reasonably be 
regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest). 
118.3 
The provisions of Article 118.1 do not apply to a conflict of interest arising in relation to a 
transaction or arrangement with the Company. 
118.4 
Any such authorisation will be effective only if: 
118.4.1 
any requirement as to quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without 
counting the Director in question or any other interested Director; and 
118.4.2 
the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their votes had not 
been counted. 
118.5 
Where authorisation is given under Article 118.1: 
118.5.1 
the Board may (whether at the time of the giving of the authorisation or subsequently) make 
such authorisation subject to any limits or conditions it expressly imposes but otherwise it shall 
be given to the fullest extent permitted; and 
118.5.2 
the Board may vary or terminate such authorisation at any time. 
118.6 
Subject to Article 118.7, a Director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any 
information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a Director of the Company and in 
respect of which he has a duty of confidentiality to another person.  In particular, the Director 
shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company under the Companies Acts 
because he fails: 
118.6.1 
to disclose any such information to the Board or to any Director or other officer or employee of 
the Company; and/or 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 40 - 
118.6.2 
to use or apply any such information in performing his duties as a Director of the Company. 
118.7 
To the extent that the relationship between a Director and a person to whom he owes a duty of 
confidentiality gives rise to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, Article 118.6 
applies only if the existence of that relationship has been authorised by the Board pursuant to 
this Article 118 or if Article 119 applies to the relationship. 
118.8 
Where the existence of a Director’s relationship with another person is authorised by the Board 
pursuant to this Article 118 (and subject to any limits or conditions imposed pursuant to 
Article 118.5.1) or Article 119 applies to the relationship and his relationship with that person 
gives rise to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, the Director shall not be in breach 
of the general duties he owes to the Company under the Companies Acts because he: 
118.8.1 
absents himself from meetings of the Board at which any matter relating to the conflict of 
interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be discussed or from the discussion of any 
such matter at a meeting or otherwise; and/or 
118.8.2 
makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to any matter which 
gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest sent or supplied by the 
Company and/or makes arrangements for such documents and information to be received and 
read by a professional adviser,  
for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest 
subsists. 
118.9 
The provisions of Articles 118.6, 118.7 and 118.8 are without prejudice to any equitable principle 
or rule of law which may excuse the Director from: 
118.9.1 
disclosing information in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise be required under 
these Articles; or 
118.9.2 
attending meetings or discussions or receiving documents and information as referred to in 
Article 118.8.1 or 118.8.2, in circumstances where such attendance or receiving such 
documents and information would otherwise be required under these Articles. 
119 
Interests not requiring Board authorisation 
119.1 
Provided that Article 119.2 is complied with, a Director, notwithstanding his office: 
119.1.1 
may be a party to or otherwise be interested in any transaction or arrangement with the 
Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested; 
119.1.2 
may hold any other office or place of profit under the Company (except that of Auditor or of 
auditor of a subsidiary of the Company) in conjunction with the office of Director and may act by 
himself or through his firm in a professional capacity for the Company, and in any such case on 
such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Board may arrange, either in addition to or 
in lieu of any remuneration provided for by any other Article; 
119.1.3 
may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or 
arrangement with or otherwise interested in, any company promoted by the Company or in 
which the Company is otherwise interested or as regards which the Company has any powers 
of appointment; and 
119.1.4 
shall not be liable to account to the Company for any profit, remuneration or other benefit 
realised by any office or employment or from any transaction or arrangement or from any 
interest in any body corporate, no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided 
on the grounds of any such interest or benefit nor shall the receipt of any such profit, 
remuneration or any other benefit constitute a breach of his duty under the Companies Acts or 
under the law not to accept benefits from third parties.

- 41 - 
119.2 
Subject to Articles 119.3 and 119.4, a Director shall declare the nature and extent of any interest 
permitted under this Article at a meeting of the Directors, or, in the case of a transaction or 
arrangement with the Company, in the manner set out in the Companies Acts.  
119.3 
A Director need not declare an interest in the case of a transaction or arrangement with the 
Company: 
119.3.1 
if, or to the extent that, the other Directors are already aware of the interest (and for this 
purpose the other Directors will be treated as aware of anything of which they ought reasonably 
to be aware); or 
119.3.2 
if, or to the extent that, it concerns the terms of his service contract (as defined in section 227 
CA 2006) that have been or are to be considered by a meeting of the Directors or by a 
committee of the Directors appointed for the purpose under these Articles. 
119.4 
A Director shall be deemed to have disclosed the nature and extent of an interest which consists 
of him being a director, officer or employee of any body corporate in which the Company is 
interested.   
120 
Interested Director not to vote or count for quorum 
120.1 
A Director shall not vote on, or be counted in the quorum in relation to, any resolution of the 
Board or of a committee of the Board concerning any transaction or arrangement in which he has 
an interest which is an interest which can reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a 
conflict of interest, and, if he purports to do so, his vote shall not be counted, but this prohibition 
shall not apply if Article 120.2 applies. 
120.2 
Provided that the matter has been authorised pursuant to Article 118 or comes within Article 119, 
the Director may vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of any resolution concerning 
one of more of the following matters: 
120.2.1 
any transaction or arrangement in which he is interested by means of an interest in shares, 
debentures or other securities or otherwise in or through the Company;

Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which he himself has assumed responsibility 
in whole or in part under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security; 
120.2.4 
the giving of any other indemnity where all other Directors are also being offered indemnities on 
substantially the same terms; 
120.2.5 
any proposal concerning an offer of shares or debentures or other securities of or by the 
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings in which offer he is, or may be, entitled to 
participate as a holder of securities or in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of which he is to 
participate; 
120.2.6 
any proposal concerning any other body corporate in which he does not to his knowledge have 
an interest (as the term is used in Part 22 CA 2006) in one per cent or more of the issued equity 
share capital of any class of such body corporate (calculated exclusive of any shares of that 
class in that company held as treasury shares) nor to his knowledge hold one per cent or more 
of the voting rights which he holds as shareholder or through his direct or indirect holding of 
financial instruments (within the meaning of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules) in such 
body corporate;  
 
CFD-#8811352-v1

Director's interest in own appointment 
121.1 
A Director shall not vote or be counted in the quorum on any resolution of the Board or committee 
of the Board concerning his own appointment (including fixing or varying the terms of his 
appointment or its termination) as the holder of any office or place of profit with the Company or 
any company in which the Company is interested. Where proposals are under consideration 
concerning the appointment (including fixing or varying the terms of appointment or its 
termination) of two or more Directors to offices or places of profit with the Company or any 
company in which the Company is interested, such proposals may be divided and a separate 
resolution considered in relation to each Director.  In such case each of the Directors concerned 
(if not otherwise debarred from voting under these Articles) shall be entitled to vote (and be 
counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own 
appointment. 
122 
Chair's ruling conclusive on Director's interest 
If any question arises at any meeting as whether a Director’s interest is an interest which can 
reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest (other than the Chair's 
interest) or the entitlement of any Director (other than the Chair) to vote or be counted in a 
quorum for the purposes of Article 120, and such question is not resolved by his voluntarily 
agreeing to abstain from voting or being counted in the quorum, such question shall be referred 
to the Chair of the meeting.  The Chair's ruling in relation to the Director concerned shall be final 
and conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of the interest of the Director 
concerned (so far as it is known to him) has not been fairly disclosed to the Board. 
123 
Directors' resolution conclusive on Chair's interest 
If any question arises at any meeting as to whether the Chair’s interest is an interest which can 
reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest or the entitlement of the 
Chair to vote or be counted in a quorum for the purposes of Article 120, and such question is 
not resolved by his voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting or being counted in the quorum, 
such question shall be decided by resolution of the Directors or committee members present at 
the meeting (excluding the Chair), whose majority vote shall be final and conclusive except in a 
case where the nature or extent of the interest of the Chair (so far as it is known to him) has not 
been fairly disclosed to the Board.

resolution passed by the Company or the Board or any committee, and any books, records, 
documents and accounts relating to the business of the Company, and to certify copies thereof 
or extracts therefrom as true copies or extracts; and where any books, records, documents or 
accounts are elsewhere than at the Office the local manager or other officer of the Company 
having their custody shall be deemed to be a person appointed by the Board for this purpose.  A 
document purporting to be a copy of a resolution, or an extract from the minutes of a meeting, of

evidence in favour of all persons dealing with the Company that such resolution has been duly 
passed or, as the case may be, that any minute so extracted is a true and accurate record of 
proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.   
SEALS 
127

Application of Seal 
128.1 
The Seal shall be used only by the authority of a resolution of the Board or of a committee of the 
Board authorised by the Board to give such authority.  The Board may determine whether any 
instrument to which the Seal is affixed shall be signed and, if it is to be signed, who shall sign it 
and by what means.  The Board may also determine, either generally or in a particular case, that 
a signature may be dispensed with or affixed by mechanical or other means.  Unless otherwise 
so determined:

share certificates and, subject to the provisions of any instrument constituting the same, 
certificates issued under the Seal in respect of any debentures or other securities need not be 
signed and any signature may be affixed to or printed on any such certificate by any means 
approved by the Board; and 
128.1.2 
every other instrument to which the Seal is affixed shall be signed by one Director and by the 
Secretary or by two Directors or by one Director in the presence of a witness who attests his 
signature or by such other persons as the Board or a committee of the Board shall appoint for 
that purpose (and, if the Secretary is a limited company, such company may nominate any 
person to act on its behalf). 
129 
Execution as a deed without sealing 
Any instrument signed by one Director and the Secretary, by two Directors or by one Director in 
the presence of a witness who attests his signature and, in any such case, expressed to be 
executed by the Company shall have the same effect as if executed under the Seal, provided 
that no instrument which makes it clear on its face that it is intended to have effect as a deed 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 44 - 
shall be so signed without the authority of the Board or of a committee authorised by the Board 
in that behalf.

done by or to a Director and the Secretary shall not be satisfied by its being done by or to the 
same person acting both as Director and as, or in place of, the Secretary.

requiring or authorising a thing to be done by the Secretary shall be satisfied if done by one of

Interim dividends 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Board may declare and pay such interim 
dividends (including any dividend payable at a fixed rate) as appears to the Board to be justified 
by the profits of the Company available for distribution.  If at any time the share capital of the 
Company is divided into different classes, the Board may pay such interim dividends on shares 
which rank after shares conferring preferential rights with regard to dividend as well as on 
shares conferring preferential rights, unless at the time of payment any preferential dividend is 
in arrear.  Provided that the Board acts in good faith, it shall not incur any liability to the holders 
of shares conferring preferential rights for any loss that they may suffer by the lawful payment of 
any interim dividend on any shares ranking after those with preferential rights. 
133 
Entitlement to dividends 
Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be declared 
and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid but no 
amount paid up on a share in advance of the date on which a call is payable shall be treated for 
the purposes of this Article 133 as paid up on the share.  Subject as aforesaid, all dividends 
shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any 
portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid, but if any share is 
issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, it shall rank for 
dividend accordingly. 
134 
Calls or debts may be deducted from dividends 
The Board may deduct from any dividend or other money payable to any person on or in 
respect of a share all such sums as may be due from him to the Company on account of calls or 
otherwise in relation to the shares of the Company.

135 
Distribution in specie 
The Board may, with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company, direct that payment 
of any dividend declared may be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets, and in 
particular of paid up shares or debentures of any other company, or in any one or more of such 
ways.  Where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Board may settle it as it 
thinks fit.  In particular, the Board may: 
135.1.1 
issue fractional certificates (or ignore fractions); 
135.1.2 
fix the value for distribution of such assets or any part thereof and determine that cash 
payments may be made to any members on the footing of the value so fixed, in order to adjust 
the rights of members; and 
135.1.3 
vest any such assets in trustees on trust for the persons entitled to the dividend. 
136 
Dividends not to bear interest 
Unless otherwise provided by the rights attached to the share, no dividend or other money 
payable by the Company on or in respect of a share shall bear interest as against the Company. 
137 
Method of payment 
137.1 
The Company may pay any dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share by direct debit, 
bank transfer, cheque, dividend warrant, money order or any other method (including by 
electronic media) as the Board may consider appropriate.  In respect of shares in uncertificated 
form, where the Company is authorised to do so by or on behalf of the holder or joint holders in 
such manner as the Company shall from time to time consider sufficient, the Company may also 
pay any such dividend, interest or other money by means of the relevant system concerned 
(subject always to the facilities and requirements of that relevant system). 
137.2 
Every such cheque, warrant or order may be sent by post or other delivery service (or by such 
other means offered by the Company as the member or persons entitled to it may agree in 
writing) to the registered address (or in the case of a Depositary, subject to the approval of the 
Board, such persons and addresses as the Depositary may require) of the member or person 
entitled to it (or, if two or more persons are holders of the share or are jointly entitled to it by 
reason of the death or bankruptcy of the member or otherwise by operation of law, to the 
registered address of such of those persons as is first named in the Register) or to such person 
and such address as such member or person or persons may direct in writing.  In respect of 
shares in uncertificated form, every such payment made by such other method as is referred to in 
Article 137.1 shall be made in such manner as may be consistent with the facilities and 
requirements of the relevant system concerned.  Without prejudice to the generality of the 
foregoing, in respect of shares in uncertificated form, such payment may include the sending by 
the Company or by any person on its behalf of an instruction to the Operator of the relevant 
system to credit the cash memorandum account of the holder or joint holders or, if permitted by 
the Company, of such person as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct. 
137.3 
Every cheque, warrant, order or other form of payment is sent at the risk of the person entitled to 
the money represented by it, and shall be made payable to the person or persons entitled, or to 
such other person as the person or persons entitled may direct in writing. Payment of the cheque, 
warrant, order or other form of payment (including, in respect of shares in uncertificated form, the 
making of payment in accordance with the facilities and requirements of the relevant system 
concerned) shall be a good discharge to the Company.  If any such cheque, warrant, order or 
other form of payment shall be, or shall be alleged to have been, lost, stolen or destroyed, the 
Board may, at the request of the person entitled thereto, issue a replacement cheque or warrant 
or order or make payment in some other form, subject to compliance with such conditions as to 
evidence and indemnity and the payment of out of pocket expenses of the Company in 
connection with the request as the Board may think fit.   
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 46 - 
137.4 
Any joint holder or other person jointly entitled to a share may give an effective receipt for any 
dividend or other money payable in respect of such share.   
137.5 
The Board may, at its discretion, make provisions to enable a Depositary and/or any member as 
the Board shall from time to time determine to receive any duly declared dividend in a currency 
other than sterling.  For the purposes of the calculation of the amount receivable in respect of any 
dividend, the rate of exchange to be used to determine the foreign currency equivalent of the 
amount of the dividend shall be such rate, and the payment thereof shall be on such terms and 
conditions, as the Board may in its absolute discretion determine. 
138 
Uncashed dividends 
If cheques, warrants or orders for dividends or other sums payable in respect of a share sent by 
the Company to the person entitled thereto are returned to the Company or left uncashed on 
two consecutive occasions or, following one occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to 
establish any new address to be used for the purpose, the Company shall not be obliged to 
send any dividends or other money payable in respect of that share due to that person until he 
notifies the Company of an address to be used for the purpose.  
139 
Unclaimed dividends 
All dividends, interest or other sums payable and unclaimed for a period of 12 months after 
having become payable may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit 
of the Company until claimed and the Company shall not be constituted a trustee in respect 
thereof.  All dividends unclaimed for a period of 12 years after having become payable shall, if 
the Board so resolves, be forfeited and shall cease to remain owing by, and shall become the 
property of, the Company. 
140 
Payment of scrip dividends 
140.1 
The Board may, with the prior authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company and subject to 
the provisions set out in this Article 140 and to such terms and conditions as the Board may 
determine, offer to any holders of shares (excluding any member holding shares as treasury 
shares) the right to elect to receive shares, credited as fully paid, instead of the whole (or some 
part, to be determined by the Board) of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution.   
140.2 
The resolution may specify a particular dividend (whether or not already declared), or may 
specify all or any dividends declared within one or more specified periods provided that any 
period so specified shall not end later than the third anniversary of the date of the meeting at 
which the said resolution is passed.  
140.3 
The entitlement of each holder of shares to new shares shall be such that the relevant value of 
the entitlement shall be as nearly as possible equal to (but not greater than) the cash amount 
(disregarding any tax credit) of the dividend to which such holder is entitled.  For this purpose 
“relevant value” shall be calculated by reference to the average of the middle market quotations 
for the shares on the London Stock Exchange, as derived from the Daily Official List, for the day 
on which the shares are first quoted “ex” the relevant dividend and the five subsequent dealing 
days, or in such other manner as the Board may determine on such basis as it considers to be 
fair and reasonable.  A certificate or report by the Auditors as to the amount of the relevant value 
in respect of any dividend shall be conclusive evidence of that amount. 
140.4 
No fractions of a share shall be allotted.  The Board may make such provisions as it thinks fit for 
any fractional entitlements, including provisions whereby, in whole or in part, the benefit thereof 
accrues to the Company and/or under which fractional entitlements are accrued and/or retained, 
and in each case accumulated, on behalf of any member and such accruals or retentions are 
applied to the allotment by way of bonus to, or cash subscription on behalf of, such member of 
fully paid shares and/or provisions whereby cash payments may be made to members in respect 
of their fractional entitlements. 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 47 - 
140.5 
The Board shall, after determining the basis of allotment, notify the holders of shares in writing of 
the right of election offered to them, and specify the procedure to be followed which, for the 
avoidance of doubt, may include an election by means of a relevant system and place at which, 
and the latest time by which, elections must be lodged in order to be effective save that, in the 
case of any holder of shares who has previously made, and has not revoked, an earlier election 
to receive shares in lieu of all future dividends, the Board shall instead send him a reminder that 
such election has been made, indicating how that election may be revoked in time for the next 
dividend proposed to be paid. 
140.6 
The Board may exclude from any offer any holders of shares or any shares held by a Depositary 
where the Board considers that the making of the offer to them or in respect of such shares 
would or might involve the contravention of the laws of or the requirements of any regulatory 
body or stock exchange or other authority in any territory or that for any other reason the offer 
should not be made to them or in respect of such shares. 
140.7 
The dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of election has been offered) 
shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect of which an election has been duly made (the 
elected Shares) and instead additional shares shall be allotted to the holders of the elected 
Shares on the basis of allotment determined as aforesaid.  For such purpose the Board may 
capitalise, out of any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any reserve or fund 
(including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) or of any of the profits 
which could otherwise have been applied in paying dividends in cash, as the Board may 
determine, a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the additional shares to be allotted 
on that basis and apply it in paying up in full the appropriate number of new shares for allotment 
and distribution to the holders of the elected Shares on that basis.  A Board resolution 
capitalising any part of such reserve or fund or profits shall have the same effect as if such 
capitalisation had been declared by ordinary resolution of the Company in accordance with 
Article 142 (Capitalisation of reserves) and in relation to any such capitalisation the Board may 
exercise all the powers conferred on the Board by Article 142 without need of such ordinary 
resolution. 
140.8 
The additional shares so allotted shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other and with the 
fully paid shares in issue on the record date for the dividend in respect of which the right of 
election has been offered, except that they will not rank for any dividend or other distribution or 
other entitlement which has been declared, paid or made by reference to such record date. 
140.9 
The Board may terminate, suspend or amend any offer of the right to elect to receive shares in 
lieu of any cash dividend at any time and generally may implement any scrip dividend scheme on 
such terms and conditions as the Board may from time to time determine and take such other 
action as the Board may deem necessary or desirable from time to time in respect of any such 
scheme. 
140.10 
The Board may establish or vary from time to time a procedure for election mandates in respect 
of future rights of election and may determine that every duly effected election in respect of any 
shares shall be binding on every successor in title to the holder thereof until the election mandate 
is revoked following that procedure. 
140.11 
The Board may decide how any costs relating to making new shares available in place of a cash 
dividend will be met, including deciding to deduct an amount from the entitlement of a 
shareholder under this Article 140. 
141 
Reserves 
The Board may, before recommending any dividend (whether preferential or otherwise), carry to 
reserve out of the profits of the Company such sums as it thinks fit. All sums standing to reserve 
may be applied from time to time, at the discretion of the Board, for any purpose to which the 
profits of the Company may properly be applied and pending such application may, at the like 
discretion, either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such 
investments as the Board thinks fit. The Board may divide the reserve into such special funds 
as it thinks fit, and may consolidate into one fund any special funds or any parts of any special 
funds into which the reserve may have been divided as it thinks fit.  Any sum which the Board 
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 48 - 
may carry to reserve out of the unrealised profits of the Company shall not be mixed with any 
reserve to which profits available for distribution have been carried. The Board may also, 
without placing the same to reserve, carry forward any profits which it may think prudent not to 
distribute. 
142 
Capitalisation of reserves 
The Board may, with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company: 
142.1 
subject as provided in this Article 142, resolve to capitalise any undivided profits of the Company 
not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not they are available for 
distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of any reserve or fund of the Company which is 
available for distribution or standing to the credit of share premium account or capital redemption 
reserve or other undistributable reserve; 
142.2 
appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the holders of shares in proportion to the 
nominal amounts of the shares (whether or not fully paid) held by them respectively which would 
entitle them to participate in a distribution of that sum if the shares were fully paid and the sum 
were then distributable and were distributed by way of dividend and apply such sum on their 
behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts, if any, for the time being unpaid on any shares 
held by them respectively, or in paying up in full new shares or debentures of the Company of a 
nominal amount equal to that sum, and allot the shares or debentures credited as fully paid to 
those holders of shares or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in one way and 
partly in the other, provided that: 
142.2.1 
the share premium account, the capital redemption reserve, any other undistributable reserve 
and any profits which are not available for distribution may, for the purposes of this Article 142, 
only be applied in paying up new shares to be allotted to holders of shares credited as fully 
paid; and  
142.2.2 
where the amount capitalised is applied in paying up in full new shares, the Company will also 
be entitled to participate in the relevant distribution in relation to any shares held by it as 
treasury shares and the proportionate entitlement of the members to the distribution will be 
calculated accordingly; 
142.3 
resolve that any shares so allotted to any member in respect of a holding by him of any partly 
paid shares shall, so long as such shares remain partly paid, rank for dividends only to the extent 
that such partly paid shares rank for dividends; 
142.4 
make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates (or by ignoring fractions or by accruing 
the benefit thereof to the Company rather than to the holders of shares concerned) or by 
payment in cash or otherwise as it thinks fit in the case of shares or debentures becoming 
distributable in fractions; 
142.5 
authorise any person to enter into, on behalf of all the holders of shares concerned, an 
agreement with the Company providing for either: 
142.5.1 
the allotment to them respectively, credited as fully paid up, of any shares or debentures to 
which they may be entitled on such capitalisation; or 
142.5.2 
the payment up by the Company on behalf of such holders by the application thereto of their 
respective proportions of the reserves or profits resolved to be capitalised, of the amounts or 
any part of the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing shares, 
in which event any agreement made under such authority shall be effective and binding on all 
such holders; and 
142.6 
generally do all acts and things required to give effect to such resolution.

143 
Record dates 
143.1 
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, but without prejudice to the rights attached 
to any shares and subject always to the Regulations, the Company or the Board may by 
resolution specify any date (the record date) as the date at the close of business (or such other 
time as the Board may determine) on which persons registered as the holders of shares or other 
securities shall be entitled to receipt of any dividend, distribution, interest, allotment, issue, notice, 
information, document or circular and such record date may be on or at any time before the date 
on which the same is paid, made, given or served or (in the case of any dividend, distribution, 
interest, allotment or issue) at any time after the same is recommended, resolved, declared or 
announced but without prejudice to the rights of transferors and transferees of any such shares 
or other securities in respect of the same.  No change in the register of such holders after the 
record date shall invalidate the same. 
143.2 
For the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a general meeting 
and how many votes such person may cast, the Company shall specify in the notice convening 
the meeting a time, being not more than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, by which 
a person must be entered on the register in order to have the right to attend or vote at the 
meeting.   
143.3 
When calculating the 48 hour period mentioned in this Article, no account shall be taken of any 
part of a day that is not a working day.   
ACCOUNTS 
144 
Inspection of records 
No member (other than a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or 
other document of the Company unless he is authorised to do so by statute, by order of the 
court, by the Board or by ordinary resolution of the Company. 
145 
Accounts to be sent to members 
Except as provided in Article 146, a copy of the Company’s Annual Accounts and Reports shall, 
not later than the date on which the Company gives notice of the annual general meeting before 
which they are to be laid, be delivered or sent to every member and holder of debentures of the 
Company and to the Auditors and to every other person who is entitled to receive notice of 
general meetings.  However, this Article shall not require a copy of those documents to be sent 
to any person who under the provisions of these Articles is not entitled to receive notices from 
the Company or for whom the Company does not have a current address or to more than one of 
the joint holders of any shares or debentures.  
146 
Strategic Reports with Supplementary Materials 
The Company may, in accordance with the Companies Acts and any regulations made under 
them, send a strategic report with supplementary materials to any member instead of or in 
addition to the documents referred to in Article 145.  Where it does so, the report shall be 
delivered or sent to the member, or made available on a website in accordance with the 
Companies Acts, not later than the date on which the Company gives notice of the annual 
general meeting before which those documents are to be laid.

in electronic form) to or by any person pursuant to these Articles (other than a notice calling a 
meeting of the Directors) shall be in writing and any such notice or document shall be deemed 
given, sent, issued, deposited, served, delivered or lodged (or the equivalent where it is sent in

electronic form) to an address for the time being notified for that purpose to the person giving the 
notice. 
147.2 
Subject to the Companies Acts, any notice, document or information is validly sent or supplied by 
the Company if it is made available on a website. 
147.3 
Any notice, document (including, without limitation, a share certificate) or information may be 
supplied by the Company to a member either personally or by sending it by post or other delivery 
service in a prepaid envelope addressed to the member at his registered address or by leaving it 
at that address or by any other means authorised in writing by the member concerned or, subject 
to and in accordance with the Companies Acts, by sending it in electronic form to an address for 
the time being notified to the Company by the member or by making it available on a website, by 
means of a relevant system.  In the case of a member registered on an overseas branch register 
any such notice or document may be posted either in the United Kingdom or in the territory in 
which such branch register is maintained. 
147.4 
In the case of joint holders of a share, all notices or documents shall be given to the joint holder 
whose name stands first in the Register in respect of the joint holding.  Notice so given shall be 
sufficient notice to all the joint holders.  Anything agreed or specified by the first-named joint 
holder in respect of a joint holding shall be binding on all joint holders.   
147.5 
Where a member (or, in the case of joint holders, the person first named in the Register) has a 
registered address outside the United Kingdom but has notified the Company of an address 
within the United Kingdom at which notices or other documents may be given to him or, subject 
to and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, of an address to which notices 
or documents may be sent in electronic form, he shall be entitled to have notices or documents 
given or sent to him at that address, but otherwise no such member shall be entitled to receive 
any notice or document from the Company. 
147.6 
Where a document or information is sent or supplied to the Company by a person on behalf of 
another, the Company may require reasonable evidence of the authority of the former to act on 
behalf of the latter. 
147.7 
Any amendment or revocation of a notification given to the Company under this Article 147 shall 
only take effect if in writing, authenticated by the member and on actual receipt by the Company 
thereof.

computer virus protection arrangements. 
147.9 
If on at least two consecutive occasions the Company has attempted to send notices or 
documents to a member and such notice or document has been returned undelivered, such 
members shall not thereafter be entitled to receive notices or documents or other information 
from the Company until the member shall have communicated with the Company and supplied to 
the Company (or its agent) a new registered address, or a postal address for the service of 
notices and the despatch or supply of documents and other information, or shall have informed 
the Company of an address for the service of notices and the despatch or supply of documents 
and other information in electronic form. For these purposes, any notice, document or other 
information sent by post shall be treated as returned undelivered if the notice, document or other 
information is served, sent or supplied back to the Company (or its agents) and a notice, 
document or other information served, sent or supplied in electronic form shall be treated as 
returned undelivered if the Company (or its agents) receives notification that the notice, 
document or other information was not delivered to the address to which it was sent. 
147.10 
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion choose (a) to serve, send or supply 
notices, documents or other information in hard copy form alone to some or all members and/or 
(b) not to serve, send or supply a notice, document or other information to a particular member 
where it considers this necessary or appropriate to deal with legal, regulatory or practical 
problems in, or under the laws of, any territory.

147.11 
Any notification that may be given to the Company pursuant to sections 146-150 CA 2006 shall 
be in a form prescribed by or approved by the Board. 
148 
Service of notice in case of death or bankruptcy, etc 
The Company may send or supply any notice or document on the person entitled to a share in 
consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member or of any other event giving rise to its 
transmission by operation of law, by sending or delivering it in any manner authorised by these 
Articles for the giving of a notice or document to a member, addressed to that person by name, 
or by the title of the representative of the deceased or of the trustee of the bankrupt or 
representative by operation of law or by any like description, at the address (if any) within the 
United Kingdom to which notices may be sent by electronic means supplied for the purpose by 
the person claiming to be so entitled.  Until such an address has been so supplied, any notice, 
document or other communication sent or supplied to any member pursuant to these Articles in 
any manner in which it might have been sent or supplied if the death, bankruptcy or other event 
had not occurred shall, notwithstanding that the member is then dead or bankrupt or that any 
other event giving rise to the transmission of the share by operation of law has occurred and 
whether or not the Company has notice of the death, bankruptcy or other event, be deemed to 
have been properly served or delivered in respect of any share registered in the name of that 
member as sole or joint holder.

Any notice, certificate or other document addressed to a member at his registered address or 
address for service in the United Kingdom shall, if sent by post, be deemed to have been served 
or delivered on the working day after the day when it was put in the post (or, where second-class 
mail is employed, on the second working day after the day when it was put in the post).  Proof 
that an envelope containing the notice or document was properly addressed and put into the post 
as a prepaid letter shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was given.  Any notice, certificate 
or other document not sent by post but delivered or left at a registered address or address for 
service in the United Kingdom shall be deemed to have been served or delivered on the day (or, 
if not a working day, the next working day) and at the time on which it was so delivered or left. 
149.2 
Any notice or other document addressed to a member shall, if sent using electronic means, be 
deemed to have been served or delivered on the day it was first sent or, if the day it is sent is not 
a working day, on the next working day. In proving such service or delivery it shall be conclusive 
to prove that the address used for the electronic communication was the address supplied for 
such purpose and that the electronic communication was properly dispatched by the Company, 
unless the Company is aware that there has been a failure of delivery of such notice or document 
following at least two attempts, in which case such notice or document shall be sent to the 
member at his registered address or address for service in the United Kingdom pursuant to 
Article 149.1 within 48 hours of the original electronic communication. 
149.3 
Any notice or other document sent or supplied by means of a website shall be deemed received 
by the intended recipient when the material was first made available on the website or, if later, 
when the recipient received, or is deemed to have received, notice of the fact that the material 
was available on the website. 
149.4 
In calculating any period for the purposes of this Article 149, no account shall be taken of any 
part of a day that is not a working day.

delivered when the Company (or a sponsoring system - participant acting on its behalf) sends the 
issuer instructions relating to the notice or document.   
149.6 
Any member present, either personally or by proxy, at any general meeting of the Company or at 
any meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the Company shall for all purposes be 
deemed to have received due notice of that meeting, and of the purposes for which the meeting 
was called.   
 
CFD-#8811352-v1 
- 52 - 
150 
Notice binding on transferees 
Every person who, by operation of law, transfers or by any other means becomes entitled to a 
share shall be bound by any notice in respect of that share (other than a notice given by the 
Company pursuant to Article 32 (Failure to disclose interests in shares)) which, before his name 
is entered in the Register, has been duly given to a person from whom he derives his title. 
151 
Notice by advertisement 
Any notice to be given by the Company to the members or any of them, and not otherwise 
provided for by these Articles, shall be sufficiently given if given by advertisement in at least one 
national newspaper published in the United Kingdom and, where the Company keeps an 
overseas branch register, in at least one daily newspaper published in the territory in which 
such register is maintained.  Any notice given by advertisement shall be deemed to have been 
served at noon on the day on which the advertisement first appears.  
152 
Suspension of postal services 
Subject to the Companies Acts and to any other provision of these Articles, if at any time by 
reason of the suspension, interruption or curtailment of postal services or threat thereof within 
the United Kingdom the Company is or would be unable effectively to convene a general 
meeting by notices sent through the post, of the United Kingdom, the Company need only give 
notice of a general meeting to those members with whom the Company can communicate by 
electronic means and who have provided the Company with an address for this purpose. The 
Company shall also advertise the notice in accordance with Article 151 and make it available on
