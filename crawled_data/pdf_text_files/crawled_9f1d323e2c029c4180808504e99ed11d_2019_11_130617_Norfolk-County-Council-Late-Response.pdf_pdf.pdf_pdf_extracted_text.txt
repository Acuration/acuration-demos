LATE SCOPING CONSULTATION RESPONSES 
 
Consultation bodies have 28 days to respond with any comments, 
stating either the information that they consider should be included 
in the ES or that they do not have any comments. 
 
Any responses received after the deadline will not be considered 
within the scoping opinion but are forwarded to the applicant for 
consideration in accordance with the policy set out in Advice Note 
7: Environmental Impact Assessment, Screening and Scoping. 
 
The following EIA scoping consultation responses were received 
after the consultation deadline specified under legislation and 
therefore did not form part of the Secretary of State's scoping 
opinion.

I have had a scan through the documentation regarding this proposed site. I 
think that there may be local opposition to its build in the first instance. 
However from a Fire Service view point the proposal looks okay my concern 
lies in the fact it does not seem to have made provisions for any private 
hydrants or EWS. I know that the airfield itself is now heavily commercialised 
both next to the A140 and from the Langton Green side ( Mid Suffolk 
Business Park) and water of some description must reach all of the units. 
The proposal is next to the existing power station run by EBR they have both 
EWS and suppression systems within the building. I would make an 
assumption that some sort of suppression system will be included in the 
design and run off will be held on site as part of the environmental impact 
assessment but no sign of any dedicated water supply for firefighting. There 
may be a supply through the Humpreys development next to the A140 which 
could be connected too, or a dedicated one put in from either the Castleton 
Road end or from Mid Suffolk Business park however a site of this size I 
suggest would need to have its own dedicated EWS. 16 ditches and ponds 
have been identified within 500m of the proposed site 8 within 250m which 
are either average or below, the construction of a new EWS could be used for 
our purpose and decrease the environmental impact by providing a habitat for 
wildlife if built sympathetically, with access for Fire Service. 
The proposed site is in Suffolk so they ultimately will have their say but just 
my observations.

Dear All 
 
The County Council has been consulted by the Planning Inspectorate on a 
proposed new Power Station and ancillary development across the border in 
Eye (Suffolk). Given the scale of the development it is deemed to be a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) and as such will be 
handled by the Planning Inspectorate who will make a recommendation to 
the Secretary of State who will determine the application. 
 
The proposal comprises: 
(a) A gas fired power station (299 MW); 
(b) A new electrical connection to export the power from the plant to the Grid; 
(c) A new gas pipeline connection. 
 
At this stage we are simply being consulted on the Scoping Report produced 
by the applicant and whether we consider there is any further information 
needed for inclusion in the report which should be covered in any 
Environmental Impact Assessment. 
 
A copy of the Scoping Report can be viewed using the link below:

cts/EN010060/1.%20Pre-Submission/EIA/Scoping/Scoping%20Request/
EN010060_ 
Scoping%20Report.pdf 
 
I'll pick up on the cross-boundary issues associated with grid connection i.e. 
the potential for new or upgraded power lines in Norfolk and/or substations. 
 
Please could I have any comments on the Scoping Report by 31 June 2013. 
 
In the meantime if you have any queries please call or email me. 
 
Thanks
