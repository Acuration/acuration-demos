This presentation may contain certain statements, expectations, statistics, projections and other information that are or may be forward-looking. The accuracy 
and completeness of all such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial position, strategy, projected costs, plans, 
beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc (“Drax”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), are not warranted or guaranteed. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the 
future. Although Drax believes that the statements, expectations, statistics and projections and other information reflected in such statements are reasonable, 
they reflect the Company’s current view and no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Such events and statements involve risks and 
uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. There are a number of 
factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Group, which could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or 
implied by such forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, factors such as: future revenues being lower than expected; increasing 
competitive pressures in the industry; future investment and support for the Group’s objectives; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting 
the relevant industry, both domestically and internationally, being less favourable than expected. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these 
projections or other forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, and we do not assume any responsibility for doing so.

Financial Summary
Strong financial performance
Adjusted 
EBITDA(1/2)
£398m
(2020: £412m)
1)
Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for material one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (write-down 
revaluation of deferred tax asset balances reflecting future increases in UK CT rates, acquisition costs, gain on sale of gas generation assets, restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence 
charges), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
2)
Includes continuing and discontinued operations (£20m of discontinued operation – CCGT generation assets, 2020: £46m).
3)
Cash and short-term investments of £317m less borrowings of £1,361m.

A Global Leader in Negative Emissions
Negative Emissions – a Trillion Dollar Market Opportunity
Negative emissions are a critical part of the 1.5⁰C climate pathway and BECCS has an essential role
Negative emissions needed in 1.5°C pathway (IPCC1,2) vs. supply
Source: IPCC; NGFS; McKinsey; PRI
1. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
2. Range of median values for three 1.5°C warming pathways published by the IPCC (less than 1.5°C, low 
overshoot, high overshoot).
3. Coalition for Negative Emissions.
4. Where Company A pays Company B to reduce emissions, but Company A takes all credit for the reduction. Can 
be criticised for lack of additionality.

-
Accelerated coal closure – 7GW of closure between 2020 and 2030
-
Biomass use will double from 4GW to 8GW 
-
46% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, targeting net zero by 2050
-
EU: bioenergy use to grow c.70% by 2050 to meet EU net zero targets; biomass power focused on coal dependent regions; 
BECCS encouraged through €40bn innovation fund and new negative emissions regulation
-
Germany: coal exit agreement brought forward to 2030; targeting 80% renewables; new biomass strategy and recognition 
of the need for negative emissions 
-
Poland: coal phase out agreed by 2049; biomass seen as key pillar of maintaining energy security in the energy transition 
-
Indonesia: co-firing in all coal-fired power stations – c.9Mt of coal will be replaced with biomass
-
South Korea: increased renewables from 10% to 25%, closure of 30 coal plants by 2034 and net zero target by 2050 
with key strategic pillar being deployment of CCS
-
US: targeting carbon-free grid by 2035; net zero target by 2050; long-term strategy recognises the need for biomass and BECCS
-
Canada: coal phase-out by 2030; net zero electricity system by 2035 and federal carbon price plan to increase $15/t per year 
from 2023 to reach $170/t by 2030

UK Energy Policy
To date the UK has been a leader in renewables and the decarbonisation of power
Clear Government commitments to negative emissions, biomass and BECCS
Net Zero Strategy – Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) ambition
-
5Mt pa by 2030, 23Mt pa by 2035 and up to 81Mt pa by 2050 
-
Retrofit BECCS power could be deployed by the late 2020s
-
Consultation on business models for GGRs due in Spring 2022
-
Independent regulator for GGR monitoring by 2024
-
Value of permanent removal vs. nature-based removal recognised
-
Climate Change Act amended to enable GGRs to contribute to UK carbon budgets
Biomass Policy Statement
-
Biomass is considered a renewable, low-carbon energy source 
-
Policy aims for sustainable biomass use across the economy 
-
Commitment to develop a separate BECCS business model 
UK Government Energy White Paper
-
“Biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of applications 
in which it can be used as a substitute for fossil-fuel based products and activities, 
from power generation to hydrogen production and even new forms of plastics. Along 
with its ability to deliver negative emissions, this makes biomass one of our most 
valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions.”
