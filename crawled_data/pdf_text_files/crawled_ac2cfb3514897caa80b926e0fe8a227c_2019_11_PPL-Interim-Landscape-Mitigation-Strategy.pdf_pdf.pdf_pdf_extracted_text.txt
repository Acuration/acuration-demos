INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Purpose of this Document 
1.1.1 
The Interim Landscape Mitigation Strategy (LMS) augments the 
mitigation measures included in the Environmental Statement 
(Document 6.1), Section 11, Landscape and Visual Assessment. It 
includes proposals for landscape mitigation and its aftercare for a 
period of 10 years. Indicative landscape mitigation is shown on the 
Outline Landscape Plans, Figures 11.35 – 11.37 as amended 
(Document 2.9). 
1.1.2 
The purpose of this Interim LMS is to provide a clear landscape 
mitigation rationale, which responds to the context of the Project site 
and each element of the Project. It follows guidance from the Eye 
Airfield Development Framework and supporting landscape documents; 
in order to provide appropriate mitigation. 
1.1.3 
It is an evolving document which will be developed in greater detail as 
the design of the three main components of the Project progresses. 
This version builds on the measures proposed in the previous version 
(Document 10.6, dated 21-08-2014 [Rev C]). It addresses some 
matters raised at the Issue Specific Hearings on 16/17 October 2014, 
and takes account of subsequent discussions with the local planning 
authorities and Eye Airfield Parishes Working Group. 
1.1.4 
The final version of the LMS, detailed landscape design and long term 
management proposals are referred to collectively as the landscape 
proposals throughout this document. The landscape proposals will be 
agreed with Mid Suffolk District Council (MSDC) in order to discharge 
Requirements 4 and 5 of the Development Consent Order (DCO) after 
the Order has been granted. They will respond to the specific character 
of each part of the project site as well as to the opportunities and 
constraints presented by the final design and layout of the project 
components. 
1.1.5 
Additional landscape mitigation is proposed in the Draft s106 
(document 10.4) which includes measures to reduce residual 
landscape and visual impact using a scheme of offsite planting. This 
offsite planting also provides the replacement hedgerows to mitigate 
the losses of this priority habitat (NERC ActS41).

Landscape Mitigation Proposals – DCO Requirements 
Requirement 4 Provision of Landscaping 
1.2.2 
In fulfilment of Requirement 4 of the Draft DCO (Document 3.1), prior to 
construction of the Project landscape proposals for each stage of the 
works would be produced in accordance with the Interim Landscape 
Mitigation Strategy and Outline Landscape Plans. The proposals will 
include details of the:  
 
location, number, species, size and planting density of any 
proposed planting including details of any proposed tree planting 
and the proposed times of such planting, and details of protection 
measures including guards, stakes and deer fencing; 
 
cultivation, importing of materials and other operations to ensure 
plant establishment; 
 
bunds and proposed finished ground levels; 
 
hard surfacing materials; 
 
vehicular and pedestrian access, parking and circulation areas; 
 
minor structures, such as furniture, refuse or other storage units, 
signs and lighting; 
 
measures for the management and enhancement of the 
ecological resources that will remain within the Order land on 
completion of the authorised development; 
 
implementation timetables for all landscaping works; and 
 
A scheme of landscape maintenance for the life of the authorised 
development (to include an aftercare protocol providing for joint 
annual inspections by the relevant planning authority and the 
undertaker for a period of ten years from the implementation 
date[s], as agreed pursuant to requirement 5[2]). 
Requirement 5 Implementation and Maintenance of Landscaping 
1.2.3 
Requirement 5 of the Draft DCO requires the following: 
 
All landscaping works must be carried out in accordance with the 
landscaping proposals approved under Requirement 4 in 
accordance with the relevant recommendations of appropriate 
British Standards. 
 
The landscaping works must be carried out in accordance with 
implementation timetables approved in the landscaping proposals.

 
Any tree or shrub planted as part of an approved landscaping 
scheme that, within a period of five years (save in relation to 
numbered works 1 and 5 which shall be seven years) after planting, 
is removed, dies or becomes, in the opinion of the relevant 
planning authority, seriously damaged or diseased, must be 
replaced in the first available planting season with a specimen of 
the same species and size as that originally planted, unless 
otherwise approved by the relevant planning authority.

THE PROJECT 
2.1.1 
The Project will comprise three key elements, the Power Generation 
Plant, the Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection which will be 
located within discrete areas of the Project site. 
2.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be sited centrally within the former 
Eye Airfield. 
2.1.3 
The Gas Connection comprises infrastructure required to deliver gas 
from the national transmission system to the Power Generation Plant. It 
would include the Pipeline approximately 1.7km long, a short access 
road, and a compound housing the Above Ground Installation. The 
Above Ground Installation would be sited on the southern edge of Eye 
Airfield, approximately 0.9km due south of the Power Generation Plant. 
2.1.4 
The Electrical Connection includes infrastructure required to export 
electricity generated by the Power Generation Plant to the electricity 
transmission network. It comprises an underground cable between the 
Power Generation Plant and the Electrical Connection Compound and 
Access Road from the A140 Junction. By necessity, the Electrical 
Connection Compound would be sited adjacent to an existing overhead 
high voltage transmission line, which lies approximately 1.5km due 
west of the Power Generation Plant. The access road would link the 
Electrical Connection Compound with the A140 road, which lies 
between the Power Generation Plant and Electrical Connection 
Compound. 
2.1.5 
All three elements, including the underground utilities and permanent 
access roads, would be located within agricultural land. The Power 
Generation Plant would be located within farmland adjacent to existing 
industrial development at Eye Airfield. 
2.1.6 
A full description of the Project can be found in the Environmental 
Statement (ES), Section 4 Project and Site Description. The ES 
landscape and visual assessment identified the following permanent 
landscape/visual detractors associated with each element of the 
Project. 
2.1.7 
The Power Generation Plant would result in the loss of approximately 
10ha of agricultural land in the central part of Eye Airfield. Potential 
visual detractors are:  
 
up to five stacks (up to 30m high each), 
 
the gas turbine generators (up to 19m high);

 
the number and diverse appearance of the industrial structures 
required for the power generation process;  
 
lighting; and  
 
perimeter security fencing. 
2.1.8 
The Above Ground Installation would be sited within open landscape 
on the southern edge of the Airfield adjacent to Castleton Way, and 
would result in the loss of ~0.5ha of agricultural land. The sensitivity of 
this landscape is high. Potential visual detractors are the Above Ground 
Installation structures, which would be up to 3m high, and the perimeter 
with security fencing which would be up to 2.4m high. A tarmac 
surfaced access road would be provided between Potash Lane within 
Eye Airfield and the Above Ground Installation. 
2.1.9 
The Electrical Connection Compound with an AIS variant substation 
would be set within agricultural land in a diagonal arrangement to the 
small-scale rectangular historic field pattern. It would remove part of the 
historic field pattern. Agricultural land would be lost from the site of the 
Electrical Connection leaving small areas of land that would not be 
viable for arable farming. Potential visual detractors would be the 
Electrical Connection Compound and Sealing End Compound (SEC). 
The Electrical Connection Compound would be located on the eastern 
side of the existing overhead high voltage transmission line and extend 
over an area up to150 x150m. The SEC would be located on the 
western side and cover an area approximately 45m x 22m. The 
maximum height of structures would be 12.5m. Both compounds would 
be enclosed by perimeter fencing 3.4m high. A 6m wide tarmac 
surfaced access road approximately 0.9km long between the Electrical 
Connection Compound and Old Norwich Road would lie within 
agricultural land. The Access Road would be unfenced to allow 
continuous working between fields adjoining the road.  
2.1.10 
The Electrical Connection Compound with a GIS variant substation 
would differ from an AIS variant in that it would occupy a smaller area 
of land and would be aligned to fit within the existing field boundaries 
with only a small loss of hedgerows. The compound would extend over 
an area of 100m x 80m and the height of the structures would be 
similar to the AIS variant. Some structures would be enclosed within a 
substation hall constructed as a metal frame with metal cladding. 
2.1.11 
Construction of the Pipeline and Cable will require a temporary working 
strip wider than the width of the easement. Within this area, it may be 
necessary to remove hedgerows, and field drainage may be disturbed. 
2.1.12 
It is anticipated that National Grid would require an easement 10m wide 
over the Pipeline, which would be required in perpetuity, and would

constrain planting and development within the area of the easement. 
Potential constraints in relation to the Pipeline are discussed in more 
detail at 5.1.2.

PLANNING POLICY AND GUIDANCE 
3.1 
Eye Airfield Development Framework  
3.1.1 
Two of the three main elements of the Project, the Power Generation 
Plant and Above Ground Installation, would be sited at Eye Airfield, 
near Eye, Suffolk, within the development area defined by the Eye 
Airfield Development Framework, February 2013 (EADF). 
3.1.2 
The MSDC Eye Airfield Planning Position Statement (Non-Statutory 
Planning Guidance) adopted 18th November 2013 (EAPPS) confirmed 
the Council’s decision that the EADF should guide future development 
on the airfield for both employment and housing. EAPPS section 5.2 
notes, “Landscape: It was realised from the outset that the study area 
was predominantly countryside with an agricultural character, also that 
the study area included an important part of the setting for Eye town 
and surrounding villages.  The southern part of the study area, in 
particular, formed an important element of distant views towards, from 
and across the town.” It confirms that the supporting documents, 
‘Baseline Landscape Appraisal’ and ‘Landscape Strategy’ produced by 
their consultants, Lloyd Bore, are key evidence that underpins the 
landscape proposals set out in the EADF Key Diagram. 
3.1.3 
The EAPPS highlights the need to consider landscape effects when 
developing Eye Airfield. It states, “Extension of development at Eye 
Airfield will require a break into open countryside much of which is 
highly sensitive landscape. Consequently, the EADF has adopted a 
landscape led approach which is supported by a variety of background 
evidence documents, containing justifications and additional detail for 
the proposals in the EADF.” 
3.1.4 
With respect to the site of the proposed Power Generation Plant, the 
EAPPS recommends landscape treatment should be similar to the 
structure planting that encloses the adjacent National Grid Gas 
Compressor Station. It would form a new countryside edge pending 
future development in the southern and western part of the Airfield and 
would provide an appropriate setting for future higher value business / 
industrial uses. 
3.2 
Eye Airfield Development Framework Landscape Strategy 
3.2.1 
The EAPPS requires, “Details of the mitigation of landscape should be 
considered as part of more detailed plans for development and clearly

- 9 - 
the Landscape Strategy and the EADF will be key documents in that 
consideration.” 
3.2.2 
EADF Landscape Appraisal and Strategy Document (2162-D10_C) 
provides several recommendations that should be considered when 
designing new development. Specifically, it advises developers, 
“Advance planting of the structural belts is part of the strategy so that 
the mitigation of development is effective at an earlier time, and in 
certain areas there would also be a restriction on building heights”. 
3.2.3 
EADF Appendix 05 Heritage and Landscape, Landscape Strategy 
(drawing number 2162/D10) illustrates aspirations for structure planting 
within the Airfield. With regard to Development Area 8, the Power 
Generation Plant site, linear woodland and shelterbelt planting are 
proposed to reinforce the landscape character and provide new wildlife 
habitats along its northern, southern and western boundaries. New 
hedgerow planting is indicated on the northern edge of Castleton Way 
near the Above Ground Installation compound. 
EADF LS – Views and Visual Sensitivities 
3.2.4 
With respect to potential visual impact, EADF Section 2.7 Views and 
Visual Sensitivities, advises: 
 
“Care should be taken in the design of any future development 
proposal that might impact on the viewpoints of greatest sensitivity 
and amenity. This will include resisting development in areas of 
highest sensitivity, and guiding development to areas of lower 
sensitivity; 
 
Where development takes place, careful consideration should be 
given to siting, scale, colour and massing of development and how 
its impacts might be mitigated; 
 
There are opportunities to enhance views by introducing 
shelterbelts and reinforcing hedgerows and tree belts, 
strengthening important wooded ridgeline characteristics. The 
general area of the site that contributes most to visual amenity, and 
from where views of highest sensitivity are located is the southern 
part of the site (character area A); 
 
The rural lane corridor along Castleton Way is considered 
particularly sensitive, due to the proximity of public footpaths and 
footpaths that link to it, and its topography of slopes falling to the 
south. Viewed from the south, character area A slopes up to a 
horizon occupied by the existing industrial estates and the planted 
tree belt south of the compressor site; and

- 10 - 
 
A consistent approach is required for strategic landscape planting 
across the site that could be reasonably expected to mitigate and 
minimise the landscape and visual impact of the development.” 
EADF LS – Design Codes 
3.2.5 
Design codes in the EADF Landscape Appraisal provide detailed 
guidance to protect the landscape and visual qualities of the Airfield in 
the context of future development. The design codes described below 
are relevant to the Project: 
3.2.6 
Paragraph 6.17 notes the former airstrips are unique and significant 
historical features that should be retained and emphasised by green 
structure including hedgerows, tree belts and surface water attenuation. 
This guidance would apply to the southern and western boundaries of 
the development site, which adjoin two former airstrips. 
3.2.7 
Paragraphs 6.20 - 6.21 note the potential prominence of chimneys, 
flues and other tall vertical elements on the skyline, and the need for 
sensitive planning, siting and design to reduce adverse impact on the 
landscape and its visual qualities. Design issues concerning the colour, 
finishes, orientation and scale of new industrial structures should be 
designed to minimise landscape impact. Consideration should be given 
to the use of recessive colours and matt finishes that would be less eye 
catching and less prominent in the landscape. 
3.2.8 
Paragraph 6.22 notes the planning authority’s requirement for a 
landscape and visual assessment to be undertaken in accordance with 
current best practice to support proposed development of this type. 
EADF LS – Key Mitigation Objectives 
3.2.9 
The following EADF landscape design codes provide guidance for the 
Project design and mitigation: 
 
“The landscape structure of the airfield site is to be reinforced and 
extended with an objective to connect with landscape features 
beyond the site boundary; 
 
The historical features of the site of significance are to be retained 
and incorporated into the strategic layout of the site; 
 
Any new development incorporating chimneys, flues, masts or 
other vertical structures and tall industrial buildings should be 
sensitively planned, sited and designed, and carefully considered in 
relation to sensitive local views; 
 
Proposals for landscape mitigation should be commensurate with 
the landscape and visual impacts of development proposals;

 
Lighting,  particularly  exterior  lighting,  should  be  designed  and 
installed so it minimises detrimental landscape and visual impacts; 
 
A range of appropriate tree and shrub species should be used, 
having due regard for the requirements of the National Grid 
guidance where planting is near to pipelines.” 
3.2.10 
The design of the Project will be developed in accordance with 
guidance set out in the EADF and supporting Landscape Baseline 
Appraisals and Landscape Strategy, as well as Suffolk County 
Council’s wider landscape and biodiversity aims, in order to achieve the 
following objectives: 
 
To improve the landscape quality of the site where it is degraded; 
 
To enhance the historic elements, runways, hedgerows, 
shelterbelts and veteran trees to contribute to habitat connectivity 
and local amenity; 
 
To protect and enhance the different landscape character areas, 
particularly but not exclusively the high sensitivity area in the south; 
and 
 
To protect and enhance visual amenity, including 3600 views in, out 
and across development areas. 
3.3 
Suffolk County Council 
3.3.1 
Suffolk County Council’s Advice Note ‘Planting New Woodlands 
Protecting Archaeology & Landscape Character’, provides guidance for 
the design of woodland planting in order to protect landscape 
character, historic landscape features and archaeological sites.

SITE LOCATION AND CONTEXT 
4.1 
Site Location 
4.1.1 
The Power Generation Plant and Above Ground Installation would be 
sited within Eye Airfield, a redundant WWII airfield, which lies 
approximately 2 km north west of the small town of Eye, roughly 
halfway between Norwich and Ipswich in north Suffolk. It comprises 
medium to large scale industrial development within the Eye Airfield 
Industrial Estate and Mid Suffolk Business Park, and is surrounded by 
semi-rural landscape that includes arable farmland, the A140 major 
transport route, an overhead high voltage transmission line from 
Sizewell nuclear power station, and small villages / farmsteads. 
4.1.2 
The above ground components of the Electrical Connection would be 
sited within agricultural land west of the A140 and to the north of the 
small settlement of Yaxley.

The Project is not located within any local landscape designations of 
importance. It is not located within any national or international 
designations related to landscape value. Several locally important 
Special Landscape Areas lie within 3km of the Project. 
4.2.2 
The former airfield occupies an area of approximately 250ha.  Existing 
development is concentrated in the northern and central part and 
includes wind turbines (125m high) and industrial units of varying sizes. 
The Power Generation Plant site is adjacent to the Eye Power Station, 
which has a 40m high stack, and the National Grid Gas Compressor 
Station with communications mast ~50m high. Much of the southern 
part of the area proposed for industrial development is in agricultural 
use. Land within the Airfield is relatively flat with ground levels varying 
between approximately 45m AOD (metres above Ordnance Datum) at 
the Power Generation Plant site falling to 40m AOD at the lowest point 
in the south east. Mature tree belts and hedgerows with hedgerow 
trees within Eye Airfield Industrial Estate reduce views of existing 
industrial development; the degree of screening provided by 
predominantly deciduous vegetation is reduced but still effective 
following leaf fall. 
4.2.3 
The Electrical Connection Compound and SEC would be sited within 
agricultural land characterised by a strong, historic field pattern, 
comprising small to medium scale rectangular fields enclosed by 
hedgerows and small copses. The sensitivity of this landscape is high. 
The topography of the surrounding area is generally flat which, in 
combination with existing field hedges and woodland, limits views of the 
site. Small settlements at Yaxley in the south and Thrandeston in the 
north have views of the 400kV overhead line.  
4.3 
Landscape Character 
4.3.1 
In order to develop measures that provide effective mitigation and are 
appropriate to the surrounding landscape, it is necessary to consider 
the key characteristics of the wider landscape.  
4.4 
Suffolk Landscape Character Assessment 
4.4.1 
The Project is located within the Suffolk landscape character type 
Ancient Plateau Clayland. Key characteristics found within the Project 
site and surrounding landscape are: 
 
“Flat or gently rolling arable landscape of clay soils dissected by 
small river valleys;

 
Field pattern of ancient enclosure – random patterns in the south 
but often co-axial in the north. Small patches of straight-edged field 
associated with the late enclosure of woods and greens; 
 
Dispersed settlement pattern of loosely clustered villages, hamlets 
and isolated farmsteads of medieval origin; 
 
Villages often associated with medieval greens or tyes; 
 
Scattered ancient woodland parcels containing a mix of oak, lime, 
cherry, hazel, hornbeam, ash and holly; 
 
Hedges of hawthorn and elm with oak, ash and field maple as 
hedgerow trees; 
 
Substantial open areas created for WWII airfields and by 20th 
century agricultural changes; and Network of winding lanes and 
paths often associated with hedges create visual intimacy.” 
4.4.2 
Former WWII airfields are a recurring feature of this landscape type, 
which are often the focus of industrial and transport orientated 
development and large-scale wind turbines, all of which can have 
considerable local visual impact. Specific issues relating to airfield 
development include the layout of buildings and the arrangement of 
planting to echo the alignment of runways. 
4.4.3 
Agricultural intensification within this landscape type in the 20th century 
has led to the removal of hedgerows and a thinning out of the historical 
field pattern. However, the distinctive character of this landscape type 
remains, and the qualities for which it is valued are in good condition, 
with a clearly apparent and distinctive character. This distinctive 
character is susceptible to relatively small changes and is assessed to 
be of high sensitivity. 
4.5 
EADF Landscape Appraisal 
4.5.1 
Further detailed landscape character assessment is provided in the 
EADF Landscape Appraisal, which gives a detailed analysis of 
landscape character variations and sensitivity throughout the airfield. 
The figure overleaf is an extract from this report. 
4.5.2 
The Power Generation Plant site lies in landscape character area C 
Industrial / Agricultural, which is characterised by: 
 
“Contained arable fields, bounded by industrial plots and (northern 
part) residential development; 
 
In general, views are restricted by large buildings such as the 
industrial and freight buildings within Eye Airfield; 
 
Remnant concrete runway strips alongside the arable fields;

 
Sparse boundary vegetation, opportunity for improvement; and 
 
Little topographical variation.” 
4.5.3 
Key elements that detract from the character of the site are: 
 
“Eroded / discontinuous boundary hedgerows and degraded 
 
landscape structure; 
 
Industrial units / sheds of poorer visual quality; and 
 
Lack of consistent branding / signage.” 
4.5.4 
The EADF assesses the overall sensitivity of this landscape to be low 
due to a lack of local distinctiveness and/or the presence of 
incongruous landscape elements. It notes there is great potential for 
enhancement.

4.5.5 
The Pipeline and Cable lie within landscape character area A - 
Agricultural. The EADF notes the following key characteristics of this 
area are: 
 
“Arable fields; 
 
Expansive open views, contributing to the open ‘prairie’ landscape 
(noted by the published LCA to be an undesirable characteristic, 
primarily due to a change in farming practices); 
 
Remnant wide concrete runway strips dividing the arable fields; 
 
Hedgerows with veteran trees delineating field boundaries, 
evidence of erosion in locations; and 
 
Even topography.” 
4.5.6 
The EADF assesses the overall sensitivity of this landscape to be high 
because it represents an important landscape feature forming an open 
and undeveloped gap between Yaxley, the A140, and Eye Town, 
contributing to the separation and individual identity of settlements, and 
thereby preventing coalescence. 
4.5.7 
The Above Ground Installation site lies in landscape character area F- 
Rural Lane, the key characteristics of this area are: 
 
“Castleton Way, a gently meandering lane of distinctly rural 
character; 
 
Wide, open views to the north and south, of a typically rural 
landscape, comprising farmland, hedgerows and trees. The 
hedgerow along the road is sporadic, giving the road a contained 
character in places, contrasting with open views across the 
landscape where hedgerows are absent; 
 
Signage at the entrance to the Airfield site detracts from the rural 
character of the road. Approaching Eye from the west, the road 
changes abruptly in character; and 
 
The views gained to the north, beyond the farmland are terminated 
by buildings on the employment land, and by structural planting.” 
4.5.8 
The EADF assesses the overall sensitivity of this landscape to be high 
because it provides an attractive approach to Eye from the west and 
makes an important contribution to its setting.

LANDSCAPE CONSTRAINTS 
5.1 
National Grid Constraints 
Gas Pipeline 
5.1.2 
Project planting proposals in the vicinity of the Gas Connection are 
required to follow National Grid (NG) guidance provided in, ‘Trees and 
Vegetation near Gas Pipelines’. Detailed screen planting and hedgerow 
/ hedgerow reinforcement planting proposals will be developed in 
consultation with NG after the engineering design of the Gas 
Connection has been finalised. NG’s written consent is required before 
any tree and shrub planting is carried out within the pipeline easement. 
5.1.3 
To comply with NG constraints no tree or shrub planting would be 
undertaken within 6m of the gas pipeline. All trees proposed between 
6m and 10m from the pipeline would be planted either as individual 
specimens or in a single row. The tree planting would include the 
species set out in section 8 of this report, and would exclude species 
that are unacceptable to NG (beech, hornbeam, lime, Scots pine, 
Austrian pine, oak, and cherry). Dense mass tree and shrub planting 
would be undertaken at a distance greater than 10m from the Pipeline. 
5.1.4 
Planting directly across the Pipeline would be limited to hedge planting 
with shallow rooting shrub species such as hawthorn and blackthorn. 
Planting would be undertaken only where a hedgerow is necessary for 
screening, or to reinstate a field boundary that has been severed during 
construction. 
Overhead Line 
5.1.5 
NG infrastructure guidance, ‘A Sense of Place, design guidelines for 
development near high voltage overhead lines’ provides guidance for 
the design of landscape mitigation in relation to the Electrical 
Connection Compound. Indicative screen planting proposals near the 
Electrical Connection Compound have been. Detailed planting 
proposals will be developed in consultation with NG and in accordance 
with their standards for electrical safety clearances after the design of 
the Electrical Connection has been finalised. 
5.1.6 
Detailed guidance on the selection of species will follow guidance 
provided by NHBC Technical Requirements, Part 4 Foundations, 
Chapter 4.2 Building Near Trees, and Appendix 4.2-A Water Demand 
and Mature Height of Trees. 
5.1.7 
Specific clearance for planting near overhead lines varies according to 
a number of factors including the type of pylon, operating voltage, and

local topography. Therefore, close consultation with NG will be 
undertaken once the design of the Electrical Connection Compound is 
finalised, and prior to developing the detailed landscape proposals for 
the planting and landscape mounds. It would follow guidance for 
planting heights as shown in the diagram below. Planting beneath the 
400kV overhead line would be limited to the shrub species set out in 
their guidance. The layout of planting near any pylons or overhead lines 
would be designed to allow adequate space for maintenance activities 
to take place safely and without causing damage to existing habitats 
and landscapes. 
5.1.8 
With reference to NG guidance, A Sense of Place, design guidelines for 
development near high voltage overhead lines 
(http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/senseofplace) the following tree 
species listed in section 8 could be included within each zone: 
 
Tall  - all species excluding Populus tremula; 
 
Medium – cherry and mountain ash; and 
 
Low - no tree species.

Other constraints 
The Cable 
5.2.2 
The Cable between the Power Generation Plant and Electrical 
Connection Compound would be owned and operated by the Power 
Generation Plant operator, and would not be a NG asset. No tree or 
shrub planting would be undertaken within 6m of the cables except for 
reinstatement hedge planting which may be undertaken directly above 
the cables.

LANDSCAPE MITIGATION PROPOSALS 
6.1 
Project Landscape Strategy 
6.1.1 
Mitigation within the Power Generation Plant and Above Ground 
Installation sites would follow the broad aspirations of the EADF LS. 
Effective landscape mitigation would ensure the three Project elements 
are successfully integrated into the surrounding landscape by 
screening low level structures and activities. Planting would be 
designed to address the range of situations across the Project site. The 
detailed landscape proposals would respond to the specific character of 
each part of the project site whilst enhancing wildlife habitats. 
6.2 
Power Generation Plant - Operational Phase  
6.2.1 
Mitigation in respect of the site configuration, the architectural design of 
the proposed buildings and structures, colour and materials is 
described in the Design and Access Statement.  
6.2.2 
Indicative landscape mitigation is illustrated on the Outline Landscaping 
Plans (Document 2.9), Figure 11.35 Landscape Mitigation – Power 
Generation Plant and Gas Connection. The proposals include structure 
planting on the southern boundary of the Power Generation Plant site 
which would be subject to NG planting constraints in relation to gas 
pipelines.  
6.2.3 
Structure planting on the western and southern boundaries would 
provide partial visual screening and break up the large scale of the 
proposed Power Generation Plant. From a landscape and visual 
perspective the planting would assist in breaking up the scale and 
mass of the buildings and hardstandings. 
6.2.4 
Mitigation would comprise planting belts not less than 20m wide and 
similar in character to planting at the adjacent NG Gas Compressor 
Station. The southern belt would extend the existing plantation to 
produce a significant belt of woodland that would link with planting at

Eye Power Station. It would extend across the central area of the 
Airfield and would screen views of industrial development from the 
south. Within the airfield the structure planting would visually reinforce 
the historic runways adjoining the western and southern boundaries of 
the Power Generation Plant siteThe security fencing enclosing the 
Power Generation Plant site would be set behind the structure planting 
which would create a soft ‘green edge’. It could be visible for up to five 
years before it was screened by planting.  The aesthetic design and 
colour of the fence would reduce its visual impact and improve 
integration with the surrounding landscape. In this situation a weldmesh 
fence, colour black, dark green or similar would be considered.Native 
species planting would be undertaken along part of the northern and 
eastern boundaries where screening is not required. In this location it 
would provide landscape integration by linking with existing planting at 
the adjacent Eye Power Station and NG Gas Compressor Station. The 
planting would comprise scrub and hedgerow to provide diverse 
habitats for wildlife. 
6.2.5 
Site drainage features within the north western part of the site would 
include areas of scrub planting and species rich grass areas to provide 
habitat for wildlife. Planting would include locally occurring native 
species of trees and shrubs to enrich the ecology of the area. Planting 
would be undertaken using UK provenance and grown nursery stock 
where available. 
6.2.6 
A number of small soft landscaped open spaces would be provided 
within the Power Generation Plant site near the administration facilities. 
In this location the planting would feature extra heavy standard size 
tree planting for immediate impact, shrub planting and grass areas.  
6.2.7 
Soil excavated from the Power Generation Plant site would be used to 
construct landscape mounds approximately 1.5 high within the 
structure planting on the southern part of the site. It would provide an 
immediate screen for ground level activities and would enhance the 
effectiveness of the young planting. 
6.2.8 
A detailed scheme for the creation, and management of these features 
for a period of 10 years, will be included in the landscape proposals to 
be agreed with MSDC, under DCO Requirements 4 and 5. 
6.3 
 Gas Connection – Operational Phase 
6.3.1

available at this stage and the location and footprint of the compound is 
indicative only. 
6.3.2 
In principle, landscape mitigation would include structure planting to 
screen the 3m high structures and security fence, which will be located 
behind the structure planting as described above. The aesthetic design 
and colour of the fence would be the same as the Power Generation 
Plant for visual continuity. A linear woodland belt would be planted 
along the northern boundary of the site to emphasise the adjacent 
runway. Structure planting between the western boundary of the site 
and Potash Lane within Eye Airfield would be subject to NG planting 
constraints in relation to gas pipelines. 
6.3.3 
Hedgerow / hedgerow tree planting would be undertaken along 
Castleton Way and Potash Lane within Eye Airfield.  
6.3.4 
A detailed scheme for the creation, and management of these features 
for a period of 10 years, will be included in the landscape proposals to 
be agreed with MSDC, under DCO Requirements 4 and 5. 
6.4 
Electrical Connection – Operational Phase 
6.4.1 
Indicative landscape mitigation surrounding the Electrical Connection 
Compound is illustrated on the Outline Landscaping Plans (Document 
Reference: 2.9), Figure 11.36 Landscape Mitigation – Electrical 
Connection Compound AIS Technology.  
6.4.2 
The proposed measures include extensive structure planting enclosing 
the Electrical Connection Compound in plantations up to 25m wide to 
screen views from nearby residential properties and public rights of 
way. The plantations would be laid out to respond to the rectangular 
field pattern in the vicinity of the compounds. 
6.4.3 
The security fencing enclosing the Electrical Connection Compound 
would be set behind the structure planting. The SEC compound fencing 
would be set behind a hedgerow or a linear belt of shrubs. The design 
of the fencing would comply with National Grid’s requirements for 
safety and security. It is likely to include steel palisade fencing which 
would be finished in a dark recessive colour (dark green or black) to 
blend into the surrounding landscape.. 
6.4.4 
Soil excavated from the site of the Electrical Connection Compound 
and Access Road would be used to construct landscape mounds 
approximately 1.5 high within the structure planting on the southern 
part of the site. Mounding would be provided on other boundaries of the 
compound subject to space, availability of material and compliance with 
NG requirements. The mounding would provide an immediate screen

for ground level activities and would enhance the effectiveness of the 
young planting. 
6.4.5 
Any woodland and hedgerow vegetation that was removed to 
accommodate the temporary road junction with the A140 would be 
reinstated on completion of the construction works. The detailed 
scheme of planting would include hedgerow or linear shrub planting to 
compensate for that lost as a result of the Electrical Connection 
Compound (the s106 planting also seek to address this issue). 
6.4.6 
Planting would include predominantly locally occurring native species of 
trees and shrubs woodland to enrich the ecology of the area, and would 
be undertaken using UK provenance and grown nursery stock. 
6.4.7 
Structure planting on the western boundary of the Electrical Connection 
Compound parallel with the overhead line is a priority screening area. 
Detailed planting proposals will be developed in consultation with NG to 
ensure the tallest species of trees and shrubs that comply with their 
constraints are planted in this location to produce a dense visual 
screen.  
6.4.8 
The landscaping principles described above would apply to a GIS 
variant substation, with the exception that structure planting enclosing a 
GIS substation would comprise narrower plantations of varying width 
up to 10m wide to screen views from nearby residential properties and 
public rights of way. Indicative landscape mitigation surrounding the 
Electrical Connection Compound is illustrated on the Outline 
Landscaping Plans (Document Reference: 2.9), Figure 11.37 
Landscape Mitigation – Electrical Connection Compound GIS 
Technology.  
6.4.9 
Structure planting and landscape mounding in the vicinity of the 
Electrical Connection Compound would be subject to NG planting 
constraints in relation to overhead lines. 
6.4.10 
A detailed scheme for the creation, and management of these features 
for a period of 10 years, will be included in the landscape proposals to 
be agreed with MSDC, under DCO Requirements 4 and 5.

Phasing 
Early planting 
6.5.2 
Mitigation screen planting will be undertaken at the start of the 
construction programme in areas of the Project site not required for the 
temporary construction works or permanent built development. The 
planting would grow by approximately 0.6 – 1.0m during the

construction period (~21 months) so would have more visual impact 
when the Project was commissioned. The final locations of early 
planting would be constrained by the detailed design of the project and 
the construction requirements.  
6.5.3 
Areas where early planting might be feasible within the Power 
Generation Plant are: 
 
Along parts of the northern and eastern boundary, between Eye 
Power Station and the NG Gas Compressor Station; and 
 
Part of the southern boundary adjacent to the former east - west 
runway. 
6.5.4 
Early planting adjacent to the Above Ground Installation could include: 
 
Hedge planting along Castleton Way; 
 
Hedge/structure planting along Potash Lane between Castleton 
Way and the runway adjacent to the northern boundary of the site. 
6.5.5 
Early planting may be feasible adjacent to the south east and south 
west boundaries of the Electrical Connection Compound with an AIS 
variant substation, and could comprise structure planting (up to 10m 
width). 
6.5.6 
The landscape proposals will set out in detail those areas to be subject 
to early planting to be agreed with MSDC, under DCO Requirement 4. 
Planting on completion of the construction works 
6.5.7 
All other planting and seeding would be completed in the first available 
season following completion of the construction works. 
Establishment and management of planting 
6.5.8 
All tree and shrub planting would be maintained for a period of ten 
years to ensure the planting establishes fully and achieves the 
mitigation objectives.

LANDSCAPE EARTHWORKS  
7.1 
Reinstatement of Agricultural Land 
7.1.1 
All land that is required temporarily during the construction phase would 
be reinstated primarily for agricultural use or landscape mitigation. Land 
reinstatement will follow the principles set out below to ensure 
agricultural land is restored to its former quality:

 
All soil handling works would be undertaken in accordance with the 
Construction Code Of Practice for the Sustainable Use of Soils on 
Construction Sites, DEFRA (March 2011) and the Good Practice 
Guide for Handling Soils, MAFF (2000); 
 
During site preparation topsoil and subsoil would be separately 
stripped and stored for re-use within areas to be reinstated for 
agriculture; 
 
Subsoil and topsoil would be replaced to at least the original depths 
using suitable machinery to minimise damage to the soil structure; 
 
Deep compaction would be relieved to the full depth of the restored 
profile by using heavy duty subsoiling equipment; and 
 
All restored land would be monitored and managed in accordance 
with a five year aftercare plan to ensure all defects are remedied 
and the land is gradually brought back to its former productivity. 
7.2 
Preparation of Landscape Areas 
7.2.1 
Soil handling and placement will be as described in 7.1 above. 
7.2.2 
All planting areas will receive a minimum depth of 30cm topsoil which 
will be increased where resources are available up to a maximum 
depth of 45cm. In the limited locations where they are to be used, 
feathered and standard size trees shall be planted in topsoil pits 60cm 
x 60cm x 45cm deep. Smaller cell grown or bare root stock may either 
be pit planted or notch planted. Grass/wildflower areas shall be 
topsoiled to a depth of 15cm. 
7.3 
Landscape Mounding 
7.3.1 
All landscape mounding will be constructed in accordance with 
guidance provided by the Construction Code Of Practice for the 
Sustainable Use of Soils on Construction Sites, DEFRA (March 2011), 
the Good Practice Guide for Handling Soils, MAFF (2000) and 
BS4428:1989 Code of Practice for General Landscape Operations, as 
amended.  
7.3.2 
The design of landscape mounding within the Electrical Connection 
Compound will be developed in consultation with NG to ensure safe 
clearances are maintained between the electrical infrastructure and 
planted mounds at maturity.  
Landscape mounds will be designed to blend into the landscape and 
will have shallow gradients on the outer face of the mound. The top and 
toe of all banks will be rounded. The topsoil and subsoil placement 
method will ensure settlement of fill areas is minimised whilst avoiding

undue compaction that would impede drainage and plant 
establishment. As a minimum, landscape mounding will be provided in 
the locations and to the approximate heights shown on the Outline 
Landscape Plans, Figures 11.35 – 11.37 as amended (Document 2.9).

PLANTING STRATEGY 
8.1 
General 
8.1.1 
Detailed planting proposals will be developed for each of the three 
Project components to ensure the design reflects the surrounding 
vegetation pattern and integrates successfully into the receiving 
landscape. 
8.1.2 
All existing trees and hedgerows will be retained within all parts of the 
Project site where reasonably practical. With the exception of the 
Electrical Connection Compound site, all new planting will be offset 
from the canopy spread of existing trees and hedgerows to reduce 
competition and safeguard the existing vegetation. Any existing 
hedgerows / field boundaries that lie within the proposed planting areas 
surrounding the Electrical Connection Compound will be retained.  New 
planting will be undertaken up to these hedgerows which will not be 
managed and will be allowed to break down naturally.  
8.1.3 
The outer edges of woodland planting adjoining agricultural land would 
comprise predominantly native species shrubs that would be arranged 
either as shrubby woodland edge or as hedgerow planting depending 
on the degree of enclosure required at each location. Detailed planting 
layouts for the woodland plantations and edge planting would be 
included in the landscape proposals to be agreed with MSDC. 
8.1.4 
Regarding permanent works within the Electrical Connection 
Compound Site, when preparing the detailed design and final layout of 
the Electrical Connection Compound pursuant to Requirement 3(4) of 
the draft DCO, the Applicant will seek to avoid important hedgerows 
where reasonably possible, but subject to complying to the necessary 
standards of National Grid and safety requirements. 
8.2 
Plant Species 
8.2.1 
Although plant species for the woodland and hedgerow planting will be 
selected from predominantly locally occurring native species of trees 
and shrubs to reflect local landscape character, it is anticipated that 
some blocks of planting will include a proportion of non-local species 
for quick screening. It is anticipated that a final selection tree and shrub 
species will be drawn from the list below. Species will be selected in

8.2.2 
It is expected that planting would be undertaken using UK grown stock. 
The stock should be of UK provenance where available. 
8.2.3 
The woodland/structure planting will comprise a mixture of trees and 
shrubs depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the 
location. Trees and shrubs would be randomly arranged in single 
species groups of 5 – 17 of each, species groups intermixed.  
8.2.4 
Planting will be undertaken using predominantly small size plants, such 
as 45-60cm cell grown, to aid establishment. Planting would be set out 
at close centres (approximately 2 metres) and rows, snaking where 
appropriate, to ensure it developed quickly to form a dense screen. 
8.2.5 
The proposed hedgerow / hedgerow tree species will reflect the 
species composition of nearby hedges. Any off site hedgerow 
reinforcement planting would be undertaken with the same species as 
the existing adjoining hedgerow.  
8.2.6 
Hedge planting would comprise approximately 4% trees and 96% 
shrubs. Shrubs would be randomly arranged in single species groups 
of 3 – 17 of each, species groups intermixed. Hedgerow trees would be 
planted at 1.2-1.5m high feathered whips (with stake, tie and guard), 
and randomly spaced between 5 and 11m apart. Cell grown plants 45-
60cm high would be planted in a double staggered row using 5 plants 
per metre with 35cm between the rows. Amenity grade bark mulch will 
be spread to a depth of 75mm over hedge planting plot. All hedge 
plants would be protected with clear plastic spiral guards and supported 
with a cane. 
8.3 
 Plant Protection 
8.3.1 
Plant protection measures will be included to control damage by deer 
and rabbits. Additional fencing and / or guards would be provided until 
the planting had established. 
8.3.2 
Structure planting within the Power Generation Plant and Above 
Ground Installation sites would be protected with individual shelter 
guards. Spiral guards would be fitted to all feathered and standard size 
trees. 
8.3.3 
Large areas of structure planting within the Electrical Connection 
Compound site will be enclosed with deer and/rabbit proof fencing. A 
detailed specification for this fencing will be included in the final 
landscaping proposals plans to be agreed with MSDC. Additionally, all 
transplants and/or cell grown plants would be protected with individual 
shelter guards.  Planting in smaller areas where deer fencing is

impractical would be protected with individual deer guards (1.8m tubes 
and staked). 
8.3.4 
Hedgerow trees would be protected with spiral guards at the Power 
Generation Plant and Above Ground Installation sites, and deer guards 
at the Electrical Connection Compound site. 
8.4 
Establishment and Maintenance 
8.4.1 
During the 12 month establishment period six maintenance visits would 
be undertaken at regular intervals between 1st March and 30th 
September. 
8.4.2 
At each visit all plants would be firmed up, weeds would be removed 
over a 2.0m wide strip central to hedge planting and 1.0m diameter to 
woodland plants. Dead or damaged wood would be pruned out and 
removed. All plant guards and fencing would be inspected and adjusted 
or repaired as necessary. All other vegetation within structure planting 
areas would be cut back twice during the 12 months establishment 
maintenance period, firstly in May and again in late August. All dead or 
failed plants would be replaced in the next planting season to ensure 
100% stocking. Mulch would be topped up to a full depth of 75mm in all 
plant stations and hedgerows to suppress weed growth.  
8.4.3 
Maintenance works in Years 2 to 4 after planting would include four 
maintenance visits at regular intervals between 1st March and 30th 
September. At each visit all plants would be firmed up and weed growth 
would be controlled to reduce competition with the establishing plants 
and to prevent spread to adjacent agricultural land. Dead or damaged 
wood would be pruned out and removed. All stakes, ties, plant guards 
and fencing would be inspected and adjusted, repaired or removed as 
necessary. General slow release fertiliser would be applied annually in 
early spring. Formative pruning of the tops and sides of hedges would 
be undertaken annually to encourage dense branching. All dead or 
failed plants would be replaced in the next planting season to ensure 
100% stocking. 
8.4.4 
Maintenance works during Years 5 to 7 would include four maintenance 
visits at regular intervals between 1st March and 30th September. 
8.4.5 
Weed growth would be controlled where necessary to reduce 
competition with the establishing plants and to prevent spreading to 
adjacent agricultural land. Formative pruning would be undertaken to 
trees within structure planting and hedgerow trees. Hedgerows, 
excluding hedgerow trees, would be trimmed to encourage dense 
branching within an overall design height of 4 metres where they are 
required for screening. All stakes, ties, plant guards and protective

fencing would be removed where accessible. All dead or failed 
hedgerow trees would be replaced in the next planting season to 
ensure 100% stocking. 
8.4.6 
Maintenance works during Years 8 to10 would include two 
maintenance visits each year.  Formative pruning would be undertaken 
to trees within woodland plots and hedgerow trees. Hedgerows, 
excluding hedgerow trees, would be trimmed annually to encourage 
dense branching within an overall design height of 4 metres where they 
are required for screening. 
8.4.7 
The scheme of establishment and maintenance in the final Landscape 
Plan would be agreed with MSDC, in accordance with draft DCO 
Requirements 4 and 5. 
8.5 
Monitoring 
8.5.1 
Mitigation planting would be monitored annually to ensure it is 
achieving the intended objectives to avoid or reduce adverse landscape 
and visual impacts.  
8.5.2 
In fulfilment of Requirement 5, to ensure satisfactory development of 
the landscape planting, there will be an agreed procedure for joint 
annual inspection of all mitigation areas by representatives of MSDC 
and developers/ operators of the project at the end of each growing 
season for each year of the ten year aftercare period. 
8.5.3 
Areas found not to be thriving should be treated to such additional 
works as are required to rectify the situation within the next growing 
season 
8.5.4 
Any tree or shrub planted as part of an approved landscaping scheme 
that, within the first seven years of the aftercare period is removed, dies 
or becomes, in the opinion of MSDC, seriously damaged or diseased, 
must be replaced in the first available planting season with a specimen 
of the same species and size as that originally planted, unless 
otherwise agreed in writing by MSDC. 
8.5.5 
Suspension of the aftercare period for any part of the scheme may 
occur in the event that in the opinion of MSDC there was a significant 
failure of the planting scheme that could not be satisfactorily remedied 
in the following planting season, and or part of the planting scheme was 
failing to progress to the extent that it would not achieve the objectives 
of the scheme within the aftercare period.
