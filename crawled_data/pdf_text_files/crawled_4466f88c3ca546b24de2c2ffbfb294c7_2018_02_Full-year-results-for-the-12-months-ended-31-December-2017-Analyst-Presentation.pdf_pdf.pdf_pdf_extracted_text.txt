Delivering the Strategy
Changing UK Energy System
22
UK energy 
revolution
Transition to a low-carbon economy
First step is low-carbon power generation
Requires a more flexible electricity system
Ultimately low-carbon power will need to be economic 
without support
Beyond power, the low-carbon economy will require new 
energy solutions for transport and heating
Changing UK Energy System
Increasing need for ancillary services and system support
23
Change in generation mix
Coal, older gas and nuclear approaching end of 
operational life
Increase in intermittent renewables – wind and solar
Reduction in system support capability
Ancillary services traditionally provided by thermal plant
–
Frequency, voltage control, back-up power and inertia
Capacity market
Favours low capex, low load factor
No significant new thermal plant
Increase in system volatility
Within five years corrective action may be required up to 
60% of time(1)

Abbreviation
Name
Description
API2/4/6
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on board 
(“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered FOB to 
Newcastle, Australia.
BM
BALANCING MECHANISM
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation / consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the system 
minute by minute.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and material one-off items that do not reflect the 
underlying trading performance of the business.
ELV
EMISSION LIMIT VALUES
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD. This sets annual limits on the emissions of NOX, 
SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the forthcoming PPC permit.
EUA
EU ALLOWANCE
European Union Allowances, the tradable unit under the EU ETS. Equals 1 tonne of CO2.
EU ETS
EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME
Trading Scheme within the European Union. The first compliance phase ran from 2005-07, the second 
compliance phase continued from 2008-12 and the third phase is proposed to run from 2013-2020.
IED
INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS DIRECTIVE
European Parliament and the Council directive on industrial emissions is the main EU instrument regulating 
pollutant emissions from industrial installations.
NOx
Nitrogen oxides, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD.
RO
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity from 
eligible renewable sources. 
ROC
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of the 
electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable energy 
sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation dependant on 
date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.
TRIR
TOTAL RECORDABLE  INJURY RATE
TRIR is calculated on the following basis (lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries) /
hours worked * 100,000.
