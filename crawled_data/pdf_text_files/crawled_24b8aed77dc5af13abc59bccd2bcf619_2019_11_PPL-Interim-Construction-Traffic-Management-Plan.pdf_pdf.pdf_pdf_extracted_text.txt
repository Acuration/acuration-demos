INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Commission 
1.1.1 
Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) was commissioned by Progress Power Ltd 
to undertake a Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) to 
support the Progress Power Project at the former Eye Airfield in 
Suffolk. 
1.1.2 
A Transport Assessment (TA) and other associated highways and 
transport works has been produced concurrently with this CTMP and is 
used to inform the content of this document. 
1.1.3 
The CTMP provides a framework for addressing the transport issues 
associated with the movement of construction traffic to serve the 
construction of the Project, including site access, routing, signage, HGV 
and abnormal loads, and operational matters. 
1.1.4 
The purpose of this document is to set out the principles that the 
developer and its Engineer and Construction Contractor will follow to 
manage construction traffic during the construction of the Project. 
1.2 
Background 
1.2.1 
The location of the proposed Project is shown in Figure 1-1.  The 
Power Generation Plant is located at the former Eye Airfield to the east 
of the A140, between the town of Eye and village of Yaxley in Suffolk.  
The site presently operates as an industrial estate.

EXISTING CONDITIONS 
2.1 
Existing Road Access 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is located adjacent to the A140, a primary transport 
route from which the national road network is easily accessible.  The 
road runs north-south linking Ipswich and Norwich.  Approximately 3 
km north of Eye, the A140 joins the A143, which provides access to 
Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth to the east and to Bury St Edmunds in 
the west.  To the south, the A140 joins with the A14, part of the 
Strategic Road Network. 
2.1.2 
The A140 is a 50 mph single carriageway road, reducing to 40 mph at 
the northern end of the former Eye Airfield on the approach to the 
Thrandeston Road.  The speed limits on the road network are shown in 
Figure 2-1. 
2.1.3 
The existing employment uses on the former Eye Airfield are accessed 
via the A140, B1077 and Castleton Way.  From the South, Castleton 
Way is accessed via a dedicated right turn lane from the A140 which is 
signed.  From the North, access from the A140 to the B1077 is via a left 
turn.  Rectory Road also provides access from the A140, forming a 
smaller triangle north of the airfield with the A140 and the B1077, 
however, this route is not encouraged given lack of signing for this 
direction. 
2.1.4 
Castleton Way runs from the south-west corner of the airfield 
eastwards into Eye and is an unrestricted country road for the majority 
of its length until it reaches Eye, where the speed limit turns to 30 mph.

SITE ACCESS 
3.1 
Proposed Site Access 
3.1.1 
Access to the proposed Power Generation Plant site during 
construction and operation will be from Castleton Way via the existing 
junction to the air strip.  No other vehicular access will be provided to 
and from the Power Generation Plant site. 
3.1.2 
Access to the proposed Electrical Connection Compound site during 
construction and operation will be from a new priority T-junction on the 
A140 at the northern end of the stopped-up old Norwich Road.  The 
junction would be completed before construction could begin on the 
Electrical Connection Compound. 
3.1.3 
The Electrical Connection for the site is proposed to run underground 
along a linear route corridor which will be constructed as part of the 
Project.  During construction, there will be a requirement to undertake 
work on the A140, Old Norwich Road and Leys Lane as the corridor will 
run across these roads.  The linear route corridor will run across 
existing fields to the Electrical Connection Compound. 
3.1.4 
The Gas Connection is proposed to run south from the Power 
Generation Plant site.  During construction, access would be provided 
via the entrance to the Power Generation Plant site on Castleton Way. 
Further detail on the proposals are presented below at 3.3. 
3.2 
New A140 Junction 
3.2.1 
A drawing showing the proposed arrangement of the new A140 junction 
is contained in Appendix A of this document. It has been agreed with 
the local highway authority that this now demonstrates that: 
 
There will be a 9m visibility splay; 
 
The right turn lane will be 3.5m; 
 
Access to the allotments and fishing lake will be retained using 
Old Norwich Road; and 
 
There will be sufficient space for an HGV to park in front of the 
new A140 Access when gated. 
3.2.2 
The detailed design of the new junction will ensure that the change of 
levels between the A140 and Old Norwich Road is accommodated to 
the satisfaction of the highway authority

- 7 - 
3.2.3 
Construction works of the new junction with the A140 would likely 
consist of on site preparation time consisting of excavation of verge, 
site clearance, construction of kerbs, gullies, utility diversions, new 
fence lines, sign posts and other civil works.  The road construction 
would likely last approximately 4 weeks and may involve temporary 
(night time) full closure of the road and temporary diversions routes 
would need to be agreed with Suffolk County Council (SCC).  The 
potential temporary traffic management could incorporate single lane 
night time closures.  Single lane operation of traffic must be 
accompanied by temporary traffic signals. Two way flows may be 
achievable on the A140 through a phased approach. Road closures 
should be limited to the absolute minimum necessary to ensure the 
safety of highway users and construction workers and the least 
disruption in the locality. If it is possible to do the work under traffic 
signals they must be used and road closures not requested. 
3.2.4 
A Traffic Management Plan would be produced following detailed 
design of the new junction and widening works and the traffic 
management layouts would be in Line with Chapter 8 Guidelines.  The 
works would require illumination, speed restrictions and temporary 
signing. 
3.2.5 
It has been agreed with the local highway authority that night time 
closures would only be during the hours of 20:00 and 06:00 and no 
work would be undertaken in the morning (08:00-09:30) and evening 
(16:00-18:00) peak hours.  
3.2.6 
The Applicant has agreed to remove the A140 Access during 
operations. Arrangements for the removal of the A140 are secured by 
the draft DCO (revision 5, submitted to the Examination on 17 
November 2014) Schedule 2, Requirement 6(3).    
3.3 
New Access Road 
3.3.1 
During the construction of the Access Road, access to and from the 
allotments and fishing lakes will be maintained with the use of 
banksmen or other appropriate means of traffic management to ensure 
the safety of local residents and construction workers. 
3.3.2 
During the construction period, the Access Road will be managed with 
the use of gates, controlled by banks men, who will open and close the 
gates to allow access from the A140 to authorised vehicles while 
ensuring access is maintained for members of the public wishing to 
travel up and down Old Norwich Road and Leys Lane.  
3.3.3 
At Old Norwich Road, the gate will be located on the east side of the 
carriageway, where the A140 Junction meets the existing Old Norwich 
 
 
Progress Power Project

for Progress Power Ltd 
 
- 8 - 
Road carriageway. By locating the gate in this location, the banks men 
will be able to ensure that the right of way is prioritised for public users 
of Old Norwich Road, while ensuring that unauthorised traffic cannot 
access Old Norwich Road via the A140 Junction, and waiting traffic can 
do so safely without causing an overhanging hazard onto the A140. 
Construction traffic will not be permitted to access Old Norwich Road 
from Mellis Road, Yaxley. 
3.3.4 
In the case of Leys Lane, construction traffic will be prohibited from 
travelling up and down (north and south) along Leys Lane, however it 
will be necessary for construction traffic to cross Leys Lane where the 
Access Road and Leys Lane intersect. To ensure the safety of 
pedestrians, equestrians and other road users on Leys Lane, banks 
men will be used to control the flow of traffic along the Access Road to 
ensure that all construction vehicles stop and give priority to the users 
of Leys Lane throughout the construction period.  
3.3.5 
Gates will be installed on both sides of Leys Lane to prevent access 
along the Access Road when work is not taking place during 
construction. The gates will remain in place during operation to prevent 
unauthorised access across the agricultural fields. 
3.3.6 
The construction of the Access Road (and laying of the cable) where it 
crosses Leys Lane will be carried out without the need to close the road 
by executing the work in two stages. The first stage will involve closing 
half of the carriageway, which will involve a partial restriction that will 
still allow the passage of single file traffic (including horses). Whilst the 
first half of the road is closed, the restricted side of the road surface will 
be excavated and a duct (concrete pipe or similar) will be installed in 
the ground. The road surface will then be reinstated and the partial 
road closure will switch to the other side of the road and the same 
process will be completed, with another length of duct connecting to the 
first. The road surface will then be reinstated and Leys Lane re-opened 
to traffic. 
3.4 
Potash Lane and the Above Ground Installation (AGI) Access 
3.4.1 
A drawing showing the proposed arrangement for the junction of 
Castleton Way / Potash Lane is contained in Appendix B of this 
document. It has been agreed with the local highway authority that this 
now demonstrates 
 
An increased visibility splay on the left as vehicles exit Potash 
onto Castleton Way to 160m. This is based on an 85kph design 
speed. It will need to be demonstrated that this is appropriate 
through a speed survey. A higher design speed (100kph) would 
require longer visibility splays (215m).

 
A repositioned access to the AGI to reduce the risk of headlight 
dazzle. 
3.4.2 
In addition to the repositioning of the AGI access, if headlight dazzle is 
deemed to be causing a risk to drivers, screening will be sited between 
the AGI access track and Castleton Way, the specification to be agreed 
with the local highway authority. 
3.4.3 
In addition to these measures, traffic management will be required at 
the junction of Castleton Way / Potash Lane such that during 
construction, priority is given for vehicles entering Potash Lane to 
accommodate the potential conflict in overlap between the swept paths 
of HGVs. This traffic management would be in place for the duration of 
the construction of the Project and designed in accordance with 
Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual.   
3.5 
Access Routes 
3.5.1 
A review of the possible routes for construction workers to (and from) 
the proposed Project Site access suggests five routes listed below in 
Table 3-1.

3.5.2 
As such, access to / from Castleton Way will be mainly via the A140 to 
prevent s disruption by construction traffic in Eye town centre. 
3.5.3 
Routes for HGVs would be constrained to the A140 (i.e. route 2 and 
route 5) which will minimise any potential disruption in Eye or Yaxley.

3.5.4 
Routes for abnormal loads would be constrained to suitable major 
roads, such as the A14 and A140, to enable the transportation of 
abnormal loads from the destination port to the Project Site. 
3.5.5 
The Transport Assessment revealed that there will be a limited number 
of construction staff travelling through Eye.  This is based on the gravity 
model used to identify the likely origin and destinations of staff. 
3.6 
Monitoring Strategy 
3.6.1 
HGV deliveries to site will be monitored to check compliance with the 
proposed routing strategy.  A number of measures could be utilised to 
achieve compliance and some examples are listed below.  The final 
measures will be agreed with the local highway authority and the 
contractor. 
 
Sticker system – All HGVs delivering to site would be required 
to display a sticker in the front window.  This would allow HGVs 
to be visually assessed for compliance with the proposed 
routes.  Local residents would be informed of the system so 
they were able to report any HGVs from the Progress Power 
site that routed through the villages or Eye or Yaxley. 
 
ANPR Cameras – A network of ANPR cameras could be set up 
along the proposed routes to site to ensure that HGVs travel on 
the required routes. 
 
GPS tracking – All HGVs could be fitted with GPS trackers to 
allow the routes to site to be directly monitored for compliance. 
3.6.2 
HGVs travelling from the south to Potash Lane via Castleton Way will 
be monitored for queuing at the A140 / Castleton Way junction.  
Concern has been raised that if more than 2 HGVs are queuing in the 
right turn pocket, then this might impact on northbound traffic on the 
A140.  The situation can be monitored, by a video camera or similar, to 
observe whether the right turning HGVs are causing an issue.  If a 
problem is determined, then the HGV route shall be revised so that all 
HGV traffic from the south will be routed north on the A140 to U-turn at 
the A140/A143 roundabout before travelling south on the A140 and left 
turn into Castleton Way. 
3.6.3 
Construction workers travelling to site via private modes of transport 
will be discouraged from using the B1077 between the A140 and Eye 
or from travelling through Yaxley and Mellis.  This will be done through 
the proposed travel plan measures.  SMART Measure 3 and SMART 
Measure 4 of the Travel Plan commit to undertaking a staff travel 
survey and undertaking travel plan marketing, respectively.  Workers’

home locations will be established and a Site Welcome Pack issued 
detailing information on travel to the site.  This opportunity will be taken 
to discourage the use of the B1077 and travelling through Yaxley and 
Mellis. If SCC becomes aware that the movements of construction 
workers are causing localised issues, options for mitigation measures 
will be agreed with SCC.

PHASING OF CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING HOURS 
4.1 
Construction Timetable 
4.1.1 
An assessment of the construction phase of the Project has been 
undertaken and an outline construction programme has been estimated 
for the duration of works.  The proposed construction programme is 
shown in Figure 4-1. 
Figure 4-1: Programme of Works 
 
4.2 
Construction Operating Hours 
4.2.1 
Construction traffic for both staff and HGVs would arrive at the site from 
07:00 and depart by 19:00 Mondays to Fridays. Saturday working will 
be 07:00 to 13:00. 
4.2.2 
Abnormal loads are likely to be transported outside peak hours to 
minimise disruption to the network, and each case would require 
engagement from the Local Highway Authority and Highways Agency if 
their roads are utilised.

TRAFFIC GENERATION 
5.1 
Construction Worker Traffic 
5.1.1 
A profile showing the number of workers required during the 
construction phase of the Project is shown in Figure 5-1.  This shows 
the average number of workers per day during each quarter of the 
construction period. 
Figure 5-1: Profile of Workers Required for Construction Phase of 
the Project 
 
5.1.2 
It has been forecast that construction will take 22 months, with the peak 
number of workers required in quarter 5 (estimated early 2018) with an 
average of 127 construction workers on site per day. 
5.1.3 
The workers have been split out into those who will work on the Power 
Generation Plant and the Gas Connection, and those who will work on 
the Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection.  The 
distinction has been made because routes to the two sites are separate 
and so the workers will use a different access to enter each site 
compound.

Table 5-1 shows that the AM (8:00-9:00) and PM (17:00-18:00) peak 
hours are each forecast to generate 41 vehicles trips. 
5.2 
HGV Traffic 
5.2.1 
In addition to the traffic generated by the construction workers, a 
number of heavy vehicles and abnormal loads would be required to 
deliver construction materials to the Project Site.  At this stage, an 
estimate of the likely number of loads required to deliver and to extract 
materials from the Power Generation Plant site and Electrical 
Connection Compound site has been made. 
5.2.2 
Table 5-2 and Table 5-3 show the estimated total number of HGVs 
required during the construction phase for the Electrical Connection 
Compound and Power Generation Plant respectively.  A profile of the 
anticipated HGV traffic is shown in Figure 5-2.

Table 5-4 shows a breakdown of the HGVs and a derivation of the 
arrival profile of the number of trips generated per hour.  It has been 
assumed that all HGV trips will occur at a uniform rate throughout the 
day and that vehicles will remain on site for approximately one hour.  
Therefore, all arrivals occur evenly distributed between 7:00am and 
6:00pm and all departures are distributed between 8:00am and 
7:00pm.  The maximum number of HGVs per hour occurs in quarter 1 
with 7 HGVs per hour equating to 14 inbound and outbound trips.

ABNORMAL LOADS 
6.1 
Overview 
6.1.1 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant will require the delivery of a 
number of abnormal loads for components such as the gas turbines 
and transformers.  The final CTMP will therefore consider adequate 
transport routes for the abnormal loads and address any temporary 
highways upgrades or maintenance requirements to enable delivery of 
abnormal loads to site. 
6.2 
Level and Type of Abnormal Loads 
6.2.1 
The exact number and type of these loads will depend upon the 
configuration of the Power Generation Plant and will be finalized during 
the tendering process.  The anticipated requirement would be around 
nine abnormal loads over the final phase of construction. 
6.2.2 
To minimise disruption to traffic, abnormal loads will be grouped 
together and travel in convoy wherever possible. 
6.3 
Access Routes 
6.3.1 
Careful consideration will be given to whether the highway network can 
accommodate forthcoming abnormal loads.  Prior to transportation of 
the first abnormal load, an access route survey report will be produced 
to assess route feasibility and identify any pinch-points where 
temporary highway alterations may be required. 
6.3.2 
The access route survey report will detail: 
 
Preferred access routes; 
 
Delivery routes; 
 
Potential pinch-points; and 
 
Delivery vehicles. 
6.4 
Timing of Deliveries 
6.4.1 
The transport of abnormal loads would be timed to be moved at night or 
outside of the peak traffic hours to minimise disruption.  These 
deliveries will be pre-arranged with local authorities and the police. 
6.4.2 
Abnormal loads should be delivered to site in sufficient time to meet the 
agreed erection programme, and in accordance with the requirements 
of the Police, Local Highway Authority and the Highways Agency.

6.5 
Haulage Responsibilities 
6.5.1 
The following requirements will be the responsibility of the haulage 
companies during the delivery of abnormal load components: 
 
It will be ensured that abnormal load drivers and their convoy are 
fully aware of the access route and do not deviate from this.  
 
Deliveries should only take place during the hours agreed with the 
Police and Highway Authorities. 
 
Peak traffic periods and school run periods will be avoided when 
timing deliveries to and from the construction site. 
 
Deliveries at weekends may also take place if this is acceptable to 
the Police and Highway Authorities. 
 
Written notification of the commencement of the delivery period(s) 
should be given to the Police and Highway Authority, within an 
agreed timescale, to allow for the safe coordination of the work. 
 
Further temporary warning signs may be provided on the abnormal 
load delivery route in accordance with the requirements of the 
highway authority. 
6.6 
Notifications 
6.6.1 
For the delivery of abnormal loads, it will be the responsibility of the 
haulage company to contact and inform the following stakeholders to 
inform them of delivery dates and likely impacts of delivery. 
Emergency Services 
6.6.2 
The Police, Fire and Ambulance service should be given written notice 
of the turbine deliveries, further daily notifications should be given in 
advance of the vehicles leaving the port of entry. 
Highway Authority 
6.6.3 
The Highway Authorities should be given written notice of the abnormal 
load deliveries.  The relevant authorities are likely to include the 
Highways Agency, Suffolk County Council and Norfolk County Council. 
6.6.4 
The Highways Agency uses a system called ESDAL to plan and map a 
route and automatically generate the required notifications.  For routes 
on Suffolk County Council’s roads, hauliers must first seek consent as 
follows: 
 
 
Progress Power Project 
 
Progress Power CTMP 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
December 2014 
for Progress Power Ltd 
 
- 21 - 
 
if weight exceeds 44,000 kilograms then two clear days notification 
and an indemnity must be given to relevant highway authorities for 
roads being used; 
 
if weight exceeds 80,000 kilograms then five clear days notification 
and an indemnity must be given to relevant highway authorities for 
roads being used. 
6.6.5 
Weekly updates should be provided as the delivery timetable is 
finalised with the supplier during the delivery period.  The Suffolk 
County Council website contains information regarding Strategic Lorry 
Routes and weight restrictions. 
Local Residents 
6.6.6 
Information should be provided to local residents affected during the 
delivery of the abnormal loads four weeks and one week prior to the 
commencement of deliveries.  The most appropriate way of 
communicating with local residents will be agreed upon at a later date.  
It is proposed that communication should provide the following 
information:  
 
Name and number of the Construction Site Manager; 
 
Name and number of the Turbine Supplier Site Manager; 
 
Commencement date for deliveries; 
 
Duration of delivery period; 
 
Estimated times of deliveries; 
 
Request to keep the highway clear of parked cars during the 
delivery period; and 
 
Emergency number for Local Police and Local Highway Authority 
Helpdesk 
Local Business 
6.6.7 
In addition to the leaflet drop and press notifications, local businesses 
should be approached directly to minimise the effect on their business. 
Local Services 
6.6.8 
Progress Power Limited (PPL) will make every effort to work with local 
service providers to ensure disruption caused by deliveries is avoided. 
Services of particular relevance include but are not limited to: 
 
Local buses; 
 
Refuse collection; and

 
Regular goods deliveries 
6.6.9 
Contact with these service providers should be made by the site 
manager 2 weeks in advance of planned deliveries. 
Planned Engineering Works 
6.6.10 
PPL will work with the local highway authority to identify any planned 
engineering works that conflict with the delivery route times. 
Discussions will then be made to minimise disruption to the local 
community and the planned engineering works. 
Local Community Events 
6.6.11 
The developer will work with the local council to identify any conflicts 
with school and nursery drop off and pick up locations and times. 
Construction deliveries will where possible be scheduled to avoid these 
busy periods. 
6.6.12 
Planned and notified community events will also be considered by the 
developer when scheduling deliveries. Contact by the site manager two 
weeks in advance of deliveries shall be made to the community to 
ensure any issues are considered. 
6.7 
Highway Conditions Survey 
6.7.1 
A highways condition survey along the whole of the route will be 
undertaken before the first abnormal load, and after the final abnormal 
load. 
6.7.2 
Any road maintenance issues directly caused by abnormal loads will be 
rectified.

Parking 
7.2.1 
Parking will be provided on all compounds, in line with local authority 
parking standards.  Separate parking has been identified at the Power 
Generation Plant and Electrical Connection Compound sites. The 
sufficiency of parking will be monitored and additional space created if 
required to ensure there is no parking on the public highway. 
7.3 
Gateway Points 
7.3.1 
The gateway point for the Above Ground Installation shall be situated 
so that there is sufficient room to allow queuing on the approach to the 
gate without impacting on the local road network.  The gateway to the 
Electrical Connection Compound has been positioned so that there is 
room for one HGV to queue between the gateway and the carriageway.  
All gates shall be manned during the hours of site operation so that 
HGVs may be logged on arrival and departure, and to manage any 
queuing that may occur.

LOCAL SIGNAGE STRATEGY AND MITIGATION TO B1077 
8.1 
Local Signage 
8.1.1 
To minimise disturbance to local residents, all construction traffic will be 
routed via the construction site access route, as detailed in Section 3 of 
the report. 
8.1.2 
To guide construction traffic, appropriate signage will be provided.  This 
will guide construction traffic in and out of the construction laydown and 
the power station site, and to the construction parking bays. 
8.1.3 
Construction traffic leaving the Power Generation Plant site will be 
guided to exit onto Castleton Way towards the A140, and travel 
northbound or southbound dependent on destination. 
8.1.4 
The location of the proposed signage for the Project will be developed 
as the Project progresses and in discussion with the Local Highway 
Authority.  Construction traffic on the A140 will be directed onto the 
Power Generation Plant site via Castleton Way. 
8.2 
Public Rights of Way 
8.2.1 
Signage will be placed along Public Rights of Way to inform users of 
the construction work.  All signage shall be in accordance with the 
Traffic Signs Manual, Chapter 8, Section O3.13.
