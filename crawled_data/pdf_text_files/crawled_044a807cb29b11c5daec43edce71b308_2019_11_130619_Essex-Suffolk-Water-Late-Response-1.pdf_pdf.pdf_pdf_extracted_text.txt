LATE SCOPING CONSULTATION RESPONSES 
 
Consultation bodies have 28 days to respond with any comments, 
stating either the information that they consider should be included 
in the ES or that they do not have any comments. 
 
Any responses received after the deadline will not be considered 
within the scoping opinion but are forwarded to the applicant for 
consideration in accordance with the policy set out in Advice Note 
7: Environmental Impact Assessment, Screening and Scoping. 
 
The following EIA scoping consultation responses were received 
after the consultation deadline specified under legislation and 
therefore did not form part of the Secretary of State's scoping 
opinion.

Dear Sir,
 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING (ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT)
REGULATIONS 2009 SI 2263 (as amended) (EIA Regulations)
PROPOSED Progress Power Station (the project)
PROPOSAL BY Progress Power Limited (PPL) (the applicant)
 
I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th May 2013 and received 21st 
May 2013 regarding the above.
 
We have no objection to the proposed development.  We give our consent to 
the development on the condition that new water connection is made onto our 
Company network for power station, for revenue purposes.
 
We assume that the existing water mains in the vicinity will be sufficient to 
supply the proposed power station with an adequate water supply.  We note 
that in the Parsons Brinckerhoff Report Paragraph 3.3.28 is states that, ‘…the 
total plant water requirement is negligible.’  If the water network requires 
reinforcement to enable Essex & Suffolk Water to supply sufficient quantity of 
water for the operation of the power station, then the cost of these works will 
be charged to the Client.
 
Please note, Essex & Suffolk Water are the enforcement agents for The Water 
Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 within our area of supply, on behalf of 
the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.  On completion of 
the power station, and before a water supply is provided, Essex & Suffolk Water 
should be contacted as the premises are Notifiable under Regulation 5 of the 
Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999.   Please see the copy of the 
Water Regulations Information Sheet No. IS – 0014 attached for more detailed 
information.
 
Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact 
us.
 
Yours faithfully
