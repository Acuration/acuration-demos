Executive Summary 
1.1.1 
This report presents the findings of a Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA) undertaken by 
AECOM Limited on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited. This FCA has been prepared to 
inform and support the Development Consent Order (DCO) application for a new Open 
Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection north of Swansea, Wales. 
1.1.2 
The Project will be located within the largely undeveloped rural site approximately 3km to 
the north of the city of Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and to the east of 
the existing Felindre Compressor Gas Station. The Project Site extends to approximately 
30.8 hectares (ha). 
1.1.3 
The Project Site is located within the Afon Llan catchment and is bounded and crossed by a 
series of small watercourses/drainage ditches which are fed by issues and springs 
throughout the catchment. All watercourses discharge into the Afon Llan at the southern 
reaches perimeter of the Project Site. The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and the River 
Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen Bay.  
1.1.4 
This FCA has been prepared following consultation with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) 
and City and Council of Swansea (CCS) and conforms to the requirements of ‘Technical 
Advice Note 15 (TAN15): Development and Flood Risk’ (July 2004) and the Welsh 
Government’s accompanying Development Advice Maps (DAMs). NRW fluvial and surface 
water flood maps have been used to inform the assessment of flood risk.  
1.1.5 
The Project is considered ‘Highly Vulnerable’ under the development criteria in TAN15. A 
review of the DAMs shows that a small area of the Generating Equipment Site is located 
within DAM Zone B. A small area at the southern boundary of the Project Site is within DAM 
Zone C2 however no building, development or construction activities are proposed within 
this area. The majority of the Project Site is located within DAM Zone A and is considered 
acceptable for development.  
1.1.6 
TAN15 requires that all potential flood sources that could affect the developable areas of the 
Project Site be considered. An initial assessment of flood risk to and from the Project Site 
from all sources shows: 
 
There is no risk of tidal flooding;  
 
The risk of fluvial flooding is considered to be negligible from Afon Llan and low from 
ordinary watercourses/land drainage to small areas of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Access Road;  
 
The risk of surface water flooding is considered to be medium to high for small areas of 
the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road and Gas Connection however the 
majority of the site is considered to be at low risk;  
 
The risk of sewer flooding is considered to be negligible;  
 
The risk of groundwater flooding is considered to be low; and 
 
There is no risk of flooding from artificial sources.

1.1.7 
TAN15 requires taking into account the potential impact of climate change over the lifetime 
of the development to ensure a safe and secure living and/or working environment. 
Following consultation with CCS it was agreed that a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability 
(AEP) +20% Climate Change allowance was used to assess the flood attenuation 
requirements. 
1.1.8 
It was identified the main flood risk to the Project Site is from surface water runoff and fluvial 
flooding from ordinary watercourse in small areas of the Generating Equipment Site. 
Therefore an Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) has been prepared to manage surface 
water at the Project Site and flood mitigation measures have been proposed to reduce flood 
risk to and from the Project Site.  
1.1.9 
During construction works a Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) will 
incorporate measures to prevent an increase in flooding. It is expected that this will include 
new temporary and/or permanent drainage ditches, silt traps, settlement lagoons and 
monitoring of flow routes along the eastern perimeter of the Project Site. 
1.1.10 
During operation flood mitigation measures have been proposed that include raised ground 
and finished floor levels, permanent cut off ditches, maintenance of overland flow routes 
across the whole Project Site and particularly at the eastern extent of the Generating 
Equipment Site, an easement to the existing Welsh Water Water Main that traverses the 
Generating Equipment Site, suitably sized culverts beneath the Access Road and safe 
access and egress routes for all site workers. 
1.1.11 
The Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) outlines the implementation of SuDS methods 
including swales and attenuation storage to manage surface water on and off the Project 
Site. Prior to a Ground Investigation it is assumed that the possibility of infiltration will be 
limited. Therefore to mitigate the increase in impermeable area due to the Project, flood 
attenuation storage areas for the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road Maintenance 
Compound and Above Ground Installation (AGI) are proposed to attenuate and release 
surface water to local watercourses at the existing greenfield runoff rates up to and including 
the 1% AEP + 20% Climate Change event.   
1.1.12 
The Project may have some impact on flood flows and flood storage associated with the 
local watercourse at the south eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site where 
raising of ground levels are proposed. The impact on flood storage and conveyance will be 
mitigated by the formalisation of an overland flow route along the eastern extent of the 
Generating Equipment Site. With the formalisation of the overland flow path it is anticipated 
that, combined with the steep catchment, any loss of storage and impact on conveyance will 
be minimal. Minor changes to the flood routes within the rural area are not considered to 
increase flood risk to third parties.  
1.1.13 
Through implementation of mitigation measures outlined in this document and in the outline 
drainage design it is considered by AECOM that this development is acceptable under 
TAN15 guidance.

Introduction 
2.1 
Background 
2.1.1 
This report presents the findings of a Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA) undertaken by 
AECOM Limited on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited. This FCA has been prepared to 
inform and support the Development Consent Order (DCO) application for a new Open 
Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection north of Swansea, Wales.    
2.2 
The Project 
2.2.1 
The Project comprises an OCGT peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas 
and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW), a new 
Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site, a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas 
to the Generating Equipment site from the National Transmission System and a new 
Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System (NETS).   
2.2.2 
The Project will be located within the largely undeveloped rural site approximately 3 km to 
the north of Swansea (Appendix A, Figure A1) and will extend across an area of 
approximately 30.8 hectares (ha).  
2.3 
The Purpose and Structure of this Document 
2.3.1 
According to TAN 151, highly vulnerable development (i.e. a power station) is not permitted 
within Development Advice Map (DAM) Zone C2 (Section 5). They are, however, acceptable 
in DAM Zone A and DAM Zone B where fluvial / tidal flooding is considered to be less of an 
issue. In the Section 42 consultation response, NRW requested that an FCA was 
undertaken. This was to assess the potential flood consequences associated with the Afon 
Llan and ordinary watercourses to and from the Project. A FCA has therefore been 
undertaken to determine the risks of flooding that could result from the Project and 
subsequent appropriate flood risk mitigation measures required.  
2.3.2 
The aim of the FCA is to assess flood consequences to and from the Project. Where 
appropriate, mitigation measures have been identified to manage flood consequences in line 
with planning guidance in order to support the DCO application for elements of the Project. 
In order to meet this aim the following scope of the FCA was undertaken:  
 
Collection and review of existing flood risk data including topographic data, surface 
water drainage, Natural Resources Wales information (Appendix C), development 
plans and CCS Flood Risk Management Plan;  
 
Assessment and interpretation of available information to identify potential sources of 
flood risk including groundwater, surface water and infrastructure failure; and,  
 
Review of the Project design in light of the identified flood risks and identification of 
measures, where necessary, that would manage any residual flood risk to the Project 
Site to acceptable levels.

Site Visit and Consultation 
2.5.1 
A site visit was undertaken on 8th November 2017 to assess the local topography and local 
drainage network. Observations made during this site visit have been used to inform this 
FCA.    
2.5.2 
Consultation with respect to the requirements of this FCA has been undertaken with the 
following key stakeholders between September and November 2017: 
 
NRW; and 
 
CCS 
2.5.3 
Consultation with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water was undertaken in 2014 during the scoping 
process. Further consultation is expected during the DCO consultation process during 2018. 
Information provided by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water regarding the capacity of the Water Main 
through the Project Site is considered to be current and up to date as no major upgrade has 
taken place within the intervening period. In addition, further investigations are ongoing to 
determine the location and depth of the Water Main and these will be provided in the DCO 
Application. However these investigations are not expected to influence the conclusion of 
the FCA.

Project Site and Surrounding Area 
3.1 
Existing Site 
3.1.1 
The Project Site (red outline in Figure A1, Appendix A) is located on predominately open 
agricultural land approximately 2 km north of Junction 46 on the M4, approximately 3 km to 
the north of Swansea, approximately 1km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach 
3.1.2 
The Project Site area is approximately 30.8 ha (Figure A2, Appendix A).   
3.2 
Topography 
3.2.1 
Ground levels at the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m AOD at the highest point in 
the north-west corner at Rhyd-y-pandy Road to approximately 80 m AOD along the southern 
perimeter, with ground levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction. 
The land within the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD (Figure B1, 
Appendix B). 
3.2.2 
The Felindre Gas Compressor Station located to the north of the new section of the Access 
Road is built upon raised ground at a level of approximately 87 m AOD. This is between 5-8 
m above the ordinary watercourse to the south. 
3.3 
Local Water Features 
3.3.1 
Figure B2 (Appendix B) shows the main local water features in the vicinity of the Project 
Site. A more detailed description of the local drainage network within each area of the 
Project Site can be found in Figure B3 Appendix B. 
3.3.2 
The Project Site is bound and crossed by a series of small watercourses/drainage ditches 
which are fed by issues and springs throughout the catchment. All watercourses discharge 
into the Afon Llan at the southern perimeter of the Project Site. The Afon Llan links with the 
Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen Bay.  
Main River 
3.3.3 
The Afon Llan flows in a south westerly direction along the southern perimeter of the Project 
Site. This watercourse is designated Main River and falls under the jurisdiction of NRW. 
Observations from the site visit show that the watercourse is approximately 4-5 m wide at 
the top of bank and 0.8-1.0 m deep from channel bottom to top of bank along the southern 
boundary of the Project Site. The water depth of the Afon Llan on the day of the site was 
estimated to be approximately 0.3 m deep.  
3.3.4 
The Afon Llan floodplain consists of arable and pasture fields. The Generating Equipment 
Site is located approximately 300 m to the north of the watercourse and approximately 6 m 
above the bank level of Afon Llan.

Ordinary Watercourses 
3.3.5 
A series of ordinary watercourses drain into the Afon Llan at the southern perimeter of the 
Project Site. An ordinary watercourse is a watercourse that is not designated as ‘Main River’ 
and can include rivers, streams, ditches, drains cuts, culverts, dikes sluices, sewers through 
which water passes.  The largest of the ordinary watercourses flows in a southerly direction 
(Figure B3, Appendix B) along the east perimeter of the Project Site (Stream A). 
Observations made during the November 2017 site visit estimate that Stream A has a 
channel width of approximately 1.5-2.0 m at the top of bank and is approximately 1.0 m high 
from the channel bed to top of bank. A water depth of approximately 0.3 m was observed on 
the site visit. 
3.3.6 
Stream A has a relatively steep gradient from the north east of the Generating Equipment 
Site down to the Afon Llan floodplain as it falls from approximately 89 m AOD to 76 m AOD 
across 620 m (gradient of approximately 1 in 50) which is considered to be relatively steep 
for a watercourse.  
3.3.7 
A second ordinary watercourse (Stream B)  flows south-westerly along the eastern boundary 
of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station  and crosses the proposed Access Road before 
entering the Afon Llan approximately 0.9 km to the south west (Figure B3, Appendix B). This 
watercourse has been diverted along existing field boundaries and site observations 
estimate the channel to be 1.5 m wide at the top of bank and 0.4-0.5 m high from the 
channel bed to the top of bank. A water depth of 0.3 m in Stream B was observed during the 
site visit. 
Land Drains and Drainage Ditches  
3.3.8 
A number of land drains and small drainage ditches cross the Project Site and outfall to the 
local watercourse network and eventually the Afon Llan. These primarily follow existing field 
boundaries and trackways and are generally ephemeral in nature. 
3.3.9 
A drainage ditch passes through the centre of the proposed Generating Equipment Site 
(Stream C) and outfalls into Stream A to the south east (Figure B2, Appendix B). This drains 
a small catchment area (approximately 0.1 km2) to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site and during the site visit a water depth of 0.1 m was observed in the ditch.  
3.3.10 
A second drainage ditch flows across the proposed path of the Gas Connection to the north 
of the Generating Equipment Site (Steam D) and outfalls in to Stream A to the south east 
(Figure B2, Appendix B). The drainage ditch has been diverted and is approximately 1 m 
wide at the top of bank and 0.3 m high from the channel bed to top of bank. A very low flow 
was observed during the site visit with most of the flow coming from a small leaking 
waterpipe servicing the surrounding fields. The watercourse flows away from Abegelli Farm 
and Abergelli Solar Farm at the location of the proposed Gas Connection crossing.

Ponds and Other Sources    
3.3.11 
Two heavily vegetated ponds are located within the Generating Equipment Site. As a result 
of restricted access and high groundwater table, in the area the extent of these ponds could 
not be verified.       
3.3.12 
The Afon Lliw and Lower Lliw Reservoir are located approximately 2.1 km to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site within a neighbouring topographic catchment.  As such neither 
reservoir is considered to be a flood risk to the Project Site and they are therefore not 
considered further in this report.   
3.3.13 
A series of surface water outfalls were noted from the Felindre Gas Compressor Station that 
flow into the aforementioned ordinary watercourse (Stream B).   
Existing Flood Defence Structures 
3.3.14 
There are no flood defence structures within the vicinity of the Project Site.  
3.4 
Geology and Soil  
3.4.1 
A review of the British Geological Survey (BGS) online mapping2 data indicates that the 
Project Site is underlain by bedrock of the Grovesend Formation, comprising mudstone, 
siltstone and sandstone (Figure B4, Appendix B). Superficial deposits across the Project 
Site are quite variable however the Generating Equipment Site is predominately underlain 
by Peat with the surrounding site comprising of mainly Till and Glaciofluvial sand and gravel 
deposits (Figure B5, Appendix B). No ground investigations to date have been undertaken to 
verify the depth of these superficial deposits.   
3.4.2 
The superficial glaciofluvial deposits and the bedrock geology are both classified as 
Secondary A Aquifers.  Secondary A Aquifers are defined as ‘permeable layers capable of 
supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in some cases forming 
an important source of base flow to rivers.’ 
3.4.3 
The superficial glacial till deposits are classed as Unproductive Strata,  defined as ‘rock 
layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible significance for water 
supply or river base flow’. 
3.4.4 
The Landmark Envirocheck report (2017)3 has identified no groundwater abstraction 
licences associated with the Project Site. There is only one licence located within 100 m of 
the Project Site boundary, recorded 56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, 
licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated February 1993, for general farming and domestic use.  
3.4.5 
A review of the Cranfield University/National Soil Resources Institute Soilscapes website4 
has found that that there are two main soil types across the Project Site which indicates the 
following: 
 
The Generating Equipment Site and the AGI compound are characterised by slowly 
permeable soils with a peaty surface and are considered to have impeded drainage; 
and 
 
The rest of the Project Site is characterised by freely draining loamy soils.

3.4.6 
Observations made during the site visit in November 2017 support the slow permeability of 
the Generating Equipment Site where ponding of surface water was observed throughout. 
This would support the inference that there is limited potential for infiltration of surface water 
within the area.  
3.5 
Surrounding Area 
General 
3.5.1 
The area surrounding the Project Site is, at present, predominantly rural in character, 
although there is Felindre Park and Share facility to the south and a substantial amount of 
utility infrastructure in the area, some of which crosses the Project Site (see Figure B6, 
Appendix B). Most notable is the Water Water Main that traverses the site from the north 
west to south east (Section 3.5.3) and electricity pylons associated with the Substation. 
3.5.2 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks located in and 
around the Project Site, linking it to the wider area. 
Felindre Water Treatment Works 
3.5.3 
The Felindre Water Treatment Works is situated approximately 1.4 km to the north west of 
the Generating Equipment Site. A 1.68 m diameter Water Main flows in a south easterly 
direction through the Generating Equipment Site, generally following the line of the existing 
farm trackway (Figure B6, Appendix B). The pipeline is owned by Welsh Water who has 
advised that typically a 30 m easement (15 m either side of the pipeline) is required to be 
kept clear of construction. A 60 m easement has been shown on the layout due to 
uncertainty over the accuracy and digitisation of the archive drawings (Appendix C, C1,C2 
and C3). Further investigations into the location and depth of the Water Main are ongoing.  
Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
3.5.4 
The Access Road is bound to the north by the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and is 
approximately 400 m to the west of the Generating Equipment Site. The main site is at an 
elevation of approximately 87 m AOD and lies 5-8m above the fields to the south.    
3.5.5 
During the site visit it was observed that number of small cut-off ditches drain the perimeter 
of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and outfall in to the drainage network to the south.  
Solar Farm 
3.5.6 
Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli Solar Farm are located to the east of Project Site. A 
further two Solar Farms are located in the vicinity at Rhyd-y-pandy and Abergelli Farm.

The Project 
4.1 
The Project 
4.1.1 
The Project comprises a OCGT peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas 
and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW), a new 
Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site, a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas 
to the Generating Equipment site from the National Transmission System and a new 
Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System (NETS).   
4.1.2 
Figure C1 in Appendix C shows an overview of the key areas within the Project Site. A 
detailed view of each element can be found within Figure C2 in Appendix C.  
4.1.3 
The Project consists of the following elements:  
 
Power Generation Plant: An Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power 
generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 
Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas 
flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to as the ‘Generating 
Equipment’) which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 
An Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site from the B4489 which lies to the 
west, formed by upgrading an existing access road between the B4489 junction and the 
Swansea North Substation (the Substation) and constructing a new section of access 
road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; and 
 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and equipment 
as well as containing site accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking 
and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area). There will be two Laydown areas and a 
small area within the southern Laydown Area will be retained permanently for the 
Maintenance Compound. 
 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for potential reptile translocation and ecological 
enhancement.  
 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and surface water 
drainage system.  
 
The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new above ground installation (AGI) and 
underground gas pipeline connection (the Pipeline). This is to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System. The Pipeline will follow 
an approximate north-south route corridor, between the National Transmission System 
south of Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the Generating Equipment Site.  
 
Electrical Connection: This is an underground electrical cable to export power from 
the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS). The proposed route of the Electrical Connection will be alongside the Access 
Road.   
4.1.4 
The Project has a current design and operational life of 25 years. During this period, on-
going assessment of the condition of the electricity market and energy mix would be 
undertaken to assess whether to ‘re-power’ or decommission.

Policy Context 
5.1 
National Policy 
5.1.1 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
5.1.2 
According to the policy5, an assessment of the existing baseline conditions regarding water 
quality, water resources and physical characteristics of the water environment is required 
where a proposed project is likely to have effects on the water environment. 
5.1.3 
The NPS EN – 1 also sets the requirement for additional pollution control measures that 
must be considered for all activities that discharge to the water environment and 
recommends that the Secretary of State (SoS) gives increased weight in its decision making 
to impacts on the water environment that would have an adverse effect on the achievement 
of the objectives of the WFD. 
5.1.4 
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines (NPS EN 
– 4) 
5.1.5 
The NPS EN-46 Part 2 Section 2.22.2 recognises that “constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect watercourses, 
aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone to flooding and ecological 
receptors. Pipeline impacts could include inadequate or excessive drainage, interference 
with groundwater flow pathways, mobilisation of contaminants already in the ground, the 
introduction of new pollutants, flooding, disturbance to water ecology, pollution due to silt 
from construction / demolition and disturbance to species and their habitats”. 
5.1.6 
The NPS EN-4 states that where the project is likely to have effects on water resources or 
water quality, an assessment of the impacts should be provided in line with Section 5.15 of 
EN-1. The SoS should be satisfied that the impacts on water quality and resources are 
acceptable in accordance with Section 5.15 of EN-1. 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS EN-5)  
5.1.7 
NPS EN-5 requires consideration of adaption to climate change particularly from the 
increased risk of flooding to the resilience of some of the sites infrastructure and should be 
covered in the FCA.  
Planning Policy Wales 2016 
5.1.8 
Planning Policy Wales 2016 is supplemented by TAN15 and incorporates sustainable 
development into the planning system which can be adhered to.  It requires every local 
planning authority to have produced a Local Development Plan (LDP) superseding the 
Unitary Development Plan (UDP).

TAN15 (2004) 
5.1.9 
TAN15 provides guidance which supplements the policy set out in Planning Policy Wales 
(PPW)7 in relation to development and flooding. A precautionary framework is set out which 
advises caution in respect of new development in areas at high risk of flooding and this is 
used as a guide for planning decisions. The overall aim of the precautionary framework is to 
direct new development away from those areas that have a high risk of flooding; and 
development will only be justified in these areas if it meets the criteria and tests specified in 
this guidance.  
5.1.10 
TAN15 also requires provision for future changes in flood risk are considered. Therefore the 
predicted future impacts of climate change should be accounted for within the FCA where 
they can be anticipated.  
5.1.11 
The operation of the precautionary framework is governed by DAMs made up of three zones 
(Table 5-1) which are used to trigger the appropriate planning test and definitions of 
vulnerable developments. The DAMs are based on the best available information 
considered adequate to determine when flood risk needs to be taken into consideration with 
future development.   
Table 5-1: Flood Zone Designations (source: TAN 15)

5.1.12 
The precautionary framework identifies the vulnerability of different land uses to flooding, 
and classifies proposed uses accordingly as detailed in Table 5-2. This is because certain 
flooding consequences may not be acceptable for particular development types

Use within the precautionary framework 
Emergency Services 
Hospitals, ambulance stations, fire stations, police stations, 
coastguard stations, command centres, emergency depots and 
buildings used to provide emergency shelter in time of flood. 
High vulnerable development 
All residential premises (including hotels and caravan parks), public 
buildings (e.g. schools, libraries, leisure centres), especially 
vulnerable industrial development (e.g. power stations, chemical 
plants, incinerators), and waste disposal sites. 
Less vulnerable development 
General industrial, employment, commercial and retail development, 
transport and utilities infrastructure, car parks, mineral extraction 
sites and associated processing facilities, excluding waste disposal 
sites. 
5.1.13 
Table 5-2 highlights that a power station development is classified as ‘Highly Vulnerable’; 
Project Site is located within DAM Zone C2, Zone B and Zone A (Appendix D, D1).  
5.1.14 
According to TAN15 new development should be directed away from Zone C and towards 
more suitable land in Zone A, otherwise to Zone B, where river or tidal flooding will be less 
of an issue. In Zone C there are a number of tests that need to be applied for certain types 
of development, however highly vulnerable development (i.e. power generation) and 
Emergency Services should not be permitted in Zone C2. All other development should only 
be permitted within Zones C1 and C2 if determined by the planning authority to be justified 
in that location, satisfying the tests within the TAN 15 document. 
5.1.15 
As shown in Figure D1, Appendix D, there is a small area on the southern perimeter of the 
Project Site that lies within DAM Zone C2, and therefore is not suitable for highly vulnerable 
development. No development is proposed in this area.   
5.1.16 
A small portion of the south eastern corner of the Generating Equipment Site is located 
within DAM Zone B and the majority of the site is within DAM Zone A, which under TAN15 is 
considered appropriate for ‘highly vulnerable’ development as long as all sources of flood 
risk have been considered. This FCA addresses these risks with mitigation proposed where 
necessary.

Local Policy 
5.3.1 
Swansea City Council Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 2008 
5.3.2 
The CCS UDP was adopted on 10th November 2008 and it is stated on the CCS website 
that this is the most up to date Development Plan covering the authorities' administrative 
area and is used in the determination of planning applications. 
5.3.3 
Policy EV35: Surface water run-off, and Policy EV36: Development and Flood Risk, are the 
relevant policies in CCS Unitary Development Plan. Policy EV35 affects developments that 
will lead to additional surface water run-off or cause a reduction of the quality of surface 
water run-off, and encourages SuDS implementation wherever practical to counteract this. 
Policy EV36 only allows new development within flood risk areas if developers can justify 
the location by proving the flooding consequences associated with the development are 
acceptable. Until the adoption of the Local Development Plan this is considered the most up 
to date Development Plan covering the authorities' administrative area. 
5.3.4 
Swansea City Council Local Development Plan 2017 
5.3.5 
The Project Site is located entirely within the CCS and so must comply with local planning 
policy and strategy.  
5.3.6 
The council submitted the Swansea Local Development Plan 2010-2025 (the LDP) to the 
Ministers of the Welsh Government for independent examination on 28 July 2017. The Plan 
‘provides a clear planning framework to address key issues facing the County, providing 
certainty and the basis for efficient planning decisions. Its policies and proposals will enable 
the delivery of sustainable development, and ensure that social, economic, environmental 
and cultural well-being goals are all suitably balanced in the decision making process so that 
the right development occurs in the right place’ 
5.3.7 
The LDP adopts a sustainable approach to flood risk by avoiding vulnerable development 
occurring within flood hazard areas.  Policy RP4 Avoidance of Flood Risk states that 
development will not be permitted if it causes an increase to flooding on or off site. 
5.4 
Evidence Base 
5.4.1 
Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment 
5.4.2 
CCS developed a Level 1 Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment (SFCA)8 in 2010 that 
provides an overview of flood risk from all sources and provides developers and other 
interested parties with guidance on flood risk and issues associated with flooding.  
5.4.3 
The Level 1 SCFA does not identify any historic flooding within the vicinity of the Project Site 
or highlight any specific flood risk to the Project Site.   
5.4.4 
CCS developed a Level 2 SFCA9 in 2012 that provides a more detailed appraisal of flood 
risk to Local Development Plan Candidate Sites to assess their suitability.  
5.4.5 
The Felindre area, located to the west of the Project Site, is highlighted for Mixed Used 
Major Development and includes six land parcels for development consideration. The 
Project Site is located to the east of these land parcels and should be considered within 
context of this development.

Local Flood Risk Management Strategy 
5.4.6 
In 2013, CCS developed a Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS)10, this 
document highlights the responsibilities of CCS as Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) with 
respect to flooding from surface water, ordinary watercourses and groundwater. This report 
also outlines the strategy objectives of CCS to manage flood risk. 
Flood Risk Management Plan 2015 
5.4.7 
CCS developed a Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP)11 which provides an overview of 
the flood risk in Swansea and detailed objectives for reducing flood risk in community areas 
which have been identified as being at significant flood risk.  
5.4.8 
The Project Site is situated within the Mawr Community and is not located within a Flood 
Risk Area as described within the FRMP. Borough wide measures from the CCS Flood Risk 
Management Strategy apply and there are no specific requirements for the Project Site.

Sources of Flooding and Flood Risk 
6.1 
Overview 
6.1.1 
TAN15 requires that all potential flood sources that could affect the Project be considered. 
This chapter primarily focuses on the fluvial and surface water flood risk posed to the Project 
Site location, but also considers the flood risk posed to the Project Site from other sources. 
6.2 
Tidal 
6.2.1 
Tidal flood sources include both the sea and estuaries. The assessment of tidal flood risk 
takes into account the sites distance from the Severn Estuary (approximately 9 km) and 
minimum ground levels on site (approximately 75 m AOD). This assessment identifies that 
there is no tidal flood risk posed to the Project and is therefore not considered further within 
this FCA. 
6.3 
Fluvial 
6.3.1 
The Project Site is bound by Afon Llan (Main River) to the south and an unnamed 
watercourse (Stream A) to the east. A series of small watercourses and land drains cross 
the Project Site (Stream B and Stream C) with a number of issues and sinks present within 
the vicinity of the Project Site.  
Main River 
6.3.2 
The NRW DAM Maps12 (See Figure D1, Appendix D) identify that the majority of the Project 
Site is located within DAM Zone A (little or no risk of fluvial flooding) whilst a small proportion 
of the Generating Equipment Site is located within DAM Zone B (areas known to have 
flooded historically evidenced by sedimentary deposits). A small area of the southern portion 
of the Project Site is located within DAM Zone C2 (Areas of Zone C without significant flood 
defence infrastructure) and is associated with the Afon Llan floodplain. This part of the 
Project Site is a proposed water compatible Ecological Mitigation Area (Figure C1, Appendix 
C) and is therefore not considered to be affected by or impact upon the floodplain.   
6.3.3 
A review of the NRW Fluvial Flood Map (Figure D2, Appendix D) indicates that the area 
south of the Generating Equipment Site is located within Flood Zone 3 (the extent of a flood 
from rivers with a 1% (1 in 100) chance or greater of happening in any given year) and 
coincides with the DAM Zone C2 extent. The majority of the Project Site is located within 
Flood Zone 1 with negligible risk of flooding from rivers (Figure D2, Appendix D).  
6.3.4 
The CCS Level 1 SCFA and Level 2 SFCA indicate that there has been no recorded 
historical fluvial flooding within the Project Site or within 1km of the Project Site. Further 
consultation with NRW and CCS shows that there has been no recorded flooding from 
fluvial sources on or near the Project Site since the production of the SFCAs.  
6.3.5 
Modelled river levels for the Project Site and surrounding area were requested from NRW, 
however it was stated that a “1D Steady State HECRAS catchment wide model created in 
2007.  This model is well out of date and the results would not be suitable for use in an 
FCA”.

6.3.6 
In the absence of suitable modelled flood levels, a review of the existing LiDAR data shows 
that the Generating Equipment Site is elevated at its lowest point to approximately 6 m 
above the flood plain of Afon Llan and located approximately 300 m from the current Flood 
Zone 3 extent. In conclusion, it is considered that there is negligible fluvial flood risk to the 
Project from Afon Llan due to the distance from the flood plain and the higher elevation of 
the site and the floodplain.  
Local Ordinary Watercourses and Land Drains 
6.3.7 
Section 3.3 provides a summary of the local ordinary watercourses and drainage ditches. 
Ordinary watercourses fall under the jurisdiction of CCS and land drainage is the 
responsibility of the riparian owner.    
6.3.8 
CCS has confirmed that there are no recorded historical flooding events from ordinary 
watercourses within the vicinity of the Project Site primarily due to the rural nature and size 
of the local watercourse network.  
6.3.9 
The ordinary watercourses and land drains flowing through the Project Site are not included 
within the NRW DAM or Flood Maps. There are no modelled flood water levels for any of the 
identified ordinary watercourses or drainage ditches. However, given the steep topography, 
relatively small channel dimensions and ephemeral nature of some of the drainage ditches it 
has been assumed that the risk of fluvial flooding is low, with ditches only holding water in 
higher return period storm events or when the groundwater level are raised.   
6.3.10 
In the absence of modelled flood levels for ordinary watercourses, a review of the NRW 
Updated Flood Map for Surface Water (UFMfSW) was undertaken. This dataset provides a 
high level assessment of flood risk from surface water and provides an indication of primary 
overland flow paths and likely locations of ponding. This therefore provides a coarse 
indication of the direction of out of bank flood flow routes.    
6.3.11 
The UFMfSW shows that there are two main overland flow routes passing across the 
Project Site from the high ground in the north to the Afon Llan in the south (Figure D3, 
Appendix D). The mapping indicates that the part of the Generating Equipment Site, located 
within DAM Zone B, lies at the confluence of several local watercourses and drains and may 
be at risk of flooding should the watercourse overtop in the 3.3% AEP event. However, given 
the size of watercourse observed during the site visit, steepness of the catchment and size 
of the floodplain downstream it is considered that the risk of fluvial flooding from ordinary 
watercourse is low.  
6.3.12 
It is likely that the greatest fluvial flood risk to the Project Site will be during the construction 
phase when there will be the culverting/bridging of Stream C (Access Road) and diversion of 
Stream B (Generating Equipment Site) and Stream D (Gas Connection). Flood risk 
mitigation measures to reduce this risk will be outlined within the CEMP and are discussed 
in Section 8.2.   
6.3.13 
The AGI area is not located near any watercourses and therefore the risk of flooding from 
fluvial sources is negligible.  
6.3.14 
The Pipeline and Electrical Connection, once constructed, will be underground and not at 
risk of flooding from fluvial sources.  
6.3.15 
In conclusion, it is considered that there is negligible flood risk to the Project from Afon Llan 
due to the distance from the modelled flood plain and the difference in elevation of the 
Project Site and the floodplain. Flood risk from ordinary watercourse is considered to be low 
given the size of watercourse observed during the site visit, steepness of the catchment and 
size of the receiving floodplain downstream.

6.4 
Overland Flow 
6.4.1 
Overland flow results from rainfall that fails to infiltrate the surface. This is exacerbated 
where the permeability of the ground is low due to the type of soil and geology (such as 
clayey soils) or urban development. Surface water flow may also occur in areas where steep 
topography can rapidly convey water that has failed to penetrate the surface or where the 
ground may already be saturated.  
6.4.2 
It has been identified in Section 3.4 that part of the Project Site and surrounding area is 
characterised by low permeable soils. It is likely therefore that rainfall during extreme events 
will be unable to effectively infiltrate into the ground and convey overland flow towards the 
Afon Llan.  
6.4.3 
CCS holds no records of surface water flooding within the vicinity of the Project Site.  
6.4.4 
A review of the UFMfSW indicates that the land adjacent to the local drains and 
watercourses, predominately Stream A (Generating Equipment Site) and Stream B (Access 
Road), have areas that are at a high risk of surface water flooding (3.3% AEP). The majority 
of the Project Site is considered to be at very low risk ((0.1% AEP) for Surface Water). 
Figure D3, Appendix D shows the key flow paths across the Project Site.  
6.4.5 
As described in Section 3.2 the Project Site is reasonably steep, sloping in a south easterly 
and southerly direction towards the Afon Llan floodplain. It is expected that overland flow 
from the upland areas of the Project Site would follow this natural topography away from the 
Project Site with only very localised ponding. The existing trackway to the west of the 
Generating Equipment Site conveys water to the south east away from the Project Site 
through minor land drains.  
6.4.6 
Flood risk from surface water is likely to be greatest during construction when the temporary 
diversion of overland flow routes is required for the construction of the Access Road and 
Gas Connection and permanent diversion of Stream B for the Generating Equipment Site. 
Flood mitigation measures are outlined in Section 8.2.   
6.4.7 
It is concluded that based on the UFMfSW small sections of the Generating Equipment Site, 
Access Road and Gas Connection are at a medium to high risk of flooding from overland 
flow. However the majority of the Project Site is considered to be at low risk of flooding from 
overland flow.  
6.5 
Sewer Flooding 
6.5.1 
Flooding can occur as a result of infrastructure failure, e.g. blocked sewers or failed 
pumping stations. Sewer flooding can occur when the system surcharges due to the volume 
or intensity of rainfall exceeding the capacity of the sewer, or if the system becomes blocked 
by debris or sediment. 
6.5.2 
The Project Site is located within an undeveloped area where there is limited known 
sewerage infrastructure. Flood risk from sewer sources is considered very low and therefore 
not considered further in this FCA.  
6.6 
Groundwater 
6.6.1 
Groundwater flooding occurs where groundwater levels rise above ground surface levels. 
The geology has a major influence on where this type of flooding takes place; it is most 
likely to occur in low-lying areas underlain by permeable rocks (aquifers).

6.6.2 
The CCS PFRA, Level 1 and Level 2 SFCA’s state there are no recorded flood events from 
groundwater sources within the CCS region. The FRMP indicates that there is a low risk of 
groundwater flooding across the CCS region.   
6.6.3 
A review of the BGS Area susceptible to groundwater flooding map within the Landmark 
Envirocheck Report (2017) indicates the lower areas of the Project Site and Generating 
Equipment Site are considered to have potential for groundwater flooding at the surface. 
Observations made during the site visit indicate that the water table was high within the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
6.6.4 
Due to the steep local topography at the Project Site, it is likely that any groundwater 
reaching the surface would be conveyed to the south east away from the Generating 
Equipment Site. This was observed during the site visit, as small issues were conveyed in 
ruts and drainage ditches along the trackway at the west of the Generating Equipment Site. 
Therefore by maintaining any existing flow paths during construction and operation the risk 
of ponding will be limited. 
6.6.5 
Based upon the evidence, there is potential for groundwater flooding at the surface however 
given the local topography and proposed ground levels above the groundwater flood risk is 
considered to be low.  
6.7 
Artificial Sources 
6.7.1 
Artificial sources include flood risk from sources such as storage areas and reservoirs. 
6.7.2 
The Afon Lliw and Lower Lliw reservoir are located approximately 2 km to the north of the 
Project Site within a neighbouring topographic catchment. A review of the NRW Reservoir 
Flood Risk Map shows that there is no risk of flooding from a breach to the reservoirs and as 
such is not considered further within this FCA.  
6.8 
Summary 
6.8.1 
In summary the following flood risk for the Project Site: 
 
There is no risk of tidal flooding;  
 
The risk of fluvial flooding is considered to be negligible from Afon Llan and low from 
ordinary watercourses/land drainage to small areas of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Access Road;  
 
The risk of surface water flooding is considered to be medium to high for small areas of 
the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road and Gas Connection however the 
majority of the Project Site is considered to be at low risk;  
 
The risk of sewer flooding is considered to be negligible;  
 
The risk of groundwater flooding is considered to be low; and 
 
There is no risk of flooding from artificial sources.

Climate Change 
7.1 
General 
7.1.1 
TAN15 requires that it is necessary to take account of the potential impact of climate change 
over the lifetime of the development to ensure a safe and secure living and/or working 
environment. 
7.1.2 
Welsh Government published updated climate change guidance in December 201613 . The 
guidance indicates that climate change is likely to have an impact on river flows, sea levels, 
rainfall intensity, wave height and wind speed. 
7.1.3 
Details of the methods and justifications for calculating the projected climate change 
allowances can be found on the Welsh Government website and will not be replicated in this 
document.      
7.2 
Peak River Flows 
7.2.1 
The peak river flow allowances show the anticipated changes to peak flow by river basin 
district. The Project Site is located within the West Wales river basin district and Table 7-1 
shows the peak river flow allowances.

The lifetime of the development is considered to be a minimum of 25 years and through 
correspondence with NRW it is agreed that the Central estimate for the Total potential 
change anticipated by the 2050’s (25%) can be used in this assessment. The period 
described as the 2050’s is not defined within the Welsh Government Climate Change 
Guidance (2016). However, within the Environment Agency Climate Change Allowances15 
(2016) it is stated for the Dee and Severn River Basin Districts that the period, 2050’s, is 
defined as 2040-2069. Therefore this assessment is considered representative for a design 
life up to 2069.

Increased rainfall affects river levels, land and drainage systems. Table 7-2 shows the 
anticipated changes in extreme rainfall intensity in small and urban catchments based upon 
English guidelines. At the time of writing no specific Welsh Government guidance was 
available and so this is considered the most up to date peak rainfall allowances.

It was agreed through correspondence with CCS and NRW that the Upper Central estimate

assessment. As described in Section 7.2.2 this assessment is considered representative for 
a design life up to 2069.    
7.4 
Impact of Climate Change on Flooding Sources 
Fluvial 
7.4.1 
The effect of climate change on peak river flow and consequently on flood levels within Afon 
Llan is unlikely to increase the flood risk from fluvial sources to the Project Site given the 
present distance and elevation distance from the watercourse.  
Overland Flow 
7.4.2 
Climate change must be taken into account when considering surface water runoff 
generated by the development site. The increase in rainfall intensity will result in increased 
surface water runoff rates and volumes. Therefore the drainage systems associated with the 
development must be designed to accommodate the climate change allowances in 
compliance with TAN15.   
7.4.3 
To accommodate increased surface water volumes peak runoff from the development will be 
attenuated up to and including the 1% + 20% Climate Change AEP event using onsite 
storage. All cut off ditches and culverts will be designed to a similar standard to ensure no 
increased flood risk to the Project Site from overland flow. Section 8.3 and Appendix E 
outline how surface runoff will be managed on the Project Site.

Groundwater 
7.4.4 
The predicted increase in wetness of winters and the intensity of storm events as a result of 
climate change could impact the groundwater level fluctuations at the Project Site and 
possibly increase the fluctuations of the groundwater table. This may therefore increase the 
likelihood of groundwater emergence and the potential for groundwater flooding to impact 
the development.  
7.4.5 
Once constructed, the Project will be largely covered by hard standing, which reduces 
infiltration and the likelihood of localised groundwater flooding reaching the surface. Cut off 
trenches along the northern and western perimeter of the Project Site will intercept any 
overland flow as a result of increased ground water levels and discharge in to the 
attenuation storage and local watercourse.  
7.4.6 
It is therefore anticipated that the risk from groundwater sources will remain low and not 
increase significantly as a result of climate change.

8. 
Flood Risk Management Measures 
8.1 
General 
8.1.1 
It has been demonstrated within Section 6 that the main flood risk to the Project Site is from 
surface water runoff and fluvial flooding from ordinary watercourse during construction 
operation and decommissioning, which therefore forms the basis for this assessment. This 
chapter identifies the flood risk management measures required to mitigate against the flood 
risk which has been identified in accordance with TAN15 requirements. 
8.2 
Flood Risk Management Measures 
8.2.1 
An Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) has been prepared to manage surface water 
flood risk to and from the Project Site and is provided within Appendix E. The surface water 
drainage system proposed adopts the principles within The SuDS Manual – CIRIA 75317 and 
industry best practice and is describe further in Section 8.3.  
8.2.2 
The following key measures to mitigate flood risk to the Project Site during construction will 
be implemented to reduce flood risk to the Project Site: 
Construction 
8.2.3 
Construction activities associated with the Project intercept a number of overland flow routes 
as discussed in Section 6.4 which is most notable at the Access Road, Generating 
Equipment Site and Gas Connection. Given that the highest flood risk for the Project is from 
surface water and/or ordinary watercourse flooding mitigation measures are focussed on 
managing and mitigating risks to the temporary works as well as not increasing flood risk off 
site. 
8.2.4 
During construction, pollution prevention guidelines will be followed by the contractor.  
8.2.5 
The proposed works involve new crossings, diversions and temporary diversions of local 
watercourses. Any proposed works to the watercourses require Land Drainage Consent 
from CCS and must be granted before any works can take place. Diversion and crossing of 
local watercourses have been kept to a minimum within the Project design.  
8.2.6 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will incorporate measures to 
prevent an increase in flooding during construction works. It is expected that the CEMP will 
include provisions such as: 
 
New temporary and/or permanent drainage ditches to prevent uncontrolled surface 
runoff of contaminated water;  
 
Silt traps within drainage ditches to reduce the flow of suspended solids from the 
Project Site;  
 
Settlement lagoons and/or proprietary settlement tanks as required to reduce the flow 
of suspended solids from site;  
 
Suitable layout of the construction site and application of suitable management 
techniques to prevent runoff from stockpiles directly ion to the watercourse; and 
 
Monitoring of overland flow routes along the eastern extent of the Generating 
Equipment Site to ensure minimal impedance of flow routes.

Operation 
8.2.7 
To ensure the ongoing operation of the Project, an Outline Drainage Strategy has been 
prepared (Section 8.3) to manage foul, oily and surface water from the Project Site and flood 
risk mitigation measures have been proposed.   
8.2.8 
The following measures will be implemented to ensure the operation of the Project is 
protected:  
Raised Ground and Finished Floor Levels 
8.2.9 
Ground levels across the Generating Equipment Site will be raised to provide three platform 
terraces for the development. Indicative proposed site levels are provided within Figures C3 
and Figure C4, Appendix C, which demonstrate that the Generating Equipment will be at a 
proposed level of 89.3 m AOD and 86.8 m AOD whilst the attenuation storage area terrace 
will be at a proposed elevation of 84.0 m AOD.  The indicative proposed levels are 
approximately 2 m above higher than the existing south east corner of the Project Site, 
which is currently at the highest risk of flooding. It is anticipated that the raised levels will be 
sufficiently resilient to future climate change levels given the steep topography of the site 
and size of the floodplain.   
8.2.10 
The north east corner of the Generating Equipment Site will be within a cutting below the 
existing ground levels. In this area potential overland flow and or watercourse overtopping 
will be managed by either localised earth mounding and/or a suitably sized cut off ditch (see 
below).  
8.2.11 
As an additional measure the finished floor levels In the Generating Equipment Site will be 
0.15 m above the site road crown level with plant plinths 0.3 m above the site level. This will 
reduce the Power Generation Plant vulnerability to flooding.  
Cut off ditches/watercourses 
8.2.12 
To prevent inundation of the Generating Equipment Site from surface runoff down the 
hillside, cut off drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill Generating Equipment Site 
perimeter. The location of these cut of ditches are located within Appendix E.  These new 
drainage ditches will be designed to divert surface runoff around the Generating Equipment 
Site and return downstream back to the original drainage ditches/watercourse. The final 
design of the cut off ditches will be completed at detailed design however they should be 
designed to adequately accommodate the 1% + 20% Climate Change AEP flows.  
8.2.13 
It is proposed the existing watercourse, Stream C, is diverted around the northern and 
western perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site. The final sizing of the diverted 
watercourse will be undertaken at the detailed design stage however based upon based on 
a catchment area of circa 13,100 m2, pessimistic runoff coefficient of 0.60 and rainfall 
intensity of 45 mm/hr [based on M100-1hr storm it is estimated that the upper end flows will 
be approximately 100 l/s. As noted in Section 8.2.10 this may be extended around to the 
east of the Project Site to protect the cutting platform.  
8.2.14 
The permanent cut-off ditches require Land Drainage Consent from CCS before 
construction can take place.

Maintenance of Overland Flow Routes 
8.2.15 
It has been demonstrated that there is an existing overland flow route that crosses the 
eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site which, in areas, is considered to be 
medium to high risk of flooding. Part of this overland flow route falling on the Generating 
Equipment Site will be accommodated by the onsite drainage that includes attenuation 
storage for surface runoff from the Project Site (Section 8.3). However, as there is land 
raising at the Generating Equipment Site some of this overland flow route will be diverted 
along the eastern extent of the Project Site. In order to maintain this overland flow path it is 
proposed that the eastern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site is kept clear and 
formalised to encourage water downslope and away from the development towards the 
undeveloped area to the south. This will also provide the easement required by CCS for 
maintenance access to the watercourse. 
Welsh Water - Water Main Easement 
8.2.16 
The Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water Water Main that crosses the site will have an easement of a 
minimum of 30 m as required by Welsh Water. The proposed site layout (Appendix C, C1 
and C2) indicates that a 60 m easement has been provided due to uncertainty of the 
accuracy and digitisation of archive drawings.  Further investigations are currently being 
carried out to identify the location and depth of the Water Main prior to detailed design so 
adequate easement can be provided for.   
8.2.17 
The ground levels will be maintained within the Water Main easement area. This will provide 
a flood flow path in the event of a Water Main rupture away from the elevated Generating 
Equipment Site which should be able to accommodate the understood flows of 1.2-1.7 m3/s. 
The combination of the easement, general topographic slope to the south and elevation of 
Generating Equipment Site Plant means that the flood risk from the unlikely rupture of the 
Water Main will be negligible.    
Access Road Culverts 
8.2.18 
The Access Road leading west from the Generating Equipment Area crosses a small field 
drain, Felindre Gas Compressor Station surface water drainage ditch and an ordinary 
watercourse (Stream B). It is assumed in outline design that a culvert will be used to convey 
flow beneath the road (Appendix E) to prevent the Access Road from flooding. Whilst this is 
proposed as a culvert, other techniques such as bridging could be incorporated into the 
design.   
8.2.19 
Culvert crossings will be designed to allow for flow up to and including the 1% AEP + 20% 
Climate Change Allowance to ensure there is no impedance of flow. For more extreme 
events the overland flow will pass over the road to the south along the natural fall of the 
topography. 
8.2.20 
To mitigate against the risk of blockage it is proposed that a twin culvert arrangement and/or 
trashscreen is implemented which will allow for the continued flow of water beneath the 
Access Road in the event that one culvert is blocked.  
8.2.21 
It is noted that Land Drainage Consent must be granted by CCS prior to any works on 
Ordinary Watercourses.  
Safe Access and Egress Route 
8.2.22 
During flood events it is proposed that suitable access and egress routes are provided the 
details of which are subject to detailed design. As a minimum, safe pedestrian 
access/egress routes should be provided and where possible vehicular routes should be 
accommodated in to the design.

Decommissioning 
8.2.23 
It is recommended that a detailed Decommissioning Environmental Management Plan will 
be prepared at a later date to identify required measures to prevent pollution during this 
phase of the development, based on the detailed decommissioning plan.  
8.2.24 
The mitigation measures for decommissioning will be similar to those identified for 
construction.  
8.3 
Surface Water Management 
8.3.1 
An Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) has been developed for the Project for the 
disposal of foul, oily and surface water from the Project to assist with planning and detailed 
drainage design phases (Appendix E).  
8.3.2 
The Project will increase the impermeable area at the Project Site through the construction 
of hard standing and buildings. Without suitable mitigation measures this is likely to increase 
the surface water runoff rates and volumes that leave the Project Site compared to the 
existing greenfield conditions. The Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) therefore 
identifies mitigation measures such as attenuation storage, swales and infiltration strips to 
manage any increase in surface water runoff as a result of the Project.    
8.3.3 
An increase in impermeable area is only applicable to the Generating Equipment Site and 
Maintenance Compound, Access Road and AGI Compound. The Pipeline and Electrical 
Connection will be below ground and will not increase the impermeable area at the Project 
Site.    
8.3.4 
The main elements of the strategy are as follows: 
 
The Project Site drainage system will be designed to prevent flooding of the Project 
Site during the 3.33% AEP and maintain greenfield runoff rates off site up to and 
including the 1% AEP + 20% Climate Change event;  
 
Where possible, the site will be designed to drain by infiltration;  
 
Pending a Ground Investigation (at detailed design stage) it is assumed that drainage 
by infiltration will not be possible and therefore all site surface water runoff will be 
attenuated up to an including the 1% AEP + 20% Climate Change event and 
discharged to the local watercourse network at the greenfield runoff rate;  
 
The Access Road will generally have a constant cross fall and no longitudinal fall. 
Where possible, roadside swales and infiltration drains will be used to remove and 
convey any standing water in to the surface water drainage system;  
 
The AGI area will drain to a small attenuation area and discharge into the nearest local 
watercourse at the greenfield runoff rate.

8.3.5 
It is not proposed to connect existing road drainage systems into the new surface water 
drainage system. Existing road drainage systems along the access road to the west of the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station will be maintained 
8.3.6 
The surface water drainage design will be subject to detailed design which will be 
undertaken after granting of the DCO 
8.4 
Flood Attenuation Storage 
8.4.1 
Due to local ground conditions and high groundwater it is unlikely that the proposed surface 
water drainage system will be able to infiltrate into the ground. This will be confirmed by a 
Ground Investigation prior to detailed design. As such a worst case scenario has been 
assumed where all surface runoff from the Project Site will be attenuated in order to mimic 
the equivalent greenfield runoff rates for events up to the 1%AEP +20% Climate Change 
event.    
8.4.2 
It is proposed that attenuation storage is required for the Generating Equipment Site, 
Maintenance Compound, AGI compound and the Access Road.  A full explanation of the 
sizing calculation and location of the attenuation areas is included within the Outline 
Drainage Strategy in Appendix E. 
8.4.3 
Table 8.1 demonstrates the preliminary calculated greenfield runoff rates using the IH124 
method18 and required attenuation storage for each area of the Project Site for the 1%+20% 
Climate Change event. It can be seen that the largest attenuation storage of approximately 
2018m3 is required for the Generating Equipment Site.

Off Site Impacts and Residual Risk 
9.1 
Impact to third party property/land 
9.1.1 
The flood risk to third parties has been assessed in accordance with TAN15. The following 
possible flood risk impacts have been identified: 
 
Loss of ordinary watercourse flood storage at the Project Site;   
 
Impact on overland flow routes and conveyance;  
 
Damage of Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water Water Main 
 
Increase surface runoff (see Section 8);  
9.1.2 
The area of the Project Site that is located within Afon Llan floodplain will not involve any 
built development or any land raising. Therefore this will not affect the storage of the Afon 
Llan floodplain.  
9.1.3 
The Project may have some impact on flood flows and flood storage associated with the 
local watercourse at the south eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site where 
raising of ground levels are proposed (Figure C3 and C4, Appendix C). The impact on flood 
storage and conveyance will be mitigated by the formalisation of an overland flow route 
along the eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site. This will allow any flow to pass 
around the site to the south, away from the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and towards the Afon 
Llan floodplain. Furthermore, the creation of suitably sized cut-off drainage ditches will 
provide additional storage during large events. With the formalisation of the overland flow 
path it is anticipated that, combined with the steep catchment, any loss of storage and 
impact on conveyance will be minimal. Minor changes to the flood routes within the rural 
area are not considered to increase flood risk to third parties.      
9.1.4 
During construction of the Gas Connection there may be a temporary diversion of the 
existing drainage ditch to the north of the Generating Equipment Site. Abergelli Farm House 
and Abergelli Solar Farm are located at a higher elevation than the watercourse at this 
location and will therefore not be affected by any temporary diversion.    
9.1.5 
During construction and operation there is a very low risk that the Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water 
Water Main could accidentally be damaged causing water to flow across the Project Site. A 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey will be completed in January 2018 to identify the 
exact location and depth of the Water Main and protective provisions will be employed 
during both phasesto ensure any works around the Water Main are strictly controlled. Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water require a 30m easement around the Water Main and the proposed 
design includes a 60m easement. The land naturally drains to the south east between the 
laydown area and Generating Equipment Site following existing drainage ditches. It is 
anticipated that the large easement and existing drainage ditch network could adequately 
convey water towards the south east away from the Project Site and towards the Afon Llan,       
9.1.6 
The Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) and mitigation measures highlighted in Section 
8.2 demonstrate that the impact on increased surface runoff will be negligible.   
9.1.7 
It has been concluded that there will be negligible impact to third parties from the Project 
through the implementation of the necessary mitigation measures described in this FCA.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
10.1.1 
Based upon the NRW flood maps, it has been demonstrated in Figure D1, Appendix D that 
part of the southern extent of the Project Site is located with TAN15 Flood Zone C2 (areas of 
the floodplain without significant flood defence infrastructure, based on the NRW extreme 
flood outline, equal to or greater than 0.1% (fluvial or tidal)). As part of the Project design 
this area will not involve any built development or land raising and will therefore not impact 
upon the floodplain or be affected by flooding.  
10.1.2 
Under TAN15 highly vulnerable development (i.e. power stations) must be located out of 
Flood Zone C2, preferably in Flood Zone A and if this is not possible Flood Zone B. A small 
area of the Generating Equipment Site is located within Flood Zone B whilst the majority of 
the Project is located within Flood Zone A (Figure D1, Appendix D). Under TAN15, this is 
considered acceptable development provided flood risk from all sources has been 
considered. 
10.1.3 
To understand the flood risk to the Project Site and impact of the Project to the surrounding 
area an assessment of all sources of flooding has been undertaken and flood mitigation 
measures proposed. 
10.1.4 
Flood risk to the Project was assessed as follows: 
 
There is no risk of tidal flooding;  
 
The risk of fluvial flooding is considered to be negligible from Afon Llan and low from 
ordinary watercourses/land drainage to small areas of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Access Road;  
 
The risk of surface water flooding is considered to be medium to high for small areas of 
the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road and Gas Connection however the 
majority of the site is considered to be at low risk;  
 
The risk of sewer flooding is considered to be negligible;  
 
The risk of groundwater flooding is considered to be low; and, 
 
The risk of flooding from artificial sources is considered to be negligible. 
10.1.5 
The most likely flood risk to the Project Site has been identified as surface water flooding 
and localised ordinary watercourse flooding. Therefore mitigation measures have been 
included within the Project design to reduce the overall risk of flooding to low.   
10.1.6 
An Outline Drainage Strategy has been proposed to control surface water runoff from the 
project site to reduce any of site impact up to and including the 1% AEP +20% Climate 
Change event. Flood attenuation storage is proposed for all impermeable areas on the 
Generating Equipment Site, Access Road, Maintenance Compound and AGI. 
10.1.7 
Through implementation of mitigation measures outlined in this document and in the outline 
drainage design it is considered that this development is acceptable under TAN15 guidance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The following report presents an outline strategy for disposal of foul, oily and surface water from 
the proposed Abergelli Power Project to assist with planning and detailed drainage design 
phases. Indicative storm water attenuation requirements are defined to demonstrate design 
compliance with UK environmental regulations for new developments and assist with site spatial 
planning.

PROJECT BACKGROUND 
2.1 
SCOPE OF THIS REPORT 
This conceptual Project Site drainage strategy outlines the proposal for managing the surface 
water, oily water and waste water drainage systems at the proposed Abergelli Power Project.  
External flood risk to the Project Site is outside the scope of this report and will be addressed 
separately.  
2.2 
SITE DESCRIPTION 
The Project Site (approximate UK National Grid Reference SN 65477 01290) is located on open 
land approximately 2 km north of Junction 46 on the M4, to the north of Swansea and 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach. Refer to Figures 2.2-1 to 2.2-3 inclusive below.

Figure 2.2-3 Site Location (3) 
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse grazing. The western 
extent of the Project Site encompasses parts of National Grid’s ‘Swansea North’ electrical 
substation (comprising a 400kV and 132kV substation) and the existing access road leading to 
the substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station from the B4489.  
The Project Site is accessed from Junction 46 of the M4. From the M4 vehicles would travel north 
via the B4489, with the Project Site therefore accessed from the west utilising the existing

National Grid junction and access road from the B4489 (which is to be widened to accommodate 
abnormal loads and is part of the Access Road) and then via land following the southern 
boundary of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station before crossing over agricultural land 
immediately west of the Generating Equipment Site.  
The Project Site is roughly 'L' shaped (in reverse). Ground levels at the Project Site vary from 
approximately 146 m above ordnance datum (AOD) at the highest point in the north-west corner 
at Rhyd-y-Pandy Road to approximately 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter, with ground 
levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction.   The land within the Generating 
Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD.  
There are no residential dwellings located within the boundary of the Project Site. Most of the 
Project Site is improved grassland but there are areas of marshy grassland in the south eastern 
part of the Generating Equipment Site. There are parts of a Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within the Project Site (Lletty Morfil SINC). The woodland present within the 
Project Site is designated as Ancient Woodland (a mixture of restored and semi-natural 
woodland).  
Within the Project Site there are springs, with their associated streams and drainage ditches 
which discharge into the Afon Llan (See Figures 2-4 to 2-7 inclusive). The Afon Llan links with the 
Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into the Bristol Channel. 
The Generating Equipment Site is located primarily within fields used for grazing, bounded by a 
mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and poor quality hedgerows with substantial gaps in them. 
The Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area are both crossed by a soft surface horse 
training track known as ‘the gallops’, which runs diagonally north-west to south-east. A block of 
broadleaved woodland, classified as Ancient Woodland, and a Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) lie to the east. There are also further blocks of Ancient Woodland, also 
classified as SINCs, to the west surrounding Swansea North Substation, Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the existing access road leading to these facilities from the B4489.  
The proposed gas supply pipeline will follow an approximate north-south route corridor, as shown 
in Figures 2-4 & 2-6, between the National Transmission System south of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road 
and the Generating Equipment Site.  The Pipeline corridor varies between 50 m and 200 m in 
width, depending on the working area required during construction. The maximum area of the 
Gas Connection Site during construction is approximately 13 Ha. Once construction is completed, 
the route corridor will reduce to 10 m wide, reflecting the width of the easement surrounding the 
Pipeline required for maintenance and to ensure safety.  The Pipeline crosses grazing fields 
bounded by a number of poor quality hedgerows (with gaps) and/or fence lines, one Public Right 
of Way, and two drainage ditches. The Pipeline avoids the small deciduous copse to the north of 
the Generating Equipment Site, part of which is classified as Ancient Woodland and a SINC.  
The Electrical Connection will follow a route corridor of approximately 30 m in width during 
construction. The Electrical Connection route coincides with the Access Road for approximately 
500 m of the route length. The maximum site area for the Electrical Connection during 
construction is 3 ha.  It will be located to the southwest of the Generating Equipment Site passing 
through grass fields and following the southern boundary of the Gas Compressor Station, passing 
through an area classified as Ancient Woodland and a SINC, before entering National Grid’s 
Swansea North Substation.  
The geology of the site is characterised by boulder clay and the underlying Grovesend Beds, 
Upper Carboniferous sandstones and thin coals; overlain by glacial sand and gravel, alluvium and 
peat. The geology is overlain by raw grey and brown soils.  
The land within the power generation plant site is approximately 90 m Above Ordnance Datum 
(AOD), generally sloping at 1:25 downwards in a southerly direction.

DRAINAGE STRATEGY 
3.1 
FOUL WATER DRAINAGE PROPOSAL 
The Generating Equipment Site incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system. The site is remote and it is believed it will be unfeasible to connect to a public 
sewer. The provision of a cesspool, composting or chemical toilets has not been considered due 
to Natural Resources Wales preferences, maintenance requirements and staff comfort. As a 
result there are two options for the foul water drainage system:  
1. A foul water drainage system that will drain to a septic tank within the site. The water from 
septic tank would then discharge into an onsite drainage field. 
2. A foul water drainage system that will drain to a package sewage treatment plant within the 
site. The processed water from this treatment plant would then discharge into an onsite 
drainage field or nearby watercourse. 
Option 2 is likely to be the preferred option for ease of maintenance and environmental criteria.  
The selected foul water drainage system will be positioned away from any areas at risk of flooding. 
Site foul water drainage systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Part H of 
the UK Building Regulations 2010. Any septic tank or package treatment plant shall be situated a 
minimum of 10 metres from habitable buildings. We suggest the most appropriate siting of the 
sewage treatment plant is in the area to the northwest of the accommodation building 
(immediately northeast of the car parking area) in order to satisfy the aforementioned separation 
requirement and allow ease of vehicular access for maintenance. 
The proposed location of the sewage treatment plant is indicated in Figure 2-4. The most 
appropriate outfall location would seem to be to the proposed drainage swale running along the 
southwest boundary of the Generating Equipment Site. 
3.2 
OILY WATER DRAINAGE PROPOSAL 
An oily water drainage system will be required to receive surface water from potentially 
contaminated oil retaining areas and prevent contaminated water being discharged from the site. 
The following areas and activities have been identified as potential sources of oil contamination:  
 Oil filled transformers 
 Lubrication systems for the Generating Equipment 
 Oil/fuel storage 
 Vehicle hard-standings used for the unloading of oil/fuel 
In the event of a spillage all designated oil retaining areas (e.g. oil filled transformers and oil 
storage areas) will be designed to contain at least 110% of the stored oil plus an allowance for 
fire-fighting water/foam. Rainwater will be removed from oil retaining areas by an automatic pump 
to the oily water drainage system. The automatic pumps will be designed to automatically shut 
down in the event that a major oil spillage is detected in order to prevent large quantities of oil 
entering the oily water drainage system.  
8 
 
Outline Drainage Strategy 
WSP 
Abergelli Power Ltd. 
Project No 70034053 
 
Rainwater drainage from oily water areas will pass through a Class 1 Full Retention Oil Separator 
(as defined in BS EN 858) to remove residual traces of oil before discharging into the site surface 
water drainage system. The Oil Separator shall be sized to suit the oily water catchment area and 
will be fitted with an alarm to indicate when the integral oil coalescer requires maintenance. 
Oily water drainage shall be designed in accordance with National Grid Technical Specification 
2.20 ‘Oil Containment at Electricity Substations and Other Operational Sites’ or similar approved. 
Outline oily water drainage areas for the Generating Equipment Site are indicated in Figure 2-4. 
3.3 
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE PROPOSAL 
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE PHILOSOPHY 
The surface water drainage system will be required to adequately drain the Project Site and 
prevent any significant flooding for the maximum design rainfall event of 100 year return period. 
The surface water drainage system will adopt the principles of The SuDS Manual – CIRIA C697.  
To prevent inundation of the Generating Equipment Site from surface runoff down the hillside, cut 
off drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill Generating Equipment Site perimeter. These 
new drainage ditches will be designed to divert surface runoff around the Generating Equipment 
Site and return downstream back to the original drainage ditches/watercourse.  
Where possible the new platform (levels and surfacing) will be designed so they naturally drain by 
infiltration into the surrounding ground. Where this is not economically possible or presents an 
unsatisfactory risk of flooding to the site, infiltration drains will be installed into the new platforms. 
All infiltration drains will connect to the surface water drainage system.  
It is not expected that it will be possible to connect the surface water drainage system to an 
infiltration basin due to the presumed predominantly clayey ground and high groundwater level in 
places. This will be confirmed when the Ground Investigation surveys are carried out. For the 
purposes of this drainage strategy, a worst case is assumed. Instead the discharged flow of water 
at the site boundary from the surface water drainage system will be attenuated in order to mimic 
the equivalent greenfield runoff flow for events up to the 100 year return period event (with climate 
change allowance). The flow will be attenuated using suitably sized attenuation pond(s) with 
downstream flow restriction. The resulting equivalent greenfield runoff will discharge to existing 
nearby watercourses. The attenuation pond(s) shall be sited to prevent flooding of operational 
areas in the event of an extreme rainfall event in excess of the 100 year return period.  
The Gas Connection comprises a buried pipeline and AGI. The Pipeline will not give rise to an 
increase in impermeable area within the Project Site and impact upon the surface water run-off 
regime.  
The only permanent above ground structure associated with the gas connection is the Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System. The AGI 
consists of 2No 30m by 30m compounds and is proposed to drain to a soakaway. 
Proposed new bituminous Power Generation Plant Site roads will generally have a constant 
crossfall with no longitudinal fall. Where possible, roadside swales and infiltration drains will be 
used to remove and convey any standing water into the surface water drainage system. Where 
there are space constraints, or there is an elevated risk of contamination, the new roads will be 
kerbed and drain via road gullies into the surface water drainage system.  
Construction laydown areas and a maintenance yard are proposed to the west of the Generating 
Equipment Area on the opposite side of the water main easement. We understand both laydown 
and maintenance areas require granular finish (i.e. crushed rock pavement construction) at 
commencement of construction in the Generating Equipment Area. The maintenance yard will be 
9 
 
Outline Drainage Strategy 
WSP 
Abergelli Power Ltd. 
Project No 70034053 
 
retained on completion of construction, however the laydown areas will be returned to grassland  
As a result, the construction laydown area runoff is omitted from calculations for permanent 
construction runoff and it shall be considered in the CEMP only (refer to Section 3.5). 
Culverts to route existing field drains under the proposed Access Road have been assumed in the 
outline design, however, other techniques such as bridges could also be used. These culverts or 
crossings will be designed for events up to the 100 year return period. It is expected that drainage 
of the new section of Access Road will be via roadside swales. Swales will discharge to existing 
watercourses via flow restriction device and piped outlets as necessary to approximate equivalent 
greenfield runoff flows from the proposed road area. 
A section of access road crosses the water main easement. At the time of writing, the form of this 
crossing is unknown. The access road is likely to be raised due to restrictions on excavation 
within the easement zone. In this case this section of road is likely to be formed on an 
embankment above the easement (a causeway) or, if surcharge loading of the easement zone is 
unacceptable, on a suspended bridge deck. Surface water runoff from the grassland/pasture area 
to the north and upslope of the raised access road shall be allowed to passively drain through the 
causeway due to installation of open pipes / culverts at regular spacings for the former option. A 
suspended bridge structure would permit surface water runoff to flow unimpeded in the latter 
option. We would expect any temporary drainage requirements during construction of a raised 
access road to be addressed in the CEMP (refer to Section 3.5). 
It is not proposed to connect existing road drainage systems into the new surface water drainage 
system. Existing road drainage systems along the existing section of Access Road will be 
maintained or modified to reflect any widening. 
PROPOSED SUDS MANAGEMENT TRAIN 
For purposes of this study it is assumed that the sensitivity of receiving watercourses is ‘Medium’. 
In accordance with Table 3.3 of the ‘SuDS Manual’ (CIRIA, 2007) there shall be a minimum of 
three SUDS management train techniques for drainage of runoff from general site development 
areas: 
1. TRAPPED GULLIES / FILTER DRAINS  
As described above, where possible all proposed new bituminous road drainage will be 
collected via roadside swales or infiltration drains. Where required the new platforms will 
be drained via a filter drain. The swales and filter drains will be designed to minimise the 
ingress of sediment into the drainage network. All new swales and drains on the 
Generating Equipment Site will discharge into the proposed attenuation ponds and then 
the existing watercourses. 
2. ATTENUATION 
The primary purpose of the attenuation pond is storage and gradual release of storm 
water runoff, however it will have secondary benefits in terms of water treatment. The 
pond geometry will be selected to promote settlement of any remaining suspended 
sediment from inflow as the pond widens and flow velocity decreases towards its outfall. 
Furthermore, in the unlikely accidental event of entry of pollutants from site activities to 
the surface water drainage system, the attenuation pond provides access for water quality 
sampling and retention of pollutants via closure of a valve within the outfall manhole prior 
to remediation. 
Periodic maintenance of the attenuation pond and its surrounding area will be required by 
the Generating Equipment Site operator in order to remove significant silt deposits and 
10 
 
Outline Drainage Strategy 
WSP 
Abergelli Power Ltd. 
Project No 70034053 
 
control vegetation. Suitable provision shall be made in the layout and levels of the pond 
area to permit access by off-road vehicles to allow this maintenance to take place. 
3. SWALE 
The final measure within the SUDS system will be a drainage swale between the 
attenuation pond and the un-named tributary of the Afon Llan (subject to agreement with 
City and Council of Swansea). The swale will be incorporated into the landscaping and be 
of a vegetated design to provide further filtering measures for any particles that have 
passed through the previous control techniques.  
Drainage from roads only requires application of two treatment train components. Therefore, the 
proposed site access road will be drained via swales that shall provide storage attenuation with 
controlled discharge, approximating to pre-development greenfield runoff, to existing 
watercourses. 
OUTLINE SIZING OF SITE ATTENUATION 
Refer to Section 4 of this report for calculation of outline storage volume requirements. 
3.4 
SITE FLOOD RISK 
The risk to the Project Site by flooding from external sources is outside the scope of this report 
and is therefore not evaluated further herein.  
Buildings, plant and equipment within the site will be elevated above the surrounding platform 
level to avoid inundation by minor surface water flooding in the event of local drainage failure or 
extreme rainfall events in excess of the 100 year return design event.  
As a minimum a raised pedestrian access route will be provided to and within the site to provide 
for safe access and egress during a flood.  
3.5 
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE STRATEGY DURING CONSTRUCTION 
Surface water drainage during construction will be developed by the contractor and detailed in the 
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP). At this stage it is expected that the CEMP 
will include provisions such as:  
 New temporary and /or permanent drainage ditches to prevent uncontrolled surface runoff of 
contaminated water 
 Silt traps within drainage ditches to reduce the flow of suspended solids from site. 
 Settlement lagoons and / or proprietary settlement tanks as required to reduce the flow of 
suspended solids from site. 
 Suitable layout of the construction site and application of suitable management techniques to 
prevent runoff from stockpiles directly into watercourses.

001 in Appendix A. A runoff coefficient has been allocated to each area type for determining the 
proportion of rainfall that is converted to runoff. The permanent site area and runoff coefficients 
are presented in Table 4.2-2. The chosen runoff coefficients represent the impermeability of the 
area categories within the limits of 0.0 (no runoff) to 1.0 (100% of rainfall is converted to runoff)

Introduction
1.1 
Background
AECOM has prepared this Water Framework Directive (WFD) Screening Assessment on behalf of Abergelli
Power Limited (APL) as part of the Environmental Statement (ES) for the proposed Abergelli Power Project
hereafter referred to as ‘the ‘Project’.
This WFD Screening Assessment has been prepared in response to comments received from Natural Resources
Wales (NRW) to the 2014 and 2018 PEIR. This WFD Screening Assessment is contained as an Appendix to the
ES and specifically to supplement the Water Quality and Resources Chapter (Chapter 9) of the ES and should,
therefore, be read together with this chapter.
The Project Site is situated on open land located approximately 2 km north of junction 46 of the M4 within the
administrative area of the City and County of Swansea Council (CCS).  The central grid reference for the site is
SN 6528 0143 and the location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1-1. A detailed Project description is 
provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.
This Preliminary WFD Assessment Screening Assessment aims to identify the relevant WFD groundwater and
surface water bodies located in the proximity of the Project Site and to undertake an assessment on the WFD
features identified which could potentially be impacted by the Project.
1.2 
Legislative Context
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to protect and enhance the quality of the water environment across
all European Union (EU) member states. It takes a holistic approach to the sustainable management of water by
considering the interactions between surface water (including transitional and coastal waters, rivers, streams and
lakes), groundwater and water-dependent ecosystems. Further details of the WFD are set out in sections 9.3.3,
9.5 and 9.8 of the Water Quality and Resources Chapter of the ES.
Under the WFD, ‘water bodies’ are the basic management units and are defined as all or part of a river system or
aquifer. These water bodies form part of a larger ‘river basin districts’ (RBD), for which ‘River Basin Management
Plans’ (RBMPs) are developed by EU member states and environmental objectives are set. RBMPs are
produced every six years, in accordance with the river basin management planning cycle. Summary documents
for the second cycle of plans were published by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) in December 2015, whilst water
body objectives and measures were updated in 2017.
The WFD requires all EU member states to classify the current condition or ‘status or potential’ of surface and
groundwater bodies and to set a series of objectives for maintaining or improving conditions so that water bodies
maintain or reach ‘good status or potential’ during the next river basin management planning cycle. NRW is the
competent authority for implementing the WFD in Wales. As part of its role, NRW must consider whether
proposals for new developments have the potential to:
 
Cause a deterioration of a water body from its current status or potential; and/ or
 
Prevent future attainment of good status or potential where not already achieved.
As a result, new developments that have the potential to impact on current or predicted WFD status are required
to assess their compliance against the WFD objectives of the potentially affected water bodies.
1.3 
Structure of this report
Section 2 of this report, provides a summary of the WFD screening process. While Section 3 provides information
on the current WFD status of water bodies that have the potential to be impacted by the Project. The no
deterioration assessment methodology is described in Section 4.2 and the WFD Assessment is provided in
Section 5.

WFD Screening 
Screening has identified four WFD surface water bodies and two WFD groundwater bodies of relevance located 
in proximity to the Project Site (i.e. within a 1km buffer set around the Project Site). The water bodies are listed in 
Table 2-1 and the locations are presented in Figure 2-1 with the exception of Burry Inlet Channel, a downstream 
surface water body, which is located approximately 7 km southwest of the Project Site.

With consideration of the construction and operational phases of the Project and taking into account the 
mitigation embedded within the Project’s design (as detailed in Chapter 3: Project Site and Description) it is 
considered in professional judgement that of the WFD water bodies identified in Table 2-1, only the Afon Llan 
River body (GB11059032100) and Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures (GB41002G200600) should be 
carried through into the WFD Screening Assessment.  It is considered that the water bodies screened out before 
the assessment are very unlikely to be impacted by the Project.  Justifications for their exclusion are included in 
Table 2-2.

Water Body Status 
3.1 
Background to Surface Water Body Status 
3.1.1.1 
Under the WFD, surface water body status is classified on the basis of chemical and ecological status 
or potential. Ecological status is assigned to surface water bodies that are natural and considered by 
the NRW not to have been significantly modified for anthropogenic purposes. Ecological potential is 
assigned to artificial and man-made water bodies (such as canals), or natural water bodies that have 
undergone significant modification; these are termed Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWBs). The 
term ‘ecological potential’ is used as it may be impossible to achieve good ecological status because 
of modification for a specific use, such as navigation or flood protection. The ecological potential 
represents the degree to which the quality of the water body approaches the maximum it could 
achieve. The worst case classification is assigned as the overall surface water body status, in a ‘one-
out all-out’ system. This system is summarised below in Figure 3-1.

3.1.2 
Chemical Status 
3.1.2.1 
Chemical status is defined by compliance with environmental standards for chemicals that are priority 
substances and/or priority hazardous substances, in accordance with the Environmental Quality 
Standards Directive (2008/105/EC). This is assigned on a scale of good or fail. Surface water bodies 
are only monitored for priority substances where there are known discharges of these pollutants; 
otherwise surface water bodies are reported as being at good chemical status. 
3.1.3 
Ecological Status or Potential 
3.1.3.1 
Ecological status or potential is defined by the overall health or condition of the watercourse. This is 
assigned on a scale of High, Good, Moderate, Poor or Bad, and on the basis of four classification 
elements or ‘tests’ (Environment Agency, 2013), as follows: 
 
Biological: This test is designed to assess the status indicated by a biological quality element 
such as the abundance of fish, invertebrates or algae and by the presence of invasive species. 
The biological quality elements can influence an overall water body status from Bad through to 
High. 
 
Physico-chemical: This test is designed to assess compliance with environmental standards for 
supporting physicochemical conditions, such as dissolved oxygen, phosphorus and ammonia. 
The physicochemical elements can only influence an overall water body status from Moderate 
through to High. 
 
Specific pollutants: This test is designed to assess compliance with environmental standards 
for concentrations of specific pollutants, such as zinc, cypermethrin or arsenic. As with the 
physico-chemical test, the specific pollutant assessment can only influence an overall water 
body status from Moderate through to High. 
 
Hydromorphology: For natural, non-HMWBs, this test is undertaken when the biological and 
physico-chemical tests indicate that a water body may be of High status. It specifically 
assesses elements such as water flow, sediment composition and movement, continuity, and 
structure of the habitat against reference or ‘largely undisturbed’ conditions. If the 
hydromorphological elements do not support High status, then the status of the water body is 
limited to Good overall status. For artificial or HMWBs, hydromorphological elements are 
assessed initially to determine which of the biological and physico-chemical elements should be 
used in the classification of ecological potential. In all cases, assessment of baseline 
hydromorphological conditions are an important factor in determining possible reasons for 
classifying biological and physico-chemical elements of a water body as less than Good, and 
hence in determining what mitigation measures may be required to address these failing water 
bodies. 
3.2 
Relevant Surface Water Bodies and Status 
3.2.1.1 
There is one surface water body to be considered in the WFD assessment: the river water body of the 
Afon Llan (Water body ID GB110059032070).  The water body encompasses the headwaters of the 
river to the tidal limit and flows in a general south-westerly direction in proximity of the Project. The 
Llan flows into the Burry Inlet Channel transitional water body (estuary) which is not considered to be 
affected by the Project given that it is located more than 7 km downstream.  Information on the Llan 
water body has been taken from the 2015 Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (NRW, 2015) 
and summarised as follows: 
 
The overall objective of the surface water body is Good by 2015 (and to remain so). 
 
Objective is Good with respect to chemical quality and quantity. 
 
Objective is Good with respect to ecological quality and quantity.

The Natural Resources Wales Watch Water Gallery1  (NRW website, accessed November 2017) 
indicates that under the latest 2015 assessment (Cycle 2) the status of the Llan is ‘good’ and therefore 
the objective in the RBMP has been met.  A summary of the 2009 Cycle 1 and 2015 Cycle 2 
assessment is reproduced in Table 3-1.

3.3 
Background to Groundwater Body Status 
3.3.1.1 
Under the WFD, groundwater body status is classified on the basis of quantitative and chemical status. 
Status is assessed primarily using data collected from the NRW monitoring network; therefore, the 
scale of assessment means that groundwater status is mainly influenced by larger scale effects such 
as significant abstraction or widespread/ diffuse pollution. The worst case classification is assigned as 
the overall groundwater body status, in a ‘one-out all-out’ system. This system is summarised in Figure 
3-2. 
3.3.2 
Quantitative Status 
3.3.2.1 
Quantitative status is defined by the quantity of groundwater available as baseflow to watercourses 
and water-dependent ecosystems, and as ‘resource’ available for use as drinking water and other 
consumptive purposes. This is assigned on a scale of Good or Poor, and on the basis of four 
classification elements or ‘tests’ as follows: 
 
Saline or other intrusions: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where the 
intrusion of poor quality water, such as saline water or water of different chemical composition,

as a result of groundwater abstraction is leading to sustained upward trends in pollutant 
concentrations or significant impact on one or more groundwater abstractions. 
 
Surface water: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where groundwater 
abstraction is leading to a significant diminution of the ecological status of associated surface 
water bodies. 
 
Groundwater Dependent Terrestrial Ecosystems (GWDTEs): This test is designed to 
identify groundwater bodies where groundwater abstraction is leading to “significant damage” to 
associated GWDTEs (with respect to water quantity). 
 
Water balance: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where groundwater 
abstraction exceeds the “available groundwater resource”, defined as the rate of overall 
recharge to the groundwater body itself, as well as the rate of flow required to meet the 
ecological needs of associated surface water bodies and GWDTEs. 
3.3.3 
Chemical Status 
3.3.3.1 
Chemical status is defined by the concentrations of a range of key pollutants, by the quality of 
groundwater feeding into watercourses and water-dependent ecosystems and by the quality of 
groundwater available for drinking water purposes. This is assigned on a scale of Good or Poor, and 
on the basis of five classification elements or ‘tests’ as follows: 
 
Saline or other intrusions: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where the 
intrusion of poor quality water, such as saline water or water of different chemical composition, 
as a result of groundwater abstraction is leading to sustained upward trends in pollutant 
concentrations or significant impact on one or more groundwater abstractions. 
 
Surface water: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where groundwater 
abstraction is leading to a significant diminution of the chemical status of associated surface 
water bodies. 
 
Groundwater Dependent Terrestrial Ecosystems (GWDTEs): This test is designed to 
identify groundwater bodies where groundwater abstraction is leading to “significant damage” to 
associated GWDTE’s (with respect to water quality). 
 
Drinking Water Protected Areas (DrWPAs): This test is designed to identify groundwater 
bodies failing to meet the DrWPA objectives defined in Article 7 of the WFD or at risk of failing 
in the future. 
 
General quality assessment: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where 
widespread deterioration in quality has or will compromise the strategic use of groundwater.

3.4 
Relevant Groundwater Bodies and Status 
3.4.1.1 
There is one groundwater body to be considered in the WFD assessment: the Carmarthen 
Carboniferous Coal Measures (ID: GB41002G200600). Information on the status of this water body is 
available from the 2015 Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (NRW, 2015) and summarised 
as follows: 
 
The overall objective of the groundwater body is Poor by 2015 (technically infeasible – no 
known technical solution available due to legacy metal mine contamination). 
 
The 2015 Cycle 2 Quantitative Status is Good. 
 
The 2015 Cycle 2 Qualitative Status is Poor. 
3.4.1.2 
The Natural Resources Wales Watch Water Gallery2  (NRW website, accessed November 2017) 
indicates that under the latest 2015 assessment (Cycle 2) the status of the Carmarthen Carboniferous 
Coal Measures is ‘poor’.  A summary of the 2009 Cycle 1 and 2015 Cycle 2 assessment is reproduced 
in Table 3-2.

Assessment Methodology 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1.1 
Proposed developments that have the potential to impact on current or predicted WFD status are 
required to assess their compliance against the objectives defined for potentially affected water 
bodies. As part of its role, NRW must consider whether proposals for new developments have the 
potential to: 
 
Cause a deterioration of a water body from its current status or potential; and/ or 
 
Prevent future attainment of Good status (or potential where not already achieved).  
4.2 
No Deterioration Assessment 
4.2.1 
Defining 'No Deterioration' 
4.2.1.1 
'No deterioration' was defined by the Environment Agency in its Position Paper (Environment Agency, 
2013). Steps are required to prevent deterioration of the ecological status, ecological potential and 
chemical status of surface water and the qualitative status and quantitative status of groundwater.  
4.2.1.2 
Originally deterioration was defined by the Environment Agency as deterioration from one status class 
to a lower one, however following a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in 
July 2015 (C-461/13), this has been redefined.  The CJEU ruling clarified that: 
 
“deterioration of the status” of the relevant water body includes a fall by one class of any 
element of the “quality elements“ even if the fall does not result in the a fall of the classification 
of the water body as a whole;  
 
 ‘Any deterioration’ in quality elements in the lowest class constitutes deterioration; and  
 
Certainty regarding a project’s compliance with the Directive is required at the planning consent 
stage; hence, where deterioration ‘may’ be caused, derogations under Article 4.7 of the WFD 
are required at this stage.  
4.2.1.3 
While deterioration within a status class does not contravene the requirements of the WFD, (except for 
Drinking Water Directive parameters in drinking water protected areas), the WFD requires that action 
should be taken to limit within-class deterioration as far as practicable. For groundwater quality, 
measures must also be taken to reverse any environmentally significant deteriorating trend, whether or 
not it affects status or potential. 
4.2.1.4 
The no deterioration requirements are applied independently to each of the elements that come 
together to form the water body classification as required by Annex V of the Water Framework 
Directive and Article 4 of the Groundwater Daughter Directive. 
 
Surface water: To manage the risk of deterioration of the biological elements of surface 
waters, the no deterioration requirements are applied to the environmental standards for the 
physico-chemical elements, including those for the Moderate/Poor and Poor/Bad boundaries. 
 
Groundwater: The no deterioration requirements are applied to each of the four component 
tests for quantitative status and the five component tests for chemical status. The no 
deterioration requirement may not apply to elements at High status and elements at High status 
may be permitted to deteriorate to Good status, provided that: 
─ 
The water body’s overall status is not High; 
─ 
The RBMP has not set an objective for the water body of High status; 
─ 
The objectives and requirements of other domestic or European Community legislation 
are complied with; and 
─ 
Action is taken to limit deterioration within High or Good status or potential classes as 
far as practicable.

Future Status Objectives 
4.3.1.1 
RBMPs are used to outline water body pressures and the actions that are required to address them. 
The future status objective assessment considers the ecological potential of a surface water body and 
the mitigation measures that defined the ecological potential. Assessments in this project are based on 
mitigation measures defined in the 2015 RBMP. Information on WFD measures available from the 
NRW website (accessed November 20173) have also been reviewed. The assessment considers 
whether the Project has the potential to prevent the implementation or impact the effectiveness of the 
defined measures.

5. 
Water Framework Directive Compliance Assessment 
5.1 
General Approach and Project Assumption 
5.1.1.1 
The WFD compliance assessment uses a spreadsheet tool to assess the effects of the Project on 
each of the WFD elements (biological, physico-chemical and hydromorphological surface water 
elements, and quantitative and chemical groundwater elements).  
5.1.1.2 
Both the surface water assessment and the groundwater assessment examine the potential effects of 
the Project, which includes the Power Generation Plant, and Gas and Electricity Connections. The 
works plans are shown in Figure 3.2 of the ES.  
5.1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant in summary will comprise the Generating Equipment, Laydown Area and 
Access Road.  The Generating Equipment will be an OGCT designed to operate where there is a 
surge in demand and a stack. An existing Access Road will be upgraded between the B4489 and the 
Swansea North Substation and a new Access Road constructed between the Substation and the 
Generation Equipment Site.   
5.1.1.4 
The Gas Connection will be a new above ground installation and approximately 1.4 km of underground 
pipeline to connect to the existing high pressure National Transmission System.  The Electrical 
Connection will comprise elements to enable power to be exported via underground cable to the 
Substation of approximately 900 m in length.  As the Project Site is remote a foul water drainage 
system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment plant, and will discharge onsite or to a 
nearby watercourse.  A surface water drainage system incorporating drainage ditches will perimeter 
the Project Site and prevent ponding.  Attenuation ponds will maintain greenfield runoff flows with 
emergency overflow. 
5.1.1.5 
Key assumptions for the assessment are as follows: 
 
Ground Works: It is assumed that ground works will comprise excavation and levelling for 
foundations, piling (if required) and laying of Gas and Electric Connections and erection of the 
Generating Equipment.  
 
Dewatering: It is assumed that no groundwater dewatering is required as part of the Project. 
 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP): It is assumed that suitable 
plans will be put in place through the Outline CEMP (secured in the development consent 
order) in order to reduce risks to the environment.       
 
Surface Water Run-off: It is assumed that drainage from the Project will not have an impact on 
surface water run-off (and therefore water quality) into the Llan WFD water body.  
5.1.1.6 
For surface water, the potential effects identified are as a result of: 
 
Noise and vibration during construction of foundations and piling during the construction phase; 
 
Temporary land-take during the construction phase; 
 
Pollution due to discharges or spillages during the construction phase; 
 
Scour during the construction phase; 
 
Temporary diversion of tributary drains during construction phase; 
 
Permanent land take during the operational phase; and 
 
Permanent diversion of tributary drains during operation. 
5.1.1.7 
For groundwater, the potential effects identified are as a result of: 
 
Pollution due to discharges or spillages during the construction phase; 
 
Piling and below ground working causing mobilisation of contaminants during the construction 
and operational phases; and

 
Damming of groundwater flow behind sheet piles (decreasing groundwater contributions and 
potentially mobilising contamination). 
5.1.1.8 
Appendix A contains the surface water and groundwater assessments where the above potential 
effects are considered. The colour coded system referred to in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 is used to give 
a visual impression of the compliance assessment. 
5.2 
No Deterioration Assessment 
5.2.1 
Llan – headwaters to tidal limit 
5.2.1.1 
The Project is located in proximity to tributary drains of the Afon Llan River with only the southern edge 
of the Project Site outline in proximity of the Afon Llan WFD body.   
5.2.1.2 
There is the potential for localised effects from land take and scour as a result of construction close to 
tributary drains which may cause a loss of habitat. However, this is unlikely to be significant at 
waterbody scale and it is considered that habitats will recover naturally.  The impacts are not expected 
to be significant at water body scale and the system would recover naturally. 
5.2.1.3 
There is the potential for localised temporary impacts on water quality in the Llan from the mobilisation 
of contaminated sediment or groundwater into surface water through piling below ground workings.  
The impact is not expected to increase at the waterbody scale and any impacts are likely to be minor 
and localised on the tributary drains.  Should any unforeseen water quality issues be identified during 
future ground investigations, which are likely to follow the granting of planning permission , further 
mitigation measures will be embedded into the design to limit any adverse impacts on the surface 
water body.  
5.2.1.4 
The Outline CEMP will mitigate potential impacts on the Afon Llan from spillages during construction.   
5.2.1.5 
There is potential for minor impacts on habitat, water quality and hydromorphology as a result of 
diversion of tributary drains during the construction and operation phases.  Any impacts are likely to be 
localised to the tributary drains and are not expected to be significant at the water body scale. 
5.2.1.6 
Therefore, overall the Project is not expected to result in significant deterioration or change in surface 
water body status.  
5.2.2 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures 
5.2.2.1 
The Project is not anticipated to involve dewatering, which limits the potential construction impacts of 
the Project on the groundwater body. There is believed to be potential for contamination with respect 
to land quality, although the potential to impact the WFD status of the groundwater body is minor as 
the impacts will be localised especially given the likely presence of low permeability superficial 
deposits.  Should any unforeseen water quality issues be identified during future ground 
investigations, which are likely to follow the granting of planning permission, further mitigation 
measures will be embedded into the design to limit any adverse impacts on the groundwater body.  
5.2.2.2 
Any proposed piling and below ground working may have the potential to reduce groundwater 
contributions to surface water or dependent ecosystems.  However, it is not expected that the 
interaction between groundwater-and surface water is a key driver given the likely low permeability 
superficial deposits in the study area.  Therefore, piling and below ground activities are no anticipated 
to have a measurable impact on the status of the groundwater body throughout the construction and 
operational phases.  
5.2.2.3 
The Outline CEMP will mitigate potential adverse impacts on the Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal 
Measures groundwater body from spillages during construction.  
5.2.2.4 
Overall, the Project is not expected to result in significant deterioration or change in groundwater body 
status.

5.3 
Future Good Status 
5.3.1.1 
The status objective for the Llan water body as reported within the 2015 RBMP is Good by 2015, 
therefore the objective is currently met.  The focus of the NRW programme of measures is to prevent 
deterioration of status in all water bodies which is assessed in Section 5.2. 
5.3.1.2 
The objective of the Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures is Poor by 2015.  This objective is 
classified as less than Good by 2027 in the 2015 RBMP (a less stringent objective) because a Good 
objective is technically infeasible due to legacy metal mine contamination. 
5.3.1.3 
At present there are no local targeted measures within the catchments to maintain or achieve 
improvements to the status of the water bodies.  National Measures set by NRW in the 2015 RBMP to 
achieve the objectives of the plan relate to: 
 
Physical Modifications; 
 
Management of pollution from sewage and waste water; 
 
Management of pollution from towns, cities and transport; 
 
Changes to natural flow and levels of water; 
 
Managing invasive non-native species; 
 
Managing pollution from rural areas; 
 
Managing the impacts of acidification; 
 
Managing pollution from mines. 
5.3.1.4 
Based on the above information it is not considered that any of the aspects of the Project will prevent 
the WFD objectives from being achieved.

Conclusion  
6.1.1.1 
The WFD assessment indicates that, based on the current understanding of the Project, there is 
potential for minor localised effects on the Afon Llan River surface water body.  However, it has been 
assessed that it is unlikely that the Project will cause any significant deterioration or change in water 
body status or prevent attainment, or potential to achieve, future good status.   
6.1.1.2 
The WFD assessment indicates that there is potential for minor temporary or localised effects on the 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures groundwater body.  However, it has been assessed that it 
is unlikely that the Project will cause any significant deterioration or change in water body status or 
prevent attainment, or potential to achieve, the WFD objectives.  
6.1.1.3 
No further assessment of WFD is recommended given that no significant deterioration or change in 
water body status is expected based on the current understanding.

Possible temporary effects from construction
close to tributary drains due to the loss of habitat
during works on the bankside.  This is unlikely to
be significant at the waterbody scale and likely to
recovery naturally.
Possible minor impact where works close to tributary
drains including below ground workings may possibly
mobilise contaminated sediments into the tributary
drains.  Unlikely to affect the status at a water body
scale following implimentation of CoPC / CEMP.
Potential for increase in scour caused by works close
to or from diversion of tributary drains may affect
ecological habitats.  Unlikely to be significant at water
body scale.
Diversion of tributary drains will result in loss of
