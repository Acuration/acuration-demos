DRAX GROUP PLC 
(Symbol: DRX) 
 
Trading Update 
 
Drax today publishes a trading update for the period from 1 July 2015 to date. 
 
Trading and Operational Performance 
Since publishing our half year results on 28 July, trading conditions in the markets in which 
we operate have remained challenging, with further weakness in power prices. However, we 
continue to benefit from good operational performance and, since July, we have 
strengthened our 2015 and 2016 hedges for power sales at prices significantly above the 
current market. 
 
These factors underpin our expectations for the full year, which remain unchanged. 
 
Power Sales Contracted for 2015 and 2016 
We have extended our contracted position, including additional power sales of 1.4TWh and 
4.5TWh for 2015 and 2016 respectively, compared to the position reported in July.  
 
As at 16 November 2015, the power sales contracted for 2015 and 2016 were as follows: 
 
 
2015 
2016 
Power sales (TWh) comprising: 
26.1 
18.0 
 
 
 
– Fixed price power sales (TWh)  
26.1 
15.5 
 at an average achieved price (per MWh) (1) 
at £49.6 
at £47.2 
– Structured power sales (and equivalents) (TWh) (2) 
- 
2.5 
 
 
 
 
Biomass Update 
Biomass operations at Drax continue in line with expectations. Our first major planned 
biomass unit outage was completed over the summer, with no biomass related issues 
identified. The unit is now back in full operation. 
 
In addition to the existing UK east coast port facilities, we have added further import 
capability with new facilities at Liverpool.  
 
State Aid 
The Investment Contract(3) for the third biomass unit conversion remains subject to EU State 
aid clearance. 
 
Other Matters 
We will announce our full year results for the twelve months ending 31 December 2015 on 23 
February 2016.

Notes: 
(1) Fixed price power sales include approximately 2.0TWh supplied to Centrica in the period 1 January 2015 to 
27 September 2015 under the five year 300MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
Under this contract the Group supplied power on terms which included Centrica paying for coal, based on 
international coal prices, and delivering matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting in aggregate to 
approximately 1.8 million tonnes in 2015. The contract provided the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green 
spreads agreed in October 2009. 
(2) Structured power sales (and equivalents) include forward gas sales, providing additional liquidity for forward 
sales, highly correlated to the power market and acting as a substitute for forward power sales. 
(3) The Government introduced Contracts for Difference (CfDs), which are long-term contracts, to support the 
development of low carbon electricity generation.  To avoid an investment hiatus in the renewables sector 
before CfDs become available under the enduring regime, the Government introduced a scheme for 
Investment Contracts under the Final Investment Decision Enabling (“FID Enabling”) for Renewables 
mechanism. These were ‘early’ CfDs intended to provide greater confidence for investors in advance of the 
enduring CfD.
