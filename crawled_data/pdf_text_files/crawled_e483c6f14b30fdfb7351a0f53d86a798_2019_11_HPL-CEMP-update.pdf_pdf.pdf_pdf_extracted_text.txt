INTRODUCTION  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL) is making an application for a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Secretary of State for 
Energy and Climate Change (SoS).  The DCO will authorise HPL to 
construct and operate a new 299 megawatt electrical (MWe) simple 
cycle gas turbine (SCGT) Power Generation Plant together with integral 
Gas and Electrical Connections (hereafter referred to as the Project).  
The Power Generation Plant will be located on the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate between Rhigos and Hirwaun in South Wales.   
1.2 
Purpose of this document  
1.2.1 
This document provides an outline from which a final Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be produced for each 
Work in the DCO, to govern all parts of the construction works 
(including site preparation/demolition) associated with the Project for all 
contractors. This document will be hereafter referred to as the ‘outline 
CEMP’.  This outline CEMP is informed by the ES and associated DCO 
documents.  
1.2.2 
Schedule 2 Requirement 12 of the DCO includes a requirement to 
approve CEMP(s) in a staged manner by the local planning authority, 
namely Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC) prior 
to the commencement of any works.  Such CEMP(s)) will be developed 
after any grant of a DCO, in conjunction with, or by, the main 
contractor/s appointed for such works once the timescales for the 
detailed implementation are defined.  
1.2.3 
The final CEMP(s) shall consider the following: 
 
Complaints procedures; 
 
Nuisance management including measures to avoid or minimise 
the impacts of construction works (covering dust, noise, vibration 
and lighting); 
 
Lighting; 
 
Waste management; 
 
Surface and ground water mitigation measures; 
 
Procedure in the event significant archaeological remains are 
encountered;

 
Landscape and visual impact mitigation (such as retention of 
existing trees and minimising visual intrusion of construction 
works); and 
 
Security measures. 
1.2.4 
Traffic and Transport mitigation measures are to be in a Construction 
Traffic Management Plan (CTMP)) prepared by the main contractors 
and submitted under Requirement 13 of Schedule 2 of the DCO, and 
complementary to the CEMP. Similarly ecological mitigation measures 
are to be contained in anEcMP to be submitted under Requirement 10 
of Schedule 2 of the DCO, and complementary to the CEMP. 
Appropriate references to these documents are made in this Outline 
CEMP and should be made in the final CEMP(s). 
1.2.5 
In considering these environmental matters the final CEMP will provide 
information on: 
 
A register of environmental aspects [the effects of the Scheme]; 
 
Roles and responsibilities; 
 
Communication and co-ordination; 
 
Training and awareness; 
 
Operational control; 
 
Checking and corrective action; and  
 
Environmental control measures. 
1.2.6 
The final CEMP will fall within the scope of the main contractor’s 
externally certified international environmental management systems, 
and as such will be subject to independent audits by the relevant 
certification bodies.   
1.2.7 
This outline CEMP provides sufficient information, based on best 
practice guidance and mitigation measures in the ES to act as a 
framework for the final CEMP and to provide assurance to the decision 
maker and stakeholders that all appropriate measures will be taken 
forward to the construction phase.  
1.2.8 
Measures set out in the final CEMP will also have reference to the 
Welsh Government document ‘Construction and Demolition Sector 
Plan’ which seeks to move towards zero waste by detailing outcomes, 
policies and delivery actions for organisations, companies and 
individuals involved with the construction and demolition sector in 
Wales. It forms part of the suite of documents that comprise the waste 
management plan/strategy for Wales, in accordance with the plan 
making requirements enshrined in Wales and EU legislation.

Project Description 
1.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and has been designed to provide an 
electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts electrical (MWe). The plant will 
be fuelled by natural gas.   
1.3.2 
The three main elements of the Hirwaun Power Project comprise:  
 
A new Power Generation Plant, a SCGT gas fired ‘peaking’ power 
generating plant capable of providing up to 299 MWe; 
 
A new underground electrical cable connection (the Electrical 
Connection) to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant 
into the National Grid at Rhigos Substation; and  
 
A new underground gas pipeline connection (the Gas Connection) 
to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the existing 
high pressure gas network National Transmission System in the 
vicinity of the proposed Project Site.  This element of the Project 
also includes the above ground installation (AGI) for the gas 
pipeline at the point of connection to the National Transmission 
System (NTS), as well as a new permanent access to the AGI.  
1.3.3 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection together are referred to as the Project and are all integral to 
the generation of electricity and the subsequent export of that electricity 
to the National Grid.  
1.3.4 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP) by virtue of section 14 (1)(a) and section 15 of the Planning Act 
2008 (PA 2008) which includes within the definition of an NSIP any 
onshore generating station in England or Wales of 50 MWe capacity or 
more. Under section 31 PA 2008 a development consent order (DCO) 
is required to develop a NSIP. Under section 37 PA 2008 this can only 
be granted if an application is made for it to the Secretary of State 
(SoS) (the DCO Application).  
1.3.5 
This outline CEMP is part of a suite of documents which accompany 
the DCO Application and should be read in conjunction to gain a fuller 
understanding of the Project.

OUTLINE CEMP – GENERAL INFORMATION 
2.1 
Register of Environmental Impacts 
2.1.1 
A register of Environmental Impacts is required to be produced as part 
of the CEMP.  This Register would be used to inform the environmental 
procedures and provide a tool for construction teams when preparing 
construction method statements or field briefings.  This register would 
also comprise the various risks identified in the Environmental 
Statement (ES) and would be regularly updated to reflect any additional 
risks resulting from the main contractor/s selected methods of working, 
changing site conditions etc. Risks would be identified under the 
following general headings: 
 
Noise & Vibration; 
 
Air Quality & Emissions; 
 
Geology & Soils; 
 
Water Quality, Drainage & Hydrology; 
 
Landscape and Visual Impacts;  
 
Ecology; 
 
Traffic and Transport; 
 
Waste and Health; 
 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage; and  
 
Combined Impacts.  
2.2 
Risk Assessments 
2.2.1 
All activities undertaken on-site would be subject to an environmental 
risk assessment.  Environmental risk assessments would be 
undertaken by trained staff following an approved procedure which will: 
 
Identify potential environmental impacts that can be anticipated; 
 
Assess the risks from these impacts; 
 
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; 
and 
 
Report where an unacceptable level of residual risk is identified so 
that action can be taken through design changes, re-scheduling of 
work or alternative methods of working in order to reduce the risk to 
an acceptable level. 
2.2.2 
The results of risk assessments, and their residual risks are only 
considered acceptable if:  
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Outline CEMP

- 11 - 
 
The severity of outcome is reduced to the lowest practical level;  
 
The number of risk exposures are minimised; and 
 
All reasonably practical mitigating measures have been taken and 
the residual risk rating is reduced to a minimum.  
2.2.3 
The findings of the risk assessment and in particular the necessary 
controls 
would 
be 
explained 
to 
all 
contractors 
before 
the 
commencement of the relevant works using an agreed instruction 
format (e.g. Toolbox Talks).  
2.3 
Method Statements 
2.3.1 
Method statements would be completed by the main contractor or sub 
contractor by trained engineers or other appropriately experienced 
personnel, in consultation with on-site staff and, where necessary, 
environmental specialists.  Their production would include a review of 
the environmental risks and commitments, so that appropriate control 
measures are developed and included within the construction process. 
2.3.2 
Method statements would be reviewed by the main contractor or sub 
contractor’s appointed environmental manager and, where necessary, 
by an appropriate environmental specialist.  Where required, method 
statements would also be submitted to the enforcement agencies 
(Natural Resources Wales, Environmental Health Officer from 
RCTCBC etc.).  Method statements would most likely contain the 
following: 
 
Location of the activity and access/egress arrangements; 
 
Work to be undertaken and methods of construction; 
 
Plant and materials to be used; 
 
Labour and supervision requirements; 
 
Health, safety and environmental considerations; and 
 
Any permit or consent requirements beyond those already obtained 
(including the DCO). 
2.4 
Site Environmental Standards 
2.4.1 
Site Environmental Standards would be agreed with the main 
contractor and would detail the minimum measures that shall be 
achieved 
for 
general 
operations 
falling 
outside 
the 
risk 
assessment/method statement procedure. The site environmental 
standards would be designed to cover the majority of construction 
activities in accordance with the ES submitted with the application and 
requirements associated with the DCO.

- 12 - 
2.4.2 
These will cover issues such as storage of materials, management of 
waste, noise and vibration, and water pollution control.  The standards 
will be printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice boards and used as 
a briefing tool on site.  These standards will also form the basis of 
Toolbox talks which will inform all contractors working on site of the 
potential environmental risks arising from construction activities.  
2.4.3 
Best practice construction site management techniques will be 
implemented to avoid/minimise the generation of excessive waste, 
dust, noise, lighting, noise and vibration, in accordance with the ES and 
relevant requirements associated with the DCO.  These are discussed 
in more detail in Section 3 of this document.  
2.5 
Environmental Management System 
2.5.1 
Following construction, an Environmental Management System for 
commercial operation will be developed and contained within the 
overall Business Management System prepared by the operator and 
designed to comply with ISO 14001 or an equivalent recognised 
standard. 
2.5.2 
Implementation of ISO 14001 is a Key Strategy for HPL and the use of 
an Environmental Management Plan for commissioning based on ISO 
14001 (or similar) will be used to support implementation and 
compliance with the DCO and the Environmental Permit that will be 
required for operation of the Project under the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2011.  All operational staff for the 
Project will be given comprehensive environmental awareness training 
as part of this process. 
2.5.3 
During the commissioning phase of the Project, HPL will require its 
environmental and compliance procedures to be implemented and 
used by the main contractor and the operator.  
2.6 
Public Relations 
2.6.1 
The following steps will be taken to make the public aware of the 
activities on site and the available lines of communication with HPL: 
 
Neighbouring occupiers will be notified of the start of site works and 
the likely duration of the overall demolition and construction 
phases;  
 
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published 
local to the site.  The site safety, health and environment (SHE) 
officer will be responsible for dealing with any complaints and will 
have the appropriate authority to resolve any issues that may

occur.  Should they be required both the SHE officer and the site 
managers ‘out of hours’ telephone numbers will be available; 
 
The SHE officer will maintain a close liaison with the council’s 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at all times; 
 
Should any complaints regarding dust be received by the SHE 
officer the details will be passed to the EHO for verification 
purposes; and 
 
Should any unforeseen event occur within the construction site that 
has the potential to cause off-site pollution then the SHE officer will 
immediately notify the EHO by phone and e-mail.  As far as 
possible notice will be issued to the EHO for dealing with an 
unforeseen activity which may give rise to a particular dust 
problem. 
2.7 
Monitoring and Measurement 
2.7.1 
Weekly site inspections will be carried out which will assess the 
potential for environmental emergency situations to arise on the site.  
Additionally the main contractor will assess the potential for 
environmental incidents on a daily basis across the site.  Particular 
notice will be taken during and following extreme weather events, when 
working in areas of known contamination, and when particularly 
hazardous activities are being carried out.  Method Statements will be 
required where the risk assessment has identified a significant risk to 
the environment.  
2.7.2 
In the event of any environmental incident the most senior 
representative of the main contractor will take the role of the 
responsible person and will take charge of the situation.  Where 
possible, the responsible person will take immediate steps to eliminate 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
environment 
and 
mitigate/minimise 
any 
environmental damage. 
2.8 
Roles and Responsibilities  
2.8.1 
Suggested specific roles and responsibilities for the implementation of 
the final CEMP are described below:

All construction activities will be undertaken in accordance with 
requirements attached to the DCO, and the recommendations of BS 
5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites’.  It 
details the legislative background to noise control, along with the 
recommended procedures for effective liaison between developers, site 
operators and local authorities.  Methods of how to minimise the impact 
of site noise on workers and local residents are also provided. 
3.2.3 
The main mitigation measure to limit impacts of nuisance noise on 
human receptors is to ensure noise levels do not exceed the noise 
thresholds set out in the ES (65 dBA daytime) and to undertake noise 
monitoring during construction to make sure these agreed thresholds 
are not breached. 
3.2.4 
In addition, construction works shall not take place outside the hours of 
07:00-18.30 Monday to Friday and 07.00-13.00 on Saturday, unless 
otherwise agreed with RCTCBC.  Controls on working hours are 
specifically set out in DCO Schedule 2 Requirements 14 and 15. 
3.2.5 
If works are required outside of these core construction hours then 
method statements and risk assessments will be required to be 
submitted to the local planning authority for approval.   
3.2.6 
To minimise the risk of noise complaints, the main contractor will advise 
potentially affected residents of the works to be undertaken outside of 
working hours.  The residents will also be provided with a point of 
contact for any queries or complaints.  
3.2.7 
The main contractor and all sub-contractors working on-site have a 
general duty to take all reasonably practicable measures to minimise

Buildings). 
3.3 
Air Quality 
3.3.1 
Relevant air quality mitigation measures are outlined in Section 6 of the 
ES and in the Statutory Nuisance Statement.  However, the following 
provides an outline of the processes which could be employed in the 
final CEMP in order to reduce dust and exhaust emissions during 
construction.  
3.3.2 
This section outlines the potential sources of air pollution created by 
construction works and the methods of mitigation proposed to limit 
these impacts which shall be adopted in the final CEMP.  The following 
provides an outline of the processes which shall be employed in the 
final CEMP in order to reduce dust and exhaust emissions during 
construction. 
3.3.3 
A site-specific dust management plan (DuMP) will be prepared for use 
during the demolition phase (Work no. 1) and the construction of the 
Power Generation Plant (Work no. 2), Gas Connection (Work nos. 3 & 
4) and Electrical Connection (Work no. 5).  This will form part of the full 
CEMP for the work(s) submitted and approved in writing by RCT prior 
to works commencing. 
3.3.4 
A Construction Traffic Management Plan will be prepared to manage 
construction traffic, as well as minimise effects of the works on 
congestion and hence elevated vehicle emissions on the highway.  This 
is a requirement under Schedule 2 Requirement 13 of the DCO so 
would be submitted separately to the CEMP but will be suitably cross-
referred and linked.  
3.3.5 
Construction/demolition activities associated with the greatest potential 
for dust generation are: 
 
Earthworks including excavation of topsoil, handling on site and 
deposition; 
 
Handling and storage of materials (including loading and 
unloading);

 
Wind blow across disturbed/exposed site surfaces and materials; 
and 
 
 Mechanical operations such as crushing, drilling, concrete mixing 
and cutting.  
3.3.6 
Best Practicable Methods (BPM) will be used to minimise the risk of 
adverse effects from construction dust and causing nuisance or 
damage to flora and fauna specific control measures for limiting 
nuisance dust and exhaust emissions during construction are as 
follows:  
 
Site Management 
i 
Records of dust and air quality complaints to be kept, 
including likely causes and mitigation measures to reduce 
impacts if appropriate; 
ii 
On-site and off-site visual inspections to be undertaken and 
recorded;  
iii 
Inspections shall be increased in frequency during periods of 
high activity or prolonged dry, windy weather; and 
iv 
Keep site perimeter, fences etc clean. 


Consideration of weather conditions, dust generating potential 
of material to be excavated prior to commencement of works; 
vi 
Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles 
etc. to sensitive receptors; 
vii 
If work within 20m of sensitive receptors cannot be avoided, 
erect solid screens at least as high as stockpiles; and 
viii 
Dusty materials shall be removed from site as soon as 
possible. 
 
Demolition (where reasonably practicable): 
ix 
Use of water as a dust suppressant; 
x 
Cutting equipment shall use water as a dust suppressant or 
incorporate suitable extraction/ventilation; and 
xi 
Use of enclosed chutes and skips where applicable;  


Re-vegetation of exposed surfaces; 
xvii Stockpiles will be formed and utilised for the shortest possible 
time; 
xviii Stockpiles will be formed such that there are no steep sides or 
angular in form/shape; 
xix 
Stockpiles to be located away from the site boundary and 
sensitive receptors wherever possible;  
xx 
Stockpiles to be covered or enclosed wherever possible; 
xxi 
Exposed soils to be re-vegetated as soon as practicable.  
Near sensitive ecosystems or other sensitive receptors, 
hessian/mulches or similar techniques to be considered where 
it is not possible to re-vegetate or cover with topsoil;

ecosystems or other sensitive receptors during prolonged dry, 
dusty weather unless damping / other suppressants are used; 
xxiii Ensure an adequate water supply to site and use water as 
dust suppressant where applicable; 
xxiv Ensure any site machinery is well maintained and in full 
working order; 
xxv Ensure equipment available for cleaning spills of dusty 
material available at all times; and 
xxvi Sand and aggregates shall be stored away from sensitive 
receptors and screened/shielded.  Similarly concrete batching 
shall take place away from receptors. 
 
Trackout (where reasonably practicable): 
xxvii If required due to site conditions vehicles to be washed and 
cleaned effectively prior to leaving the site; 
xxviii Effective vehicle cleaning and specific wheel-washing facilities 
will be implemented at all site exits, including: hose pipes with 
adequate water supply and pressure and mechanical wheel 
spinners or brushes;  
xxix An area of paving/hard standing will be implemented between 
the washing facilities and the site exit;

xxxii Vehicles to comply with site speed limits (15mph on hard 
surfaces, 10mph on unconsolidated surfaces); 
xxxiii Water assisted sweeping of local roads to be undertaken if 
material is tracked out of site; 
xxxiv Install hard surfacing as soon as practicable on site and 
ensure that they are maintained in good condition; and 
xxxv Haulage routes would be planned in order to avoid adversely 
affecting air quality within the Aberdare Air Quality 
Management Area. 
3.3.7 
To ensure that dust generated by construction works does not exceed 
levels which could constitute a nuisance dust monitoring is proposed to 
be undertaken at the northern end of the Power Generation Site, in 
particular, in the vicinity of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC. A real 
time monitor for total suspended particulate is proposed, used as an 
‘indicative instrument; only.  The monitoring station would be mobile 
and would be moved around the site as principal activities move. 
Should dust arisings at this location be found to exceed trigger levels 
then additional dust control measures from the above list will be 
applied. Trigger levels for the instrument, which would suggest 
increasing risk emissions, will be agreed with RCT and NRW prior to 
the commencement of construction.  
3.3.8 
It is proposed that solid hoarding be erected along the northern edge of 
the Power Generation Plant site during demolition activities.  The 
prolonged storage of debris on-site, in temporary stockpiles will be 
avoided.  Vehicles removing demolition or site clearance materials 
must have their loads effectively sheeted on all sides.  Crushing of 
material for reuse, transportation or disposal shall be undertaken as far 
away as possible from sensitive receptors.  
3.3.9 
On-site burning of waste material will be forbidden.  
3.3.10 
The number of handling operations shall be minimised, ensuring that 
dusty material is not moved or handled unnecessarily.  Fine material 
shall be delivered to site in bags.  Drop heights must be kept to a 
minimum. 
3.3.11 
Hard-standing areas for vehicles entering, parking and leaving the 
Project Site shall be provided, with wheel washing facilities at access 
points where there is a risk of tracking mud onto local roads.  Plant and 
wheel washing will be carried out in a designated area of hardstanding 
at least 10 m from a watercourse or surface water drain.  Where this is 
not possible alternative mitigation will be implemented.

- 21 - 
3.3.12 
The performance of the wheel washing system will be maintained by 
the regular removal of settled sediment from within the sump.  Run-off 
from this area will be collected in a dedicated sump and water will be 
recycled/re-used wherever possible.  Where recovery is not possible, 
water from the sump system will be emptied to a dedicated storage 
tank prior to its removal from site for authorised disposal by a suitably 
licensed contractor. 
3.3.13 
Site roads shall be cleaned regularly, and damped down if necessary to 
prevent nuisance dust.  Site vehicle movements shall be kept to a 
minimum and, where possible, restricted to paved haulage routes.  
Vehicle speeds will be limited to 10 mph on unconsolidated track and 
15 mph on hard surfaces.  The idling of vehicles will be kept to a 
minimum. 
3.3.14 
The main contractor will have responsibility on a day to day basis for 
determining if either the nature of the activities on site or weather 
conditions would be likely to result in the unacceptable transfer of dust 
off site.  In cases where this is anticipated, remedial action will be taken 
to minimise emissions, including the application of appropriate control 
measures, or if necessary, the temporary suspension of works. 
3.3.15 
Good site management practices during the construction works will 
help to prevent the generation of airborne dust.  It will be the 
responsibility of the nominated main contractor and site manager to 
ensure through the final CEMP that sufficient precautionary measures 
to limit dust generation are in fact taken. 
3.4 
Contaminated Land and Groundwater 
3.4.1 
The CEMP will include a Demolition Method Statement which will apply 
as necessary to each Work Package of the Project.  
3.4.2 
During construction, if piling were to be required to the depth of the 
secondary aquifer A, mitigation measures set out in “Piling and 
penetrative ground improvement methods on land affected by 
contamination guidance on pollution prevention – NGWCLC Report 
NC/99/73” would be prepared and agreed with NRW as part of the 
CEMP in order to manage potential pollutant pathways. 
3.4.3 
Site investigations undertaken at an adjacent site to the Power 
Generation Plant have not revealed levels of contamination which are 
likely to pose a risk to human health or cause a statutory nuisance.  
Further ground investigations will be undertaken at the Power 
Generation Plant site prior to construction which will further define the 
exact nature of ground conditions at the Power Generation Plant Site. 
However, based on evidence to date, there are not anticipated to be

any significant issues with contamination at the Power Generation Plant 
site or Electrical Connection.  
3.4.4 
Foundation design will be informed from further assessment of ground 
conditions completed during environmental and geotechnical site 
investigation. 
3.4.5 
Land under which the Gas Connection will be developed has remained 
as undeveloped greenfield land and therefore there is low likelihood of 
contamination.    
3.4.6 
Professional standards and guidance relating to contamination will be 
consulted to provide advice on best practice mitigation measures which 
will be employed during the construction/demolition phase of the 
Project. 
3.4.7 
This multi-stage process is only to cover unexpected contamination. 
3.4.8 
Sensitive receptors are as follows:- 
 
Construction workers (during excavation and works); 
 
Site users; 
 
Groundwater; and 
 
Surface water bodies.  
3.4.9 
There is a small risk of construction workers coming into contact with 
contaminated soils and groundwater during construction. 
3.4.10 
There will be no access to construction areas by the general public. 
The site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access and contact with 
contaminated soil or groundwater. 
3.4.11 
In the case that unidentified contaminant “hotspots” showing visual of 
olfactory evidence of contamination are discovered during construction 
works, the following procedure will be applied:  
 
Stop work immediately; 
 
Report the discovery to the construction manager; 
 
Seal off the area to contain the spread of contaminants; 
 
Clear the area to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion; 
 
Contact the regulator or local authority once it is confirmed that 
contamination is found;

 
Arrange for testing to be carried out and agree changes to the 
existing contamination strategy; and 
 
Record details of the incident, including photos and relevant 
information on the Environmental Incident Report Form. 
3.4.12 
Any material which is excavated and free from visual and olfactory 
evidence of contamination will be stockpiled and tested for metal (and 
other determinants) for reuse on site.  Any soils which are considered 
to be contaminated hotspots (either identified through testing or through 
visual or olfactory evidence of contamination on site) will be removed 
and disposed of by a suitably licensed contractor or treated on-site.  
3.4.13 
All water from dewatering activities shall either be transported off site 
by a suitably licensed contractor or treated on site.  Any proposed 
discharges to existing land drains (or other surface water bodies) will 
be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Environment 
Agency (EA) Regulatory Position Statement on temporary water 
discharges from excavations, which is applied by NRW.  
3.4.14 
Where soils are imported onto the site then they shall be subject to 
testing to ensure contaminated soils are not being brought onto the 
site. 
3.4.15 
Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite to minimise disturbance of 
bare surfaces.  Measures shall also be put into place to ensure that the 
length of time bare surfaces are left exposed are minimised. 
3.4.16 
Precautions will be undertaken in accordance with NRW's Pollution 
Prevention Guidance to ensure that silt laden runoff, arisings or 
chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses.  Measures will 
include, testing of arisings to see whether they are suitable for reuse on 
site, siting stockpiles well away from watercourses, covering stockpiles 
in inclement weather, use of impermeable liners and use of fixing 
agents.  
3.4.17 
The final CEMP will identify any potential human health risks to 
construction workers or future site users so that appropriate 
mitigation/remediation can be put in place. 
3.4.18 
Although the main contractor undertaking the works will be required to 
produce a risk assessment and method statement detailing how they 
will minimise the risk of coming into contact with potentially 
contaminated materials, the following can be considered as a guide for 
the final CEMP:

3.4.21 
Construction workers will wear appropriate personal protective 
equipment (PPE) for the nature of works being undertaken.  This will 
involve standard site PPE, plus overall, gloves and eye protection. 
3.4.22 
Additional measures that will likely be taken are:  
 
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ 
area of the site;  
 
Site welfare facilities will be made available;  
 
All workers will be required to wash their hands and remove 
overalls/boots when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the site;  
 
Any soils excavated which are considered to be potentially 
contaminated (e.g. visual or olfactory evidence) will be reported to 
site management and left alone until their appropriate treatment.  
Suitable training will be provided to site personnel to ensure the 
correct identification of potentially contaminated soils by olfactory 
means; and 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with 
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts.

A Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) will form part of the CEMP, 
for use during the demolition and construction stages.  This will ensure 
waste management provisions complement the construction activities 
on site and that wastes emanating from the project are dealt with in an 
appropriate manner and their management follows the waste hierarchy. 
The SWMP will identify the waste types arising from the project, 
estimate quantities of each waste type and identify treatment. 
3.5 
Surface Water 
3.5.1 
The Power Generation Plant site is in the hydraulic catchment of the 
River Camnant. The upstream reaches of this watercourse are the Nant 
yr Ochain which is culverted under the site. Furthermore the Gas 
Connection runs through an area of marshy agricultural land parts of 
which form the Hirwaun Common Site of Importance Nature 
Conservation (SINC).  
3.5.2 
In order to ensure that there will be no discharges to any watercourses 
as a result of construction activities at the Project Site, the following 
matters shall be included in the detailed CEMP: 
 
Site infrastructure will be designed in accordance with EA pollution 
Prevention Guidelines and industry best practise. 
 
Oil storage will be undertaken in accordance with the Control of 
Pollution (Oil Storage) Regulations 2001.  Storage tanks will be 
located on an impervious base provided with bund walls to give a 
containment capacity of the greater of 110 per cent of the largest 
tank volume within the bund or 25 per cent of the total storage 
capacity of all tanks within the bund.  All valves and couplings will 
be contained within the bunded area; 
 
Any surface water which has the potential to be contaminated by 
hydrocarbons (e.g. from car parks), which are used during the 
construction phase, to be passed through oil interceptor(s) prior to 
discharge;   
 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any surface 
water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be allowed to 
enter directly or indirectly into any water course, underground strata 
or adjoining land; 
 
Provisions will be made so that all existing drainage systems 
continue to operate; 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made aware

of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with 
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts; 
 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted 
to a designated area with properly designed fuel tanks and bunds 
and suitable operating procedures;  
 
All static plant and any hazardous materials stored at the Power 
Generation Plant Site will be located within specifically designed 
areas with an impermeable base and with secondary containment 
designed to contain 110% of the maximum stored material. The 
drainage of these areas will incorporate oil separators designed 
and manufactured in accordance with BS EN 858-1 to ensure no 
contaminated runoff enters the surface water sewer or drains to a 
watercourse. A detailed emergency response plan will be prepared 
which will be enacted in the event of a spill of hazardous material to 
minimise the risk of environmental impacts; 
 
Construction access roads will be designed to ensure no increased 
flood risk or silt production; 
 
Temporary wheel washing facilities will be installed to prevent 
transfer of soil sediment onto nearby public roads. Runoff from 
wheel wash facilities will be collected and removed or treated prior 
to discharge; 
 
If deemed necessary, measures such as temporary drainage 
routes silt fences and silt bunds will be constructed to prevent 
heavily silted discharge to surface waters and to attenuate high 
flows; 
 
At the gas pipeline, pre- and post-construction agricultural under-
drainage schemes will be designed and installed to an agreed 
specification to ensure similar surface water flows pre- and post- 
construction and to ensure no increase in sediment, silt or nutrient 
runoff; 
 
A Soil Handling Strategy will be formulated, including a programme 
of soils de-compaction, loosening and aftercare aligned to the 
drainage schemes. This will facilitate soil structure recovery and 
natural drainage pathways to return soil water retention / storage to 
pre-construction status; 
 
During construction of the pipeline, care will be taken to ensure that 
silt laden water does not enter watercourses. This will be done by 
plugging existing drains, intercepting surface water above the 
working width and where appropriate by leaving filter strips of 
unstrapped topsoil along main watercourses / ditches. Topsoil will

be replaced over post-construction drains as soon as possible to 
prevent site water from getting into drains; 
 
For construction of the pipeline, any de-watering pumping will be 
undertaken using an appropriately sized pump at such a rate to 
avoid disturbance or erosion of stream banks.; 
 
The Main Contractor will be required to regularly inspect all pumps, 
pipes and connections; 
 
For construction of the pipeline, temporary lagoons, siltation tanks 
or filter membranes may be considered at sensitive outfall locations 
or where deeper excavations are proposed; 
 
Any stockpiled material will be located away from watercourses to 
avoid pollution runoff and best practice working guidelines will be 
followed to avoid spillages near watercourses;   
 
The final CEMP will be developed including a site environmental 
and health and safety management policy to mitigate construction 
risks. General rules apply to site works to ensure that no significant 
impact to identified receptors will occur during construction. Best 
practice recommendations for the prevention of contamination will 
be outlined in the final CEMP, both which will be developed and 
discussed with the Local Authority prior to commencement of 
construction;  
 
The draft Method Statement for protection of the nearby SINCs 
presented at Appendix 8.10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1.0) 
will be revised and included within the final CEMP. This Method 
Statement will include measures to prevent line rush establishing 
through inappropriate soil handling. This Method Statement is to be 
followed; and

British 
Standard 
Code 
of 
Practice 
for

Ecology 
3.6.1 
Relevant works to protect/mitigate impacts on ecology and biodiversity 
are described in more detail in the ES.  Appropriate regard for the 
protection of local habitats and protected species during the 
construction works will be included within the CEMP and will 
incorporate the following measures:  
 
As far as is practicable, work compounds and access tracks etc. 
will not be located in, or adjacent to, areas that maintain habitat 
value or are within areas supporting protected species;

 
The Construction footprint will be demarcated with robust fencing, 
to ensure a buffer of at least five metres between the construction 
footprint and any water bodies is preserved during construction. 
Furthermore it will prevent access to areas outside working areas, 
particularly in areas adjacent to features of interest/value; 
 
Briefings and instruction will be given to contractors regarding the 
biodiversity issues associated with the site and protocols and 
contingency plans will be established to deal with incidents should 
they arise including in relation to storage of potentially dangerous 
materials; 
 
The demolition of all buildings will be undertaken under statement 
European Protected species licence, to be obtained from Natural 
Resources Wales, and the supervision of a licensed bat worker;   
 
Where possible, all vegetation clearance prior to construction shall 
take place between September and February (depending on 
climatic conditions in a given year), to prevent damage to any nests 
of breeding birds; 
 
Where vegetation cannot be removed outside of the nesting 
season, pre-clearance checks must be undertaken by an 
experienced ecologist to identify if any birds are nesting within or 
close to the vegetation due to be removed.  To ensure legal 
compliance if a bird nest is found, no works will be undertaken in 
that area (approximately 10 m in all directions for most bird 
species) until the young birds are no longer dependent on the nest 
site;   
 
Works will be undertaken during daylight hours (i.e. 7:00-18:30) 
during the bat active season and artificial lighting overnight will be 
minimised. Where this is not possible, low sodium lighting will be 
used as this is known to have a minimal impact on bats relative to 
the majority of other types of construction lighting; 
 
Contaminants will not to be stored near areas of hydrological 
sensitivity;  
 
The draft Method Statement for protection of the nearby Sites of 
Important Nature Conservation (SINCs) presented at Appendix 
8.10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1.0) will be revised and 
included within the final CEMP in respect of Work nos 1, 3 and 4 
(i.e. those works which are proximate to the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate SINC and Hirwaun Common SINC) to be submitted under 
Requirement 12, once the detailed construction arrangements are 
confirmed.  This Method Statement is to be followed. Furthermore, 
if developed, Method Statements for marsh fritillary butterfly must 
be incorporated into the final EcMP and cross referred in the 
CEMP;

 
Ecological Management Plan(s) will be produced for each Work 
under Requirement 10 and must be given due regard as part of the 
final CEMP; 
 
A detailed soil handling and reinstatement strategy will be 
developed as part of the final CEMP; 
 
Solid hoarding shall be erected along the northern edge of the 
Power Generation Plant site during demolition; 
 
Any broad-leaved semi-natural woodland habitat lost from outside 
the permanent easement of the Gas Connection will be reinstated 
following construction using native species; 
 
Works will be programmed to occur outside periods of high flow i.e. 
will not be carried out after periods of heavy rainfall; 
 
Prior to each watercourse diversion commencing, in channel 
vegetation (if present) will be removed and placed on the banks of 
the watercourse downstream of the crossing point; 
 
The establishment of watercourse diversions will follow a careful 
procedure including the construction of a dam up stream, followed 
by the over-pumping of the watercourse downstream, trench 
excavation and laying of pipeline, trench reinstatement and 
reinstatement of watercourse; 
 
A pre-construction Otter Monitoring Survey will be undertaken 
under Requirement 10 but would inform preparation of the detailed 
CEMP; 
 
A simple Otter Method Statement will be included in the EcMP ( to 
capture measures to ensure that otters can cross the working width 
/ working corridor. As otters are most active around dawn and dusk 
(and therefore temporary obstructions during daylight construction 
are unlikely to require specific mitigation), fencing will be used 
outside working hours to create suitable commuting routes if 
necessary; Any trenches / pits which are excavated adjacent to 
suitable habitat are to be covered over outside working hours, or 
include an appropriate ramp to allow an otter to escape;  
 
All works in the vicinity of watercourse crossings will be undertaken 
under the guidance of a suitably qualified Ecologist; During 
construction, instead of creating new gaps in linear features, 
existing gaps will be utilised wherever possible;  
 
Light spillage onto linear features will be avoided by the use of 
directional lighting. The project will have regard to The Institute of 
Lighting Engineers/Bats Conservation Trust Best Practice 
Guidance in relation to lighting and bats;

 
Tree and shrub clearance will take place outside of the breeding 
bird season; 
 
The demolition of the two buildings within the Power Generation 
Plant compound which are used by barns swallows will be 
mitigated for by installing suitable ledges or readymade nests within 
the proposed bat mitigation structure; 
 
Measures to avoid the incidental mortality or injury of reptiles and 
amphibians will be incorporated into vegetation and site clearance 
methodologies; 
 
A pre-construction ecological constraints survey will be undertaken 
to confirm the ecological status of the site prior to demolition and 
construction works commencing; 
 
In relation to temporary effects on marshy grassland habitats, a 
detailed soil handling and reinstatement strategy will be developed 
as part of the CEMP.  This will be informed by pre-construction soil 
and vegetation surveys.  This will ensure impacts on marshy 
grassland soils within the Gas Connection route are minimised 
during site clearance, construction and restoration, maximising the 
success of the habitat restoration; 
 
A pre-construction survey of the site for marsh fritillary larval food-
plants (i.e. any of the scabious species) will be undertaken in the 
summer preceding construction of the Gas Connection. Should any 
food-plants be found the survey will be extended to include a 
search for larval webs in late summer; 
 
In the unlikely event marsh fritillary are detected then a specific 
method statement will be developed to ensure construction-related 
impacts on individual butterflies/larvae are avoided, for example by 
translocation of larval food webs to outside the construction 
footprint. Any such Method Statement, if required would be 
developed in consultation with NRW and the RCTCBC Ecologist; 
 
Any broad-leaved semi-natural woodland habitat lost from outside 
the permanent easement of the Gas Connection will be reinstated 
following construction using native species.  Native species only 
will be used, sourced from stock of local provenance if possible; 
 
During construction, the working width will also be minimised as far 
as possible; 
 
Demolition of buildings known to be used by breeding birds will 
either take place outside the breeding bird season, or will be 
preceded by blocking potential nesting locations in the winter prior 
to demolition;

 
Additional tree planting will also be provided immediately west of 
the A4061 at the southern end of the Gas Connection;   
 
The Landscape Strategy will also include reinstating any species-
poor hedgerows removed with species-rich hedgerow planting, and 
providing an increased diversity of tree/scrub species in 
replacement woodland/scrub planting mixes.  All re-instatement 
planting will be native species;  
 
In addition bird boxes will be erected on retained vegetation within 
HPL’s ownership; 
 
Monitoring of breeding bird populations will take place 1 and 3 
years post-construction;  
 
Reptiles and amphibians In order to ensure the incidental mortality 
of reptiles/amphibians is avoided, suitable terrestrial habitat for 
these species will be cut carefully to a height of under 15 cm prior 
to construction and site clearance commencing.  This will 
encourage those species to leave the Project Site; 
 
Otters The works programme will be staged so as to minimise the 
length of time works are carried out along any watercourse affected 
by construction of the Gas Connection; 
 
Watercourse crossings would be worked on for the minimum 
duration necessary (with the intent being for the duration of in-
channel works to last no more than one day per watercourse); 
 
Trenches and holes shall be covered when not being worked on to 
prevent entry by mammals and where this is not possible exist and 
escape routes such as ramps or mammal ladders will be provided; 
and 
 
Open entrances to pipes and pipelines shall be covered when not 
being worked on to prevent access by mammals.  
3.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
3.7.1 
The following mitigation measures, as outlined in the ES will be 
implemented during the construction phase in order to specifically limit 
impacts on landscape and visual amenity of the surrounding area:  
 
The retention and management of existing vegetation wherever 
possible; 
 
Planting, hard landscaping and other mitigation substantially in 
accordance with ES Figure 11.5;

 
Temporary storage of topsoil and any other material considered of 
value for retention. Where practical stores would be sited to screen 
the construction works; 
 
Agreed site access points; 
 
Maintenance of tidy and contained site compound; 
 
Where feasible, perimeter screen planting will be undertaken in 
advance of the works to be effective on completion of the 
construction works;  
 
Where practicable storage of topsoil will take place, with siting, to 
screen and/or provide a physical buffer between the construction 
works and more sensitive receptors;  
 
Temporary protection (in accordance with Best Practice) of any 
boundary vegetation to be retained;  
 
The design and layout of site construction areas will reduce 
adverse impacts arising from temporary security fencing and 
lighting;  
 
The removal of all temporary structures and stockpiles when no 
longer required;  
 
Spreading of topsoil, reseeding and planting within the Project Site 
and adjoining areas that are to be reinstated as soon as possible 
after sections of work are complete;  
 
Management of all reinstates area in accordance with a 5 year 
aftercare plan to help ensure full and successful establishment of 
the planting to the approval of the planning authority; and 
 
The prompt reinstatement of temporary construction areas when no 
longer required.  
3.8 
Archaeology / Cultural Heritage 
3.8.1 
An assessment of the potential archaeological and cultural heritage 
resource at the site has been undertaken as part of the ES.  Although 
the potential impacts on archaeology are low, they cannot be ruled out 
completely.  
3.8.2 
A Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) will be prepared in advance of 
demolition / construction commencing.  This will set out investigative 
measures such as evaluation trenching prior to construction, and 
monitoring of ground disturbance during construction and topsoil 
stripping activities.

Artificial Lighting 
3.9.1 
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to 
provide a safe working site during hours of darkness.  An outline 
lighting strategy has been prepared to support the DCO Application 
(document reference [6.2.0] Appendix 11.2) and compliance with this is 
secured by Requirement 16 of Schedule 2 of the DCO.  It shall also 
inform the CEMP in terms of general design objectives that will be used 
to ensure that adverse effects of lighting associated with demolition and 
construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
 
Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand;  
 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
 
Demolition and construction lighting shall be directed away from all 
sensitive receptors;  
 
Preference shall be given to several, lower lighting units rather than 
tall, wide beam lighting units to illuminate large areas as it will limit 
light trespass, glare and sky glow from the plant; 
 
Vehicle lights shall be properly directed (conforming to MOT 
requirements) and lenses must be intact to prevent un-necessary 
glare and light intrusion;  
 
Lighting shall be reduced or switched off when not required for 
safety purposes. Security lighting shall be kept at the minimum 
level needed for visual and security protection; and   
 
If appropriate, the use of infra-red floodlighting and CCTV systems 
shall be considered for security to reduce the need for visible 
lighting outside working hours.  
3.9.2 
Specific ecological design objectives that will be implemented to ensure 
that adverse effects of lighting associated with demolition and 
construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
 
There shall be no light intrusion beyond the boundary of the 
proposed Project Site and particularly within the SINC to the north 
of the Project Site which is a habitat that supports breeding birds 
and bats; 
 
There shall be no night-time working within the SINC while 
construction of the Gas Connection and above ground facility takes 
place; 
 
No task lighting shall be used between the Power Generation Plant 
to the north and the proposed laydown area (in the existing car 
park) to the south to avoid fragmentation of habitats at night-time;

 
No temporary lighting shall be installed along the Gas Connection 
corridor between the main site and the working area of the pipeline 
to avoid fragmentation of habitats used by bats at night-time; and 
 
Dark corridors shall be maintained on hedgerows and watercourses 
and any other linear features by avoiding light trespass on these 
areas. This will avoid the fragmentation of habitat used by species 
such as bats and also otters that use these features to move at 
night-time.

INTRODUCTION  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL) is making an application for a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Secretary of State for 
Energy and Climate Change (SoS).  The DCO will authorise HPL to 
construct and operate a new 299 megawatt electrical (MWe) simple 
cycle gas turbine (SCGT) Power Generation Plant together with integral 
Gas and Electrical Connections (hereafter referred to as the Project).  
The Power Generation Plant will be located on the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate between Rhigos and Hirwaun in South Wales.   
1.2 
Purpose of this document  
1.2.1 
This document provides an outline from which a final Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be produced for each 
Work in the DCO, which willto govern all parts of the construction works 
(including site preparation/demolition) associated with the Project for all 
contractors. This document will be hereafter referred to as the ‘outline 
CEMP’.  This outline CEMP is informed by the ES and associated DCO 
documents.  
1.2.2 
Schedule 2 Requirement 12 of the DCO includes a requirement to 
approve CEMP(s) in a staged manner by the local planning authority, 
namely Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC) prior 
to the commencement of any works.  Such CEMP(s)) will be developed 
after any grant of a DCO, in conjunction with, or by, the main 
contractor/s appointed for such works once the timescales for the 
detailed implementation are defined.  
1.2.3 
The final CEMP(s) shouldshall consider the following: 
• 
Complaints procedures; 
• 
Nuisance management including measures to avoid or minimise 
the impacts of construction works (covering dust, noise, vibration 
and lighting); 
• 
Lighting; 
• 
Waste management; 
• 
Surface and ground water mitigation measures; 
• 
Procedure in the event significant archaeological remains are 
encountered;

• 
Landscape and visual impact mitigation (such as retention of 
existing trees and minimising visual intrusion of construction 
works); and 
• 
Security measures.; 
1.2.4 
Traffic and Transport mitigation measures (such as aare to be in a 
Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP)) prepared by the main 
contractors and submitted under Requirement 13 of Schedule 2 of the 
DCO, and complementary to the CEMP). Similarly ; andEecological 
mitigation measures are to be contained in an(such as an EcMP to be 
submitted under Requirement 10 of Schedule 2 of the DCO, and 
complementary to the CEMP.) Appropriate references to these 
documents are made in this Outline CEMP and should be made in the 
final CEMP(s). 
1.2.5 
In considering these environmental matters the final CEMP will provide 
information on: 
• 
A register of environmental aspects [the effects of the Scheme]; 
• 
Roles and responsibilities; 
• 
Communication and co-ordination; 
• 
Training and awareness; 
• 
Operational control; 
• 
Checking and corrective action; and  
• 
Environmental control measures. 
1.2.6 
The final CEMP will fall within the scope of the main contractor’s 
externally certified international environmental management systems, 
and as such will be subject to independent audits by the relevant 
certification bodies.   
1.2.7 
This outline CEMP provides sufficient information, based on best 
practice guidance and mitigation measures in the ES to act as a 
framework for the final CEMP and to provide assurance to the decision 
maker and stakeholders that all appropriate measures will be taken 
forward to the construction phase.  
1.2.8 
Measures set out in the final CEMP will also have reference to the 
Welsh Government document ‘Construction and Demolition Sector 
Plan’ which seeks to move towards zero waste by detailing outcomes, 
policies and delivery actions for organisations, companies and 
individuals involved with the construction and demolition sector in 
Wales. It forms part of the suite of documents that comprise the waste

management plan/strategy for Wales, in accordance with the plan 
making requirements enshrined in Wales and EU legislation.   
1.3 
Project Description 
1.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and has been designed to provide an 
electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts electrical (MWe). The plant will 
be fuelled by natural gas.   
1.3.2 
The three main elements of the Hirwaun Power Project comprise:  
• 
A new Power Generation Plant, a SCGT gas fired ‘peaking’ power 
generating plant capable of providing up to 299 MWe; 
• 
A new underground electrical cable connection (the Electrical 
Connection) to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant 
into the National Grid at Rhigos Substation; and  
• 
A new underground gas pipeline connection (the Gas Connection) 
to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the existing 
high pressure gas network National Transmission System in the 
vicinity of the proposed Project Site.  This element of the Project 
also includes the above ground installation (AGI) for the gas 
pipeline at the point of connection to the National Transmission 
System (NTS), as well as a new permanent access to the AGI.  
1.3.3 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection together are referred to as the Project and are all integral to 
the generation of electricity and the subsequent export of that electricity 
to the National Grid.  
1.3.4 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP) by virtue of section 14 (1)(a) and section 15 of the Planning Act 
2008 (PA 2008) which includes within the definition of an NSIP any 
onshore generating station in England or Wales of 50 MWe capacity or 
more. Under section 31 PA 2008 a development consent order (DCO) 
is required to develop a NSIP. Under section 37 PA 2008 this can only 
be granted if an application is made for it to the Secretary of State 
(SoS) (the DCO Application).  
1.3.5 
This outline CEMP is part of a suite of documents which accompany 
the DCO Application and should be read in conjunction to gain a fuller 
understanding of the Project.

OUTLINE CEMP – GENERAL INFORMATION 
2.1 
Register of Environmental Impacts 
2.1.1 
A register of Environmental Impacts is required to be produced as part 
of the CEMP.  This Register would be used to inform the environmental 
procedures and provide a tool for construction teams when preparing 
construction method statements or field briefings.  This register would 
also comprise the various risks identified in the Environmental 
Statement (ES) and would be regularly updated to reflect any additional 
risks resulting from the main contractor/s selected methods of working, 
changing site conditions etc. Risks would be identified under the 
following general headings: 
• 
Noise & Vibration; 
• 
Air Quality & Emissions; 
• 
Geology & Soils; 
• 
Water Quality, Drainage & Hydrology; 
• 
Landscape and Visual Impacts;  
• 
Ecology; 
• 
Traffic and Transport; 
• 
Waste and Health; 
• 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage; and  
• 
Combined Impacts.  
2.2 
Risk Assessments 
2.2.1 
All activities undertaken on-site would be subject to an environmental 
risk assessment.  Environmental risk assessments would be 
undertaken by trained staff following an approved procedure which will: 
• 
Identify potential environmental impacts that can be anticipated; 
• 
Assess the risks from these impacts; 
• 
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; 
and 
• 
Report where an unacceptable level of residual risk is identified so 
that action can be taken through design changes, re-scheduling of 
work or alternative methods of working in order to reduce the risk to 
an acceptable level. 
2.2.2 
The results of risk assessments, and their residual risks are only 
considered acceptable if:

Hirwaun Power Project Outline CEMP 
 
• 
The severity of outcome is reduced to the lowest practical level;  
• 
The number of risk exposures are minimised; and 
• 
All reasonably practical mitigating measures have been taken and 
the residual risk rating is reduced to a minimum.  
2.2.3 
The findings of the risk assessment and in particular the necessary 
controls 
would 
be 
explained 
to 
all 
contractors 
before 
the 
commencement of the relevant works using an agreed instruction 
format (e.g. Toolbox Talks).  
2.3 
Method Statements 
2.3.1 
Method statements would be completed by the main contractor or sub 
contractor by trained engineers or other appropriately experienced 
personnel, in consultation with on-site staff and, where necessary, 
environmental specialists.  Their production would include a review of 
the environmental risks and commitments, so that appropriate control 
measures are developed and included within the construction process. 
2.3.2 
Method statements would be reviewed by the main contractor or sub 
contractor’s appointed environmental manager and, where necessary, 
by an appropriate environmental specialist.  Where required, method 
statements would also be submitted to the enforcement agencies 
(Natural Resources Wales, Environmental Health Officer from 
RCTCBC etc.).  Method statements would most likely contain the 
following: 
• 
Location of the activity and access/egress arrangements; 
• 
Work to be undertaken and methods of construction; 
• 
Plant and materials to be used; 
• 
Labour and supervision requirements; 
• 
Health, safety and environmental considerations; and 
• 
Any permit or consent requirements beyond those already obtained 
(including the DCO). 
2.4 
Site Environmental Standards 
2.4.1 
Site Environmental Standards would be agreed with the main 
contractor and would detail the minimum measures that shouldshall be 
achieved 
for 
general 
operations 
falling 
outside 
the 
risk 
assessment/method statement procedure. The site environmental 
standards would be designed to cover the majority of construction 
activities in accordance with the ES submitted with the application and 
requirements associated with the DCO.

Hirwaun Power Project Outline CEMP 
 
2.4.2 
These will cover issues such as storage of materials, management of 
waste, noise and vibration, and water pollution control.  The standards 
will be printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice boards and used as 
a briefing tool on site.  These standards will also form the basis of 
Toolbox talks which will inform all contractors working on site of the 
potential environmental risks arising from construction activities.  
2.4.3 
Best practice construction site management techniques will be 
implemented to avoid/minimise the generation of excessive waste, 
dust, noise, lighting, noise and vibration, in accordance with the ES and 
relevant requirements associated with the DCO.  These are discussed 
in more detail in Section 3 of this document.  
2.5 
Environmental Management System 
2.5.1 
Following construction, an Environmental Management System for 
commercial operation will be developed and contained within the 
overall Business Management System prepared by the operator and 
designed to comply with ISO 14001 or an equivalent recognised 
standard. 
2.5.2 
Implementation of ISO 14001 is a Key Strategy for HPL and the use of 
an Environmental Management Plan for commissioning based on ISO 
14001 (or similar) will be used to support implementation and 
compliance with the DCO and the Environmental Permit that will be 
required for operation of the Project under the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2011.  All operational staff for the 
Project will be given comprehensive environmental awareness training 
as part of this process. 
2.5.3 
During the commissioning phase of the Project, HPL will require its 
environmental and compliance procedures to be implemented and 
used by the main contractor and the operator.  
2.6 
Public Relations 
2.6.1 
The following steps will be taken to make the public aware of the 
activities on site and the available lines of communication with HPL: 
• 
Neighbouring occupiers will be notified of the start of site works and 
the likely duration of the overall demolition and construction 
phases;  
• 
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published 
local to the site.  The site safety, health and environment (SHE) 
officer will be responsible for dealing with any complaints and will 
have the appropriate authority to resolve any issues that may

occur.  Should they be required both the SHE officer and the site 
managers ‘out of hours’ telephone numbers will be available; 
• 
The SHE officer will maintain a close liaison with the council’s 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at all times; 
• 
Should any complaints regarding dust be received by the SHE 
officer the details will be passed to the EHO for verification 
purposes; and 
• 
Should any unforeseen event occur within the construction site that 
has the potential to cause off-site pollution then the SHE officer will 
immediately notify the EHO by phone and e-mail.  As far as 
possible notice will be issued to the EHO for dealing with an 
unforeseen activity which may give rise to a particular dust 
problem. 
2.7 
Monitoring and Measurement 
2.7.1 
Weekly site inspections will be carried out which will assess the 
potential for environmental emergency situations to arise on the site.  
Additionally the main contractor will assess the potential for 
environmental incidents on a daily basis across the site.  Particular 
notice will be taken during and following extreme weather events, when 
working in areas of known contamination, and when particularly 
hazardous activities are being carried out.  Method Statements will be 
required where the risk assessment has identified a significant risk to 
the environment.  
2.7.2 
In the event of any environmental incident the most senior 
representative of the main contractor will take the role of the 
responsible person and will take charge of the situation.  Where 
possible, the responsible person will take immediate steps to eliminate 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
environment 
and 
mitigate/minimise 
any 
environmental damage. 
2.8 
Roles and Responsibilities  
2.8.1 
Suggested specific roles and responsibilities for the implementation of 
the final CEMP are described below:

OUTLINE CEMP – SPECIFIC MEASURES 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation 
measures which will be used in the CEMP for the Project in order to 
limit impacts on noise and vibration, air quality, contaminated land and 
groundwater, ecology, archaeology and cultural heritage and landscape 
and visual amenity. It will additionally outline the measures to prevent 
impacts arsingarising from artificial lighting.   
3.2 
Noise and Vibration 
3.2.1 
This section outlines the potential sources of nuisance noise created by 
construction works and the methods of mitigation proposed to limit 
these impacts which shouldshall be adopted in a CEMP.  
3.2.2 
All construction activities will be undertaken in accordance with 
requirements attached to the DCO, and the recommendations of BS 
5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites’.  It 
details the legislative background to noise control, along with the 
recommended procedures for effective liaison between developers, site 
operators and local authorities.  Methods of how to minimise the impact 
of site noise on workers and local residents are also provided. 
3.2.3 
The main mitigation measure to limit impacts of nuisance noise on 
human receptors is to ensure noise levels do not exceed the noise 
thresholds set out in the ES (65 dBA daytime) and to undertake noise 
monitoring during construction to make sure these agreed thresholds 
are not breached. 
3.2.4 
In addition, construction works shall not take place outside the hours of 
07:00-19:0018.30 Monday to Friday and 07.00-13.00 on Saturday, 
unless otherwise agreed with RCTCBC.  Controls on working hours are 
specifically set out in DCO Schedule 2 Requirements 14 and 15. 
3.2.5 
If works are required outside of these core construction hours then 
method statements and risk assessments will be required to be 
submitted to the local planning authority for approval.   
3.2.6 
To minimise the risk of noise complaints, the main contractor will advise 
potentially affected residents of the works to be undertaken outside of 
working hours.  The residents will also be provided with a point of 
contact for any queries or complaints.  
3.2.7 
The main contractor and all sub-contractors working on-site have a 
general duty to take all reasonably practicable measures to minimise

nuisance from noise and vibration that has the potential to impact on 
the local community or environment.  To achieve this and avoid the 
potential for construction works to give rise to consequences that would 
otherwise be statutory nuisances (but for the provision of the DCO), 
Best Practicable Means (BPM) as defined in section 79(9)(a) of the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 must be employed and the following 
requirements will be complied with: 
• 
Appropriate 
selection 
of 
plant, 
construction 
methods 
and 
programming.  Only plant conforming with relevant national or 
international standards, directives or recommendations on noise or 
vibrations emissions will be used;   
• 
Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately, 
having regard to the manufacturer’s written recommendations or 
using other appropriate operation and maintenance programmes 
which reduce noise and vibration emissions; 
• 
All vehicles and plant will be switched off when not in use; 
• 
Approved routes and programming for the transport of construction 
materials, spoil and personnel to reduce the risk of increased noise 
and vibration impacts due to the construction of the project; 
• 
Vehicle and mechanical plant used for the purpose of the works 
shouldshall be fitted with effective exhaust silencers, to be 
maintained in good working order and operated in such a manner 
as to be maintained in good working order and operated in such a 
manner as to minimise noise emissions.  The contractor 
shouldshall use plant items that comply with the relevant EU/UK 
noise limits applicable to all equipment; 
• 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps 
would be positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance 
(e.g. as far away as practicable from residential receptors).  If 
necessary, temporary acoustic barriers or enclosures would be 
provided; 
• 
The positioning of construction plant and activities to minimise 
noise at sensitive locations; 
• 
Equipment that breaks concrete by munching or similar, rather than 
by percussion, shouldshall be used as far as is practicable; 
• 
The use of mufflers on pneumatic tools; 
• 
Where practicable, rotary drills actuated by hydraulic or electrical 
power shouldshall be used for excavating hard materials; 
• 
The use of non-reciprocating construction plant where ever 
practicable;

• 
The use, where necessary, of effective sound reducing enclosures; 
• 
The targeting, where possible, of noisy work at times which 
minimise disturbance; and 
• 
To prevent damage to adjacent structures, demolition and 
construction activities will be carried out in accordance with Part 2 
of BS 7385:1993 (Evaluation and Measurement for Vibration in 
Buildings). 
3.3 
Air Quality 
3.3.1 
Relevant air quality mitigation measures are outlined in Section 6 of the 
ES and in the Statutory Nuisance Statement.  However, the following 
provides an outline of the processes which could be employed in the 
final CEMP in order to reduce dust and exhaust emissions during 
construction.  
3.3.2 
This section outlines the potential sources of air pollution created by 
construction works and the methods of mitigation proposed to limit 
these impacts which shouldshall be adopted in the final CEMP.  The 
following provides an outline of the processes which shouldshall be 
employed in the final CEMP in order to reduce dust and exhaust 
emissions during construction. 
3.3.3 
A site-specific dust management plan (DuMP) will be prepared for use 
Dduring the demolition phase (Work no. 1) and the construction of the 
Power Generation Plant (Work no. 2), Gas Connection (Work nos. 3 & 
4) and Electrical Connection (Work no. 5), it is intended that a site 
specific dust management plan (DuMP).  This  will form part of the full 
CEMP for the sitefor the work(s) and will require to be submitted and 
approved in writing by RCT prior to works commencing. 
3.3.2 
Furthermore,A a Construction Traffic Management Plan will be 
prepared to manage construction traffic, as well as minimise effects of 
the works on congestion and hence elevated vehicle emissions on the 
highway.  This is a requirement under Schedule 2 Requirement 13 of 
the DCO so would be submitted separately to the CeEMP but will be 
suitably cross-referred and linked.  
3.3.4 
 
3.3.33.3.5 
Construction/demolition activities associated with the greatest potential 
for dust generation are: 
• 
Earthworks including excavation of topsoil, handling on site and 
deposition;

• 
Handling and storage of materials (including loading and 
unloading); 
• 
Wind blow across disturbed/exposed site surfaces and materials; 
and 
• 
 Mechanical operations such as crushing, drilling, concrete mixing 
and cutting.  
3.3.43.3.6 
In order to ensure the employment of Best Practicable Methods (BPM) 
will be used to minimise the risk of adverse effects from construction 
dust and causing nuisance or damage to flora and fauna specific 
control measures for limiting nuisance dust and exhaust emissions 
during construction are as follows:  
• 
Site Management 
i 
Records of dust and air quality complaints to be kept, 
including likely causes and mitigation measures to reduce 
impacts if appropriate; 
ii 
On-site and off-site visual inspections to be undertaken and

iii 
Inspections shall be increased in frequency during periods of 
high activity or prolonged dry, windy weather; and 
iv 
Keep site perimeter, fences etc clean. 
• 
Site Planning 
v 
Consideration of weather conditions, dust generating potential 
of material to be excavated prior to commencement of works; 
vi 
Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles 
etc. to sensitive receptors; 
vii 
If work within 20m of sensitive receptors cannot be avoided, 
erect solid screens at least as high as stockpiles; and 
viii 
Dusty materials shall be removed from site as soon as 
possible. 
• 
Demolition (where reasonably practicable): 
iix 
Use of water as a dust suppressant;

3.3.7 
To ensure that dust generated by construction works does not exceed 
levels which could constitute a nuisance  dust monitoring is proposed to 
be undertaken at the northern end of the Power Generation Site, in 
particular, in the vicinity of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC. A real 
time monitor for total suspended particulate is proposed, used as an 
‘indicative instrument; only.  The monitoring station would be mobile 
and wshould be moved around the site as principal activities move. 
Should dust arisings at this location be found to exceed trigger levels 
then additional dust control measures from the above list will be 
applied. Trigger levels for the instrument, which would suggest 
increasing risk emissions, will be agreed with NRW RCT and NRW 
prior to the commencement of construction.  
3.3.53.3.8 
It is proposed that solid hoarding be erected along the northern edge of 
the Power Generation Plant site during demolition activities.  The 
prolonged storage of debris on-site, in temporary stockpiles will be 
avoided.  Vehicles removing demolition or site clearance materials 
must have their loads effectively sheeted on all sides.  Crushing of 
material for reuse, transportation or disposal shouldshall be undertaken 
as far away as possible from sensitive receptors.  
3.3.63.3.9 
On-site burning of waste material will be forbidden.  
3.3.73.3.10 The number of handling operations shouldshall be minimised, ensuring 
that dusty material is not moved or handled unnecessarily.  Fine 
material shouldshall be delivered to site in bags.  Drop heights must be 
kept to a minimum. 
3.3.83.3.11 Hard-standing areas for vehicles entering, parking and leaving the 
Project Site shouldshall be provided, with wheel washing facilities at

access points where there is a risk of tracking mud onto local roads.  
Plant and wheel washing will be carried out in a designated area of 
hardstanding at least 10 m from a watercourse or surface water drain.  
Where this is not possible alternative mitigation will be implemented.   
3.3.93.3.12 The performance of the wheel washing system will be maintained by 
the regular removal of settled sediment from within the sump.  Run-off 
from this area will be collected in a dedicated sump and water will be 
recycled/re-used wherever possible.  Where recovery is not possible, 
water from the sump system will be emptied to a dedicated storage 
tank prior to its removal from site for authorised disposal by a suitably 
licensed contractor. 
3.3.103.3.13 Site roads shouldshall be cleaned regularly, and damped down if 
necessary to prevent nuisance dust.  Site vehicle movements 
shouldshall be kept to a minimum and, where possible, restricted to 
paved haulage routes.  Vehicle speeds will be limited to 10 mph on 
unconsolidated track and 2015 mph on hard standingsurfaces10 km/h.  
The idling of vehicles will be kept to a minimum. 
3.3.113.3.14 The main contractor will have responsibility on a day to day basis for 
determining if either the nature of the activities on site or weather 
conditions would be likely to result in the unacceptable transfer of dust 
off site.  In cases where this is anticipated, remedial action will be taken 
to minimise emissions, including the application of appropriate control 
measures, or if necessary, the temporary suspension of works. 
3.3.123.3.15 Good site management practices during the construction works will 
help to prevent the generation of airborne dust.  It will be the 
responsibility of the nominated main contractor and site manager to 
ensure through the final CEMP that sufficient precautionary measures 
to limit dust generation are in fact taken.

secondary aquifer A, mitigation measures set out in “Piling and 
penetrative ground improvement methods on land affected by 
contamination guidance on pollution prevention – NGWCLC Report

3.4.13.4.3 
Site investigations undertaken at an adjacent site to the Power 
Generation Plant have not revealed levels of contamination which are 
likely to pose a risk to human health or cause a statutory nuisance.  
Further ground investigations will be undertaken at the Power 
Generation Plant site prior to construction which will further define the 
exact nature of ground conditions at the Power Generation Plant Site. 
However, based on evidence to date, there are not anticipated to be 
any significant issues with contamination at the Power Generation Plant 
site or Electrical Connection.  
3.4.4 
Foundation design will be informed from further assessment of ground 
conditions completed during environmental and geotechnical site 
investigation. 
3.4.23.4.5 
Land under which the Gas Connection will be developed has remained 
as undeveloped greenfield land and therefore there is low likelihood of 
contamination.    
3.4.33.4.6 
Professional standards and guidance relating to contamination will be 
consulted to provide advice on best practice mitigation measures which 
will be employed during the construction/demolition phase of the 
Project. 
3.4.43.4.7 
This multi-stage process is only to cover unexpected contamination. 
3.4.53.4.8 
Sensitive receptors are as follows:- 
• 
Construction workers (during excavation and works); 
• 
Site users; 
• 
Groundwater; and 
• 
Surface water bodies.  
3.4.63.4.9 
There is a small risk of construction workers coming into contact with 
contaminated soils and groundwater during construction. 
3.4.73.4.10 There will be no access to construction areas by the general public. 
The site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access and contact with 
contaminated soil or groundwater. 
3.4.83.4.11 In the case that unidentified contaminant “hotspots” showing visual of 
olfactory evidence of contamination are discovered during construction 
works, the following procedure will be applied:  
• 
Stop work immediately; 
• 
Report the discovery to the construction manager;

• 
Seal off the area to contain the spread of contaminants; 
• 
Clear the area to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion; 
• 
Contact the regulator or local authority once it is confirmed that 
contamination is found; 
• 
Arrange for testing to be carried out and agree changes to the 
existing contamination strategy; and 
• 
Record details of the incident, including photos and relevant 
information on the Environmental Incident Report Form. 
3.4.93.4.12 Any material which is excavated and free from visual and olfactory 
evidence of contamination will be stockpiled and tested for metal (and 
other determinants) for reuse on site.  Any soils which are considered 
to be contaminated hotspots (either identified through testing or through 
visual or olfactory evidence of contamination on site) will be removed 
and disposed of by a suitably licensed contractor or treated on-site.  
3.4.103.4.13 All water from dewatering activities shall either be transported off site 
by a suitably licensed contractor or treated on site.  Any proposed 
discharges to existing land drains (or other surface water bodies) will 
be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Environment 
Agency (EA) Regulatory Position Statement on temporary water 
discharges from excavations, which is applied by NRW.  
3.4.113.4.14 Where soils are imported onto the site then they shall be subject to 
testing to ensure contaminated soils are not being brought onto the 
site. 
3.4.123.4.15 Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite to minimise disturbance of 
bare surfaces.  Measures shall also be put into place to ensure that the 
length of time bare surfaces are left exposed are minimised. 
3.4.133.4.16 Precautions will be undertaken in accordance with Natural Resources 
Wales (NRW's) Pollution Prevention Guidance to ensure that silt laden 
runoff, arisings or chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses.  
Measures will include, testing of arisings to see whether they are 
suitable for reuse on site, siting stockpiles well away from 
watercourses, covering stockpiles in inclement weather, use of 
impermeable liners and use of fixing agents.  
3.4.17 
The final CEMP will identify any potential human health risks to 
construction workers or future site users so that appropriate 
mitigation/remediation can be put in place.

3.4.143.4.18 Although the main contractor undertaking the works will be required to 
produce a risk assessment and method statement detailing how they 
will minimise the risk of coming into contact with potentially 
contaminated materials, the following can be considered as a guide for 
the final CEMP: 
3.4.153.4.19 Compliance with the mitigation measures set out in the following 
documents: 
• 
Protection of Workers and the general public during the 
development of contaminated land (HSE 1991); and 
• 
If applicable, a guide to safe working on contaminated sites R132 
(CIRIA 1996). 
3.4.163.4.20 Work will be carried out in accordance with best practices and safe 
working practices will be maintained.  
3.4.173.4.21 Construction workers will wear appropriate personal protective 
equipment (PPE) for the nature of works being undertaken.  This will 
involve standard site PPE, plus overall, gloves and eye protection. 
3.4.183.4.22 Additional measures that will likely be taken are:  
• 
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ 
area of the site;  
• 
Site welfare facilities will be made available;  
• 
All workers will be required to wash their hands and remove 
overalls/boots when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the site;  
• 
Any soils excavated which are considered to be potentially 
contaminated (e.g. visual or olfactory evidence) will be reported to 
site management and left alone until their appropriate treatment.  
Suitable training will be provided to site personnel to ensure the 
correct identification of potentially contaminated soils by olfactory 
means; and 
• 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with 
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts. 
3.4.193.4.23 Measures shouldshall be taken to avoid/minimise the potential for fuel 
and chemical spills.  A spill response procedure will also apply on-site;

A Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) will form part of the CEMP, 
for use during the demolition and construction stages.  This will ensure 
waste management provisions complement the construction activities 
on site and that wastes emanating from the project are dealt with in an 
appropriate manner and their management follows the waste hierarchy. 
The SWMP will identify the waste types arising from the project, 
estimate quantities of each waste type and identify treatment.

Surface Water 
3.5.1 
The Power Generation Plant site is in the hydraulic catchment of the 
River Camnant. The upstream reaches of this watercourse are the Nant 
yr Ochain which is culverted under the site.  
3.5.1 
 Furthermore the Gas Connection runs through an area of marshy 
agricultural land parts of which form the Hirwaun Common Site of 
Importance Nature Conservation (SINC).  
3.5.2 
In order to ensure that there will be no discharges to any watercourses 
as a result of construction activities at the Project Site, the following 
matters should shall be included in the detailed CEMP: 
• 
Site infrastructure will be designed in accordance with EA pollution 
Prevention Guidelines and industry best practise. 
• 
Oil storage will be undertaken in accordance with the Control of 
Pollution (Oil Storage) Regulations 2001.  Storage tanks will be 
located on an impervious base provided with bund walls to give a 
containment capacity of the greater of 110 per cent of the largest 
tank volume within the bund or 25 per cent of the total storage 
capacity of all tanks within the bund.  All valves and couplings will 
be contained within the bunded area; 
• 
Any surface water which has the potential to be contaminated by 
hydrocarbons (e.g. from car parks), which are used during the 
construction phase, to be passed through oil interceptor(s) prior to 
discharge;   
• 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any surface 
water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be allowed to 
enter directly or indirectly into any water course, underground strata 
or adjoining land; 
• 
Provisions will be made so that all existing drainage systems 
continue to operate; 
• 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the

contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with 
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts; 
• 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted 
to a designated area with properly designed fuel tanks and bunds 
and suitable operating procedures;  
• 
All static plant and any hazardous materials stored at the Power 
Generation Plant Site will be located within specifically designed 
areas with an impermeable base and with secondary containment 
designed to contain 110% of the maximum stored material. The 
drainage of these areas will incorporate oil separators designed 
and manufactured in accordance with BS EN 858-1 to ensure no 
contaminated runoff enters the surface water sewer or drains to a 
watercourse. A detailed emergency response plan will be prepared 
which will be enacted in the event of a spill of hazardous material to 
minimise the risk of environmental impacts; 
• 
Construction access roads will be designed to ensure no increased 
flood risk or silt production; 
• 
Temporary wheel washing facilities will be installed to prevent 
transfer of soil sediment onto nearby public roads. Runoff from 
wheel wash facilities will be collected and removed or treated prior 
to discharge; 
• 
If deemed necessary, measures such as temporary drainage 
routes silt fences and silt bunds will be constructed to prevent 
heavily silted discharge to surface waters and to attenuate high 
flows; 
• 
At the gas pipeline, pre- and post-construction agricultural under-
drainage schemes will be designed and installed to an agreed 
specification to ensure similar surface water flows pre- and post- 
construction and to ensure no increase in sediment, silt or nutrient 
runoff; 
• 
A Soil Handling Strategy will be formulated, including a programme 
of soils de-compaction, loosening and aftercare aligned to the 
drainage schemes. This will facilitate soil structure recovery and 
natural drainage pathways to return soil water retention / storage to 
pre-construction status; 
• 
During construction of the pipeline, care will be taken to ensure that 
silt laden water does not enter watercourses. This will be done by 
plugging existing drains, intercepting surface water above the 
working width and where appropriate by leaving filter strips of 
unstrapped topsoil along main watercourses / ditches. Topsoil will

prevent site water from getting into drains; 
• 
For construction of the pipeline, any de-watering pumping will be 
undertaken using an appropriately sized pump at such a rate to 
avoid disturbance or erosion of stream banks.; 
• 
The Main Contractor will be required to regularly inspect all pumps, 
pipes and connections; 
• 
For construction of the pipeline, temporary lagoons, siltation tanks 
or filter membranes may be considered at sensitive outfall locations 
or where deeper excavations are proposed; 
• 
Any stockpiled material will be located away from watercourses to 
avoid pollution runoff and best practice working guidelines will be 
followed to avoid spillages near watercourses;   
• 
The final CEMP will be developed including a site environmental 
and health and safety management policy to mitigate construction 
risks. General rules apply to site works to ensure that no significant 
impact to identified receptors will occur during construction. Best 
practice recommendations for the prevention of contamination will 
be outlined in the final CEMP, both which will be developed and 
discussed with the Local Authority prior to commencement of 
construction;  
• 
The draft Method Statement for protection of the nearby SINCs 
presented at Appendix 8.10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1.0)

Where vegetation cannot be removed outside of the nesting 
season, pre-clearance checks must be undertaken by an 
experienced ecologist to identify if any birds are nesting within or 
close to the vegetation due to be removed.  To ensure legal 
compliance if a bird nest is found, no works will be undertaken in 
that area (approximately 10 m in all directions for most bird 
species) until the young birds are not longerno longer dependent 
on the nest site;

ensure that otters can cross the working width / working corridor. 
As otters are most active around dawn and dusk (and therefore 
temporary obstructions during daylight construction are unlikely to 
require specific mitigation), fencing will be used outside working 
hours to create suitable commuting routes if necessary; Any 
trenches / pits which are excavated adjacent to suitable habitat are 
to be covered over outside working hours, or include an appropriate 
ramp to allow an otter to escape; and

Tree and shrub clearance will take place outside of the breeding 
bird season; 
• 
The demolition of the two buildings within the Power Generation 
Plant compound which are used by barns swallows will be 
mitigated for by installing suitable ledges or readymade nests within 
the proposed bat mitigation structure; 
• 
Measures to avoid the incidental mortality or injury of reptiles and 
amphibians will be incorporated into vegetation and site clearance 
methodologies; 
• 
A pre-construction ecological constraints survey will be undertaken 
to confirm the ecological status of the site prior to demolition and 
construction works commencing; 
• 
In relation to temporary effects on marshy grassland habitats, a 
detailed soil handling and reinstatement strategy will be developed 
as part of the CEMP.  This will be informed by pre-construction soil 
and vegetation surveys.  This will ensure impacts on marshy 
grassland soils within the Gas Connection route are minimised 
during site clearance, construction and restoration, maximising the 
success of the habitat restoration; 
• 
A pre-construction survey of the site for marsh fritillary larval food-
plants (i.e. any of the scabious species) will be undertaken in the 
summer preceding construction of the Gas Connection. Should any 
food-plants be found the survey will be extended to include a 
search for larval webs in late summer; 
• 
In the unlikely event marsh fritillary are detected then a specific 
method statement will be developed to ensure construction-related 
impacts on individual butterflies/larvae are avoided, for example by 
translocation of larval food webs to outside the construction 
footprint. Any such Method Statement, if required would be 
developed in consultation with NRW and the RCTCBC Ecologist; 
• 
Any broad-leaved semi-natural woodland habitat lost from outside 
the permanent easement of the Gas Connection will be reinstated 
following construction using native species.  Native species only 
will be used, sourced from stock of local provenance if possible;

• 
During construction, the working width will also be minimised as far 
as possible; 
• 
Demolition of buildings known to be used by breeding birds will 
either take place outside the breeding bird season, or will be 
preceded by blocking potential nesting locations in the winter prior 
to demolition;   
• 
Additional tree planting will also be provided immediately west of 
the A4061 at the southern end of the Gas Connection;   
• 
The Landscape Strategy will also include reinstating any species-
poor hedgerows removed with species-rich hedgerow planting, and 
providing an increased diversity of tree/scrub species in 
replacement woodland/scrub planting mixes.  All re-instatement 
planting will be native species;  
• 
In addition bird boxes will be erected on retained vegetation within 
HPL’s ownership; 
• 
Monitoring of breeding bird populations will take place 1 and 3 
years post-construction;  
• 
Reptiles and amphibians In order to ensure the incidental mortality 
of reptiles/amphibians is avoided, suitable terrestrial habitat for 
these species will be cut carefully to a height of under 15 cm prior 
to construction and site clearance commencing.  This will 
encourage those species to leave the Project Site; 
• 
Otters The works programme will be staged so as to minimise the 
length of time works are carried out along any watercourse affected 
by construction of the Gas Connection; 
• 
Watercourse crossings would be worked on for the minimum 
duration necessary (with the intent being for the duration of in-
channel works to last no more than one day per watercourse); 
• 
Trenches and holes shouldshall be covered when not being worked 
on to prevent entry by mammals and where this is not possible 
exist and escape routes such as ramps or mammal ladders will be 
provided; and 
• 
Open entrances to pipes and pipelines shouldshall be covered 
when not being worked on to prevent access by mammals.  
3.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
3.7.1 
The following mitigation measures, as outlined in the ES will be

• 
The retention and management of existing vegetation wherever 
possible; 
• 
Planting, hard landscaping and other mitigation substantially in 
accordance with ES Figure 11.5; 
• 
Implementation of the Lighting Strategy; 
• 
Temporary storage of topsoil and any other material considered of 
value for retention. Where practical stores would be sited to screen 
the construction works; 
• 
Agreed site access points; 
• 
Maintenance of tidy and contained site compound; 
• 
Where feasible, perimeter screen planting will be undertaken in 
advance of the works to be effective on completion of the 
construction works;  
• 
Where practicable storage of topsoil will take place, with siting, to 
screen and/or provide a physical buffer between the construction 
works and more sensitive receptors;  
• 
Temporary protection (in accordance with Best Practice) of any 
boundary vegetation to be retained;  
• 
The design and layout of site construction areas will reduce 
adverse impacts arising from temporary security fencing and 
lighting;  
• 
The removal of all temporary structures and stockpiles when no 
longer required;  
• 
Spreading of topsoil, reseeding and planting within the Project Site 
and adjoining areas that are to be reinstated as soon as possible 
after sections of work are complete;  
• 
Management of all reinstates area in accordance with a 5 year 
aftercare plan to help ensure full and successful establishment of 
the planting to the approval of the planning authority; and 
• 
The prompt reinstatement of temporary construction areas when no 
longer required.  
3.8 
Archaeology / Cultural Heritage 
3.8.1 
An assessment of the potential archaeological and cultural heritage 
resource at the site has been undertaken as part of the ES.  Although 
the potential impacts on archaeology are low, they cannot be ruled out 
completely.

3.8.2 
A Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) will be prepared in advance of 
demolition / construction commencing.  This will set out investigative 
measures such as evaluation trenching prior to construction, and 
monitoring of ground disturbance during construction and topsoil 
stripping activities.   
3.9 
Artificial Lighting 
3.9.1 
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to 
provide a safe working site during hours of darkness.  An outline 
lighting strategy has been prepared to support the DCO Application 
(document reference [6.2.0] Appendix 11.2) and compliance with this is 
secured by Requirement 16 of Schedule 2 of the DCO.  The It 
shouldshall also inform the CEMP in terms of general design objectives 
that will be used to ensure that adverse effects of lighting associated 
with demolition and construction of the Project are minimised are listed 
below: 
• 
Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand;  
• 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
• 
Demolition and construction lighting shouldshall be directed away 
from all sensitive receptors;  
• 
Preference shouldshall be given to several, lower lighting units 
rather than tall, wide beam lighting units to illuminate large areas as 
it will limit light trespass, glare and sky glow from the plant; 
• 
Vehicle lights shouldshall be properly directed (conforming to MOT 
requirements) and lenses must be intact to prevent un-necessary 
glare and light intrusion;  
• 
Lighting shouldshall be reduced or switched off when not required 
for safety purposes. Security lighting shouldshall be kept at the 
minimum level needed for visual and security protection; and   
• 
If appropriate, the use of infra-red floodlighting and CCTV systems 
shouldshall be considered for security to reduce the need for visible 
lighting outside working hours.  
3.9.2 
Specific ecological design objectives that will be implemented to ensure 
that adverse effects of lighting associated with demolition and 
construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
• 
There shouldshall be no light intrusion beyond the boundary of the 
proposed Project Site and particularly within the SINC to the north 
of the Project Site which is a habitat that supports breeding birds 
and bats;

Hirwaun Power Project Outline CEMP 
 
• 
There shouldshall be no night-time working within the SINC while 
construction of the Gas Connection and above ground facility takes 
place; 
• 
No task lighting shouldshall be used between the Power 
Generation Plant to the north and the proposed laydown area (in 
the existing car park) to the south to avoid fragmentation of habitats 
at night-time; 
• 
No temporary lighting shouldshall be installed along the Gas 
Connection corridor between the main site and the working area of 
the pipeline to avoid fragmentation of habitats used by bats at 
night-time; and 
• 
Dark corridors shouldshall be maintained on hedgerows and 
watercourses and any other linear features by avoiding light 
trespass on these areas. This will avoid the fragmentation of habitat 
used by species such as bats and also otters that use these 
features to move at night-time.

 CONCLUSIONS 
4.1.1 
This outline CEMP provides a framework on which the construction 
contractor should will be required to base a more detailed CEMP.  
4.1.2 
Although no significant impacts are predicted as a result of the 
construction phase of the Project, the mitigation measures outlined 
herein will ensure that the lowest level of risk possible is placed on the 
environment.  
4.1.3 
Mitigation measures have been outlined to limit impacts of noise levels, 
air quality, contaminated land and groundwater, ecology, archaeology 
and cultural heritage, landscape and visual amenity and artificial 
lighting. These mitigation measures shouldshall be taken forward for 
further consideration when preparing the detailed CEMP.   
4.1.4 
It has also outlined a series of general best practice principles which 
shouldshall be adhered to, including; a register of environmental 
impacts, the production of risk assessments and Method Statements, 
the adherence to Site Environmental Standards, the production of an 
operations Environmental Management System, dealing with Public 
Relations, the monitoring and measurement of construction activities 
and the roles and responsibilities of key site staff.
