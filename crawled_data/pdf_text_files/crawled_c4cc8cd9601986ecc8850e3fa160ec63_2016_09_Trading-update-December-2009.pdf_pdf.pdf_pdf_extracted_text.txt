Trading Update 
Prior to entering its close period on 4 January 2010, Drax announces the following trading 
update. 
 
Trading Performance and Distributions 
Although the UK market has experienced historically low near-term dark green spreads 
during the year, our earnings have been enhanced by both a strong forward contracted 
position and our ability to capture value from Drax Power Station’s strategic position in the 
UK generation fleet.  
 
In particular, we are taking advantage of the plant’s flexibility and reliability to improve 
profitability in such market conditions. These features of the plant enable us to participate 
more actively in the real-time electricity trading market and also buy back power in the 
market to meet forward contracted positions, when prices fall below our marginal cost of 
production.  The real-time market is managed on a daily basis by National Grid through the 
balancing mechanism.  
 
As a result, we now anticipate that full year EBITDA for 2009 will be modestly ahead of 
current market consensus.  
 
After adjusting for movements in working capital, we further anticipate that total distributions 
for 2009 will be in line with current market consensus of £50m. 
 
For 2010, we are very strongly hedged at higher average margins than for 2009, which 
substantially underpins next year’s cash and earnings.  We also have a strong forward 
contracted position for 2011, reducing our exposure to the weaker forward spreads currently 
being seen for that period.

Notes 
1. Fixed price power sales include approximately 5.3TWh supplied to Centrica in the period 1 
January 2009 to 11 December 2009 under the ﬁve-and-a-quarter year baseload contract with 
Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2007. 
 
2. Fixed margin power sales consist of 5.8TWh in 2010 and 7.9TWh in 2011 in connection with the 
above contract and the five year 300MW baseload contract commencing 1 October 2010 with 
Centrica, announced on 5 November 2009. Under these contracts the Group will supply power on 
terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices, and delivering 
matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting in aggregate to approximately 5.4 million tonnes 
in 2010 and approximately 7.2 million tonnes in 2011. The contracts provide the Group with a 
series of ﬁxed dark green spreads, with the spreads in the first contract having been agreed in the 
ﬁrst quarter of 2006 and with those in the second contract having been agreed in October 2009. 
 
We will next update the market on the Group’s positions under contract on 23 February 2010 
when we announce our Preliminary Results for the year ending 31 December 2009.   
 
Co-Firing Update 
We have commenced commissioning for the £80m 400MW co-firing facility at Drax in line 
with the proposed construction schedule. The facility is due to be fully operational by end-
June 2010 and will increase Drax’s total co-firing capacity to 500MW. 
 
Haven Power and Dedicated Biomass 
We are pleased to announce that, following an encouraging feasibility study, we have started 
to sell power to large industrial and commercial customers, through our retail supply 
business, Haven Power. We believe that this can provide a substantial route to market for 
our generation capacity over time.  
 
With respect to our dedicated biomass business, we have submitted a section 36 application 
for the Immingham site and have received consent from both the district and county councils 
for our section 36 application at the Drax site. We have also commenced the pre-qualification 
process for selection of the engineering, procurement and construction contractors for the 
first plant. 
 
 
Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive of Drax said: 
 
“This is a good performance in what remains a challenging market environment. I am also 
particularly pleased with our contracted position for 2010 which underpins strong earnings 
and cash generation for next year.  
 
Beyond 2010, forward markets are currently weak, although our contracted position for 2011 
provides us with a reasonable foundation for that year.  Nevertheless, we will retain a strong 
focus on cost, cash and risk management to ensure we navigate successfully these 
potentially difficult conditions, whilst at the same time being in a position to maximise 
opportunities when markets recover”.
