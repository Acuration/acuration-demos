This privacy notice is intended to provide information

you or from third parties about you before during and after 
your working relationship with us will be processed within 
the Drax group of companies. It relates to personal data/ 
information (defined under data protection laws) about 
you that we refer to as personal information in this notice.
WHO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION?
Drax Group plc will be collecting and processing your

that will be supplemented by this notice. 
This notice applies to current and former shareholders. 
This notice does not form part of any contract of 
employment or other contract to provide services. We may 
update this notice at any time, so you are advised to review

Shareholder Privacy Notice

Shareholder Privacy Notice     
• 
Consent: in certain circumstances, we may need your 
consent unless authorised by law, to use personal 
information about you 
• 
Necessity to establish, exercise or defend legal claim: if 
you, or we, bring a legal claim against the other, we may 
use your information in either establishing our position, or 
defending ourselves in relation to that legal claim.   
• 
Compliance with a legal obligation: where laws or 
regulations may require us to use your personal information 
in certain ways.  For example.
◦ 
Managing your shareholder rights and our 
obligations to you as a shareholder pursuant to our 
Articles of Association and all relevant laws; and
◦ 
Meeting our obligations to our regulators.
• 
Legitimate Interests: we will also process your personal 
information where this processing is in our “legitimate 
interests”. When relying on this condition, we are required 
to carry out a balancing test of our interests in using your 
personal information, against the interests you have as a 
citizen and the rights you have under data protection laws.  
The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether 
we can use your personal information in the ways described 
in this privacy notice.  We will always act reasonably and 
give full and proper consideration to your interests in 
carrying out this balancing test.
For marketing, you will always be given a choice over the use of 
your data.  
WILL WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
WITH ANYONE ELSE?
We do not disclose your information outside of Drax except to:
• 
Equiniti or any other organisation appointed as our share 
registrar.
• 
Any organisation appointed by us or Equiniti to trace 
shareholders.
• 
Payment providers assisting in the administration of 
dividend payments or other relevant payments to and from 
shareholders.
• 
Other members of the Drax group of companies as 
necessary to administer our business, regulators, which 
include the Financial Conduct Authority, the London Stock 
Exchange, HM Revenue and Customs, and the Information 
Commissioner’s Office.
• 
Where we are required or permitted to do so by law 
or relevant regulatory authority (e.g., financial crime 
screening, fraud detection/prevention).
TRANSFERRING INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE 
UNITED KINGDOM (UK), 
Most of the personal information we collect about you will 
remain in the UK. Where a service provider is based outside 
the UK, they are required to comply with data protection law. 
If that is the case, we ensure a similar degree of protection is 
afforded by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards 
is implemented: 
• 
we will only transfer your personal information to 
countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate 
level of protection for personal information by the 
relevant regulator; or 
• 
where we use certain service providers who are not in 
a ‘adequate’ country, we may use specific contracts 
approved by the regulator which give personal 
information the same protection it has in the UK. If you 
would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of the 
UK, please contact us using the details in the “Contacting 
Us” section at the end of this notice.
FOR HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR 
INFORMATION?
We store your personal as determined by our data retention 
policy, as well as is required to satisfy any legal, accounting or 
reporting obligations, or as necessary to resolve disputes. 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal 
data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the 
personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised 
use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes we 
process your personal data for and whether we can achieve 
those purposes through other means, and applicable legal 
requirements. 
Your personal information will be retained under one or more 
of the following criteria:
• 
Where the personal information is used to provide you 
with services as a shareholder, which will be kept as 
long as it is required to fulfil our obligations to you as a 
shareholder. 
• 
Where you have sold your shareholding, we may retain 
your personal information for as long as required 
by statutory authorities to meet our obligations for 
accounting, legal, tax, and regulatory purposes.
• 
For as long as your information is required to allow us to 
conduct fraud and/or criminal checks and investigations.
• 
For as long as is required in the event that we have a 
reasonable expectation of litigation.
 
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE,

Shareholder Privacy Notice     
Your rights in connection with personal information 
Data protection laws provide you with rights when your data is 
processed in the UK:
• 
Request information about how and with who your 
personal information is being used or shared.
• 
Request access to your personal information. This enables 
you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold 
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. 
• 
Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. 
• 
Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good reason 
for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to 
ask us to delete or remove your personal information where 
you have exercised your right to object to processing (see 
below). However, this is not an absolute right and there 
will be circumstances where we are required to retain 
your personal information even if you are no-longer a 
shareholder of ours. 
• 
Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to 
ask us to suspend the processing of personal information 
about you, for example if you want us to establish its 
accuracy or the reason for processing. 
• 
Request the transfer of your personal information to 
yourself or another party. 
You also have a right to object to the processing of your 
personal information. 
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this notice. 
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any time 
to the regulator for data protection issues as follows: 
UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your 
concerns before you approach the regulator, so please contact 
us in the first instance using the contact details set out at the 
end of this document. 
You will not usually have to pay a fee to exercise any of your 
rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request 
for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we 
may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. 
What we may need from you 
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure you are entitled to exercise 
a right. This is another appropriate security measure to ensure 
that personal information is not disclosed to any person who 
has no right to receive it. 
Timing of our response 
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within 
30 days. Occasionally, it may take us longer if your request is 
particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In 
this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT 
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided 
your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of 
your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the 
right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing 
at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end 
of this notice. Once we have received notification that you 
have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your 
information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed 
to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. 
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE 
We reserve the right to update this notice at any time, and 
we will provide you with a new notice when we make any 
material updates. We may also notify you in other ways 
from time to time about the processing of your personal 
information.
