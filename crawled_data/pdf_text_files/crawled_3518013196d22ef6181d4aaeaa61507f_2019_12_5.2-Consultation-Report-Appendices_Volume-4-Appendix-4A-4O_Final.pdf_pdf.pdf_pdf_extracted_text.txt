Millbrook Power: gas fired power station proposal (Rookery South Pit) 
From: Paul Taylor  
Sent: 18 May 2017 17:06 
Subject: Millbrook Power: gas fired power station proposal (Rookery South Pit)  
 
 
 
May 18th 2017: I am writing to inform you that Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL) has re-started its work to secure 
planning consent to build a gas-fired electricity generation plant on land located in Rookery South Pit, near 
the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston Moretaine. 
  
If you recall, in March 2015 it was decided to put MPL’s work “on hold”; the decision was not taken lightly, 
given the extensive work that the MPL project team had carried out over the previous 12 months and more. 
  
There however remains a need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in this country, and 
acknowledging this national need, the MPL project was recently acquired by the UK energy company, Drax 
Group plc.  Under Drax’s stewardship, it is MPL’s intention to submit a Development Consent Order (DCO) 
to the Planning Inspectorate before the end of this year; noting the DCO and financing processes, and a 2-3 
year construction period, Drax does not expect the Millbrook project to enter operation until 2022. 
  
Whilst a great amount of work was carried out by the MPL team in 2014/15 (assessing the project’s various 
impacts and to gather feedback from the relevant local councils, various statutory organisations, local 
landowners and the local community), the project team is  revisiting and refreshing its environmental and 
technical assessments as two years has passed since the decision to put the project “on hold”.    
  
Furthermore, the MPL team (the same people are very much involved in the project as before) will again 
work closely with local councils in the area and consult the local community before it makes a submission 
to the Planning Inspectorate.  
 
MPL will be hosting a series of public exhibitions between June 9th and 13th (as part of a period of statutory 
consultation that will run from May 29th to July 2nd). The exhibitions are taking place: 
•          Friday, 9th June 1500-1930hrs - Marston Moretaine Village Hall, Bedford Road, Marston Moretaine, 
MK43 0LD 
•          Saturday, 10th June 0900-1300hrs - Stewartby Club, Stewartby Way, Stewartby, MK43 9NB 
•          Monday, 12th June 1600-2000hrs - Wingfield Club, 37 Church Street, Ampthill, MK45 2PL 
•          Tuesday, 13th June 1230-1530hrs - Lidlington Village Hall, High Street, Lidlington, MK43 0RT 
  
Please note that MPL’s decision, made in February 2015, to underground the Project’s electrical connection 
to the National Grid will not be changed.  It has also been decided that the proposed generation plant will 
have just one gas turbine, thereby necessitating a single 35m stack (in 2014/15, MPL had been considering 
up to five stacks) which will further reduce the project’s visual impact. 
2
  
MPL will use its website www.millbrookpower.co.uk, the public exhibitions and other channels to share its 
plans with people (including its Preliminary Environmental Information Report) as well as flag any significant 
milestones between now and the submission of the application to the Planning Inspectorate.  However, 
please let me know (via the contact details below) if you have any immediate questions.

Dear Sir/Madam  
 
 
Re: Millbrook Power Station, Rookery South Pit, Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Regulation 11 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations) (as amended) 
 
Peter Brett Associates act for Millbrook Power limited. 
 
Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") intends to apply to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate 
Change for a Development Consent Order ("DCO") under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 
2008 Act”) to authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of a gas fired power station 
project together with its integral gas and electrical connections (the "Project"). MPL is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Watt Power Limited, a company that develops gas fired power station projects 
in the United Kingdom. 
 
The EIA Regulations require the carrying out of an Environmental Impact Assessment in relation to 
certain applications for DCOs. All development in Schedule 1 (“Schedule 1 development”) requires 
an EIA. The definition of Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating stations with a heat 
output of 300 MW or more. MPL therefore proposes to provide an Environmental Statement as part 
of its application for a DCO for the Project.  
 
Under section 48 of the 2008 Act and Regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009, MPL is publishing a notice of the proposed 
application for a DCO for the Project in the London Gazette, the Independent, Bedfordshire on 
Sunday and the Bedfordshire Citizen. Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations requires that MPL 
sends a copy of its section 48 notice to the consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA Regulations) 
and to any person notified to the applicant in accordance with regulation 9(1)(c) of the EIA 
Regulations, at the same time as publishing its section 48 notice.

Section 48, Planning Act 2008 
Regulation 4 Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 
 
Notice of proposed application for a Development Consent Order to construct and operate the 
Millbrook Power Project, Rookery South Pit, Bedfordshire 
 
1. Notice is hereby given that Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") of 33 Cavendish Square, London 
W1G 0PW, intends to apply to the Secretary of State for a Development Consent Order ("DCO") 
pursuant to section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”) to authorise the construction, 
operation and maintenance of an up to 299 megawatts ("MW") gas-fired electricity generation 
project at the former clay extraction site in Bedfordshire. This project comprises a power 
generation plant and integral gas and electrical connections to connect the power generation 
plant to the national transmission system and existing overhead transmission line respectively 
(together, the "Project"). MPL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015. 
2. MPL has been established by Watt Power Limited to develop the Project. Watt Power Limited is 
seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook and elsewhere in the UK to support the 
UK Government's drive to a low carbon economy. 
3. The site for the generating equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha and is located within 
Rookery South Pit (approximate grid reference 501373, 240734), which itself covers 
approximately 90 ha. 
4. The proposed DCO would, among other things, license and authorise:  
i. 
The construction, operation and maintenance of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power 
generation plant consisting of up to five gas turbine generators ("GTG") fuelled by natural gas 
with a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299MW.   
ii. 
Provision of: 
a. Up to 5 GTGs;   
b. Up to 5 exhaust gas emission flue stacks, each up to 40m in height; 
c. An administration building and office, workshop, store, control building, telemetry 
apparatus and blackstart generator; 
d. A fire water tank and demineralised water storage tank;  
e. Security infrastructure, including cameras, perimeter fencing and a gatehouse; 
f. 
Site lighting infrastructure, including perimeter lighting columns; 
g. Internal roadways, car parking, pedestrian network, cycle parking and potentially 
hardstanding for planned maintenance car parking; 
h. Site vehicular access(es), including a proposed access road from Green Lane to the site;  
i. 
A 400 kV electrical connection to export electricity produced by the power generation 
plant to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System. This may take the form of up 
to two overhead lines [of 400kV] including up to seven transmission towers (one of which 
will be replacing an existing tower and is likely to be located in close proximity to the 
location of that existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net additional towers) to connect to 
the existing 400 kV overhead line; 
j. 
A switchyard / banking compound located within the generating equipment site containing 
up to six transformers and other plant required to manage the transmission of electricity; 
k. A substation which is likely to be located adjacent to the generating equipment within 
Rookery South Pit;  
l. 
A new underground gas pipeline connection of up to 1.7km in length to import natural gas 
from the National Gas Transmission System (NTS) to the power generation plant; 
m. An above ground compound at the NTS connection point containing: 
 
 
i.  a minimum offtake connection comprising a remotely operable valve, control and 
instrumentation kiosk and electrical supply kiosk; 
ii. a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) facility, comprising a PIG launching facility, 
emergency control valve, isolation valve and control and instrumentation kiosk, 
and electricity supply kiosk; and 
iii. 
access to the compound. 
n. A natural gas receiving station and compound  at the generating equipment site 
containing: 
i. a PIG receiving facility; 
ii. isolation valve; 
iii. control and instrumentation kiosk; 
iv. gas filters, metering, heating boiler and (if required) compressors  
o. Temporary construction compound(s) for the power generation plant, gas connection and 
electrical connection together with access(es); and 
p. Site drainage and waste management infrastructure and other services. 
iii. 
If required, tree and hedge removal along the gas and electricity connection routes. 
iv. 
Planting, landscaping and, if required, ecological mitigation. 
v. 
If required, the temporary stopping up of public footpath(s) during the construction works 
described above. 
vi. 
If required, permanent and temporary changes to the highway network for the Project. 
vii. 
If required, the permanent and/or temporary compulsory acquisition of land and/or rights in 
land for the Project. 
viii. 
If required, overriding of easements and other rights over or affecting land for the Project. 
ix. 
If required, the application and/or disapplication of legislation relevant to the Project. 
x. 
Construction, operation and maintenance of associated development, including, but not 
limited to, those items listed in paragraph 4 above. 
xi. 
Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works, provisions, permits, consents, waivers or 
releases as are necessary and/or convenient for the successful construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project. 
5. Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). The Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. The proposed application for a DCO will 
therefore be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES). The ES will provide a detailed 
description of the Project and its likely significant environmental effects.  
6. Information (including plans and maps) about the nature and location of the Project, as well as the 
information so far compiled about the Project's likely significant environmental effects is all 
contained in a Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) and summarised in a non-
technical summary of the PEIR (the "Documents"). The Documents will be available to view or

<ADDRESS> 
Dear Sir/Madam 
Re:  Proposed application for a Development Consent Order to construct and operate the 
Millbrook Power Project, Rookery South Pit, Bedfordshire 
Further to our recent communications with you as a statutory consultee to our project, and 
following your receipt in October 2014 of our information pack about the project, I enclose a copy of 
a Planning Act Section 48 notice. This notice should have been sent to you at the same time as the 
pack.  It detailed the main elements of the Project and its period of statutory consultation. 
I also enclose an Information Update about the Project that Millbrook Power issued in early February 
with regard to changes to the Project:  this was issued to statutory consultees as well as other 
interested parties.  I would like to draw your attention, in particular, to our decision to underground 
the electrical connection, which negates the need for us to construct additional transmission towers. 
This has been welcomed by the local councils, namely Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough 
Council. 
We are likely to submit our application for a Development Consent Order to the Planning 
Inspectorate within the next 2-4 weeks.  If you would like any further information about our Project, 
please let me know. 
 Yours sincerely

Section 48, Planning Act 2008 
Regulation 4 Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 
Notice of proposed application for a Development Consent Order to construct and operate the 
Millbrook Power Project, Rookery South Pit, Bedfordshire 
1.
Notice is hereby given that Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") of 33 Cavendish Square, London
W1G 0PW, intends to apply to the Secretary of State for a Development Consent Order ("DCO")
pursuant to section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”) to authorise the construction,
operation and maintenance of an up to 299 megawatts ("MW") gas-fired electricity generation
project at the former clay extraction site in Bedfordshire. This project comprises a power
generation plant and integral gas and electrical connections to connect the power generation
plant to the national transmission system and existing overhead transmission line respectively
(together, the "Project"). MPL's application is likely to be submitted in Q1 of 2015.

limited to, those items listed in paragraph 4 above.
xi.
Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works, provisions, permits, consents, waivers or
releases as are necessary and/or convenient for the successful construction, operation and
maintenance of the Project.
5.
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). The Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure Planning
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. The proposed application for a DCO will
therefore be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES). The ES will provide a detailed
description of the Project and its likely significant environmental effects.

Dear Sir/Madam 
Re: Millbrook Power Limited:  Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr. 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire – INFORMATION UPDATE 
Peter Brett Associates act for Millbrook Power Limited (MPL). 
I write to update you on MPL's proposal to construct and operate a gas-fired power station on a site 
at Rookery South Pit together with an integral gas connection and electrical connection (together 
"the Project"). 
MPL undertook statutory consultation regarding the Project, pursuant to sections 42, 47 and 48 of 
the Planning Act 2008 (“the Planning Act”), between 13 October and 16 November 2014 and would 
like to thank all those who provided comments. MPL is having regard to the responses received as 
it refines its proposals in anticipation of the submission of the application for a Development 
Consent Order for the Project in the first quarter of 2015. 
We wanted to update you on some of the work that MPL has been doing in order to take on board 
consultation feedback and refine the proposals for the Project. 
One key area of feedback has related to the proposed Electrical Connection. As you may recall, the 
proposed Project includes the construction, operation and maintenance of a new electrical 
connection together with a new substation to connect the power generation plant to the existing 
overhead power line nearby. At consultation, the layout of the Electrical Connection was not 
finalised but an area within which the connection would be sited was identified.  
At that time a realistic worst case scenario of up to two overhead line double circuits [of 400 kV] 
(including up to seven new towers one of which would replace an existing tower leading to six net 
additional towers) had been assumed (and was environmentally assessed). However MPL has 
continued to work with National Grid on the indicative design of the connection and it has become 
apparent through the responses to the statutory consultation that one of the major concerns has 
been the impact on the landscape and on views of overhead power lines and towers.

Following due consideration of a number of factors (including perceived impact, engineering issues 
and cost), MPL is pleased to have been able to take on board community and consultee feedback 
and has taken the decision to underground as much of the connection as possible.  
This underground connection would take the form of: 
1) One underground double circuit. This would require one replacement tower (which will
replace an existing tower and will be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission 
route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). The replacement tower will be 
up to 48 m tall rather than up to 45 m tall as previously indicated in the statutory 
consultation – a change of less than 10%; 
2) Either one or two Sealing End Compounds (SECs) located adjacent to the existing
transmission line. The SEC(s) are required to ‘seal off’ the area within which the cables are 
taken underground. Each SEC will cover an area of approximately 0.25 of a Hectare. 
3) Both circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres in
length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’) - which will remain located in the Rookery South Pit. 
Other amendments to the Project that MPL has made in order to take on board the feedback that 
has been received during consultation include:  
•
Consultation zones modified
•
Choice of corridor
•
Location of AGI
•
Revised red line boundary
•
Undergrounding of the Electrical Connection cable.
The submission under the Planning Act 2008 for the application for a Development Consent Order 
for the Project will be made by MPL before the end of Q1 2015. 
Should the application be accepted by the Planning Inspectorate (a decision would be made within 
28 days of the application being received by the Planning Inspectorate), then MPL would notify the 
local community, statutory consultees and relevant landowners of the acceptance of the application 
and invite those who are interested to register with the Planning Inspectorate in order to remain 
involved in the process of considering and examining the accepted application. Details of the 
application would also be published in hard copy in local authority’s office and in various libraries in 
the area. The information would also be made available on the planning inspectorate’s website 
(http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/). The Planning Inspectorate would then take up to six 
months to examine the accepted application for the Project (this process would include receiving 
representations from those who have registered an interest in the Project). Following completion of 
its examination, the Planning Inspectorate would then have three months to report to the Secretary 
of State, who would themselves have three months in which to make a decision on whether or not 
to grant consent for the Project.

information, or if you would like to meet with a relevant member or members of the team to discuss 
the Project.

Dear Sir / Madam  
 
RE: Millbrook Power Station, Rookery South Pit, Millbrook, Bedfordshire  
 
Regulation 11 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (the "EIA Regulations 2009")  
 
Peter Brett Associates (“PBA”) acts for Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”).  
 
MPL intends to apply to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for a 
Development Consent Order ("DCO") under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”) to 
authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299MW gas fired power station 
together with its associated gas and electrical connections to the existing electricity and gas 
networks (the "Project").  
 
MPL was recently acquired by the UK energy company Drax Group PLC (“Drax”). Drax is seeking 
to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook and elsewhere in the UK to support the 
Government's drive to a low carbon economy by providing back up to the National Grid and 
plugging the gaps created by intermittent renewables.  
 
The Project was taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application process in 2014 and 
MPL undertook the first phase of statutory consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 
and 16th November 2014 ("Phase 1 consultation"). However, due to market and political 
uncertainty, in March 2015 MPL put on hold its plans for the Project and notified the public that it 
was doing so. Under the new ownership of Drax, the Project is now once again being taken forward 
in acknowledgement of the fact that there remains a national need for new gas-fired power stations 
to be built in the UK. 
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the "EIA Regulations 2009") to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA"). All development in Schedule 1 (“Schedule 1 
development”) requires an EIA.  
 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (the "EIA Regulations 2017") regime. This is

because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 
2009 before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with 
the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37(2)(a)(ii) of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA 
Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal power station with a heat output of 
300MW or more (as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a) of the EIA Regulations 2009). The 
proposed application for a DCO will therefore be accompanied by an Environmental Statement 
("ES"). The ES will provide a detailed project description and consider the likely significant 
environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. 
 
Under section 48 of the 2008 Act and Regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009, MPL is publishing a notice of the proposed 
application for a DCO for the Project in the London Gazette, the Times, the Bedfordshire on Sunday 
and the Bedford Times & Citizen. Under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations 2009, MPL is 
required to send a copy of the section 48 notice to consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA 
Regulations 2009) and to any person notified to the applicant in accordance with regulation 9(1)(c) 
of the EIA Regulations 2009.  
 
Accordingly, MPL hereby provides a copy of the section 48 notice to you. The enclosed notice sets 
out details of the project timescales, revised design parameters and explains where to find further 
details of the Project.   
   
As the project design parameters have changed since 2014, you will be invited, by a separate 
letter, to submit comments on the MPL proposals during the second phase of statutory consultation 
which will run from 29th May 2017 until 2nd July 2017 (inclusive).

Regulation 4 Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 
Notice of proposed application for a Development Consent Order to construct and operate 
the Millbrook Power Project, Rookery South Pit, Bedfordshire  
 
1 
Notice is hereby given that Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") of Drax Power Station, Drax, 
Selby North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH intends to apply to the Secretary of State for a 
Development Consent Order ("DCO") pursuant to section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 
2008 Act”) to authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299 
megawatts ("MW") gas-fired electricity generation project at the former clay extraction site in 
Bedfordshire.    
2 
This project comprises a power generation plant, associated gas connection to the National 
Transmission System (NTS) and electrical connection to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS) (together, the "Project"). MPL intends to submit its DCO 
application for the Project in Q4 2017.  
3 
MPL was recently acquired by the UK energy company Drax Group PLC (Drax). Drax is 
seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook and elsewhere in the UK to support 
the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by providing back up to the National Grid 
and plugging the gaps created by intermittent renewables.  
4 
The Project was taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application process in 
2014. However, due to market and political uncertainty, in March 2015 MPL put on hold its 
plans for the Project and notified the public that it was doing so. Under the new ownership of 
Drax, the Project is now once again being taken forward in acknowledgement of the fact that 
there remains a national need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in the UK.  
5 
The site for the generating equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha and is located 
within Rookery South Pit (approximate grid reference 501373, 240734), which itself covers 
approximately 95 ha.  
6 
The proposed DCO would, among other things, license and authorise:  
i. 
The construction, operation and maintenance of an open cycle gas turbine power 
generation plant consisting of one gas turbine generator fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  
ii. Provision of:  
a. One gas turbine generator;  
b. One exhaust gas emission flue stack;  
c.  Fin fan coolers; 
d. An administration building and office, workshop, store building, control room, 
telemetry apparatus, maintenance compound and emergency generator;   
 
2 
 
e. A fire water tank and demineralised water storage tank; 
f. Security infrastructure, including cameras, perimeter fencing and a gatehouse; 
g. Site lighting infrastructure, including perimeter lighting columns;  
h. Internal roadways, car parking, pedestrian network, cycle parking, hardstanding and 
water trailers; 
i. 
Site vehicular access(es), including a proposed access road from Green Lane to the 
site; 
j. 
A 400 kV electrical connection to export electricity produced by the power 
generation plant to the NETS. This will comprise a new substation connected to the 
existing 400 kV overhead lines via underground cables. This part of the project may 
be delivered in one of two ways:   
i. Option 1 – this would require replacing one existing tower with a new tower 
and two Sealing End Compounds (SECs) which would be connected to the 
substation via underground cables. This option would result in no net 
additional towers; or 
ii. Option 2 - this would require replacing one existing tower with a new tower 
and one larger SEC which would be connected to the substation via 
underground cables. This option would result in no net additional towers.  
Site vehicular access is required to the SEC(s) 
k. A transformer compound located within the generating equipment site containing a 
generator step up transformer, unit and other transformers, overhead line gantry 
and associated equipment;  
l. 
A substation located adjacent to the western boundary of the power generation 
plant within Rookery South Pit; 
m. A new underground gas pipeline connection to import natural gas from the NTS to 
the power generation plant;  
n. An above ground installation at the NTS connection point containing:  
i. a minimum offtake connection (MOC) facility comprising a remotely operable 
valve, control and instrumentation kiosk and electrical supply kiosk; 
ii. a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) facility, comprising a PIG launching facility, 
emergency control valve, isolation valve and control and instrumentation and 
electricity supply kiosks; and 
iii. access to the compound.

Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). The Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (EIA Regulations 2009). The 
proposed application for a DCO will therefore be accompanied by an Environmental 
Statement (ES). The ES will provide a detailed Project description and consider the likely 
significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. 
8 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This 
is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA 
Regulations 2009 before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, 
in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 
2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project.

Dear Sir/Madam 
 
RE: Millbrook Power Station, Rookery South Pit, Millbrook, Bedfordshire  
 
Regulation 11 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (the "EIA Regulations 2009")  
 
Peter Brett Associates (“PBA”) acts for Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”).  
 
MPL intends to apply to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for a 
Development Consent Order ("DCO") under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”) to 
authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299MW gas fired power station 
together with its associated gas and electrical connections to the existing electricity and gas 
networks (the "Project").  
 
MPL was recently acquired by the UK energy company Drax Group PLC (“Drax”). Drax is seeking 
to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook and elsewhere in the UK to support the 
Government's drive to a low carbon economy by providing back up to the National Grid and 
plugging the gaps created by intermittent renewables.  
 
The Project was taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application process in 2014 and 
MPL undertook the first phase of statutory consultation on the Project between 13th October 2014 
and 16th November 2014 ("Phase 1 consultation"). However, due to market and political 
uncertainty, in March 2015 MPL put on hold its plans for the Project and notified the public that it 
was doing so. Under the new ownership of Drax, the Project is now once again being taken forward 
in acknowledgement of the fact that there remains a national need for new gas-fired power stations 
to be built in the UK. 
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is required under the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the "EIA Regulations 2009") to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA"). All development in Schedule 1 (“Schedule 1 
development”) requires an EIA.  
 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (the "EIA Regulations 2017") regime. This is

because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 
2009 before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with 
the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37(2)(a)(ii) of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA 
Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal power station with a heat output of 
300MW or more (as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a) of the EIA Regulations 2009). The 
proposed application for a DCO will therefore be accompanied by an Environmental Statement 
("ES"). The ES will provide a detailed project description and consider the likely significant 
environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. 
 
Under section 48 of the 2008 Act and Regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009, MPL published a notice of the proposed 
application for a DCO for the Project in the London Gazette, the Times, the Bedfordshire on Sunday 
and the Bedford Times & Citizen. Under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations 2009, MPL is 
required to send a copy of the section 48 notice to consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA 
Regulations 2009) and to any person notified to the applicant in accordance with regulation 9(1)(c) 
of the EIA Regulations 2009.  
 
Accordingly, MPL hereby provides a copy of the section 48 notice to you. The enclosed notice sets 
out details of the project timescales and revised design parameters. Please note that it is no longer 
possible to view hard copies of documents at the public venues listed in the Section 48 Notice, 
however all information relevant to the consultation has been issued separately today (in electronic 
form as well as hard copies of key documents) as part of our consultation under Section 42 of the 
Planning Act 2008. Should you have any questions regarding this matter or wish to view hard 
copies of specific documents, please contact us using the details provided below. 
  
As the project design parameters have changed since 2014, you are also invited to submit 
comments on the MPL proposals as part of the second phase of statutory consultation. We would 
therefore welcome any comments by 17:00 on 15th September 2017.

Section 48, Planning Act 2008 
Regulation 4 Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 
Notice of proposed application for a Development Consent Order to construct and operate 
the Millbrook Power Project, Rookery South Pit, Bedfordshire  
 
1 
Notice is hereby given that Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") of Drax Power Station, Drax, 
Selby North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH intends to apply to the Secretary of State for a 
Development Consent Order ("DCO") pursuant to section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 
2008 Act”) to authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299 
megawatts ("MW") gas-fired electricity generation project at the former clay extraction site in 
Bedfordshire.    
2 
This project comprises a power generation plant, associated gas connection to the National 
Transmission System (NTS) and electrical connection to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS) (together, the "Project"). MPL intends to submit its DCO 
application for the Project in Q4 2017.  
3 
MPL was recently acquired by the UK energy company Drax Group PLC (Drax). Drax is 
seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook and elsewhere in the UK to support 
the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by providing back up to the National Grid 
and plugging the gaps created by intermittent renewables.  
4 
The Project was taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application process in 
2014. However, due to market and political uncertainty, in March 2015 MPL put on hold its 
plans for the Project and notified the public that it was doing so. Under the new ownership of 
Drax, the Project is now once again being taken forward in acknowledgement of the fact that 
there remains a national need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in the UK.  
5 
The site for the generating equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha and is located 
within Rookery South Pit (approximate grid reference 501373, 240734), which itself covers 
approximately 95 ha.  
6 
The proposed DCO would, among other things, license and authorise:  
i. 
The construction, operation and maintenance of an open cycle gas turbine power 
generation plant consisting of one gas turbine generator fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  
ii. Provision of:  
a. One gas turbine generator;  
b. One exhaust gas emission flue stack;  
c.  Fin fan coolers; 
d. An administration building and office, workshop, store building, control room, 
telemetry apparatus, maintenance compound and emergency generator;   
 
2 
 
e. A fire water tank and demineralised water storage tank; 
f. Security infrastructure, including cameras, perimeter fencing and a gatehouse; 
g. Site lighting infrastructure, including perimeter lighting columns;  
h. Internal roadways, car parking, pedestrian network, cycle parking, hardstanding and 
water trailers; 
i. 
Site vehicular access(es), including a proposed access road from Green Lane to the 
site; 
j. 
A 400 kV electrical connection to export electricity produced by the power 
generation plant to the NETS. This will comprise a new substation connected to the 
existing 400 kV overhead lines via underground cables. This part of the project may 
be delivered in one of two ways:   
i. Option 1 – this would require replacing one existing tower with a new tower 
and two Sealing End Compounds (SECs) which would be connected to the 
substation via underground cables. This option would result in no net 
additional towers; or 
ii. Option 2 - this would require replacing one existing tower with a new tower 
and one larger SEC which would be connected to the substation via 
underground cables. This option would result in no net additional towers.  
Site vehicular access is required to the SEC(s) 
k. A transformer compound located within the generating equipment site containing a 
generator step up transformer, unit and other transformers, overhead line gantry 
and associated equipment;  
l. 
A substation located adjacent to the western boundary of the power generation 
plant within Rookery South Pit; 
m. A new underground gas pipeline connection to import natural gas from the NTS to 
the power generation plant;  
n. An above ground installation at the NTS connection point containing:

p. Temporary construction compound(s) for the power generation plant, gas 
connection and electrical connection together with access(es);  
q. Site drainage and waste management infrastructure;  
r.  Electricity, water, wastewater and telecommunications and other services; and 
s. The following additional measures may also be taken by the applicant if required:  
i. Tree and hedge removal along the gas and electricity connection routes; 
ii. Planting, landscaping and ecological mitigation, permanent and temporary 
fencing;  
iii. The temporary stopping up of public footpath(s) during the construction 
works described above;  
iv. Permanent and temporary changes to the highway network for the Project;  
v. The permanent and / or temporary compulsory acquisition of land and / or 
rights in land for the Project;  
vi. The required, overriding of easements and other rights over or affecting land 
for the Project; 
vii. The application and/or disapplication of legislation relevant to the Project;  
viii. Construction, operation and maintenance of associated development, 
including, but not limited to, those items listed in paragraph 6 above;  
ix. High voltage and low voltage cabling, equipment and controls and 
associated telemetry and electrical protection auxiliary cabling;  
x. Underground gas pipeline connection(s), associated telemetry and cathodic 
protection test / transformer rectifier unit; and  
xi. Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works, provisions, permits,

because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 
2009 before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with 
the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37(2)(a)(ii) of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA 
Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal power station with a heat output of 
300MW or more (as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a) of the EIA Regulations 2009). The 
proposed application for a DCO will therefore be accompanied by an Environmental Statement 
("ES"). The ES will provide a detailed project description and consider the likely significant 
environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. 
 
Under section 48 of the 2008 Act and Regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009, MPL published a notice of the proposed 
application for a DCO for the Project in the London Gazette, the Times, the Bedfordshire on Sunday 
and the Bedford Times & Citizen. Under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations 2009, MPL is 
required to send a copy of the section 48 notice to consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA 
Regulations 2009) and to any person notified to the applicant in accordance with regulation 9(1)(c) 
of the EIA Regulations 2009.  
 
Accordingly, MPL hereby provides a copy of the section 48 notice to you. The enclosed notice sets 
out details of the project timescales and revised design parameters. Please note that it is no longer 
possible to view hard copies of documents at the public venues listed in the Section 48 Notice, 
however all information relevant to the consultation has been issued separately today (in electronic 
form) as part of our consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. Should you have any 
questions regarding this matter or wish to view hard copies of specific documents, please contact 
us using the details provided below. 
  
As the project design parameters have changed since 2014, you are also invited to submit 
comments on the MPL proposals as part of the second phase of statutory consultation. We would 
therefore welcome any comments by 17:00 on 15th September 2017.  
 
Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact:

Section 48, Planning Act 2008 
Regulation 4 Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 
Notice of proposed application for a Development Consent Order to construct and operate 
the Millbrook Power Project, Rookery South Pit, Bedfordshire  
 
1 
Notice is hereby given that Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") of Drax Power Station, Drax, 
Selby North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH intends to apply to the Secretary of State for a 
Development Consent Order ("DCO") pursuant to section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 
2008 Act”) to authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299 
megawatts ("MW") gas-fired electricity generation project at the former clay extraction site in 
Bedfordshire.    
2 
This project comprises a power generation plant, associated gas connection to the National 
Transmission System (NTS) and electrical connection to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS) (together, the "Project"). MPL intends to submit its DCO 
application for the Project in Q4 2017.  
3 
MPL was recently acquired by the UK energy company Drax Group PLC (Drax). Drax is 
seeking to develop gas-fired power stations at Millbrook and elsewhere in the UK to support 
the Government's drive to a low carbon economy by providing back up to the National Grid 
and plugging the gaps created by intermittent renewables.  
4 
The Project was taken through the first stages of the DCO planning application process in 
2014. However, due to market and political uncertainty, in March 2015 MPL put on hold its 
plans for the Project and notified the public that it was doing so. Under the new ownership of 
Drax, the Project is now once again being taken forward in acknowledgement of the fact that 
there remains a national need for new gas-fired power stations to be built in the UK.  
5 
The site for the generating equipment covers an area of approximately 4 ha and is located 
within Rookery South Pit (approximate grid reference 501373, 240734), which itself covers 
approximately 95 ha.  
6 
The proposed DCO would, among other things, license and authorise:  
i. 
The construction, operation and maintenance of an open cycle gas turbine power 
generation plant consisting of one gas turbine generator fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  
ii. Provision of:  
a. One gas turbine generator;  
b. One exhaust gas emission flue stack;  
c.  Fin fan coolers; 
d. An administration building and office, workshop, store building, control room, 
telemetry apparatus, maintenance compound and emergency generator;   
 
2 
 
e. A fire water tank and demineralised water storage tank; 
f. Security infrastructure, including cameras, perimeter fencing and a gatehouse; 
g. Site lighting infrastructure, including perimeter lighting columns;  
h. Internal roadways, car parking, pedestrian network, cycle parking, hardstanding and 
water trailers; 
i. 
Site vehicular access(es), including a proposed access road from Green Lane to the 
site; 
j. 
A 400 kV electrical connection to export electricity produced by the power 
generation plant to the NETS. This will comprise a new substation connected to the 
existing 400 kV overhead lines via underground cables. This part of the project may 
be delivered in one of two ways:   
i. Option 1 – this would require replacing one existing tower with a new tower 
and two Sealing End Compounds (SECs) which would be connected to the 
substation via underground cables. This option would result in no net 
additional towers; or 
ii. Option 2 - this would require replacing one existing tower with a new tower 
and one larger SEC which would be connected to the substation via 
underground cables. This option would result in no net additional towers.  
Site vehicular access is required to the SEC(s) 
k. A transformer compound located within the generating equipment site containing a 
generator step up transformer, unit and other transformers, overhead line gantry 
and associated equipment;  
l. 
A substation located adjacent to the western boundary of the power generation 
plant within Rookery South Pit; 
m. A new underground gas pipeline connection to import natural gas from the NTS to 
the power generation plant;  
n. An above ground installation at the NTS connection point containing:  
i. a minimum offtake connection (MOC) facility comprising a remotely operable 
valve, control and instrumentation kiosk and electrical supply kiosk; 
ii. a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) facility, comprising a PIG launching facility, 
emergency control valve, isolation valve and control and instrumentation and 
electricity supply kiosks; and 
iii. access to the compound.  
o. A natural gas receiving station and compound at the generating equipment site 
containing: 
i. a PIG receiving facility; 
ii. isolation valve; 
iii. control and instrumentation kiosks; and  
iv. gas filters, metering, heating boiler and (if required) compressors. 
v. Emergency generator  
 
3 
 
p. Temporary construction compound(s) for the power generation plant, gas 
connection and electrical connection together with access(es);  
q. Site drainage and waste management infrastructure;  
r.  Electricity, water, wastewater and telecommunications and other services; and 
s. The following additional measures may also be taken by the applicant if required:  
i. Tree and hedge removal along the gas and electricity connection routes; 
ii. Planting, landscaping and ecological mitigation, permanent and temporary 
fencing;  
iii. The temporary stopping up of public footpath(s) during the construction 
works described above;  
iv. Permanent and temporary changes to the highway network for the Project;  
v. The permanent and / or temporary compulsory acquisition of land and / or 
rights in land for the Project;  
vi. The required, overriding of easements and other rights over or affecting land 
for the Project; 
vii. The application and/or disapplication of legislation relevant to the Project;  
viii. Construction, operation and maintenance of associated development, 
including, but not limited to, those items listed in paragraph 6 above;  
ix. High voltage and low voltage cabling, equipment and controls and 
associated telemetry and electrical protection auxiliary cabling;  
x. Underground gas pipeline connection(s), associated telemetry and cathodic 
protection test / transformer rectifier unit; and  
xi. Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works, provisions, permits, 
consents, waivers or releases as are necessary and/or convenient for the 
successful construction, operation and maintenance of the Project.  
7 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). The Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (EIA Regulations 2009). The 
proposed application for a DCO will therefore be accompanied by an Environmental 
Statement (ES). The ES will provide a detailed Project description and consider the likely 
significant environmental effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. 
8 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This 
is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA 
Regulations 2009 before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, 
in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 
2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project. 
 
9 
Information (including plans and maps) about the nature and location of the Project, as well 
as the information so far compiled about the Project's likely significant environmental effects

Stewartby gas fired power station plan fuels opposition | Bedfordshire News
Stewartby gas .htm[03/12/2014 15:05:54]
 An artist's impression of what the power station will look like
 Comments (2)
FIVE flue stacks, each 40 metres, high could grace the skies of Mid-Bedfordshire if a new power station is given the go
 ahead by the government.
By spring of next year, MIllbrook Power Limited is expected to submit an application for a 299 megawatt gas-fired
 power station in Stewartby to the secretary of state for energy.
The project, if given permission, would mean a power station at the Rookery South Pit site, next to where US firm
 Covanta has approval to build an energy from waste incinerator.
Before the application is formally submitted to the secretary of state however, Millbrook Power will hold public
 exhibitions of its final plans at village halls in Marston Moretaine, Lidlington, Stewartby and at Ampthill Masonic
 Centre from October 31 to November 4.
Some residents have already spoken of their opposition to the power station however saying that this is just another
 example of a decision being taken by the government which ‘disregards’ local opinion. 
A spokesman for Millbrook Power said: “Everyone living within 5km of the site should receive a copy of our leaflet this
 week which explains what it’s all about.
“We have made some changes since the last exhibitions in the summer such as the height of the stacks which have been
 reduced from 60m to 40m and this will also be the height from the base of the pit not ground level.”

Appendix 4.K: Phase 1 Section 42 – Statutory 
consultation – Minutes of meetings held with key 
stakeholders during statutory consultation phase 
4.K(i) Meeting with Bedford Borough Council (23rd October 2014) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note of meeting between Bedfordshire Borough Council (BBC) and 
Millbrook Power Ltd. (MPL) 
23/10/14 – BBC, Borough Hall, Bedford 
 
Present for BBC – Ian Johnson (IJ) 
Present for MPL – Paul Wormald (PW), Nick Johnson (NJ) 
Summary 
The meeting was offered to give BBC the opportunity to ask any initial questions regarding the PEIR 
or Statutory Consultation and also discuss the drafting of the DCO and requirements within it. Due to 
changes in personnel at BBC, the meeting provided some introductory information – NJ ran through 
a set of up to date slides describing the Project and EIA done to date. IJ had not yet completed a 
review of the PEIR and had no questions regarding the consultation process. The DCO drafting 
process was not discussed.  
NJ and PW explained that the Project is 95% within CBC and the only part within BBC is the 
emergence of the Access onto the public highway. NJ and PW explained that MPL are already 
engaged with BBC highways officer Kim Healy regarding the Traffic and Transport issues. All agreed 
that with respect to BBC’s response to the S42 consultation the Traffic and Transport Chapter should 
be concentrated on.  
NJ explained that an outreach meeting and site visit are being arranged with key stakeholders, PINS 
and MPL and that a representative from BBC would be most welcome. IJ agreed that this would be a 
good idea and all agreed that it may be sensible for Kim Healy to attend as well as or instead of IJ.

Summary 
This group meets on a quarterly basis to provide a line of communication between the local 
communities in the Marston Vale and the ongoing landfill operations. Councillor Sue Clark suggested 
that it would be an excellent forum though which MPL could also keep local communities updated.  
MPL presented a set of slides describing the most up to date plans for the Project, the high level 
findings of the recently published PEIR and the ongoing phase of Statutory Consultation. Specific 
points that were raised during the presentation and following discussion were; 
 
SC noted her concerns that photomontages are often not realistic. MPL explained that the 
photomontages produced for MPL followed best practice methodology as had been agreed 
at scoping stage. SC suggested that a barrage balloon could be raised to the height of the 
chimney at the site to get a better idea – MPL agreed that this was a good idea.  
 
SC suggested that the residents of Stewartby may not be too pleased that no photomontage 
has been produced from their village for exhibitions. MPL explained that this was because 
there is nowhere in Stewartby from which the development will be visible, however they 
would try to put something together for the exhibition. SC also suggested that MPL should 
have a viewpoint from the Millennium Park close to site. NJ and CM explained that this 
would not be possible at this late stage and that photographic viewpoint locations had been 
agreed previously. Furthermore a close-up photo viewpoint has been included from a hill 
very close to site. 
 
DT asked if there would be a community fund. CM explained that on other projects a 
community fund has been pledged. 
 
DT stated that Green Lane is in need of resurfacing. NR stated that work has recently been 
completed on the bridges on Green Lane and there are no longer any weight restrictions on 
that stretch of road.  
 
In relation to Statements of Common Ground (SoCG), CM assured the group that MPL 
would not pressure any council members to sign up to a SoCG and gave example of the 
types of statements that have been included for previous projects. 
 
SC asked if the route of the access through the pit could be changed at a later date. MPL 
explained not because of the way DCO’s are structured. 
 
SC explained if MPL with planning on extracting clay. MPL explained not. 
 
SH stated that what MPL are calling the ‘Old A421’ is actually the C94 
 
SH stated that she understood that some new PRoW were being created into the Pit that 
MPL have not taken into account in PEIR – SH will address this in her response to S42 
consultation

1.
Network Rail (NR) is currently reviewing the current rail provision in the Marston Vale within the
context of the East – West Rail proposals :
i)
East West Rail will increase the existing rail frequency from 1 to 2 trains per hour per direction
as an initial stage;
ii)
it is likely that this could increase to around 6 trains per hour per direction at a later stage;
iii)
this increase in movement will require a risk assessment to confirm that any increased risk at
all level crossings is acceptable with the higher number of rail movements. Should this
assessment identify a greater risk, the Office of Rail Regulation will expect these risks to be
mitigated;
iv)
Parsons Brinckerhoff has been commissioned by NR to undertake risk assessments of all
level crossings affected by the EWR proposals;
v)
concurrently, following a series of pedestrian fatalities associated with level crossings around
the country, NR has a commitment and remit to remove all level crossings nationally;
vi)
Network Rail further wishes to electrify the Bedford – Bletchley section of EWR as part of
delivery of a higher speed service. This electrification also has implications to the level
crossing facilities, as well as the associated risk assessment. It is unlikely that this
electrification would happen until NR’s expenditure programme timescale of Control Period 5
(2019 – 2024).
2.
Whilst the existing Green Lane level crossing apparatus could be enhanced with an “Object
Protection System” to deliver improved pedestrian / cyclist / motorist safety, this would require the
barriers to remain lowered for around 4½ mins per train passing – considerably longer than the
existing situation.
3.
With the proposed 2 trains per hour per direction (i.e., 4 trains per hour in total), this would result in
barriers being lowered for around 18 minutes per hour.
4.
The necessary level crossing closures with a further increased frequency of train movements with the
emerging EWR proposals (potentially 6 / hr / direction) would have a significant, potentially
unacceptable impact, on traffic movements along Green Lane, the barriers being closed for the
majority of the time.
5.
The provision of a bridge replacement for any level crossing is a significant engineering undertaking.
Funding is not certain, nor indeed are deliverable technical solutions possible within the available
highway.
6.
NR is currently undertaking initial scoping to understand the constraints within which NR would have
to work – this work includes speaking to local authorities and potentially affected local developers.

Introduction 
 
This meeting was arranged to discuss the planning and highway authorities’ 
emerging requirements for a transport assessment to support the Development 
Consent Order (DCO) application to be made by Millbrook Power Ltd. This meeting 
follows: 
 
i) 
an earlier Joint Highway Authority Transport Meeting on 28th August 2014; 
and  
 
ii) 
the issue of the DCO Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) in 
October 2014 to all relevant consultees.  
 
MPL intended that this technical assessment process would be progressed 
together with the Joint Highway Authorities to ensure that all matters arising be 
discussed and dealt with together in a mutually acceptable manner as the 
assessment work proceeds.    
 
Whilst there have been no Network Rail (NR) representatives at these two Joint 
Highway Authority Transport Meetings, they had been invited to both. A further 
meeting has been arranged separately to discuss matters with them, the intention 
is that they be invited to future meetings. Copies of all Meeting Notes will be 
circulated to all parties.

Local Engagement and consultation  
 
Four consultation exhibitions have been held as part of the Local Engagement 
exercise at Stewartby, Marston Moretaine, Lidlington and Ampthill. The proposals 
have been generally well received.  
 
Refinement of the red line boundary  
 
The PEIR includes a redline boundary significantly reduced from that circulated at 
the meeting in August as the gas and electricity connection routes are confirmed. It 
is likely that the next iteration will remove further areas from the current red line.  
 
The redline boundary now includes the area to accommodate the traffic calming 
measures sought for Green Lane relating to the Site Access, as discussed at the 
previous meeting.  
 
Network Rail - East-West Rail Meeting 
 
Network Rail has published proposals to deliver a higher quality line for the high 
speed East-West Rail (EWR) link. Associated with this is NR’s objective of 
removing all level crossings across their network. 
 
MPL and PBA met with the East-West Rail Manager on October 24th to exchange 
information. The notes of this meeting are attached.  
 
NR acknowledges that the delivery programme for EWR is after that for the MPL 
proposals. NR would need to accommodate the approved / consented access 
proposals for the Covanta EfW plant, which may be delivered earlier by MPL. As 
such, the EWR proposals have no impact on the delivery of the MPL proposals.

Highways Agency comments  
 
HA had already forwarded the comments from Aecom to the TA / TP / ES Scoping 
issued in August 2014 by PBA, these comments are attached.  
 
In summary, HA has confirmed that they see no transport-related reasons why the 
MPL proposals should not be approved, albeit that they will seek further definition:  
 
i) 
regarding the construction movements assigning between the electrical / gas / 
power plant areas; 
 
ii) 
on the source of this information; 
 
iii) 
to the construction trip routing; 
 
iv) 
on the worst case construction trip assessment; 
 
v) 
of the two-way trip movements through the strategic road network junctions; 
and 
 
vi) 
to the construction trip analysis period. 
 
Aecom confirmed that:  
 
i) 
the Transport Assessment contents comply with the Department for 
Transport’s Guidance on Transport Assessment (March 2007); and  
 
ii) 
the content of the proposed TA and Travel Plan appears to comply with the 
HA guidance on requirements for transport assessments and travel plans.

Bedford Borough Council comments to the PEIR 
 
BBC confirmed that they see no transport-related reasons why the MPL proposals 
should not be approved, albeit that in addition to the HA comments they seek:  
 
 
i) 
further clarity to the quoted worst-case construction trip assessment – what 
this relates to; 
 
ii) 
a planning condition to ensure that the construction trips generated by the 
MPL and Covanta developments will be managed to avoid two operations 
with high HGV trip generation occurring together; 
 
iii) 
further definition to the construction programme; 
 
iv) 
a review of the construction routes shown in the PEIR, to comply with existing 
weight or height limits – such as through Millbrook and Kempston Hardwick; 
 
v) 
details of the construction movements through the local highway network 
junctions; 
 
vi) 
the collection of further traffic data on the B530 to inform the likely 
construction movement impacts – an  additional automatic traffic counter site 
was agreed as part of the ongoing traffic count survey to support the 
application.

========================================================================================== 
 
Delivering MPL A4 exhibition posters to Stewartby Council’s John Symonds, PT took the opportunity 
to talk with JS about the MPL project given JS’s recent critical comments on BBC Three Counties 
Radio.  JS acknowledged that the MPL project is OK, given its size, type of operation and fuel, and 
the changes to the project that had been made since 2014 as a result of local consultation. JS had 
noted that the single stack height was now 35m. 
 
However, JS is concerned about the cumulative impact of MPL and Covanta, and the other 
developments taking place in the area – more housing and a proposed industrial scheme.  PT 
assured him that the decision to re-start the MPL project so soon after Covanta’s application for an 
environmental permit was co-incidental, and that (just as in 2014), MPL’s environmental studies take 
into account the Covanta scheme. 
 
The meeting at Wootton Parish Council was attended by six councillors, including Cllr John Wheeler 
of Bedford Borough Council (who MPL met on April 26th).  The purpose of the meeting was to update 
the councillors on the MPL project, some of whom had recently received the MPL leaflet via Royal 
Mail.  The Parish Clerk confirmed that she had received the Section 42 pack, and said that she would 
display the MPL exhibition posters on parish noticeboards 
 
PT explained the main changes to the project since 2014 – the decision to apply for consent for one 
turbine (1 stack), and revisited the other main elements of the project, namely the other generation 
equipment and buildings, and the underground electrical and gas connections.  PT also outlined the 
plans for the period of statutory public consultation (May 29th to July 2nd). 
 
The main issue raised was the cumulative impact of MPL and Covanta: PT explained that MPL’s 
assessments in 2014 had taken into account the Covanta scheme, and would do so again.  Questions 
were also asked about gas security (foreign imports and global gas reserves being finite?) and why 
the power station was needed. 
 
PT offered to write an article for the Council’s website; this was provided by PT on June 1st.

Note of telephone call with Sarah Watt on behalf of Houghton Conquest Parish Council and Nick Johnson (MPL) – 
06/06/2017 
 
Telephone call was held between Nick Johnson (NJ) and Sarah Watt (SW) to discuss the concerns raised in the letter 
issued by Houghton Conquest Parish Council on 04/06/17. 
1. NJ explained that where possible quantitative assessment of cumulative impacts with Covanta have been 
assessed. NJ explained that this is only possible in some topics for example air quality where numerical 
modelling is used. NJ informed SW that the results of the assessment are in the PEIR which SW agreed to 
look at in more detail. 
2. NJ explained that because MPL have consulted the locals on the Project previously the Project is at a mature 
stage in terms of design with few areas where any optionality remains. NJ reminded SW that some 
significant changes had already been made as a result of the consultation. That said, NJ explained that the 
optionality referred to in the S42 cover letter in connection with the gas connection is in relation to how 
construction traffic accesses the site, and that SW should look at Figure 12.2 of the PEIR for further 
information. NJ then explained that the optionality with regard to the electrical connection is in relation to 
whether 1 large or 2 small sealing end compounds are used, stating that the impacts will be the same for 
either option. NJ also explained that although MPL may be able to have some influence over which electrical 
connection option is progressed, this was largely a decision made by Nation Grid based on technical studies. 
3. NJ explained that the attenuation pond and drainage scheme for Rookery S Pit is part of the LLRS consent 
than than MPL’s DCO. That said, NJ explained that MPL have carried out a full flood risk assessment which is 
available at appendix Volume G to the PEIR.      
SW expressed that she did not think that the impacts of the Project should be any cause for concern for the people 
she represents, but that getting that message across in the wake of the Covanta project was not going to be easy.

Note of Meeting 
NJ gave a very brief update on the project including that MPL was purchased by Drax Group in late 
2016 and are now progressing through the DCO planning process for the Project. NJ explained that 
the aspirational programme for the Project is to submit the DCO application in Q4 2017, obtain 
planning consent by mid 2019, with construction commencing in 2020 and concluding in 2022. 
MH stated that, as had been discussed in 2014, the principal concern for the Proving Ground was 
one of security/privacy where workmen may be carrying out work up the existing pylon which is 
adjacent to Millbook Station. Work will need to be carried out on this pylon to allow de-stringing and 
re-stringing of the 400 kV lines. All agreed that any issues for the Proving Ground around this matter 
will be mitigated by planning any works well in advance and coordinating schedules. NJ stated that 
the works on the over-head line would likely be carried out during the summer months of 2021 or 
2022.  
All agreed to keep in close contact going forward, particularly as construction schedules are drawn 
up.  
Further Information Post-Meeting     
The works to de-string then re-string the 400 kV line will take place over two periods – once at the 
beginning and once at the end of an approximate 5 month period between March and August. The 
time taken for each period of stringing is expected to be around 5 days.

Thanks for your email.
 
I or a colleague will reply more fully to the points you raise
during the week but given that we are hosting exhibitions
tomorrow in Ampthill tomorrow and Liflington on Tuesday I
thought I would provide a brief response now.
 
The Millbrook Power project would be fuelled by natural gas
piped underground to the plant.
 
Once the construction is completed (approx 2 years), there will be
around 15 people working on site over 2 or 3 shifts so there is no
real traffic impact.  There will be the occasional delivery truck.
There will be HGV traffic during the construction period.
 
The site is classified by the local council as land for waste and
energy use.  
 
Given the planning consent process, the earliest possible start of
operations date is 2022.
 
Millbrook Power has no connection with the Covanta project :
wholly  different on the fuel they use, the generation capacity,
their physical size and of course vehicle movements. And their
emissions. 
 
If you or colleagues can visit the exhibitions, we can explain
more.  Documents, explaining the environmental impacts, can be
inspected online, at the exhibitions or via the council offices and
in local libraries.
 
We are engaging with the local parish councils in the area as well
as the two local borough councils.  
 
I trust that provides some helpful clarification.  As I said we will
respond more fully over the next few days.

Dear Paul Taylor,
I am writing as a member of a transport pressure
group in regard to its concerns about the Millbrook
Power Project which is currently under statutory
consultation .The group is known as the English
Regional Transport Association(ERTA),which is a
voluntary membership-based,pro-public transport
improvement association with its main projects
initially in the Bedfordshire and surrounding regional
areas but its remit has since increased since several of
its projects have a nation-wide positive benefit and
impact.
ERTA's website will also provide some further useful
information: https://ertarail.com/
 If this  development goes ahead alongside the
already approved Wootton to Kempston business
park alongside the A421 and also the nearby Covanta
incinerator plant, the level of HGV movements
necessary for this power station along that road plus
the M1 will soar.People who now use the new J13 /
Bedford / MK road will know how unreliable it is
becoming in the rush-hour periods and how much
traffic has already moved back onto the old
A421.Therefore there will be more
congestion,pollution and carnage on these roads,and
as you may also be aware,air quality is now at a
premium.The M1 today frequently closes for several
hours during the day.
The proposal  also creates an over- supply of
employment land and the area already has sufficient
approved employment land of this type and this
proposal over develops a small village location.
This area should also remain predominantly green
field to support the barrier to block Milton Keynes
expansion across the M1 east toward Bedford and
villages like Marston Moreteyne.
Furthermore.this proposal will  cost  £millions yet
another East-West Road would seemingly create
capacity in a context of growth. But it is a false
economy. It will  eat up land and the growth ends up
at junctions and town centres fuelling more land used
for parking and more out- of -town sprawl as
Councils pander to popularism and accommodating
drive-round access to the car rather than close-knit
communities where walking, cycling and using
public transport gives the edge.
I think that the £millions spent on an East-West Road
would be better spent to:
a. hasten the railway and get more freight off roads
onto rails(including the businesses close to the
Marston Vale line and the A421)
b. de-congest London by virtue of early delivery of
East-West Rail
c. Spare money in days of austerity should go back to
councils who invested in good faith to make the case
whereas Whitehall should have picked up on the
error of this particular closure and rectified it decades
ago. I would prefer this money to be used to keep
community centres and libraries open with lights on!
Should the proposal go ahead,ERTA insists that the
power station's supplies/waste are transported by rail
rather than road,with dedicated sidings from the
current Marston Vale railway,which will ultimately
be incorporated into the East - West Rail Link.

Simon Barber - Administrator

The Rookery Pit Incinerator should be rail served
from the Marston Vale Railway from day one.
If interested object to it and suggest the rail aspect
and visit the exhibitions - can ERTA have a stall at
any of them?
 
Just a thought, you can choose to ignore it.

The Environment Agency Permit consultation for the Covanta Waste 
Incinerator has now closed. We have been informed by the Agency that 
over 2,000 comments from members of the public and interested 
stakeholders were received.  
Houghton Conquest Parish council has made a detailed submission of 
a number of points of objection to this project. We also added our points 
to a cross-parish objection which was facilitated by Councillor Sue 
Clark (Cranfield and Marston Ward). The Environment Agency is 
considering the objections and will make a technical determination 
before a second round of consultation. The Parish Council is engaging 
with Veolia and Covanta as part of the Community Liaison Partnership 
(CLP). The next CLP meeting is on the 12th June 17.  
We note that ground work has commenced at the site, however this is 
at Veolia & Covanta’s expense and liability as a permit is yet to be 
 granted.  
New Development 
 
 
The Parish Council received a presentation from Millbrook power who 
are planning to install a 299MW, Open Cycle Gas Turbine. This turbine 
will be used to help the UK energy grid with peak power demand.  
Millbrook power plan to spend a communication to all householders in 
the area about this project. There will also be a public consultation 
before planning permission is submitted.  
The Council have asked to review the Environmental Impact 
Assessment as soon as this is available.

Parish Council Vacancies 
We are looking for volunteers to fill 3 vacancies on the Parish Council. 
Being a member of the Parish Council can be a very rewarding and 
fulfilling experience, as well being a useful addition to a CV. To qualify 
to apply you need to live or work in the village and be 18 or over. If you 
are able to attend a majority of the monthly meetings (generally 10 a 
year) and have a desire to maintain and improve village life then why 
not contact The Clerk to find out exactly what is involved.     
 
Planning  
No updates to report on the 2 large developments in the village. If we 
are provided with any information we will of course share it. The 
Chapel End development does come with provision of a MUGA (Multi 
Use Games Area) and it is proposed to install this on the Sports Field 
so it benefits all villagers. More details can be found in this newsletter. 
There is also provision for public art, in the form of a village sign and 
several noticeboards. These will be designed and installed in 
consultation with local organisations and residents and more 
information will be provided in due course. 
The new planning application for 9 houses in Mill Lane has had several 
highway changes and is still under consideration. This land already has 
permission granted for 7 houses. 
 
Millbrook Power – Gas-fired power station 
Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL) has re-started its work to secure planning

Project Description  
 
The Project Applicant is Millbrook Power Ltd (MPL), an energy development 
company established for this Project by Watt Power Limited. 
 
The Project comprises:  
 
i) 
a new Power Generation Plant, a gas fired peaking 299MW power 
generating station fuelled by natural gas. The Generation Plant would be 
accessed via a new purpose built access road from Green Lane, 
Stewartby; 
 
ii) 
a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System; 
 
iii) 
a new Electrical Connection to export power from the Power Generation 
Plant to the National Grid Electricity Transmission system for distribution;  
 
iv) 
a temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site;  
 
v) 
a new purpose-built 1.7km access road constructed from Green Lane to 
the Generating Equipment. This access road would follow the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching 
Rookery South Pit, the Access Road would descend the ramp to enter 
into the Pit, and cross through the Pit until it reaches the Generating 
Equipment Site.   
 
The Generating Equipment within the Project would run during periods of high 
electricity demand to support the high-output “base” suppliers such as nuclear 
and coal-fired power stations, as well as to complement the output from 
renewable energy sources.  As such, this plant will not operate constantly - an 
environmental permit limited to 1,500 hours operation per year is being sought. 
 
The likely operational staffing of the MPL proposals would be a maximum of 5 
staff per shift. As the plant is powered by gas, there would be no / minimal 
additional delivery movements during normal operation.

Summary of the background planning  
 
There are a series of extant consents for Rookery South Pit that could be 
implemented concurrently with the Project:  
 
i) 
the “Low Level Restoration Scheme” to restore the Rookery South Pit, 
including drainage, landscaping, and earthworks to ensure the long-term 
stability of the area (this will be fundamentally completed before the MPL 
works commence); 
 
ii) 
Covanta has an extant DCO for an Energy from Waste (EfW) plant, with 
an annual throughput of 580,000t of refuse passing into the Site for 
incineration. The IPCC order was published in March 2013 – although 
there is currently some uncertainty as to delivery timetables for this 
though; and 
 
iii) 
an Integrated Waste Management Facility associated with this EfW – 
albeit this facility would be entirely dependent upon the EfW facility.

The redline boundary covers the ground over which the Gas and Electrical 
Connections pass. In particular: 
 
i) 
the Gas Connection will consist of an Above Ground Installation (AGI) on 
the existing gas main, connecting the existing pipeline apparatus to the 
Generating Equipment; 
 
ii) 
a sub-station would be located adjacent the Generating Equipment Site 
within the Rookery South Pit - and will transform the Plant output to a 
voltage compatible with the National Grid network voltage.

Project Update 
 
Local Engagement and consultation  
 
Four consultation exhibitions have been held this autumn as part of the Local 
Engagement exercise at Stewartby, Marston Moretaine, Lidlington and 
Ampthill. The proposals have been generally well received.  
 
PEIR issue 
 
The Section 42 consultation exercise commenced on October 16th following the 
issue of the PEIR on October 7th 2014. The responses were due to be returned 
on 12th November 2014. (Post Meeting Note - NR were requested to contact 
their planning colleagues to progress this response.) 
 
Network Rail - East-West Rail Meeting 
 
Network Rail has published proposals to deliver a higher quality line for the 
high speed East-West Rail (EWR) link. Associated with this is NR’s objective of 
removing all level crossings across their network. MPL and PBA met with the 
East-West Rail Manager on October 24th to exchange information.  
 
NR acknowledges that the delivery programme for EWR is after that for the 
MPL proposals. NR would need to accommodate the approved / consented 
access proposals for the Covanta EfW plant, which may be delivered earlier by 
MPL. As such, the EWR proposals have no impact on the delivery of the MPL 
proposals.

Network Rail comments to the MPL proposals 
 
Access Junction – Green Lane 
 
The Covanta DCO included for an approved ghost island priority junction to 
Green Lane.  If Covanta delivers this arrangement, it would have sufficient 
spare capacity to accommodate the MPL application trip generation without 
amendment.  
 
This ghost island access arrangement was derived to accommodate a 
significantly higher daily operational trip generation than is being proposed by 
the MPL application, and is therefore considered to be excessive – and indeed, 
potentially detrimental to highway safety providing excess highway width.

In the event that Covanta did not deliver this ghost island priority junction, a 
more suitably scaled alternative for this application is being considered by 
MPL. A simple priority junction, possibly similar to the attached PBA drawing 
reference 31116/3010/003, is proposed as the site access. In capacity terms, 
this will be tested and reported with the worst case peak hour construction 
movements to demonstrate its suitability.  
 
Whilst NR has no concerns over the level of queuing arising during the normal 
operation, NR concerned over the greater number of movements during the 
construction period. It was agreed that a temporary traffic signal controlled 
arrangement would be acceptable in principle during working hours. PBA to 
prepare a Traffic Management signage plan and note on the potential 
arrangement, to Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual. 
 
Access Track 
 
The Covanta DCO also included a new, purpose-built, 1.7km access road 
constructed from Green Lane to the Rookery South Pit, following the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. This had been agreed 
with NR at the time of the Covanta DCO. 
 
As it is intended that the proposed access road is to be constructed at the 
existing level, NR has minimal concerns. PBA to issue details of the access 
track agreed in the DCO to NR. 
 
PBA to forward details of: 
 
- 
the railway boundary fencing identified within the DCO;  
- 
the “anti-dazzle” fencing to protect on-coming train drivers’ vision;  
- 
carriageway construction details; and 
- 
the safety fence detail. 
 
NR will allow no discharge of rainwater onto the rail land. 
 
Details of the dust control measures are to be forwarded to NR. 
 
Building construction 
 
As the proposed Generating Equipment Building would be circa 90m from the 
rail boundary, NR does not perceive this to impact detrimentally upon the rail, 
hence would not influence NR’s response. 
 
General 
 
NR to forward NR’s standard construction guidance documentation to PBA. 
 
All correspondence to NR to be issued to Amanda Ashton, the NR Town 
Planning Technician LNE & EM (who issued the initial response to the PEIR 
Scoping in June 2014), copied to the appropriate contact.

Welcome and Introduction 
 
The Planning Inspectorate opened the meeting by giving an introduction to the 2008 
Planning Act which was followed by a project update presentation by Millbrook Power 
Limited (see attached slides). 
 
Stakeholder Issues discussed 
 
All parties were advised to engage as soon as possible early on in the consultation 
process so that issues raised by stakeholders may be resolved before the application 
was submitted, as there is very limited scope to change an application after 
submission. 
 
Enforcement 
 
In response to a question, the Planning Inspectorate explained that powers to enforce 
requirements are with the local planning authority and should be specified in the 
Development Consent Order (DCO).  
 
Local Impact Reports (LIR) 
  
The Planning Inspectorate covered the role of the LIR in its presentation. In response 
to a question, The Parish Councils (PCs) represented were advised by the Planning 
Inspectorate that they did not have to produce a Local Impact Report (LIR) but to 
assist joint-working, that they could submit evidence to assist the Local Authorities 
(LAs) with their LIRs.  
 
 
Statements of Common Ground 
 
The Planning Inspectorate covered the role of the LIR in its presentation. Several of 
the statutory parties expressed concerns regarding Statements of Common Ground 
(SoCGs) since their previous experience on a different application, had been one of 
pressure to agree SoCGs before the examination closed. . The Inspectorate explained 
that no party should feel forced to agree a SoCG and if no common ground could be 
agreed, areas of Uncommon Ground could also be specified. The Planning 
Inspectorate advised that aAny SoCG submitted should be clear on what had and had 
not been agreed upon. 
 
Appointment of Examining Inspector  
 
In answer to a query, the Planning Inspectorate explained that matters were taken 
into account as part of the appointment process. The Planning Inspectorate advised 
that the appointment process looks at possible conflicts of interest and would also 
consider whether Inspectors had previously been involved in nearby applications. The 
Planning Inspectorate also advised that where resources allow, the Acceptance 
Inspector would also conduct the examination but this could not be guarenteed. It 
was also clarified that in the event of the application not being accepted and then 
resubmitted, a new inspector may be appointed to conduct the acceptance and 
examination. 
 
How a decision is made 
 
In response to a concern that there was a presumption in favour of the project and 
that there was limited scope to affect the decision, the Planning Inspectorate advised 
the decisions are made in accordance with the relevant National Policy Statements 
(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478
54/1938-overarching-nps-for-energy-en1.pdf 
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/4785
5/1939-nps-for-fossil-fuel-en2.pdf), subject to a number of tests set out in the 
Planning Act 2008 (as amended). These tests include (but are not limited to), whether 
local impact outweighs the benefits of the scheme, any potential breaches of 
international obligations, for example to the environment, and taking into account 
anything the Secretary of State considers important and relevant. 
 
Previous experience of the process 
 
Some stakeholders wished to know if the relevant representations (RR) process had 
changed since their previous experience and suggested that parts of the application 
form and the terminology used needed to be simplified, eg so that members of the 
public understand what terms such as ‘interest in the land’ actually meant in this 
context. It was noted that the RR form had been refined recently and will be subject 
to ongoing improvements, and it was agreed that the Planning Inspectorate would 
explore the possibility of further clarifying the terminology.  
 
The stakeholders also explained that their previous experience of hearings had not 
been positive and that future hearings can be improved by Inspectors putting 
Interested Parties’ questions to the applicant, or allowing those questions to be asked 
directly, and allowing sufficient time for these.  The Planning Inspectorate offered to 
provide this feedback to the Group Manager for Examining Inspectors.  
 
The Planning Inspectorate advised that a number of improvements had been made to 
its website in response to feedback, and it encouraged more feedback in future. It 
advised there will be a project specific web-page with a visual examination timetable 
available, and a project specific email address will also be set up following the 
meeting. 
 
Responses received by the applicant 
 
During its presentation, the applicant explained that all responses to its consultation 
will be included as appendices to the consultation report, and that the report itself will 
summarise the responses in a table. 
 
Design and visual impact 
 
The applicant stated that due to the nature of the project that it cannot submit a final 
design proposal at the point of submission and that the submitted application will 
utilise the ‘Rochdale Envelope'i approach as the power station’s turbine design is yet 
to be chosen. This means that the final design would have to adhere to limits 
contained in any DCO and cannot go outside those limits.  
 
An attendee raised concerns regarding the visual impact and expressed a preference 
for one stack rather than five as mentioned in the Preliminary Environmental Impact 
Report (PEIR). The applicant advised that the five stack scenario was the worst case 
scenario and that the DCO would commit them to five stacks or less and that the 
numberamount of stacks would depend on the technology chosen in response to a 
range of factors. The applicant also advised, in answer to a question, that as the 
project would be using single cycle turbines, there will be no plume from the stack.  
Concerns were also raised regarding the stack height. The applicant explained that the 
height had been modelled to be as low as possible without compromising on air 
quality and would benefit from being located in the Pit.. 
 
The applicant also advised that it would not be able to first build the power station 
with one stack/turbine and then add a second or a third one at a later date thus 
building up the capacity to 299MW and that the DCO would prohibit this by capping 
the plant at 299MW per annum.  
 
Concerns were also raised regarding the visual impact of the pylons on Ampthill Park. 
The applicant explained that there would be no more than 7 pylons but that the 
number of pylons and the type of connection to the power station would depend on 
the configuration preferred by National Grid for connection to the electricity network, 
which may not be known until the start of the examination process. 
  
Some stakeholders advised that they felt they had too little information regarding the 
visual impact and advised that they wanted a much more fixed design proposal to be 
submitted, including the design of the grid connection. 
 
The Planning Inspectorate explained that the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) allowed 
for flexibility in the design, but that the worst case scenario had to be fully 
asseccessed by the applicant. This does however not mean that the proposed design 
of the station should be unclear and advised the applicant to follow up the concerns 
raised with the respective stakeholders.  
 
The Planning Inspectorate confirmed that a project can be built according to the 
maximum limits specified in the DCO but that this scenario had to be fully assessed in 
the Environmental Statement, and be the subject of consultation. It reiterated the 
benefit of providing comments on potential impacts of the proposed design at the pre-
application stage, to allow the applicant to consider potential impacts it may be 
unaware of. 
 
Some stakeholders advised that the worst scenario may not lead to a scenario that 
was best for the local communities, since the application cannot be materially 
amended after it has been submitted.  
 
The applicant informed stakeholders that it would arrange briefings on the project 
before it submitted its DCO application and would also share with them the top-level 
results of the statutory consultation period.  
 
Operating hours 
 
A stakeholder sought clarification on how the applicant would be prevented from 
running the plant 100% of the year rather than c20% as stated in the Preliminary 
Environmental Impact Report. The applicant explained that the Environmental Permit 
would prevent the plant from running more than c20% of the year.  
 
The applicant was asked by attendees to consider what community benefits they could 
provide for the local community, such as combined heat and power (CHP).  The 
applicant advised that it is able to have further discussions on community benefits 
related to the scheme, however as the project is a peaking plant that would only 
generate power for c20% of the time, the applicant explained that exporting heat 
from the plant wouldn’t be possible. 
 
Other matters 
 
A ‘Low Level Restoration Scheme’ (LLRS) on the project site has commenced and 
must be completed before any construction can take place. It was noted that  and will 
result in the site was cbeing 15m lower than the surrounding land.     
 
The LA and the applicant agreed not to use data from the Rookery South application 
as it is now out of date, and that all draft documents would be circulated to all 
stakeholders present. 
 
Stakeholders also requested that the applicant could use layman terms as much as 
possible in relevant documentation. 
 
The application is expected to be submitted in February 2015.  If consented, and 
subject to financing construction would start in late 2017 at the earliest, and the plant 
would be operational in 2019/20.     
 
AOB 
 
The applicant and the stakeholders agreed to discuss the following issues at future 
meetings. 
 
• 
Flexible design 
• 
Visualisation aids 
• 
Viability of the project 
• 
Change in energy policy after the general election 
• 
Community benefits 
 
 
 
 
 
i The Rochdale Envelope is a term used to describe circumstances where an applicant is seeking flexibility 
for aspects of its proposal, in which an applicant seeks options / parameters in which the final option / 
detailed design can be resolved after development consent is granted. It is named after a legal decision on 
the issue of assessing the impacts of this approach under Town and Country Planning Act legislation. 
Further information can be found in a Planning Inspectorate Advice Note (see link).

Meeting held at Millbrook Proving Ground, Millbrook, Bedford, MK45 2JQ  on 17th December 2014 
at 13:30. 
Present: Martin Hughes (MPG) 
Nick Johnson, Chris McKerrow 
Summary 
This meeting had been arranged to further discuss MPL’s needs WRT the Proving Ground. CM 
recapped on where the project is at, what it involves, and what the need for interaction with the 
Proving ground is. MH stated that he was not concerned about the temporary conductors over 
sailing the site – his only concern was the workmen that would be around during its construction. 
CM/NJ explained that this would not be expected to take more than a week. Martin explained that 
given the amount of time between now and the construction program starting, he felt it should be 
relatively easy to come to an arrangement that would work for both parties.  
The exact location of the temporary diversion works was checked in respect to the new 
development at the proving ground. It was agreed that there should be no conflict.    
MH was asked if he had received MPL’s S42 consultation pack – he had and was surprised that MPL 
had not received his response. MH agreed to forward it on directly. He explained that the response 
is not an objection as such, more a statement that more work needs to be done to consider the 
impacts for the proving ground.     
MPL agreed to get a more detailed schedule for the construction program to MH ASAP once NG 
have come back on a number of queries.

Subject: RE: Millbrook Power 
Hi Chris, 
Thank you, and your colleagues from Peter Brett Associates, for providing the background to this project. 
It is important to separate the permitting aspects from the planning aspects so please continue to go through 
Neville on aspects relating to planning – as ultimately it will be his team leader that may have to sign off any 
‘Statements of Common Ground’ if we get to an impasse on the planning application. 
I will provide our response, from compliance/permitting perspective, to him during the consultation process which 
won’t be too far from what has been provided before for the sister project in our neighbouring Area. 
Permitting Reference Identification 
I suggested we set up some archiving mechanisms for permitting correspondence and do that I will issue you with a 
permitting reference identifier. 
Please forward the following:- 
Application Expected Date 
A best estimate is useful for permitting planning purposes.
Site Name and Address 
Please always include the Grid Ref – if a postal address is yet 
to be assigned to the site. 
Operator Name and Registered Office 
Address inc Companies House 
number
Also add in any names of agents/consultants carrying out the 
application work on behalf of the operator
BAT – Open Cycle 
The key areas for permitting will revolve around demonstration of Best Available Techniques for Open Cycle GTs.  At 
present we have creating a ‘holding position’ for Open Cycle plant which limits them to 500hr / annum operational 
hours.  This is based on our expectation that plant must optimise its energy efficiency.   We are currently reviewing 
our BAT criteria for Open Cycle GT operations and until that concludes I am just letting you be aware of the current 
situation. 
Air Emissions 
Combustion activities are significant contributors of Oxides of Nitrogen.  We will need demonstration, by assessing 
at permitting, that the stack heights are considered BAT based on the Process Contribution and background ground 
level concentrations.  Please be aware of any AQMZ within 10kms of the proposal.   
BREF - Combustion 
The BREF is still very much draft but the UKs submission to the various Technical Working Groups (TWGs) should 
provide what the UKs Government’s position is for each of the TWGs.   
2
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140328084622/http:/www.environment-
agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/144756.aspx 
As the BREF is planned to be adopted in 2015 then for existing sites compliance will required within 4 years of the 
adoption date. We will complete a permit BAT review in 2019 to complete that requirement. 
For new applications our current enforcement position is that if the BREF is adopted after a new application is duly 
made the ELVs at permit issue will be based on a BAT assessment of new plant standards at the time the application 
is duly made.  However, where necessary, pre-operational and/or improvement conditions will be used to ensure 
timely compliance with the BREF conclusions. 
From this our expectation is that sites will be designing new plant to meet the likely BREF conclusions and where 
there are ‘unexpected last minute changes’ to them then we can implement a route to ensure compliance in as 
short, and as practicable, period as possible but no later than 4 years from BREF conclusions publication.
Carbon Capture and CHP Readiness 
In addition, for new applications being received now, we require CHP readiness and our guidance on that can be 
found here:- 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-efficiency-for-combustion-and-energy-from-waste-power-
plants 
This clearly is more focussed on high efficiency (water and hybrid cooled) plant but I provide as a steer to other 
projects you may get involved with in England. 
This contains information on Carbon Capture readiness as well. 
I understand that there is some uncertainty on how the <300MWe threshold should be measured for deciding 
whether Carbon Capture is required so I will provide further advice and guidance when I receive it from our 
Environment and Business Advisors. 
I hope the above is useful, even if it has repeated previous dialogue in other Areas, but please do not hesitate in 
coming back to me if you need further technical information on permitting.

Nice to meet with you today and thanks for your time. 
As promised, please find attached a link to the statement of common ground between the EA and Progress Power 
(the other 299 MW OCGT we discussed that is nearing the end of examination). There is a paper at the end of this 
document which we asked Parsons Brinkerhoff to produce in response to the Environment Agency’s request for 
further information regarding both the economic efficiencies of OCGT relative to CCGT and the emergence of new 
technologies which may challenge the relative efficiency of OCGT to CCGT.  
Grateful if you could pass on to Neville.

diversion plan.pdf
Martin, 
Since our last meeting with you, we have spoken to National Grid and our engineers and have some further 
information regarding the electrical connection for our project. The main points of note are: 
• 
The construction of the electrical connection will take up to 5 months, starting in March 2020 (as
previously discussed most of this work will be taking place to the north of Station Lane and will have no
impact on the Proving Ground)
• 
A temporary diversion of the 400 kV line will be erected to the south of the existing 400 kV which will
involve;
o Erecting a scaffold structure over Station Lane – this will fit into the verges of the road and will not
require the use of Proving Ground land 
o Erecting a temporary pylon – this will be to the north of Station Lane
o  Pulling cables along the temporary diversion route which crosses the Proving Ground as shown in the
plan. This process will take up to 5 days and may or may not require a short section of the Proving 
Ground fence to be taken down. In the event that the fence is removed National Grid contractors 
will provide 24 hr security. Some equipment will have to be located next to the western most pylon 
within the Proving Ground as shown in the attached.  
o Vegetation will need to be cleared 10 m on either side of the diversion route (shown in attached
plan). Most vegetation can be cut back, lopped or coppiced rather than being removed altogether. 
It has been assumed that these areas will be accessed by removing a section of fence adjacent to a 
layby off Station Lane, however we would be interested in exploring the possibility of using existing 
means of access with yourself in due course.  
o  During the four to five month interim period during which the diversion will be ‘live’ and construction 
works will be on-going to the north, any security fence belonging to the Proving ground will be 
reinstated and the over-sailing conductors will not impose any restriction on the use of your facility. 
No access will be required to the diversion during this time.  
o Restringing the existing 400 kV line, again this will take up to 5 days with the same impacts as above.
o  Millbrook Power would re-plant anything that had been removed during the process.
We appreciate that this will be inconvenient for your business and involves some disruption to you. We intend to 
follow up this email with a further plan if required and an offer of compensation for you to consider with the
suggested terms of an agreement between us. It may also be useful to clarify that Millbrook Power will pay for the 
reasonable costs of your legal representation in this process. We expect to make you an offer prior to the end of 
February. 
In the meantime of you have any questions or wish to discuss the process generally please do not hesitate to 
contact me or our legal director Susannah Harvey. 
With best regards, 
Nick

Dear Sir/Madam 
Re: Millbrook Power Limited:  Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr. 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire – INFORMATION UPDATE 
Peter Brett Associates act for Millbrook Power Limited (MPL). 
I write to update you on MPL's proposal to construct and operate a gas-fired power station on a site 
at Rookery South Pit together with an integral gas connection and electrical connection (together 
"the Project"). 
MPL undertook statutory consultation regarding the Project, pursuant to sections 42, 47 and 48 of 
the Planning Act 2008 (“the Planning Act”), between 13 October and 16 November 2014 and would 
like to thank all those who provided comments. MPL is having regard to the responses received as 
it refines its proposals in anticipation of the submission of the application for a Development 
Consent Order for the Project in the first quarter of 2015. 
We wanted to update you on some of the work that MPL has been doing in order to take on board 
consultation feedback and refine the proposals for the Project. 
One key area of feedback has related to the proposed Electrical Connection. As you may recall, the 
proposed Project includes the construction, operation and maintenance of a new electrical 
connection together with a new substation to connect the power generation plant to the existing 
overhead power line nearby. At consultation, the layout of the Electrical Connection was not 
finalised but an area within which the connection would be sited was identified.  
At that time a realistic worst case scenario of up to two overhead line double circuits [of 400 kV] 
(including up to seven new towers one of which would replace an existing tower leading to six net 
additional towers) had been assumed (and was environmentally assessed). However MPL has 
continued to work with National Grid on the indicative design of the connection and it has become 
apparent through the responses to the statutory consultation that one of the major concerns has 
been the impact on the landscape and on views of overhead power lines and towers.

Following due consideration of a number of factors (including perceived impact, engineering issues 
and cost), MPL is pleased to have been able to take on board community and consultee feedback 
and has taken the decision to underground as much of the connection as possible.  
This underground connection would take the form of: 
1) One underground double circuit. This would require one replacement tower (which will
replace an existing tower and will be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission 
route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). The replacement tower will be 
up to 48 m tall rather than up to 45 m tall as previously indicated in the statutory 
consultation – a change of less than 10%; 
2) Either one or two Sealing End Compounds (SECs) located adjacent to the existing
transmission line. The SEC(s) are required to ‘seal off’ the area within which the cables are 
taken underground. Each SEC will cover an area of approximately 0.25 of a Hectare. 
3) Both circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres in
length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’) - which will remain located in the Rookery South Pit. 
Other amendments to the Project that MPL has made in order to take on board the feedback that 
has been received during consultation include:  
•
Consultation zones modified
•
Choice of corridor
•
Location of AGI
•
Revised red line boundary
•
Undergrounding of the Electrical Connection cable.
The submission under the Planning Act 2008 for the application for a Development Consent Order 
for the Project will be made by MPL before the end of Q1 2015. 
Should the application be accepted by the Planning Inspectorate (a decision would be made within 
28 days of the application being received by the Planning Inspectorate), then MPL would notify the 
local community, statutory consultees and relevant landowners of the acceptance of the application 
and invite those who are interested to register with the Planning Inspectorate in order to remain 
involved in the process of considering and examining the accepted application. Details of the 
application would also be published in hard copy in local authority’s office and in various libraries in 
the area. The information would also be made available on the planning inspectorate’s website 
(http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/). The Planning Inspectorate would then take up to six 
months to examine the accepted application for the Project (this process would include receiving 
representations from those who have registered an interest in the Project). Following completion of 
its examination, the Planning Inspectorate would then have three months to report to the Secretary 
of State, who would themselves have three months in which to make a decision on whether or not 
to grant consent for the Project.

Please do not hesitate to contact me using the above details should you require any further 
information, or if you would like to meet with a relevant member or members of the team to discuss 
the Project.

POWER STATION PROJECT UPDATE – February 6th 2015 
I am writing to update you on Millbrook Power's proposal to construct and operate a gas-
fired power station on a site at Rookery South Pit together with an integral gas connection 
and electrical connection. 
As you know, Millbrook Power (MPL) undertook statutory public consultation regarding the 
Project last autumn (October/November).  Since then, MPL has considered the responses, 
carried out further technical and environment studies and refined its proposals in 
anticipation of submitting its application for a Development Consent Order for the Project 
before the end of March.  
We wanted to update you on how MPL has refined its proposals in response to the feedback 
received during the consultation process.   
One key area of feedback has related to the proposed Electrical Connection. As you may 
recall, the proposed Project includes the construction, operation and maintenance of a new 
electrical connection together with a new substation to connect the power generation plant 
to the existing overhead power line nearby.  
Our work over recent months, carried out in consultation with National Grid, had pointed us 
towards an electrical connection comprising two overhead lines and up to seven new 
transmission towers.  However after further consideration by the MPL team of various 
factors (including perceived impact, engineering issues and cost), and acknowledging the 
views expressed by local people, we have taken the decision to underground the connection 
as much as possible. 
This means that no new transmission towers for the Project will be built (one existing tower, 
which stands 46m high, will be replaced by one that is 48m).  In order for the underground 
cable connection to connect into the National Grid, there will be a need for either one or 
two “connection areas” known as Sealing End Compounds to be built adjacent to the 
existing transmission lines.  Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough councillors as well as 
local parish councillors have welcomed MPL’s decision to underground the necessary 
electrical connection. 
The location of the sub-station remains within Rookery South Pit, next to the generation 
plant.   
We have also made some other adjustments to the Project since the autumn consultation 
including the route of the underground of the gas pipeline connection and the Project’s 
boundary lines.  The height of the chimney stacks (up to five) has been reduced to no more 
than 35 metres high from the base of Rookery South Pit, which is approximately 15m deep.  
We have also finalised the routes that construction traffic would use to and from the site in 
order to avoid driving through residential areas and plans have been drawn up for how the 
Project will be landscaped and screened to minimise its visual impact. 
 
As mentioned previously, the submission under the Planning Act 2008 for the application for 
a Development Consent Order for the Project will be made by MPL before the end of March.  
Should the application be accepted by the Planning Inspectorate (a decision would be made 
within 28 days of the application being received by the Planning Inspectorate), then MPL 
would notify the local community, statutory consultees and relevant landowners of the 
acceptance of the application and invite those who are interested to register with the 
Planning Inspectorate in order to remain involved in the process of considering and 
examining the accepted application.  
 
Details of the application would also be published in hard copy in local authority offices and 
in various libraries in the area. The information would also be made available on the 
planning inspectorate’s website (http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/), and our 
website www.millbrookpower.co.uk  will carry information also.  
 
The Planning Inspectorate would then take up to six months to examine the accepted 
application for the Project (this process would include receiving representations from those 
who have registered an interest in the Project). Following completion of its examination, the 
Planning Inspectorate would then have three months to report to the Secretary of State, 
who would themselves have three months in which to make a decision on whether or not to 
grant consent for the Project.

Dear Sir/Madam  
 
 
Re: Millbrook Power Limited:  Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr. 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire, Development Consent Order (DCO) 
 
 
Peter Brett Associates act for Millbrook Power Limited (MPL). 
 
I write to update you on MPL’s proposal to construct and operate an up to 299MW gas-fired power 
station on a site at Rookery South Pit together with an integral gas connection and electrical 
connection (together "the Project"). 
 
This letter is to inform you that MPL is about to submit a DCO application for the Project to the 
Planning Inspectorate and to advise you of a slight amendment to the redline boundary for the 
Project that MPL consulted on in the statutory consultation period in October/November 2014. MPL 
would also like to inform you that it will be proposing some minor amendments to the Rookery 
South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 (“RRF DCO”). The amendments are proposed to 
enable both the Rookery South RRF and MPL’s Project to be constructed, should both proceed to 
the financing and construction stages. 
 
 
Amendment to MPL’s consultation redline boundary     
 
The amendment to the redline boundary is shown in Appendix 3.ZA to the Consultation Report (and 
enclosed for convenience), which form part of the DCO application (Document References 5.2 and 
5.1 respectively) and which will be made available to the public should the application be accepted 
for examination by the Planning Inspectorate. Following submission of the application, the 
acceptance decision will be made within 28 days. Following acceptance of the application, the local 
community, relevant landowners and statutory consultees will be notified under s56 of the Planning 
Act 2008 of acceptance and the notification will explain how third parties can engage with the 
Planning Inspectorate's examination of the application.

The amendment to the redline boundary of October/November 2014 has been made as a result of 
discussions with relevant landowners, is entirely within Rookery South Pit and has been proposed 
in order to provide some flexibility as to the exact location and route of the Access Road that forms 
part of the Project from the point at which it enters Rookery South Pit to the boundary for the 
Generating Equipment Site. This amendment does not affect any other parts of the Project (such as 
the location and indicative layout of the generating equipment and substation), nor the proposed 
routes for the gas connection and electrical connection.  The land within the amended area also 
forms part of the same land interests that were affected by the redline boundary that was consulted 
on in October/November 2014 and as such no additional landowners are affected by this 
amendment.  
 
 
Amendment to the Rookery South RRF DCO 
 
The proposed amendment to the Rookery South RRF DCO that MPL wishes to make is (pursuant 
to s120 of the Planning Act 2008) to include protective provisions for MPL’s benefit within that 
DCO. Protective Provisions are commonly used as a way of governing the way that two statutory 
undertakers (such as those holding electricity generation licences, which will be the case for both 
the Rookery South Resource Recovery Facility and the Project) will interact, to ensure that both 
organisations can deliver their statutory functions. In this case, the Rookery South RRF DCO 
includes a range of rights and powers over land on which MPL is proposing to construct the Project. 
In the same way as other statutory undertakers have protective provisions in the Rookery South 
RRF DCO which govern the way that certain powers and rights under that DCO will be exercised, 
MPL is proposing to insert wording that would govern the interaction between anyone exercising 
certain rights and powers in the Rookery South RRF DCO and MPL, within the proposed boundary 
for the Project.   
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me using the above details should you require any further 
information, or if you would like to meet with a relevant member or members of the MPL team to 
discuss the Project. 
 
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir/Madam  
 
 
Re: Millbrook Power Limited:  Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South 
Pit, Nr. Millbrook, Bedfordshire, Development Consent Order (DCO) 
 
Further to our letter/email of March 20th, with regard to the project, we will no longer be 
submitting our application this week.  
 
Directors of Watt Power Limited, MPL’s parent company, wish MPL to defer the submission 
of the application until the end of this year.  Given the significant amount of work that MPL 
has carried out to date, this decision was not taken lightly, but our directors are mindful of 
the evolving political environment and the market conditions for new power generation 
projects in this country. 
 
Millbrook Power will continue to engage with you and other consultees and have regard to 
any correspondence in the lead up to submission of its application which will be made at the 
end of this year. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further 
information, or if you would like to speak with a relevant member of the MPL team to discuss 
the Project.

Item 
Subject 
Actions 
1.  
Background/Introduction 
 
SH provided an overview of the project and introduced the applicant 
based upon the information set out in the PEIR document (both 
CBC and the IDB having confirmed receipt as part of the S42 
consultation).  It was noted that a DCO application was to be made 
towards the end of 2017. 
 
Explained that the project had been placed ‘on hold’ in early 2015, 
at which point both the FRA and ‘water’ ES chapter had been 
prepared.  The purpose of the meeting was therefore to: 
 
 
‘re-cap’ on matters; 
 
ensure that any ‘new’ information is identified and; 
 
reach agreement regarding the issues to be addressed and 
the scope of any work that may be required to revise and 
update the 2014 FRA and ES chapter. 
 
 
2.  
Roles/Responsibilities 
 
SH explained that PBA had re-consulted the Environment Agency 
(EA) and been advised that they had no comment to make in 
respect of flood risk and drainage and that they had deferred to the 
IDB and CBC as LLFA on such matters. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB was principally interested in the surface 
water pumping regime from Rookery Pit (to the Mill Brook 
watercourse bordering the western boundary of the Pit) and 
ensuring that any pumping continued in accordance with the terms 
of the existing consent to discharge (which permits pumping at a 
rate of 23l/s).  TS advised that, on the assumption that the pumping 
regime would be unchanged, the IDB would have no comment on 
the proposals. 
 
It was noted that the Mill Brook watercourse falls outside the IDB’s 
District and would be classified as an Ordinary Watercourse, under 
the jurisdiction of the LLFA (CBC). 
 
AB acknowledged that CBC would ‘lead’ on flood risk/drainage 
matters, but noted that it’s a ‘legacy’ project, such that she would 
need to consult the EA to ensure agreement/clarity regarding the 
scope of issues to address.

Page 2 of 6 
 
 
It was also noted that any works (permanent or temporary) to the 
watercourses bordering Rookery Pit would require consent.  
Consent applications are dealt with by the IDB on behalf of Central 
Beds Council. 
 
TS queried whether Bedfordshire Borough Council (BBC) should be 
consulted (noting that the north-eastern corner of Rookery South Pit 
falls within BBC’s area).  AB commented that, as the application site 
and the vast majority of the Pit fell within CBC’s area, CBC and the 
IDB would lead. 
 
3.  
Policy, Guidance and Evidence Base 
 
AB advised that CBC’s draft Local Plan, and the associated 
evidence base, had been published for public consultation. 
 
AB advised that the principal evidence base studies relevant to both 
the FRA and ‘water’ ES chapter are: 
 
 
Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (July 2017) 
 
Water Cycle Study (July 2017) 
 
AB also highlighted (i) CBC’s Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy (February 2014), (ii) the Tri-Lead Local Authority 
Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (June 2011), (iii) Central 
Bedfordshire Sustainable Drainage Supplementary Planning 
Document (adopted April 2014) and (iv) CBC’s Advice Note ‘Advice 
for the provision of surface water drainage systems for new 
developments (April 2015)’. 
 
 
4.  
Site and Project Description 
 
SH provided a description of The Rookery (north and south - former 
clay pits) and an overview of the principal components of the project 
by reference to the information, figures, etc, included within the May 
2017 Preliminary Environmental Information Report (provided on 
the Millbrook Power website:  http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/). 
 
It was noted that the generating plant will comprise only one 
generator unit (previously up to five), running for up to 2,250 hours 
per year. 
 
SH explained that the project constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project pursuant to the 2008 Planning Act and 
therefore requires development consent under that Act.  PBA has 
been appointed to prepare the Environmental Statement and 
associated Flood Risk Assessment in support of the application for 
a Development Consent Order (DCO). 
 
5.  
PEIR and Section 42 Consultation 
 
TS acknowledged receipt of the PEIR, but confirmed that the IDB 
had yet to respond.  TS to draft a response ASAP. 
 
AB acknowledged receipt of the PEIR (uploaded to CBC’s file 
sharing/hosting site by SH on 2nd June) but had yet to review the 
document and would consult colleagues re: whether a response 
had been drafted.

Post-meeting note:  AB advised via e-mail dated 4th July that CBC 
had responded to the consultation. 
 
SH highlighted that the PEIR document incorporates a copy of the 
FRA as drafted prior to the project being placed on hold in March 
2015 (the FRA comprising Appendix G of the PEIR).  SH explained 
that it would be helpful to receive CBC’s feedback/comment on the 
draft FRA prior to finalising the document for submission.  AB 
agreed to review and comment on the document.  AB to advise re: 
timeframe for completing the review. 
 
SH referred to the EA’s response to the Section 42 consultation, the 
Agency having commented that the site is located in Flood Zone 1 
(according to their Flood Map) and that the IDB and LLFA should be 
consulted for ‘drainage advice’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AB 
6.  
Low Level Restoration Scheme 
 
SH explained that The Rookery is the subject of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) and that, once restored, Rookery 
South (the location of the Millbrook Power project), would be 
approximately 15m below the surrounding ground level. 
 
SH explained that the principal works associated with the LLRS 
comprise: 
 
 
Re-profiling of the base of the pit to create a platform 
graded to fall to the north; 
 
Implementation of a surface water drainage system, 
comprising a balancing pond, network of interceptor 
channels and pumping station; 
 
Buttressing of the pit slopes; 
 
Provision of access ramps; 
 
Landscaping works/planting around the pit edge and 
balancing pond. 
 
It was noted and agreed that, as the LLRS is to be 
implemented/completed prior to any development within Rookery 
South Pit, the LLRS constitutes the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of 
the EIA and preparation of the FRA for the Millbrook Power project 
(this being consistent with the approach adopted for the Covanta 
project). 
 
AB queried provisions in respect of maintenance of the balancing 
pond, etc.  SH advised that responsibility for maintenance sat with 
O&H Properties Ltd. 
 
 
7.  
Surface Water Management 
 
SH explained that the LLRS drainage scheme comprises/operates 
as follows: 
 
 
Surface water collecting in the balancing pond will be 
pumped to (i) Rookery North at a rate of 100l/s and (ii) the 
Mill Brook at a rate of 23l/s (as per the terms of the existing 
Consent to Discharge); 
 
The water level in Rookery North will be drawn down by 
approximately 1m;

Page 4 of 6 
 
 
 
Water from Rookery North will return to the balancing pond 
in Rookery South via a gravity connection at a rate of no 
more than 23l/s. 
 
By using Rookery North as a strategic storm water storage 
facility, the balancing pond would return to its normal water 
level approximately 12 days after the 1 in 100 year plus 
climate change event. 
 
SH explained that, in respect of design parameters, the base and 
side-slopes of Rookery South Pit are assumed to be 100% 
impermeable and the sizing of the balancing pond has been 
undertaken using catchment-specific rainfall parameters derived 
from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). 
 
The balancing pond has been sized to accommodate rainfall events 
up to and including the 1 in 100 year event including climate change 
and comprises a retained water depth of 0.5m. 
 
As the LLRS design has been prepared assuming the Pit to be 
100% impermeable and the Millbrook Power project falls within the 
catchment of the Pit, it was agreed that the LLRS drainage strategy 
offers adequate capacity to accommodate surface water run-off 
from the Millbrook Power project, such that no additional mitigation 
would be required in respect of surface water run-off control. 
 
SH explained that design of the surface water drainage strategy 
caters for residual risk scenarios comprising (i) the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event and a period of pumping station failure 
(pumps off-line for 3 days) and (ii) a "follow-on" event - a 1 in 10 
year plus climate change event occurring within 1 week of the 1 in 
100 year plus climate change event.  The pond has been sized to 
provide sufficient residual capacity above that required for the 1 in 
100 year plus climate change event to accommodate both residual 
risk scenarios. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the design of the drainage strategy 
is robust. 
 
8.  
Flood Risk Associated with Mill Brook 
 
SH explained that a HEC-RAS hydraulic model of the Mill Brook and 
its tributary (running along the southern fringe of Rookery South Pit) 
had been developed as part of PBA’s previous work (to inform 
design of the LLRS (2008) and the FRA for the Covanta RRF 
scheme (2010)).  The analysis had shown that floodwater may ‘spill’ 
into Rookery South Pit from a localised area of the tributary, albeit 
at a relatively low rate (peak spill rate of approx. 0.2m3/s). 
 
SH explained that, as per the LLRS proposals, floodwater will be 
allowed to spill into the Pit as per the “existing” situation, but will be 
“managed” by being intercepted and conveyed to the attenuation 
pond.  SH confirmed that the surface water drainage channels and 
attenuation pond being brought forward as part of the LLRS had 
been designed to accommodate floodwater influx from the Mill 
Brook tributary. 
 
In addition, it was noted that the ‘raised’ platform created by the 
LLRS works will be such that the site of the Millbrook Power project

Page 5 of 6 
 
 
will be elevated above water levels within the balancing pond and 
associated drainage channels, etc. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the project site would be 
adequately safeguarded from flooding, such that no further 
mitigation works would be required as part of the project. 
 
SH explained that consideration of the 1,000 year event in 2010 had 
shown that floodwater may spill over the eastern bank of the Mill 
Brook immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the railway (in 
the vicinity of the north-west corner of the Covanta RRF site).  
Given the distance from the Millbrook Power site, coupled with the 
topography across the base of the Pit following implementation of 
the LLRS, it was agreed that mitigation measures would not need to 
be brought forward as part of the Millbrook Power project.  (It was 
also noted that measures had been incorporated within the design 
of the Covanta RRF scheme to cater for this floodwater spill). 
 
The requirement to divert the lower reach of the Mill Brook tributary 
(as part of the LLRS) was noted and SH advised that the diverted 
reach had been designed to convey 100 year plus climate change 
flood flows ‘in bank’.  TS and AB confirmed this is an adequate 
design standard. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB would deal with any consent applications 
for watercourse works on behalf of CBC. 
 
SH highlighted the fact that the hydraulic modelling analysis dates 
to 2010.  The EA has previously (2014) advised that the model 
provides the best available data in respect of flood risk associated 
with the Mill Brook, such that it should be taken forward and used to 
inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power Project. 
 
It was noted that the assessment of catchment hydrology (flood 
flows) was revisited in 2014 to establish whether estimates were 
higher/lower than those derived in 2010.  SH confirmed that the 
2014 analysis resulted in lower flood flow estimates than derived in 
2010 and, as agreed with the EA, the modelling analysis was not 
therefore updated. 
 
TS and AB advised that the hydrology assessment should be 
revisited.  TS and AB agreed that, where the updated, 2017 
analysis provides flow estimates that are less than or equal to the 
2010 estimates, it would not be necessary to revisit the hydraulic 
modelling analysis (i.e. the 2010 modelling data/output could be 
taken forward and used to inform the FRA). 
 
9.  
Climate Change 
 
It was noted that guidance regarding the allowances to be used for 
the purposes of preparing FRA’s had changed following the 
publication of EA guidance titled ‘Flood risk assessments: climate 
change allowances (February 2016)’. 
 
Whilst both TS and AB noted that the LLRS benefits from planning 
permission and acknowledged that the 2016 guidance would not 
need to be applied ‘retrospectively’, the FRA prepared for the 
Millbrook Power scheme should comply with the 2016 guidance.

Page 6 of 6 
 
 
It was noted that the current guidance requires that a rainfall 
intensity allowance of between 10% and 20% is adopted (based 
upon a project design life of c.25 years).  SH confirmed that the 
LLRS surface water drainage strategy had been designed using a 
30% increase in rainfall intensity and it was therefore agreed that 
the strategy was robust when reviewed within the context of the 
current climate change allowances guidance (i.e. such that the 
Millbrook Power Project would not need to bring forward additional 
mitigation for surface water run-off). 
 
In respect of peak river flow allowances, it was noted that the 
current guidance requires that an allowance of between 20% and 
35% is adopted.  SH confirmed that the modelling analysis 
undertaken in 2010 and the draft FRA prepared in 2014 assessed 
the implications of a 20% increase in flood flows within the Mill 
Brook and its tributary. 
 
TS and AB suggested that model sensitivity testing was undertaken 
to establish the impacts of a 35% increase in flood flows upon flood 
water influx to Rookery South Pit (i.e. whether the balancing pond 
offers adequate capacity to accommodate additional inflows). 
 
10.  
Water Framework Directive 
 
AB queried whether a Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
compliance assessment was being prepared in support of the DCO 
application. 
 
SH explained that this had not been identified as a requirement 
following EIA scoping and stakeholder consultation completed 
previously (2014). 
 
AB noted that the Mill Brook watercourse outfalls to Stewartby Lake, 
a WFD designated water body, and will therefore consult the EA to 
establish whether a WFD compliance assessment is required in this 
instance and, if so, the scope required.

AB suggested that a multi-disciplinary ‘follow-up’ meeting/workshop

Dear All
 
The statutory consultation period for the Millbrook Power scheme ended on July 2nd.  The
project team received a fair number of comments from local people and organisations,
and rest assured, the comments will be addressed in detail in the Environment Statement
(ES) that will accompany MPL’s application for a Development Consent Order.  The
application is still expected to be submitted later this year once the necessary
environmental and technical studies have been completed. We will notify you of the
application submission once it is made and will ensure that the local Parish Councils
receive a copy of the ES and other supporting application documents.

Subject: RE: Millbrook Power Station, Rookery South Pit, Millbrook, Bedfordshire  
 
Dear Steve, 
 
I am writing in response to your comments regarding Soils and Agricultural Land following the Section 42 Planning 
Act 2008 consultation with Natural England in relation to the proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, 
near Millbrook, Bedfordshire (your ref. 216544). I have outlined the response provided by my colleague, Chris Leach 
(cc’d), below, for your consideration. 
 
NE Comment: Detailed information on Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) Grade is not supplied in the 
PEIR. Natural England recommends it is necessary to undertake an agricultural land quality and soil 
resources survey of the site – particularly any areas of land that will not be re-instated or are likely to suffer 
permanent loss. 
 
As stated by Natural England, the majority of the Project is sited within brownfield land (Power Generation Plant, 
Substation, Laydown Area and Access Road). The Gas Pipeline part of the Gas Connection and the underground 
cable element of the Electrical Connection would both be buried in agricultural land. However, careful construction 
techniques such as topsoil stripping and storage, together with correct re-instatement would ensure that no 
agricultural land is sterilised. We therefore agree with Natural England, that there would be no impact from these 
elements of the Project on agricultural land or soil resources.  
 
The remaining elements of the Project sited on agricultural land include the Gas Connection AGI (approximately 
0.5ha) and the Electrical Connection Sealing End Compound (SEC) (0.36ha). Although these elements are sited on 
agricultural land, it is Grade 3 according to the Agricultural Land Classification and therefore not the best quality or 
most fertile land (Grades 1 and 2).  Although the areas have not been assessed as part of the post 1998 agricultural 
land assessment, land immediately to the east of the Access Road has, which further classifies this land as Grade 3b 
– “Land capable of producing moderate yields of a narrow range of crops, principally cereals and grass or lower 
yields of a wider range of crops or high yields of grass which can be grazed or harvested over most of the year”. 
 
Additionally, the area required for the SEC has already been taken out of agricultural tenancy and is no longer 
farmed. Finally, any effects on agricultural land would be temporary, for a period of 25 years, upon which the Project 
would be decommissioned and land used for the SEC and AGI re-instated to its former use. 
 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) would be produced prior to construction on site, along with 
method statements for construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. These documents would advise 
on the most appropriate working methods to protect agricultural land and soil quality. An outline of the CEMP will be 
included as an appendix to the ES to support the DCO Application which would be available for review by Natural 
England. 
 
Methods to protect soils and agricultural land outlined in the CEMP will include: 
• 
stockpiling of any excavated materials in discreet horizons, in reverse order of excavation to test whether any 
can be re-used on site and also to ensure that proper reinstatement can take place; 
• 
methods to prevent compaction of soils such as constructing access roads first and ensuring traffic only uses 
designated access routes; 
• 
ensuring any exposed soils are re-vegetated as soon as practical to prevent excess runoff or wind erosion 
and all agricultural land required temporarily during construction would be reinstated, with a five year 
aftercare plan to ensure land is returned to its former productivity.  
2
 
Taking all of the above into consideration, it is not anticipated that there would be a significant impact on soil 
resources or agricultural land as a result of the Project. 
 
 
Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with Chris, should you wish to discuss any aspect of this further.

Dear Steve, 
 
I am writing in response to your comments regarding protected species following the Section 42 Planning Act 2008 
consultation with Natural England in relation to the proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, near 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire (your ref. 216544). I have outlined our responses to each comment below, for your 
consideration. 
 
1.     NE Comment: We are concerned that if this fence is taken down before the DCO works commence then 
there is likelihood that GCNs may access the site. We require further information as to why it is 
considered that no further surveys for GCNs are required. 
 
Footprint of the proposed power generation plant 
 
GCNs will remain excluded from the footprint of the power generation plant during the interim period prior to the start 
of the DCO works by the retention and maintenance of GCN exclusion fencing (installed as part of the GCN 
translocation exercise completed in Rookery South Pit in 2014), and through completion of the LLRS in Rookery 
South Pit which will remove suitable habitat for this species. There are two legally binding routes by which this is 
assured: 
 
a.     Requirements of The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011: 
              i.        The Ecological Management Scheme (ref. 9019_R_APPR_11102016, BSG Oct 2016) which was 
submitted to Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council in relation to Requirement 40 of 
The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011, includes a commitment to amend licence 
2014-1762-EPS-MIT-1 such that GCN exclusion fencing will remain in place until the end of 2020 (for the 
duration of the construction of the RRF scheme); and 
 
b.     Land Option Agreement (LOA) between MPL (the Applicant) and the O&H (landowner of Rookery Pit, comprising 
the MPL Project Site): 
              i.        The LOA includes a clause that Rookery South Pit will be maintained ‘free of ecological constraints’ 
until construction of the MPL Project (currently anticipated to be 2020). In relation to great crested newts, 
it can be expected that this will comprise the retention and maintenance of the GCN exclusion fence 
[O&H are understood to be the Applicant for licence 2014-1762-EPS-MIT-1]; and  
             ii.        There is an additional clause in the LOA which ensures that certain elements of the LLRS will be 
completed prior to construction of the MPL Project, including the re-profiling of the base of Rookery South 
Pit involving the extraction of soils and clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side with 
re-grading of the base of the pit to an approximate level of 15mbgl. Through completion of the LLRS, 
before construction of the MPL Project, Rookery South Pit will comprise a level development platform, 
which will not support habitat suitable for great crested newts. 
 
Through the commitment under The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011, to amend licence 
2014-1762-EPS-MIT-1 in order to retain GCN exclusion fencing until 2020; it is assumed that GCN will remain absent 
from the footprint of the proposed power generation plant prior to the start of construction, and as such, no further 
GCN surveys in relation to works in this area of the project site, are considered to be necessary. Furthermore, if for 
any reason, there are delays in the construction programme for either the Covanta Scheme and/ or the MPL Project, 
there is assurance that GCN will remain excluded from the development footprint through relevant clauses in the 
LOA. 
 
Footprint of the access road, and the proposed gas and electrical connection 
2
 
As detailed in the PEIR, the likelihood of encountering GCN during the proposed re-surfacing of the access road, and 
the installation of the gas and electrical connections is considered to be low. However, any requirement to carry out 
the works under a precautionary method statement included within the CEMP or a derogation licence issued by 
Natural England, to ensure that no newts are harmed during the construction process, will be determined prior to 
construction. This will be based on the historical context of mitigation works associated with great crested newts in 
and adjacent to the Project Site.  
 
The PEIR also states that given that construction is due to commence six years after the 2014 great crested newt 
surveys were completed; updated surveys may be required to confirm the management and/or mitigation measures 
required which can be expected to be implemented through the CEMP. If necessary, any such surveys would be 
completed prior to construction. 
 
2.     NE Comment: Should the development involve a requirement for any protected species licences to be 
issued by Natural England it is important that the details are agreed with us at an early stage, to ensure 
that Letters of No Impediment can be issued with submission. 
 
This is noted. However, at this stage, there is not considered to be any requirement for protected species licences to 
be issued by Natural England. The reasoning for this is set out below: 
 
•         No bat roosts were identified within the Project Site which would be directly affected by the proposals. 
Appropriate management measures will be implemented to avoid potential disturbance through light spill etc.; 
•         The likelihood of encountering GCN during the proposed re-surfacing of the access road, and the installation of 
the gas and electrical connections is considered to be low. Using Natural England’s Rapid Risk Assessment tool, 
the likelihood of an offence being committed as a result of these works is considered to be ‘highly unlikely’; and 
•         No badger setts were identified within the Project Site during the surveys. 
 
Please don’t hesitate to get in touch should you wish to discuss any aspect of this further.

Millbrook Power Ltd. 
Meeting to Discuss MPL Project in context of Forest of Marston Vale (FoMV) 
Forest Centre, Marston Moretaine - 12:00 – 13:00 – 25/07/17   
 
Attendees  
Nick Webb (FoMV)

Nick Johnson (Stag Energy) 
David Ball (Drax) 
 
 
 
Note of Meeting 
The parties met to discuss; 
 
Progress made on MPL project since 2015 
 
Programme for MPL project through planning and into construction 
 
The aims of the FoMV and developer contributions to support those aims 
 
MPL’s intensions in terms of tree planting to support the aims of the FoMV 
 
NJ explained the changes that have been made to the project since 2015 particularly in terms of the 
reduction in the number of turbines used and resultant reduction is size of site and the refined 
electrical connection.  
NJ explained the programme over the coming months up to submission of the DCO application and 
beyond looking towards construction and operations. During examination, it is likely that MPL / the 
planning inspectorate may want to host hearings at the Forest Centre. This is likely to take place 
between February – July 2018.  
The amount of tree planting that is required by developers in order to meet the aims of the FoMV 
was discussed and, although the exact area of development will not be known until detailed design 
has been carried out, it is likely that the mitigation planting for the MPL project will cover those 
needs. MPL will keep FoMV updated as plans become further refined.  
 
Next steps  
 
 MPL to finalise mitigation planting strategy and indicative plant layout  
 
Assessment to be made regarding MPL’s obligation to meet the FoMVs tree planting 
objective.

Note of Meeting 
MH has recently joined CBC as a senior planning officer and will be taking over from Annabel on the 
MPL project later in 2017.  
AR was happy with the provisions in the draft heads of terms for a s106 agreement. AR questioned 
how CBC would recover costs incurred as a result of CBC administering the discharge of 
requirements – all agreed that this could be covered by an additional clause in the s106 agreement.  
The prospect of an additional community benefit fund was discussed and AR expressed the opinion 
that it may not be necessary or appropriate and that CBC would be unlikely to be interested in 
administering it. NJ and CM explained that there is a precedent for such funds on other similar 
projects and that it would not carry and planning weight through the examination or decision-
making process.  
 NJ explained that the EIA team are carrying out further modelling for the noise assessment. All 
agreed that the next step in progressing this matter is to arrange a call with the Alan Stone (EHO) on 
his return w/c 21st Aug. 
AR did not have any comments/questions on the proposed structure of the SoCG and NJ explained 
that this would be agreed following the acceptance of the project after submission of the 
application. NJ/CM also explained that during acceptance PINS would request a letter stating that 
the consultation was carried out in accordance with the agreed SoCC. 
All agreed that several of the tasks in the PPA have now been completed and an invoice can 
therefore be issued. NJ to provide invoicing details.

7. PPA 
 
Note of Meeting 
KH had a number of questions regarding the management of traffic at the Green Lane junction. KH 
also questioned why CBC were included in the draft HoT for an s106 agreement with respect to 
traffic management measures and why BBC were not included in that provision. NJ explained that 
the traffic management measures referred to in the s106 were in relation to the gas connection 
temporary construction access which is wholly within CBC.  KH has subsequently stated that she is 
satisfied with all aspects of the project which relate to traffic and transport. 
Two points raised in BBC’s s42 response were discussed. First, the issue of residents within BBC 
being impacted by noise from the plant. NJ explained that the nearest receptor is in CBC at approx. 
400 meters from the turbine and that the nearest receptors in BBC are in Stewartby at approx. 1.5 
km distance from the turbine – as such there is no anticipated effects at Stewartby. Second, BBC had 
suggested that there is a lack of viewpoints in the LVIA assessment from the north (Stewartby). NJ 
explained that viewpoints from the north had been considered but that there are no locations from 
which the plant can be seen owing to trees and vegetation in Rookery North Pit. NJ agreed to 
provide some evidence of this.       
AR and PL did not at this stage have any particular concerns regarding the heads of terms for a s106 
agreement. They stated that they would welcome a community benefit scheme to be put in place 
but stated that BBC was unlikely to want any part of administering it and all appreciated the point 
that it would carry no ‘planning weight’ throughout the examination/decision making process. 
AR and PL also had no comment at this stage on the prosed structure of the SoCG although all 
agreed that the vast majority of EIA topics would be for CBC to agree (or otherwise) rather than BBC 
and that BBC’s involvement generally during the examination would be minimal. The timing of the 
submission was discussed and NJ/CM agreed to keep BBC regularly updated on any involvement that 
will be required of them (for example the Adequacy of Consultation report / letter which will be 
required during the 28 day acceptance period).     
It was acknowledged that an number of the tasks in the PPA have been completed and therefore an 
invoice should be issued.

Dear Hayley, 
On the basis of the additional information you have provided in your email regarding the extent of 
land impacted, we do not propose to make any detailed comments in relation to agricultural land 
quality and soils, although more general guidance is available in Defra Construction Code of 
Practice for the Sustainable Use of Soils on Construction Sites, and we recommend that this is 
followed. 
 
If, however, you consider the proposal has significant implications for further loss of ‘best and 
most versatile’ agricultural land, we would be pleased to discuss the matter further. 
Please reply to consultations@naturalengland.org.uk if you wish to comment on our advice.

Dear Hayley, 
We understand from your email of 28 July that the GCN exclusion fencing will be retained and 
maintained regarding the footprint of the power generation plant during the interim period prior to 
the start of the DCO works. On the basis that 2014-1762-EPS-MIT-1 licence modification is 
deemed acceptable, and that the fence is maintained until construction of the MPL Project, we 
acknowledge that the proposed area will remain inaccessible to GCN and therefore further survey 
work should not be required.  
 
Regarding the access road, and the proposed gas and electrical connection, we acknowledge that 
updated GCN surveys may be required – given that construction is envisaged to commence in 
2020, six years after the previous GCN surveys were completed.  The survey results should 
inform any mitigation measures that would be implemented through the Construction 
Environmental Management Plan.

Attn: Will Fletcher, Inspector of Ancient Monuments 
 
 
Dear Mr Fletcher, 
 
RE: MILLBROOK POWER LIMITED: PROPOSED GAS FIRED POWER PLANT AT ROOKERY 
SOUTH PIT, NR. MILLBROOK, BEDFORDSHIRE 
 
Thank you for your response to the Millbrook Power consultation undertaken under Section 42 of 
the Planning Act 2008 on the proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery Pit South. The 
consultation was undertaken between 29th May 2017 and 2nd July 2017; the response received 
from Historic England is dated 22nd June 2017. 
 
MPL has considered the matters raised in Historic England’s response and write to provide 
clarification on some of those matters. We would be pleased to discuss further at a meeting with 
you in early September, prior to submission and once our final assessment has been completed. 
 
Visual Material 
 
MPL notes the comments made with regards to the availability of visual material. The Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) (PBA, May 2017) was accompanied by the 
photomontages produced in 2017 (using 2017 photography) showing the new indicative proposed 
development layout i.e. one stack only. MPL considers the quality to be appropriate for the purpose 
of providing a visual representation of the viewpoints.  
 
The photomontages were produced in line with Landscape Institute Advice Note 01/11 
‘Photography and Photomontage in Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment’ and Technical 
Guidance note 02/17 ‘Visual Representation of Development Proposals’.   
 
An electronic copy of the photomontages at a higher resolution are however enclosed with this 
letter to provide HE with clearer images. 
  
It is considered that the information to be provided as part of the DCO application and the ES will 
be sufficient for consultees to be able to understand the indicative appearance of the proposed 
development, and to aid the reading and understanding of the environmental impact assessment. 
 
MPL notes the comments made in relation to the photomontage viewpoints in relation to specific 
heritage assets and provides comments on these as follows:

• 
Houghton House – the importance and prominence of the house are acknowledged and it is 
considered that Viewpoint 4 provides a sufficient view to assess effects on Houghton House 
• 
Marston Moretaine Church – A Zone of Theoretical (ZTV) visibility has been created and 
used to guide initial selection of representative viewpoints for the preliminary landscape and 
visual impact assessment, as described in paragraphs 11.5.5 – 11.5.6 in Chapter 11 of the 
PEIR. Marston Moretaine Church is outside of the ZTV which therefore suggests that there 
is no scope for intervisibility and effects on the church. Nevertheless, Viewpoint 8 is taken 
from the eastern edge of Marston Moretaine, representing a worst case view from the rear 
of the church. This viewpoint (and the subsequent analysis of such presented in the 
assessment of visual effects table in Appendix 11.1 of the PEIR) shows that there is no 
indivisibility between the church and the project site due to intervening topography and 
vegetation;  
• 
Ampthill Park House – the view from Ampthill Park House is recognised and acknowledged 
in the preliminary assessment; Viewpoint 7 is taken from the Public Right of Way at the front 
of the house and is considered to provide a sufficient view. The subsequent analysis of this 
viewpoint presented in the assessment of visual effects table presented in Appendix 11.1 of 
the PEIR which shows that there would only be medium distance glimpsed views of the 
upper parts of the stack;  
• 
Millbrook Church – Also outside of the ZTV and the church is screened by existing well 
established vegetation so intervisibility with it is limited, no effects on the church are 
anticipated 
 
It should be noted that, whilst the photomontages have been used by the technical specialist to aid 
the undertaking of the preliminary Historic Environment assessment; as stated in the PEIR at 
paragraph 13.5.9 that ‘all designated assets within the study areas and also within the ZTV were 
visited in order to assess both the building/archaeological site/structure and also their setting’. 
 
We welcome further discussion with regards to the above historic assets ahead of submission of 
the ES and DCO application. 
 
 
Methodology for the assessment of the Historic Environment 
 
MPL notes the comments made in relation to methodology for the assessment of impacts on the 
Historic Environment in Chapter 13 of the PEIR. 
 
MPL notes the comments with regards to the sensitivity matrix set out in Table 4.1, and the 
category of sensitivity under which some of the heritage sites under assessment should fall. MPL 
would like to clarify that the purpose of the matrices set out in Chapter 4 of the PEIR are to provide 
an exemplar set of matrices, and to demonstrate the approach taken to assigning significance to 
any identified potential environmental effects i.e. by categorising receptor sensitivity, and 
magnitude of change, and then considering sensitivity and magnitude of change together to 
determine the significance of an effect. As described “it is noted that for some environmental topics, 
significance criteria may need to differ depending on the topic assessment and conditions 
encountered at the Project Site. Each topic chapter of the ES clearly identifies and explains the 
specific criteria used”. It is therefore Table 13.2 in Chapter 13 of the PEIR which should be referred 
to for the categories of sensitivity that have been used in the preliminary assessment of historic 
assets. Table 13.2 sets out that many of the historic sites under assessment have been categorised 
as of high sensitivity, and MPL can confirm that the preliminary assessment of the Historic 
Environment has been undertaken using that (Table 13.2) sensitivity matrix. 
 
As acknowledged in HEs response, paragraph 13.5.9 of the PEIR states that “each designated 
asset was viewed from the closest possible publicly accessible location from within/beside the 
asset where direct public access was possible”, however that “this did not lead to any limitations to 
the assessment of the designated assets or their setting”, as a full assessment of the significance 
 
3 
and setting of the assets (including how setting contributes to the significance of the assets) was 
possible on this basis. This is therefore considered to be a reasonable approach, and the views 
were sufficient for undertaking a robust assessment of the assets. 
 
With regards to the comment in relation to the contribution that setting makes to significance not 
being dependent on the grade of the designated asset, MPL can confirm that the assessment in the 
final ES will based upon the asset specific factors and not on their grading alone. 
 
 
Assessment of the Historic Environment 
 
MPL notes the comment made with regards to the preliminary assessment of the Historic 
Environment as set out in Chapter 13 of the PEIR. 
 
For clarity, the Sealing End Compounds (SECs) are part of the Electrical Connection as described 
in Section 3.4 of Chapter 3 of the PEIR, and will be located towards the southern extent of the 
‘Electrical Connection Site’ area shown in Figure 1.2 ‘Project Site’ of the PEIR. There are two 
options considered for the layout of the Electrical Connection as described in Section 1.1 of 
Chapter 1 of the PEIR; Option 1 would require 2 SECs and Option 2 would require only 1 larger 
SEC. Indicative plans are shown in Figures 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) of the PEIR; for either option the 
maximum height of the SEC(s) would be 17m. The SEC(s) will not be located within the pit itself. 
The preliminary assessment of Landscape and Visual effects and Historic Environment effects has 
been undertaken on this basis of the project description set out in Chapter 3 of the PEIR.  
 
Further design iteration and discussion with National Grid has revealed that Option 2 (requiring only 
one SEC) would be the preferred development option. Therefore, this option would be taken 
forward for assessment in the ES.   
 
Whilst not explicitly set out within the preliminary assessments, the potential cumulative impact of 
the SEC(s) and the stack have therefore inherently been considered through the assessment. 
 
MPL notes the comments made with regards to assessment of effects on significance and can 
confirm that the preliminary assessment will be developed to ensure that the final assessment is 
based on the asset specific factors and not on their grading alone. Effects on heritage assets have 
been considered in relation to the NPPF, and effects will be set out in relation to the relevant policy 
provided by the NPPF within the final ES. 
 
Archaeology 
 
MPL notes the comments made with regards to archaeological matters, CBC has, in its s42 
consultation response, confirmed agreement to the approach of mitigating any impacts on 
archaeology through a programme of archaeological investigation to be secured as a Requirement 
of the DCO, and undertaken prior to commencement. The application will include a draft DCO (the 
MPL draft Order) setting out each of the proposed requirements. 
 
Next Steps 
 
MPL would welcome further discussion on the above matters as the assessment for the final ES is 
developed. 
 
We hope that this information is useful and can aid further discussion with regards to the proposals.

Hi Janec, 
 
Further to our brief conversation, I am happy with the proposals for the additional monitoring.  Will some of this be 
attended?  As this may offer a broader understanding of the noise environment. 
 
In relation to my suggested LOAEL and SOAEL levels, I can provide justification for these but need to go and look at 
the previously submitted report to compare and contextualise my comments which would have delayed my 
response.  Perhaps this is something we can discuss in a meeting following the survey and modelling as per your 
suggestion. 
 
If you have any further queries then please feel free to contact me.

Good Afternoon,  
 
Thank you for your recent comments relating to the noise and vibration chapter of the PEIR submitted for the 
Millbrook Power Project.  
  
We note that with respect to operational noise from the facility you have proposed a LOAEL of 0 dB above 
background and a SOAEL of 10 dB above background. Please can you confirm the justification behind the selection 
of 0dB as the LOAEL?  
  
We have reviewed the background sound levels measured during the previous surveys and propose to undertake 
additional monitoring at a single location as highlighted on the attached. As previously agreed with you in 2014, the 
location is considered to be representative of the worst affected receptor and it is considered that control of noise 
levels at this location would be sufficient to control noise levels at other, more distant locations. Surveys would be 
undertaken over a 1 week period, would capture daytime and night time noise and levels and would be undertaken 
outside of the school holidays. 
 
We’d be grateful if you could respond to the above and confirm acceptance of the proposed survey methodology by 
return.  
  
We would of course be happy to discuss further with you if you feel appropriate. 
 
Once we have further developed our noise model and undertaken the additional monitoring we would look to organise 
a meeting to discuss the results and agree on a way forward prior to submission of the application in October.  
  
Please let us know if you have any comments.

Note of Meeting 
 
Millbrook update 
Aiming to finalise planning application mid Oct then there will be an examination until July 2018.  It will then take a 
further 6 months for a decision to be reached giving consent at the end 2018.  This will allow Millbrook to enter the 
capacity auction end 2019 with construction commencing 2020.  The target operational date is 2022. 
Covanta update 
Covanta are aiming for credit approval end Sept 2017.  The environmental permit is in final consultation and they 
hope that it will be issued in November 2017.  It will be at this point that Covanta will exercise their option with 
O&H. 
LLRS works 
Covanta are due to complete phase 1 of the LLRS mid October 2017.  O&H still await the remaining legal documents 
from Covanta in relation to the appointment and warranties for the contractor and contract administrator.   
Action; Covanta to issue legal documents ASAP. 
Main works 
There are currently some overlaps between the documentation (red line plans, etc) in the Covanta and Millbrook 
agreements.  There is also a number of gaps in the draft transfer documents appended to the option agreements.   
Action; It was agreed that Covanta and Millbrook would review the documentation based on the latest information 
and coordinate a set of documents so the option agreements can be updated.  This is especially relevant with 
Covanta who are looking to complete the transfer in November 2017. 
 The following part of the meeting was not attended by O&H 
Amendments to the Rookery South Order 
Covanta expressed concern over the proposed amendments (insertion of Protective Provisions) to their DCO and 
suggested that the control that MPL require could be achieved through a private agreement. There was general 
agreement over what the overlap issues are and the control that MPL reasonably need, but the mechanism to give 
the control was not agreed. Next step – Pinsent Masons to draft a position statement setting out the situation which 
can be signed by both parties prior to MPL’s DCO submission.

I have been through the technical information submitted and there are a number of initial aspects that I would like 
to raise: 
 
• 
The terminology used and therefore the conclusions drawn have not at any point been quantified in terms 
of NPPF terminology.  
For example the conclusion on degree of harm to the setting of the two kilns and four chimneys at Stewartby 
Brickworks (Grade II listed) is ‘slight adverse impact’. This should be equated in terms of substantial and less than 
substantial harm (including potential harm within each range e.g. minor, moderate and high less than substantial 
harm) to allow conclusions to be weighed against the NPPF.  
 
• 
Owing to the identified  Zone of Theoretical Visibility, the significance and any contribution which setting 
makes to significance of Stewartby Conservation Area and the two Grade II listed buildings (see below) have 
not been assessed:  
Sir Malcom Stewart Trust Homes, seven lamp standards and wrought-iron railings, listed in 2016, list no.: 1432692 
Sir Malcom Stewart Trust Common Room, Stewartby, listed 2016, list no.: 1433440. 
Given that they are within the 2km study area, it is advised that an assessment of significance of these heritage 
assets is required. Whilst the ZTV can help indicate which heritage assets there will be potential greater visual 
impact to/from, this does not take into account the full contribution that setting can make to significance as 
identified in Historic England’s Good Practice Advice Planning Note 3 (The setting of heritage assets)where views are 
not the only considerations. The Preliminary Environmental Information Report (2017) section 13.6.10 states that 
Stewartby is outside the ZTV 1.4km away to the north east at the nearest point. ‘It has no inter-visibility with the 
project and is separated in the direction of the Power Generation Plant by Rookery North Pit and is located too far 
away from the Power Generation Plant for the non-visual aspects of its setting to be impacted upon [….]These two 
assets [Wootton and Stewartby Conservation Areas] have not been assessed as there will be no potential for 
impacts or effects on their settings. Without further consideration of what is significant and any contribution to 
setting of Stewartby, it is not clear how this conclusion can be reached. As such it is advised that an assessment of 
the Conservation Area and listed buildings identified above is required. 
 
• 
It is also note that the 12m width of stack proposed does not appear to have been taken into account in 
considering the impact of views on the Stewartby chimneys, the height appears to be the main 
consideration. ‘The industrial and functional nature of the chimneys and stacks are essentially the same as is 
their architectural form. They are inherently compatible with each other’ (LB13, table 1 ‘scheduled 
monuments and listed buildings’, Appendix K). This is not fully agreed with as the stack (note assessment 
references stacks) will be 12m wide and the Stewartby chimneys are 3.3 to 4.1m wide. Architecturally and 
taking into account their profile, although both stacks, Millbrook stack would be different owing to its 
proportions. It is not clear that this has been considered in assessment; a wider, albeit shorter stack, could 
have a different impact resulting from the differing widths.  No reference has been made in the assessment 
of the impact of other taller structures proposed for example transmission tower 49m high and temporary 
tower or mast 55m high. Only stacks and gas and electrical connections referenced with ‘no effects on the 
setting of the house’ being the conclusion. With reference to conclusions on Gas and electrical connections 
a house is referenced not the chimneys/kiln.  
 
• 
Both in appendix c – legislation and policy and the PEIR no reference to existing local plan policies relating to 
heritage is made, for example BE11 and BE21. Also core strategy policies CP23 and CP21 are also not 
consistently referred to in both these legislation sections.

Hannah Stevens

Dear Chris cc. Rob 
Many thanks for taking the trouble to ensure we received your letter and additional images.  
 
Having reviewed the letter, we continue to be of the opinion that additional viewpoints are needed from 
Houghton House that show a more representative viewpoint and one that would properly illustrate the 
potential impact of the development. We would also like to discuss viewpoint 7 from Ampthill Park. We are 
unable to locate this image at present and therefore not able to comment on it further at this stage. We also 
note Robs comment son Millbrook church. 
 
I note that you suggested a meeting to discuss the LVIA and the ES and having discussed the case with my 
colleague we agree this would be a sensible way forward. I would therefore be happy to facilitate a meeting 
here at Brooklands if you able to provide some dates for later in the month. Please be aware however that 
this is likely to be considered pre-application advice within the term of our EAS charging structure (see 
HistoricEngland.org.uk/EAS) and we would need prior agreement on the terms and scope of the meeting.

Good Morning,  
 
Since our last discussion regarding the Millbrook Power Project, we have undertaken additional environmental sound 
monitoring at the closest noise sensitive receptor. With the results of the additional survey and more detailed data 
regarding potential noise sources we have further developed our noise model to undertaken additional assessments 
of the potential noise impact. 
 
Please find attached the Technical Note that sets out our most recent survey results along with the most recent 
project proposals and the additional assessments undertaken.  
 
We trust the attached to be clear however we would be pleased to discuss any queries you may have. 
 
Thank you for your time.
