Approach to Air Quality Dispersion Modelling
Appendix 6.1 Approach to Air Quality Dispersion 
Modelling  
The following methodology was agreed as part of the consultation process as agreed 
with City and County of Swansea (CCS). 
Table 6-1: Agreed Approach to the Air Quality Assessment  
Point of Consultation 
Agreed Approach 
Stack Modelling 
Model to be used: 
ADMS 5 
Pollutants 
to 
be 
considered: 
Nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide 
Meteorological Data 
5 years data (2012-2016) for Cwm Level Park Data 
(provided by CCS) with missing data/cloud cover 
supplemented with Mumbles Head Data for the same time 
period. 
Terrain Data  
Included in the model based maximum resolution (64x64) 
allowed within ADMS5 and covering an area applicable to 
each modelling grid 
Modelling Grid 
200 m (20 km x 20 km centred on the stack) – used for 
contour plots and ecological impact assessment. 
30 m (3 km x 3 km centred on the stack) – used for Stack 
Height Determination 
Indicative Receptors  
Ecological Designations (modelled at a height of 1.5 m):  
- Ramsar, SAC and SPA sites within 10 km 
- SSSI, SINC, Ancient Woodland, NNR and LNRs 
designated within 2 km 
 
Human Receptors (modelled at a height of 1.5 m)  - 
specific receptor locations representing the closest 
sensitive receptors to the Project Site, i.e.: 
- Abergelli Farm; 
- Morriston; 
- Pant-lasau; 
- Llwyncelyn; 
- Llangyfelach; and 
- Receptors representative of the eastern boundary of 
areas 11 and 5 on the LDP Concept Plan 
Background Air Quality 
Human Health - Based on Mapped Defra grid square for 
each modelled receptor. 
Contour Plots - No background will be applied for contour 
plots which will just show contributions from the Project 
Point of Consultation 
Agreed Approach 
Ecology - Background for ecological receptors will be 
based on APIS background estimates  
NOx to NO2 conversion 
Use Environment Agency values of 70% conversion of 
NOx to NO2 for annual concentrations and 35% for hourly 
concentrations. 
Assessment 
of 
Significance 
Environment Agency Screening levels i.e. if less than 1% 
of AQS objective for Long-term and 10% for short-term 
then can be screened out as not significant. 
Roads Modelling 
Is assessment required? Screen need to assess road contributions based on the 
based on the IAQM Land-Use Planning & Development 
Control Planning For Air Quality Jan 2017 (v1.2) Table 6.2
If 
traffic 
contributions 
cannot be screened out 
based 
on 
the 
IAQM 
guidance’s then: 
Model Using ADMS Roads at specific receptors close to 
the roads that exceed the IAQM screening level at a 
height of 1.5 m.  
Use Defra mapped background data 
Stack contribution will be added to this to assess in 
combination effects. 
NOx to NO2 conversion based on Defra conversion tool. 
Assess significance based on the IAQM guidance’s 
criteria
