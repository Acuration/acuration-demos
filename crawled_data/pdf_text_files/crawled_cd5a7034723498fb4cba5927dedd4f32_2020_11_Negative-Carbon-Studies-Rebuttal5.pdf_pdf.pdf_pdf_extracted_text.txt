1.  Colnes, A., et al., Biomass Supply and Carbon Accounting for Southeastern Forests, The 
Biomass Energy Resource Center, Forest Guild, and Spatial Informatics Group, February 
2012
Synopsis: This report includes a literature review aimed at evaluating total supply of and 
demand for wood biomass for energy harvested from the US South. Authors also modeled 
assessments of wood bioenergy’s effect on atmospheric carbon levels in comparison to fossil 
fuels.  
Conclusions/Findings: The authors conclude that carbon debt periods for woody feedstocks 
used for energy range from 35-50 years, depending on the assumed energy pathway.
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Does not include market effects or supply/demand market responses.
o
Time Scale: 

The focus on near-term carbon debt does not give appropriate weight to the 
displacement of fossil fuels, which contribute permanent GHG additions to the 
atmosphere, and the relative effect of near-term vs. long-term emissions on global 
temperature rise.
o
Assumptions: 

Incorrectly assumes wood not used for bioenergy would remain in the forest 
untouched.

Does not acknowledge a likely counterfactual fate that demand for other forest 
products would enter a basin in order to take advantage of attractive fiber supply 
and prices.
o
Technology Efficiency: 

Pathways modeled in this analysis do not include wood pellet fuels (only less 
efficient wood chips).  Dedicated biomass power end use efficiencies range from 
38-40%.
Summary:  This study incorrectly focuses on near-term carbon debt scenarios, rather than long-
term carbon emissions.  The scientific community has agreed that long-term carbon emissions 
into the atmosphere are the cause of global temperature shifts and climate change, whereas the 
science on short-term carbon debts is inconclusive.  Additionally, this study incorrectly assumes 
that all wood not used for bioenergy would remain in the forest untouched and does not take into 
account that wood fiber for bioenergy comes from sustainable working forests that are harvested 
for a variety of forest products and managed for higher-value industries such as sawtimber.

2.    Mitchell, S., Harmon, M., and O'Connell, K., Carbon Debt and Carbon Sequestration 
Parity in Forest Bioenergy Production, GCB Bioenergy, May, 2012.
Synopsis: The authors discuss modeled concepts of forest carbon sequestration dynamics over 
time in order to compare the carbon debt repayment point and the carbon sequestration parity 
point. The carbon debt repayment point is the time required for woody biomass used for energy 
to become carbon beneficial in comparison to the initial level of forest carbon storage, while the 
carbon sequestration parity point is the time required for woody bioenergy feedstocks to become 
carbon beneficial in comparison to a counterfactual scenario in which the forest would have not 
been harvested, continuing to grow into perpetuity. 
Conclusions/Findings: The authors conclude that wood bioenergy is an inefficient use of forests 
because, in the absence of increased harvests due to bioenergy demand, the forest would 
continue growing and sequestering carbon. They propose that the carbon offset parity point 
should be used to assess the emissions benefits of wood bioenergy.
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Models a managed forest in which increased harvesting is incorrectly assumed to 
lead to a decrease in carbon storage. Forests in the US South are not managed on 
set rotations, and increases in demand have a land use change response which 
increases planting, forest inventories, and landscape carbon storage.
o
Assumptions:

Compares the bioenergy scenario to a unlikely counterfactual in which forests 
continue to grow in perpetuity, incorrectly assuming that forests are managed 
strictly for the production of bioenergy feedstocks. 

Does not acknowledge that forests become less efficient at sequestering carbon as 
trees reach a certain threshold and continue to age.
Summary:  The study incorrectly assumes that forests are harvested and managed for bioenergy, 
when the reality is that wood fiber for bioenergy comes from sustainable working forests that are 
harvested for a variety of forest products and managed for higher-value industries such as 
sawtimber.  The study also ignores the market response from increased demand – an increase in 
planting to supply this demand, which leads to increased forest inventory and higher carbon
stocks.

warming payback time as climate indicators of forest biomass use. Mitigation and Adaptation 
Strategies for Global Change 17(4): 369-386.
Synopsis: The authors present a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology for estimating the 
global warming impact of wood bioenergy in comparison to fossil fuel energy sources and the 
use of biomass in harvested wood products, using the forests of Southern Finland as an example.
Conclusions/Findings:  The authors found that the global warming payback time increases with 
the diameter of the wood used for bioenergy, and that wood use in construction materials is 
preferable to use in bioenergy pathways.
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Does not include market effects or supply/demand market responses.

Authors model forest harvesting in Finland’s boreal forest, which are ecologically 
very different from forests in the US South.
o
Assumptions: 

Compares bioenergy use scenarios to alternate fates in which the same feedstock 
is used in the manufacturing of solid wood products, which is unlikely to occur.
Summary:  This study assesses boreal forests from Finland, which have differing species, 
growth rates, and biodiversity than working forests in the US South.  Furthermore, this study 
does not consider that different forest products are of different value.  High-value wood fiber is 
sold into markets like sawtimber and is much too expensive for a lower-value industry like 
bioenergy.

bioenergy from additional harvest of forest biomass is neither sustainable nor greenhouse gas 
neutral. GCB Bioenergy: 4(6): 611-616
Synopsis: The authors use a static forest model to assess the effect of using forest biomass to 
produce 20% of the world’s energy supply.
Conclusions/Findings:  The authors conclude that increasing the use of wood feedstocks to 20% 
of global energy supply would have a net negative effect because it would result in younger 
forests, reduced biomass pools, depleted soil nutrients, and the loss of vital ecosystem functions.
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Does not include market effects or supply/demand market responses, assuming a 
permanent reduction in carbon stock as a result of increased bioenergy demand.
o
Spatial Scale: 

The carbon assessment is made at the stand-level, rather than at the landscape 
level.  Working forests in the US South are in a constant rotation of harvest and 
various stages of regrowth, making a landscape level assessment more accurate.
o
Time Scale: 

Argues that the upfront emissions due to reduction in forest carbon stocks from to 
increased harvest levels mean that atmospheric carbon is increased for decades. 
Market effects and spatial scale errors aside, this statement does not give 
appropriate weight to the displacement of fossil fuels, which contribute permanent 
GHG additions to the atmosphere, and the relative effect of near-term versus
long-term emissions on global temperature rise.
o
Assumptions: 

Assumes forests would be left to grow in perpetuity in the absence of bioenergy 
demand, incorrectly assuming that forests are managed strictly for the production 
of bioenergy feedstocks.
Summary: This study incorrectly focuses on near-term carbon debt scenarios, rather than long-
term carbon emissions.  The scientific community has agreed that long-term carbon emissions 
into the atmosphere are the cause of global temperature shifts and climate change, whereas the 
science on short-term carbon debts is inconclusive.   Additionally, this study incorrectly assumes 
that all wood not used for bioenergy would remain in the forest untouched and does not take into 
account that wood fiber for bioenergy comes from sustainable working forests that are harvested 
for a variety of forest products and managed for higher-value industries such as sawtimber.

6.  Walker, T., et al., Biomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study, The Manomet Center for 
Conservation Sciences, June 2010.
Synopsis: Manomet and its partners released the results of a study conducted for the Massachusetts 
Department of Energy Resources to better understand the implications of using wood for energy in 
Massachusetts.
Conclusions/Findings:  These studies analyze Massachusetts’ forests to determine biomass impacts on 
forest growth and carbon and find negative impacts on carbon stocks and forest inventory resulting from 
the use of biomass for energy. 
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Ignores that Massachusetts’ forests have differing characteristics and markets than 
southern forests.  

Fails to recognize that the value of sawtimber is too high for forest landowners to sell 
sawtimber into a low-paying market, like bioenergy.  For example: For forest owners to 
switch markets and sell sawtimber into bioenergy markets, as Hagan suggests, would take 
a catastrophic failure of housing markets, worse than the 2008 collapse, and a 
simultaneous extreme increase in fossil fuel and natural gas prices to occur.

Ignores the impact of healthy markets and demands on incentivizing landowners to 
replant following a harvest.
o
Spatial Scale: 

The carbon assessment is made at the stand-level, rather than at the landscape level.  
Working forests in the US South are in a constant rotation of harvest and various stages 
of regrowth, making a landscape level assessment more accurate.
o
Time Scale: 

Ignores the full carbon life cycle, including carbon already present in the forest. 

Fails to acknowledge that the use of bioenergy for electricity, even in the absence of heat 
capture, reduces the emissions of burning fossil fuels for electricity.
o
Assumptions: 

Incorrectly claims forests will grow in perpetuity in the absence of bioenergy demand.

Incorrectly infers forests are managed strictly for the production of bioenergy feedstocks.
Summary:  This study ignores the basic market forces at play in the forest products industry, namely that 
forests are managed and harvested for the high-paying sawtimber industry.  This, together with additional 
misconceptions regarding the biogenic carbon cycle lead to incorrect assumptions about the impact of 
bioenergy on forest resources and carbon stocks.
Additional Notes: The Pinchot Institute for Conservation, a non-partisan conservation research 
institution and a research participant in this study, held a subsequent media advisory following their report 
in which their President Al Sample made the following remarks in response to erroneous conclusions 
drawn by the media upon release of this study:

The rapidly spreading assertion that biomass is dirtier than coal “couldn’t be further from the 
truth”.

“It was a gross simplification that resulted in the misinterpretation of the study’s overall 
conclusions.”

Scenarios for Assessing the Greenhouse Gas Impacts and Energy Input Requirements of 
Using North American Woody Biomass for Electricity Generation in the UK, UK Department 
of Energy and Climate Change, July 2014.
Synopsis:  In 2014, researchers at the former UK Department of Energy and Climate Change 
released a report which analyzes multiple scenarios within the forest industry in the southeastern 
US and the impact of these scenarios on assessing the carbon intensity of using woody biomass 
for electricity.
Conclusions/Findings:  Through a series of assumptions and counterfactual modeling, this 
report draws a variety of conclusions based upon differing scenarios, some showing low carbon 
and some showing high carbon from using woody biomass for energy production. 
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Does not include market effects or supply/demand market responses.

This study does not analyze the likelihood of any suggested scenarios actually 
occurring in the southeastern US forest market.
o
Assumptions: 

This report employs the use of scenarios and counterfactuals that are not realistic 
to forest markets in the US South including:

Incorrect assumption that sawtimber-quality wood is used for bioenergy
with forests managed and harvested solely for bioenergy production.

Incorrect calculation of average harvesting rates in the US.  For example, 
the report quotes 70+ years for hardwood harvest rotations, when US 
Forest Service data shows an average of 50-55 years.

Incorrect assumption that low-value bioenergy markets would strongly 
influence landowner harvesting and management decisions.
Summary:  This study ignores the basic market forces at play in the forest products industry, 
namely that forests are managed and harvested for the high-paying sawtimber industry and not 
for bioenergy.  Additionally, the scenarios introduced in this study are extremely unrealistic and 
unlikely to occur at all in the forest market in the US South.
Additional Notes: In 2015, the former UK Department of Energy and Climate Change 
commissioned a second study to analyze the likelihood of the scenarios in this 2014 study 
occurring due to increased bioenergy demand.  This follow up study was released in 2017 and
concluded that only 5 of the 38 scenarios were even moderately likely to occur, and none of them 
would occur “as a result of pellet demand alone, because financial return is not adequate and 
sustainability requirements would not allow this change”.

8.  Repo, A., et al., Sustainability of Forest Bioenergy in Europe: Land-use-related Carbon Dioxide 
Emissions of Forest Harvest Residues, GCB Bioenergy, March 2014.
Synopsis: The paper looks at how changes in carbon stored in soil and litter, due to increased biomass 
use, affect the intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The geographic scope is Europe.
Conclusions/Findings: The authors quantified forest residuals and litter available in different European 
countries that could be used for biomass power generation, compatible with sustainable forestry.  They 
compared emissions from power generation (of heat or electricity), with CO2 emissions and soil 
sequestration of carbon that would have occurred if those residuals had been left in the forest.  The 
comparisons are made at discrete points in the future from 2020 to 2095.  They find that bioenergy 
production from these feedstocks is worse than fossil fuel in the short term and would need to continue 
for 60 to 80 years to achieve a 60% CO2 emission reduction compared to fossil fuels.   
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Does not include market effects or supply/demand market responses.

Does not consider the economic capacity to improve forest management due to the 
additional market being available.  

Does not consider to what extent forests stay as forests because of an additional market 
being available for forest owners.
o
Assumptions:  

Analysis does not include possible effects of changes in forest management or species 
composition.  

Does not consider the difference in decay rates and soil structures between the US South 
and Northern Europe.    The analysis is focused on European forests, so is not useful for 
understanding the dynamics of forests in US South, particularly concerning decay rates of 
harvest residue, which are faster in warmer climates.

Compares emissions of CO2 from generating electricity/heat with forest residuals to the 
counterfactual of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel.  The correct counterfactual would be 
fossil fuel emissions PLUS emissions from decaying forest residuals that could have been 
used for power generation.

Levels of available biomass in this study were derived without consideration of local 
market conditions.  
o
Technology Efficiency: 

Pathways modeled in this analysis assumed conversion efficiency to be just 25%, 
whereas in modern dedicated power stations using wood pellets see a conversion 
efficiency of 38-40%.  The study therefore significantly overstates CO2 emissions from 
the use of biomass in electricity generation.
Summary:  This study is not relevant to forestry in the US, as it does not address the market forces in the 
US forest products market or the biological aspects of forests and soils in the US South.

9.  Ter-Mikaelian, M., et al., Carbon Debt Repayment or Carbon Sequestration Parity? Lessons from 
a Forest Bioenergy Case Study in Ontario, Canada, GCB Bioenergy, May 2014.
Synopsis: The paper assesses changes in CO2 emissions at Atikokan Generating Station in Ontario, 
Canada, making comparisons if coal is substituted by pellets made from forest residues, or by pellets 
made from stemwood from additional harvesting.
Conclusions/Findings: The study discusses two metrics, time to carbon “sequestration parity” and time 
to “carbon debt repayment”.  It found that for the residue scenario, sequestration parity was achieved in 
one year.  In the stemwood scenario, times to carbon sequestration parity and carbon debt repayment were 
91 and 112 years respectively; this scenario requires the regenerating forest to sequester carbon to offset 
extra emissions from combustion of biomass. Modelling found increasing growth rates for stemwood 
substantially reduce time to carbon sequestration parity.
Deficiencies:
o
Market Effects: 

Does not include market effects or supply/demand market responses.

Does not consider whether additional markets can help keep forests as forests, rather than 
converting to another land-use.  This is a reality in the US South where private ownership 
is prevalent.

Does not consider the capacity for investment in better forest management provided by 
the opportunity to sell otherwise un-merchantable material.
o
Assumptions:  

Considers forests in northern Ontario, with maximum annual increments of just 1.5m3 to 
4.5m3 per ha per year.  In the US South, growth rates can be 6 to 10 times faster than 
those in the study, resulting in different outcomes for cumulative greenhouse gas 
emissions and carbon sequestration calculations.  The study itself acknowledges that 
“yield curves had the largest effect on total cumulative GHG emissions and times to 
carbon sequestration parity.”  

Makes unrealistic assumptions about the biomass harvesting process, theorizing a 
completely separate, non-existent biomass harvest that only uses the stemwood 
component of the harvest. 

Incorrectly assumes all wood for bioenergy is diverted from current use in other wood 
markets 

Does not consider the potential for oversupply or surplus of fiber, such as the one 
currently ongoing in the US South.

Incorrectly assumes that forest growth, successional change, and natural disturbance 
remain constant which is not accurate in the US South.

Incorrectly assumes extra felling of forest stands specifically for pellets.  This is highly 
unlikely to occur as there will more valuable products in a stand. 

Does not consider the positive contributes that advances in plantation forestry practices 
can make for soil conditions and forest productivity.
o
Technology Efficiency:

The model assumed 1.52 or 1.736 MWh/tonne of pellets.  Modern biomass generators 
achieve close to 2MWh/tonne of pellets.
Summary:  The unrealistic assumptions, slow growth rates, and modest efficiency make this study very 
limited in its applicability.
