Strategy Update and
Biomass Opportunities
Will Gardiner, CEO
19 November 2019
Introduction
Drax has a clear purpose: to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future
Drax has a clear strategy
– To be the leading provider of power system stability
– To give our customers control of their energy
– To build a long-term future for sustainable biomass
Over the last four years, Drax has successfully transformed and significantly increased profitability
The next step in our journey to deliver our purpose and strategy
– Increase biomass self-supply to five million tonnes and reduce the cost to c.£50/MWh

The Imperative for Decarbonisation is Increasing
The UK decision was taken following:
–
Visit to Parliament by teenage activist Greta Thunberg (April 2019)
–
Extinction Rebellion protests (April 2019)
–
Committee on Climate Change (CCC) report on net zero (May 2019)
–
David Attenborough’s Climate Change: The Facts (May 2019)
–
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (August 2019)
The transition to net zero informs our Purpose
UK is the first country to legislate to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (July 2019)
19 November 2019
UK Parliament 
declares climate 
change emergency
The UK has officially 
declared a climate 
‘emergency’

UK Net Zero Carbon Emissions
Power
– Wind, solar, biomass, gas and ultimately hydrogen
Transport
– Electrification, limited biofuel for HGVs
Buildings 
– Insulation, hybrid heat pumps
Industry and aviation
– Carbon capture and carbon negative generation, such as BECCS,  
required to support sectors where abatement is difficult
A challenging but clear route to net zero by 2050
19 November 2019
Committee on Climate Change Report  
(May 2019)
“We have assumed overall bio resource available to 
the UK of around 200 TWh… 
…This is equivalent to around 10% of UK primary 
energy consumption in 2050. Of this, 173 TWh goes 
into BECCS in 2050, providing 51 MtCO2 of 
removals.” 
“Deployment of sustainable bioenergy with CCS 
(BECCS) will need to start sufficiently early (e.g. by 
2030) to build up to a potentially large contribution 
from BECCS in the longer term.”

The Future UK Generation Mix
Biomass has a long-term role to play
Pumped storage and hydro has a long-term role to play
Future gas generation – convert to hydrogen and gas with CCS
Increase in intermittent renewables, retirement of current thermal fleet and increased electricity demand

Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage
A low-cost Negative Emissions Technology “NETS”
19 November 2019
Drax will capture CO2 from biomass 
and pump that into a pipeline along 
the Humber out to storage under the 
North Sea for long-term storage
Drax is also exploring the potential to 
create hydrogen from CO2
Progressing workstreams to make this a reality by late 2020s
– Technology options
– Government policy
– Biomass cost reduction

systems growing use intermittent renewable energy
We will give all our customers control of their 
energy
–
Through insight and digitisation we will provide control over energy 
use and access to markets to optimise use, source and cost
We will build a long-term future for sustainable 
biomass
–

2016/17 included additional ‘Income Adjustment Event Black Start’ 
costs of £117m thereby increasing overall BSUoS costs
BSUoS cost includes a range of system support services
–
Frequency response, reactive power, voltage control, inertia, 
blackstart, constraint management, headroom and footroom,
