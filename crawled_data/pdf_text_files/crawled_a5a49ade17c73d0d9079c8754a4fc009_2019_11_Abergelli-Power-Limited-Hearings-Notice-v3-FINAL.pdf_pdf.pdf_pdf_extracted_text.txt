Notification of Hearings under Rule 13(6) of the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010 and Section 91 of 
the Planning Act 2008 
 
Notice of Hearings relating to the Application for a Development Consent Order for the Abergelli Gas Fired Generating 
Station Order 
 
Planning Inspectorate reference: EN010069 
 
 
1. 
Notice is hereby given that hearings will be held, at the date, time and location set out below, by the Examining Authority 
(appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”)) for the examination 
of the application made by Abergelli Power Limited (“APL”) of Drax Power Station, Drax, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH 
for a Development Consent Order (“DCO”) for the Abergelli Gas Fired Generating Station (the “Application”). The Application 
was made under Section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 on 25th May 2018 and accepted for examination by the Secretary of 
State on Thursday 21st June 2018. The reference number applied by the Planning Inspectorate, on behalf of the Secretary 
of State, to the Application is EN010069. 
 
Summary of the Project 
 
2. 
APL proposes to construct and operate an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (“OCGT”) peaking power generating station (the "Power 
Generation Plant") of up to 299 Megawatts (“MW”) and new connections to the gas and electricity networks on land at 
Abergelli Farm, Swansea, Wales (the “Project”).  The Application seeks consent for the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Power Generation Plant (the “authorised development”). In addition, the Application seeks to authorise 
the acquisition of land and rights over land, and the extinguishment or suspension of, or interference with, interests in or 
rights over land in order to facilitate the construction and operation of the Project. 
 
3. 
The Power Generation Plant would comprise the following elements: 
 
▪ 
Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant 
(BOP) (together referred to as the “Generating Equipment”) which are located within the “Generating Equipment 
Site”; 
▪ 
An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies to the west, formed by upgrading an existing access 
road between the B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation (the “Substation”) and constructing a new 
section of access road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; 
▪ 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking and temporary fencing (the “Laydown Area”). A small 
area within the Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the “Maintenance Compound”); 
▪ 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement within the Project Site Boundary; and 
▪ 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and surface water drainage system. 
 
4. 
The authorised development comprises an onshore electricity generating station in Wales with a capacity of over 50 MW 
and therefore it constitutes a nationally significant infrastructure project ("NSIP") under section 15(2) of the Planning Act 
2008.  Accordingly, it requires development consent under section 31 of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
5. 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development associated with the NSIP (“Associated 
Development”). However, as the Project is a generating station in Wales below 350 MW, development consent cannot be 
granted for Associated Development pursuant to section 115 of the Planning Act 2008.  Accordingly, APL will apply for 
planning permission for consent to develop the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.  
 
6. 
The Generating Equipment, Laydown Area, Access Road, Maintenance Compound, Ecological Mitigation Area and 
permanent parking and drainage are together known as the “Power Generation Plant”. The Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with all access requirements are referred to as the “Project”.   
 
7. 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of 
the Project, is referred to as the “Project Site”. The Project Site is approximately 35 ha in area. 
 
8. 
The DCO will, if granted, authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of the authorised development and would, 
amongst other things, make provision for the following: 
 
a) 
The compulsory acquisition by APL of land and rights over land including the power to create new rights and impose 
restrictive covenants over land, required for the Project and the power to take possession of and use land temporarily 
for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining the Project; 
b) 
The suspension or extinguishment of private rights or restrictive covenants over land required for the construction, 
operation and maintenance of the Project; 
c) 
Tree and hedge removal within the Project Site as required; 
d) 
Landscaping and ecological mitigation works; 
e) 
The temporary stopping up or management of the public highway and public rights of way and street works as described 
in the Application; 
f) 
Alterations to the public highway network and the construction of temporary and permanent accesses to the Project as 
described in the Application; and 
g) 
The application and/or disapplication of relevant legislation as may be required.
