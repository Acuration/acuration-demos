Year-on-year change in British electricity demand
1.  Headlines
There was little to celebrate in 2020, but at least clean energy offered a source 
of good news. In a major milestone, more of Britain’s electricity came from 
renewable energy sources than from fossil fuels over the last year. Renewable 
generation increased by a sixth on 2019, to supply over 100 TWh of clean electricity. 
Carbon emissions from electricity generation were also down a sixth.
2020 was a record-breaking year for the power system, in many ways because of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Lockdowns reduced activity, so electricity demand fell by 6%, 
the largest ever recorded in the national grid’s 100 year history. Fossil fuels took the 
brunt of this fall, and their generation fell below 100 TWh for the first time since 1960.
Suppressed demand contributed to electricity prices falling to their lowest in  
15 years. The increased share of renewables also meant they were more volatile, 
which means the relative value of technologies is changing. Fossil-fuelled power 
stations earned 25% more per unit of output than wind and solar farms over 2020, 
highlighting the premium that flexible and controllable technologies can command.
Wind power was a big winner, shattering several records in 2020. In December 
wind output hit an instantaneous peak of over 17.4 GW, and across the whole 
year it produced a quarter of Britain’s electricity. While output was up, so also 
was the amount of curtailment – wind energy that had to be dumped because of 
constraints on the transmission network. Curtailment doubled in 2020, at a cost 
of over quarter of a billion pounds.
Christmas Day was very different for many of us. Restrictions on movement meant 
people had to stay home rather than seeing family, and more people cooking 
individual dinners helped to push peak demand to its highest level for a Christmas 
Day since 2010. There were no lumps of coal from Santa Claus though, as it was 
the first ever coal-free December 25th since the electricity age began in the 1880s. 
Boxing Day then saw a slew of clean-energy records, with over half of the day’s 
electricity coming from wind power, and 80% from all low-carbon sources.

2.  Renewables overtake fossil fuels
Ten years ago, fossil fuels provided three quarters of Britain’s electricity, some  
20 times more than renewables. In 2020 their roles reversed, and renewables overtook 
fossil fuels for the first time to become Britain’s biggest source of electricity over the 
whole year. Together wind, solar, hydro and biomass provided 104 TWh of electricity,  
or 39% of Britain's consumption.
The pace of change has been dramatic. 
Renewable output has increased ten-fold 
since 2010, while fossil-fuelled output has 
fallen 60%. In 2020, supply from coal, gas 
and oil fell to below 100 TWh for the first 
time since 1960.
Meanwhile, 2020 saw the fastest year-
on-year rise in electricity generation from 
renewables, boosted by growth in the 
offshore wind fleet and ‘good weather’ for 
energy generation (sunny and windy). With 
demand falling due to COVID, the share  
of renewables in the grid mix rose by  
5 percentage points, mirroring the 6 point 
fall from fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels were overtaken by low-carbon electricity 
sources in Britain (nuclear plus renewables) back in 
2017. The milestone of renewables alone outperforming 
fossil fuels was bound to happen at some point, but it 
likely arrived 1–2 years early because of the coronavirus 
pandemic. Over the last decade demand has fallen by 1–2% 
each year. With the 5.5% drop seen in 2020, around 15 TWh 
of demand was ‘missing’ because of lockdowns. That is 
like the whole of Wales going without power for the year.1 
With only 4 TWh separating the output of renewables from 
fossil, this reduced activity made all the difference.
The first time that renewables supplied more electricity 
than fossil fuels over a single day was back in the summer 
of 2015. Last year, this was the case for over 200 days – 
well over half of the year. The fact this number has almost 
doubled since 2019 highlights the pace of change. If 
this pace were to continue, we could naively expect that 
unabated fossil fuels will be all but eliminated by 2030. 
This would be no small challenge, as the power system 
must work equally well when it is sunny and windy as 
it does on a cold and still winter’s day – or even several 
of them in a row. But if the last decade has taught us 
anything, it is that the realms of what is possible are 
expanding every day.

3.  2020 in review
2020 was certainly an anomalous year for the energy sector; but many changes seen in 
the power system simply reflect and amplify existing trends and give us a glimpse of its 
near future. The UK faced its largest drop in GDP for three centuries, a sign of how hard 
retail, hospitality and tourism were hit by lockdowns. Shuttered businesses stopped 
consuming electricity, and many service sector jobs went virtual as people worked from 
home, so office blocks also dropped off the system. All this contributed to a historic fall 
in demand, the largest ever recorded.
This is part of a long-term trend, as electricity demand has 
fallen 18% since 2010. Demand will likely bounce back in 
2021 if the economy recovers, but the broader decline is 
expected to continue for a while. However, new sources 
of demand (electric vehicles and heat pumps) will start to 
outweigh efficiency savings, increasing total demand from 
around 2024 onwards, putting an end to a 15-year decline. 
Fast forward to the 2030s and demand is expected to surge 
ahead as wider uptake of electrification kicks in.
Lower demand contributed to a 16% fall in absolute emissions 
from electricity generation between 2019 and 2020. The bulk 
of this improvement came from changes in the generation mix 
though. The carbon intensity of power generation emissions 
fell by 11% in 2020, meaning Britain maintained its world-leading 
pace for cleaning up its power sector. Emissions intensity has 
fallen 63% since 2010; however, this is just the beginning. To 
keep pace with the UK’s Carbon Budgets, carbon intensity must 
fall by 74% over the next decade, and 84% the decade after.
Wind and solar power continued their upward trend. Their 
combined share of generation grew by 5 percentage points 
in 2020, from 22 to 27%. Their share has grown 9-fold since 
2010, and this pace needs to continue for much of the 
coming decade. The CCC put the share of electricity from 
wind and solar at 50% by 2025 and 69% by 2030. After then 
it will plateau, settling out around 75–85% in the 2030s.
Hitting the Climate Change Committee’s targets will require 
wind and solar to be complemented by a range of other 
technologies. This will include low-carbon sources – nuclear, 
hydrogen and plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
– and even negative-carbon biomass with CCS.
2020 saw Britain edge closer to the power system of 
the future. The next steps we must take will be more 
challenging than those taken so far, as driving out the 
last sources of carbon will require us to go beyond just 
more wind and solar power. New business models, backed 
by policy and investment, will be needed to bring new 
technologies into the mainstream, enabling low- or even 
negative-carbon flexible power.

4.  Record wind output and curtailment
1 
This curtailed energy could have powered around 1.25 million homes (assuming the UK average of 3,000 kWh per year), or around 3 million people. The population of Wales is estimated at around 3.2 million. 
Annual curtailment of wind energy in Britain 
over the last decade…
Britain’s wind farms hit an all-time high in 2020. They supplied more than a quarter of 
the country’s electricity demand over the year, but that also meant more of their potential 
output had to be discarded due to network congestion. Curtailment almost doubled from 
2019, at a cost of over a quarter of a billion pounds.
Over the year as a whole, wind farms supplied 69 TWh of electricity, but this could have 
been much more. 6% of Britain’s wind output had to be curtailed – or wasted – because 
it couldn’t be transported to consumers on the electricity network. 3.8 TWh of electricity 
was lost to curtailment over the year, enough to power every home in Wales.1
Between 2015 and 2019, curtailment costs rose in line with 
wind output from £90 to £145 million per year. This cost 
doubled in 2020 though, as National Grid ESO faced a bill 
of £282 million – around £10 per household. Put another 
way, curtailment costs added £4 to each MWh of wind 
energy generated. While this pushes up the whole-system 
cost of generation, wind is still likely to give lower bills 
than a system dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear, as its 
construction costs have come down so far.
Much of Britain’s onshore wind is in the central belt of 
Scotland, and there is often congestion on the lines which 
carry this down to other demand centres in England and 
Wales. We last reported on constraints in 2018 when 
a new transmission line (the Western HVDC link) came 
online, adding more capacity between Scotland and the 
rest of Britain. That link was offline for much of January 
and February, giving rise to high curtailment (more than 
6% of the wind generated) in those months. Ofgem is now 
investigating the link over its performance.
Wind curtailment was also high during the summer months 
as demand was depressed during lockdown. Rates went 
back down during Quarter 3 as lockdown restrictions eased 
and demand rose, but then in November curtailment rose to 
a new peak with more than 11% of wind energy lost. National 
Grid’s service to deliver more operational flexibility came to 
an end, and the Western Link suffered more outages. 
Ultimately, some level of curtailment should be accepted as 
part of the most cost-effective way to deal with wind over-
production. The cost of new transmission lines and storage 
is still relatively high, so in the short-term it is cheaper to 
continue paying wind farms to shut down than to invest in 
more technical fix. Eliminating all curtailment would involve 
massive infrastructure investments, but it is natural to want 
to make the most of the renewable resources we have. 
New innovations such as smart-charging electric vehicles 
or flexible production of hydrogen could eventually help to 
ease the situation.

As Britain moves towards more renewable power, the value of having control over the 
timing of output is coming into sharp relief. During 2020, fossil fuelled power stations 
earned 25% more than wind and solar farms per unit of output, and this gap has 
quadrupled in the last two years.
During 2020, the average power price was £36/MWh, its lowest in over a decade as fuel 
prices fell and lockdowns suppressed demand. But not all technologies earn this average, 
as power prices vary from hour to hour and so does their output.
Nuclear reactors aim to run at full power throughout the year (except for outages), and so 
they consistently earn close to the average price. While biomass stations do run flexibly 
when required, they tend to operate year-round with high utilisation, and so also earn 
close to the average.
During the first half of the 2010s coal was also a baseload fuel, operating around the 
clock. Coal power stations earned near enough the annual average price each year, just 
as nuclear and biomass do today. From 2016 onwards, coal became restricted to the 
winter months, then to winter daytimes, then to only selected few days when the system 
was especially tight.
As coal increasingly became a peak-only fuel, the relative earnings have risen to 20% 
above average prices (a premium of £7/MWh). Although gas still supplies the largest share 
of Britain’s electricity, it appears to be moving in the same direction. In 2020, gas power 
stations earned almost 10% (£3.50/MWh) above the average market price.
Because wind and solar farms have no fuel costs, they generate whenever possible.  
When their output is high they can push down power prices, and even send them negative 
when output has to be curtailed. At the start of the decade, solar farms earned above the 
average price, as they operate during daylight hours when prices were higher. Now sunny 
afternoons often see negative prices as solar output is so high (e.g. last Easter), and 
average power prices throughout the summer are now £10–15 lower than they were ten 
years ago. Averaged over the whole of 2020, solar energy earned 18% (£6/MWh) less than 
the average price, and wind farms now earn 12% (£4/MWh) less than average.

Coal and solar represent two extremes and the difference in their output timings can  
be seen in the chart below. One-sixth of solar energy was produced at times when 
power prices were below £20/MWh, and one-sixth when they were above £40/MWh.  
In contrast, coal power stations produced eight times more electricity when prices were 
above £40/MWh than when they were below £20/MWh. Power prices were negative 
during 2% of hours in 2020. Virtually no coal stations operated during these negative 
price periods (0.1% of their yearly output), versus 3% of output from solar farms.
None of this means that coal power stations are suddenly a great investment or that solar 
farms are a bad one. The higher prices that coal earns coincide with rapidly shrinking 
market share. Although average power prices are pushed down by growing shares of 
renewables, dispatchable and flexible generators may continue to earn a reasonable 
rate. Weather-driven renewables may suffer further as their shares grow, so the business 
case for integrated renewables with storage projects may strengthen. Any projects that 
improve flexibility, including pumped hydro, interconnection, battery storage or vehicle-
to-grid will all help to rebalance prices.

6.  Capacity and production statistics
Demand for electricity last quarter was 4% lower than the year before, as the 
winter was slightly milder and the second national lockdown kept demand 
suppressed. This pushed fossil fuel output down by 12% compared to Q4 in 2019. 
The capacity factor for gas stations remained below 50% for the seventh quarter 
running. Across 2020, the capacity factor of gas stations fell below 40%. Coal 
output fell by more than half compared to this time last year. Coal supplied the 
smallest share of electricity from any technology for the third quarter in a row.
The moratorium on new onshore wind farms has firmly taken root, nine months after 
it was reversed. The installed capacity of onshore wind stood still for the whole 
of 2020 at 13.6 GW.1 The ban on government support for onshore wind was put in 
place back in 2015 by the Cameron government. While it was repealed in March last 
year, the pipeline of new projects will take time to deliver completed wind farms.

BEIS reported no new capacity added through 2020, while RenewableUK reported 90 MW added (0.09 GW). We take the average of both sources, which is < 0.1 GW.

Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of waste-to-energy plants.  
These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

7.  Power system records
2020 was yet another year of extremes, with the power system moving further 
into new territory. Just as in 2019, all clean electricity sources broke their previous 
annual production records. Wind, solar and biomass reached all-time highs in 
2020, while nuclear fell to its lowest output in over a decade. 2020 also saw the 
lowest electricity production from coal and fossil fuels, the lowest demand, lowest 
price and lowest carbon emissions in over a decade.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2020) and report the record 
output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages over a day, a

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants. 
The operation of battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not publicly available.
