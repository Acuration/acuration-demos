Water Quality and Resources 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
This chapter provides an assessment of the likely significant effects on water 
quality, water resources and flood risk arising from construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. 
9.1.2 
A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in 
this chapter is provided at the start of this PEIR.  This chapter is supported by the 
assessment demonstrated in Appendix 9.1: Flood Consequence Assessment 
(FCA), and a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Screening Assessment provided in 
Appendix 9.2. Both the FCA and WFD Screening Assessment should be read 
alongside this chapter. Assessments of likely significant effects on hydrogeology 
are presented in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology.  
a) Objectives of the assessment 
9.1.3 
The objectives of the assessment were to: 
 Assess the activities to be carried out and their associated potential impacts 
likely to arise throughout the different phases of the Project which pose a risk to 
all water environmental receptors within the Project Site and surroundings; 
 To provide any additional mitigation as required to prevent, reduce and offset 
any significant adverse effects to water quality and resources likely to be 
affected by the Project;  
 Detail the residual effects after implementation of the mitigation; 
 Detail cumulative effects of the Project and nearby projects. 
 To ensure the Project complies with all local, national and international 
regulatory and legislative requirements. 
 To address the issues and concerns raised in the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 
4.2) by the SoS in relation to Water Quality and Resources following an initial 
consultation in 2014. 
9.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
9.2.1 
There have been changes to the Project design as a result of design evolution and 
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the 
reader, Table 9-1 below outlines the changes to this assessment compared with the 
2014 PEIR.

9.3.2 
Legislation and policy has been considered on an international, national, regional 
and local level. The following is considered to be relevant to the water quality, water 
resources and flood risk assessment as it has influenced the sensitivity of receptors 
and requirements for mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). 
a) International 
i. 
Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) (European Union, 2000) 
9.3.3 
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) together with its two daughter 
directives, being the Groundwater Directive (GWD) (2006/118/EC) and the Priority 
Substances Directive (2008/105/EC), and the EC Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) 
set out by the European Union are key international legislations that affect the 
Project within the context of water quality and resources. These directives together 
provide consensus measures on which surface water and groundwater bodies are 
protected. 
9.3.4 
The WFD also establishes a legal framework to protect and restore clean water 
status (i.e. “good” in terms of ecological and chemical quality and water quantity, as 
appropriate) across Europe and to ensure its long-term, sustainable use. The WFD 
(Directive 2000/60/EC) is a significant piece of EU water legislation, with the 
overarching objective of enabling all water bodies in Europe to attain ‘Good’ or 
‘High’ ecological status by 2015.   
9.3.5 
The WFD directive establishes an innovative approach for water management 
based on river basins, the natural geographical and hydrological units and sets 
specific deadlines for Member States to protect aquatic ecosystems. The Directive 
addresses inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and 
groundwater. It establishes several principles for water management, including 
public participation in planning and the integration of economic approaches, 
including the recovery of the cost of water services. 
9.3.6 
The WFD is implemented in England and Wales by “The Water Environment (Water 
Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017”. The Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW) is the competent authority in Wales responsible for 
delivering the objectives of the WFD. River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) 
specifically set out measures to ensure that water bodies in Wales achieve ‘Good’ 
ecological status. 
b) National 
9.3.7 
The national legislations relevant to the Project in terms of water quality and water 
resources are summarised below: 
i. 
The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales)  
Regulations 2017 
9.3.8 
The Water Framework Directive requires that Member States continue to provide 
shellfish water protected areas with at least the same protection as under the 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-6 
 
repealed Shellfish Waters Directive. The Water Environment (Water Framework 
Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 were laid before the National 
Assembly for Wales on 16 March 2017. The regulations came into force from 10 
April 2017. 
9.3.9 
The Regulations ensure that objectives are set for improving or protecting the water 
quality of shellfish waters and that these are monitored. Information about these 
areas must also be included in the river basin management plans. 
9.3.10 The content of the list of shellfish water protected areas in Wales has not changed 
since 2013. 
ii. Flood and Water Management Act 2010 
9.3.11 The Act designates CCS as the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA), with the 
responsibility to lead and co-ordinate local flood risk management in the area. It 
also requires a Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) Approving Body (SAB) 
to be established within the LLFA. This responsibility to promote, approve and 
adopt sustainable drainage systems in new and re-developments can be delegated 
but the legal responsibility for drainage remains with CCS as the LLFA. SAB must 
approve drainage systems for the new and re-developed site in their area before 
construction can begin. The proposed drainage system must also meet National 
Standards for Sustainable Drainage (Ref. 9-7).  
iii. Flood Risk Regulations 2009 
9.3.12 The Flood Risk Regulations require NRW and LLFA to produce a Preliminary Flood 
Risk Assessment, Flood Hazard Maps, Flood Risk Maps and Flood Risk 
Management Plans for any areas at significant risk.  
iv. Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 
9.3.13 The Permitting regulations require operators to obtain permits for some facilities 
regarding water resources.  The permits are granted by NRW, who control 
permitting water discharge and groundwater activities.  The 2016 update requires 
permits to be obtained for flood risk activities, including work on or near a main river 
and in a flood plain. 
v. Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ) 
9.3.14 The Act requires public bodies to undertake their duties and decision making in a 
sustainable way to help secure Wales’ long term well-being, so that it benefits from 
a prosperous economy, a healthy and resilient environment and vibrant, cohesive 
communities.  The Act includes the requirement for decision making to take 
account of long term implications, such as climate change.  
vi. Environment (Wales) Act 2016 
9.3.15 The Act aims to enable Wales’ natural resources to be managed in a more 
proactive, sustainable and joined up way and to help tackle climate change.

c) National Policy 
i. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN – 1) 
9.3.16 According to the policy, an assessment of the existing baseline conditions 
regarding water quality, water resources and physical characteristics of the water 
environment is required where a proposed project is likely to have effects on the 
water environment. 
9.3.17 The NPS EN – 1 also sets the requirement for additional pollution control measures 
that must be considered for all activities that discharge to the water environment 
and recommends that the SoS gives increased weight in its decision making to 
impacts on the water environment that would have an adverse effect on the 
achievement of the objectives of the WFD. 
ii. National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (NPS EN – 4)  
9.3.18 The NPS EN-4 Part 2 Section 2.22.2 recognises that “constructing pipelines 
creates corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect 
watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone to 
flooding and ecological receptors. Pipeline impacts could include inadequate or 
excessive drainage, interference with groundwater flow pathways, mobilisation of 
contaminants already in the ground, the introduction of new pollutants, flooding, 
disturbance to water ecology, pollution due to silt from construction / demolition and 
disturbance to species and their habitats”. 
9.3.19 The NPS EN-4 states that where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality, an assessment of the impacts should be provided in line 
with Section 5.15 of EN-1. The SoS should be satisfied that the impacts on water 
quality and resources are acceptable in accordance with Section 5.15 of EN-1. 
iii. National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS EN-5)  
9.3.20 NPS EN-5 requires consideration of adaption to climate change particularly from 
the increased risk of flooding to the resilience of some of the sites infrastructure 
and should be covered in the FCA.  
iv. Planning Policy Wales (Welsh Government, 2016) 
9.3.21 This is supplemented by TAN15 and incorporates sustainable development into the 
planning system which can be adhered to.  It requires every local planning authority 
to have produced a Local Development Plan (LDP) superseding the Unitary 
Development Plan (UDP). 
v. TAN15: Development and Flood Risk (Welsh Government, 2004)  
9.3.22 Technical Advice Note 15 (TAN15) provides the framework for guiding planning 
decisions to assess and manage flood risk impacts for new developments.  The 
aim is to, for preference, direct new developments away from high risk of flooding 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

AECOM 
 
9-8 
 
areas.  If using a high risk area is unavoidable, the development must be justified 
on sustainability grounds and that the consequences of the flooding are acceptable.  
9.3.23 The development advice maps (DAM) are the information considered most suitable 
to determine flood risk zones and when flood risk issues must be taken into 
consideration in planning future development in that area.  
vi. Recommended non-statutory standards for sustainable drainage (SuDS) in 
Wales (Welsh Government, 2017) 
9.3.24 This SuDS approach aims at reducing the volume of water contaminated by 
sewerage and needing to be pumped for treatment.  This would allow new 
development to use the free capacity in the sewerage network to remove the need 
to install new infrastructure and reducing the risk of flooding.  
vii. Water Strategy for Wales (Welsh Government, 2015) 
9.3.25 The Water Strategy aims to improve natural resource management of water 
systems.  It aims to improve the resilience of the whole water systems and 
therefore reduce costs to consumers and businesses, including water companies.  
d) Regional 
i. 
Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) (NRW, 2015) 
9.3.26 The purpose of RBMP is to protect and improve the water environment in the 
Western Wales River Basin District (RBD).  The plan includes; classification of 
water bodies; summary of Programme of Measures to achieve statutory objectives 
and statutory objectives for water bodies. 
e) Local 
i. 
City and County of Swansea Council Local Development Plan (2017) 
9.3.27 This adopts a sustainable approach to flood risk by avoiding vulnerable 
development occurring within flood hazard areas.  Policy RP4 Avoidance of Flood 
Risk states that development will not be permitted if it causes an increase to 
flooding on or off site. 
ii. City and County of Swansea Council Unitary Development Plan (2008) 
9.3.28 Policy EV35: Surface water run-off, and Policy EV36: Development and Flood Risk, 
are the relevant policies in CCS Unitary Development Plan. Policy EV35 affects 
developments that will lead to additional surface water run-off or cause a reduction 
of the quality of surface water run-off, and encourages SuDS implementation 
wherever practical to counteract this. Policy EV36 only allows new development 
within flood risk areas if developers can justify the location by proving the flooding 
consequences associated with the development are acceptable.

iii. The City and County of Swansea Council Strategic Flood Consequence 
Assessment (SFCA) Stage 2 (2012) 
9.3.29 Stage 1 SFCA is a desk based study of flood risk, and Stage 2 is a more detailed 
assessment of flood risks.  This determined that the main flood risk to the area is 
from fluvial and tidal water sources, with surface water also occurring and 
groundwater risk considered minimal. A Stage 3 SFCA was not required as Stage 1 
and 2 satisfied the requirements of TAN15 for the potential development.  
iv. The City and County of Swansea Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) (2015) 
9.3.30 The FRMP contains the overview of the flood risk within the CCS area and the 
objective to reduce flood risk in significant flood risk areas for six years to 2021.  
The plan covers flooding from surface water, groundwater and ordinary 
watercourse.  NRW are responsible for flooding from main rivers and reservoirs.  
v. The City and County of Swansea Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) 
(2015) 
9.3.31 The SWMP details how resources will be managed and how waste will be 
minimised and reduced, re-used and recycled wherever possible.  This will include 
guidelines such as to keep waste segregated as it’s generated to save time and 
money. 
vi. The City and County of Swansea Local Flood Risk Management Strategy 
(LFRMS) (2013) 
9.3.32 Under the LFRMS, flood risk from surface run-off, groundwater and ordinary 
watercourses have been considered.  The LFRMS is the method through which the 
LLFA leads and co-ordinates flood risk management on a day to day basis.  Local 
strategies must include objectives and methods for managing local flood risk, as 
well as timescales and cost of implementation.  
9.4 
Methodology 
a) Scope of the assessment 
9.4.1 
The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping 
process undertaken with the SoS and subsequent consultation with key consultees, 
including NRW and CCS. Comments raised on the EIA Scoping Report by NRW in 
their letter dated 14 November 2014 have been taken into account in the 
development of the assessment methodology and these are detailed where 
relevant in this chapter. Responses to the comments raised in the EIA Scoping 
Opinion, NRW and CCS can be found in Table 9-2. 
i. 
Water Quality 
9.4.2 
The scope of the water quality assessment has been undertaken in accordance 
with the relevant applicable regulations as outlined in Section 9.3 above. 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-10 
 
9.4.3 
The assessment consisted of a desk-based study to establish the baseline 
conditions of the water environment within the Project Site and surroundings, 
informed by the literature and 
internet-based information sources and 
supplemented by responses received via direct consultation with relevant 
regulatory authorities and stakeholders. 
9.4.4 
The potential impacts on the water environment during the construction, operational 
and decommissioning phases of the Project have been identified and assessed, 
taking into account the embedded design mitigations as contained in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description and the comments raised in the Scoping Opinion 
Report by the SoS (Appendix 4.2). 
ii. Flooding 
9.4.5 
Potential effects from the development have been assessed with reference to the 
Highway Agency’s Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB, HD/45/09) in 
relation to the water environment. Although primarily developed for the assessment 
of water quality effects, the method can also be applied to drainage and flooding 
effects and provides a robust and accepted method for assessing the significance 
of effects 
9.4.6 
This chapter has also followed guidance set out in NPS EN-1 and TAN15: 
Development and Flood Risk. Consultation with NRW, and with the LLFA has also 
been undertaken for the preparation of the FCA, which has informed this 
assessment, as noted in Section 9.4b.  The FCA (Appendix 9.1) supporting this 
PEIR, considers the impact of the Project on flooding and drainage. 
9.4.7 
Sustainable disposal of surface water through SuDS design has been proposed 
wherever possible. 
9.4.8 
Appropriate methods for the construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection at water crossings to prevent adverse effects on drainage and flooding 
have been considered.  
b) Consultation 
9.4.9 
The scope of the assessment has also been informed by ongoing consultation with 
statutory consultees throughout the design and assessment process, including past 
and recent email communications with the SoS, and a meeting with NRW and 
CCS. A summary of the comments raised and responses are detailed in Table 9-2.

The Scoping Report did not detail whether any areas of 
the site are at risk from flooding. EA data indicates that 
an area to the south west of the application site is 
within EA Flood Zones 2/3. The SoS notes that the ES 
is to contain an FCA. This document should include a 
description of which areas of the site are at risk from 
flooding and the exact locations of all watercourses on 
site, including springs, streams and drainage ditches.  
The sites at risk from flooding and the locations 
of watercourses on site are addressed in full

The SoS notes the comments of NRW that the 
assessment should include consideration of surface 
water drainage impacts and options for improving site 
surface water drainage to prevent localised flooding 
during extreme rainfall events.  
The prevention of localised flooding during 
extreme rainfall events is addressed in full within 
the FCA (Appendix 9.1) which also considers the 
Outline Drainage strategy (Appendix E of FCA).

The SoS recommends that the applicant considers 
temporary attenuation ponds to allow adequate 
settlement of site generated run-off during the 
construction and decommissioning phases of the 
development. 
The SoS draws the attention of the applicant to NRW’s 
comments that silt fencing, scour protection and 
sediments alone have been proven ineffective in this 
catchment due to its flashy nature.  
The settlement of site generated run-off is 
addressed in the Outline Drainage Strategy 
(Appendix E of FCA provided in Appendix 9.1) 
and within Sections 9.6 and 9.7 of this chapter 
and included in the construction environmental

The limits on the quantity of water that is 
discharged is discussed in the FCA in Appendix 
9.1 and Sections 9.6 and 9.7 of this chapter.

The SoS notes the concerns of NRW regarding cooling 
water, it should be stated within the ES whether any 
cooling water would be required and if so where it 
would be derived from and discharged to.  
Based on the Project’s Design Concept (Ref. 9 – 
22), water cooling is not required. Domestic and 
demineralised water will be delivered to site via 
tanker. No discharge of process water to nearby 
water receptors is envisaged as all process 
water will be taken off-site via tanker to 
appropriate wastewater treatment facility by 
specialist contractors.

regarding 
the 
potential 
impact 
of 
the 
development on water quality within the Lower Lliw

assesses potential impacts on the reservoir including 
potential impacts from deposition and affected rainfall.  
The potential impacts on the reservoir has been 
assessed in Section 9.6 of this chapter.

from overland flow than fluvial sources. Therefore 
maintenance of flow routes is important to reduce this 
flood risk and any downstream impacts. The overland 
flow path on the eastern boundary of the Generating 
Equipment Site should be kept clear and formalised to 
encourage water to flow downslope, away from the 
development and nearby Solar Farm and towards the 
ecological mitigation area to the south.  The 7 m 
easement could be relaxed provided some access is 
maintained. Overland flow routes should be formalised 
along the eastern edge of the site and kept clear. 
Easement of these routes is not necessary.

c) Study area 
9.4.10 The study area adopted with respect to the water quality and water resources 
extends beyond the Project Site boundary as provided in Figure 9.1. The study 
area therefore includes the area within the Project Site boundary and a potential 
zone of influence (ZoI) which is defined as a distance over which significant effects 
on important water receptors/features can reasonably have the potential to occur. 
In this case, from the perspective of water receptors/features, this is defined as a 
1 km buffer zone of influence (ZoI) around the Project Site boundary (Figure 1.1 of 
Appendix 9.2). 
9.4.11 The 1 km buffer ZoI has been determined considering a number of factors, 
including the number of water receptors likely to be affected by the Project, taking 
into account the nature of the Project, adopted assessment methodology as 
described in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment, the 
embedded design mitigation measures, the Outline CEMP, outline drainage 
strategy (Appendix E in Appendix 9.1) and the proximity of each identified receptor 
to the Project Site.  
d) Sensitivity and value of resources 
9.4.12 The sensitivity of each water feature/receptor identified with respect to the water 
quality and water resources within the study area has been determined by the 
importance of the affected features/receptors in the study area. 
9.4.13 A list of the main water features/receptors identified and considered within the study 
area is given below. The list takes into account the site’s characteristics, 
background project documents, relevant reference documents and professional 
judgement. 
 WFD classified water bodies ('Main Rivers'); 
 Ordinary water bodies including springs, ponds, reservoirs, lakes and rivulets; 
 Groundwater bodies and aquifer(s); 
 Licensed groundwater and surface water abstractions; 
 Flood risk zones; and 
 Water dependent conservation areas and other key environmental receptors 
such as sites of importance for nature conservation (SINC), ancient 
Woodlands, SSSI (Figure 9.2). 
9.4.14 The criteria used in assessing the value and sensitivity of key water 
features/receptors within the study area are set out in Table 9-3.

Significance of effect and definitions 
9.4.16 The significance of the potential effects of the Project on the water environment is 
defined by the sensitivity of and the magnitude of the impact on the 
receptors/features within the study area. 
9.4.17 Based on the receptor sensitivity and the magnitude of impact on the water 
environment, the definition of the significance of effect on the water features 
receptors are set out in Table 9-5.

9.4.18 Following the classification of an effect as detailed in Table 9-5, a clear statement is 
made as to whether the effect is ‘significant’ or ‘not significant’.  
9.4.19 Effects predicted to be Minor or Negligible are considered to be manageable and 
are therefore ‘Not Significant’ and effects assessed as Moderate or Major are 
considered to be 'Significant'. 
9.5 
Baseline Environment 
9.5.1 
This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project 
Site and surroundings with specific reference to the water quality and water 
resources within the study area. 
9.5.2 
In order to assess the potential impacts and effects of the Project, the baseline 
environmental conditions and relevant water features/receptors that currently exist 
in the study area have been determined from a number of sources including the 
following: 
 Reports of the 2014 PEIR baseline study;  
 British Geological Survey (BGS) 1:50,000 Series Geological Maps Sheet 247 
Swansea (England and Wales); 
 Information from Natural Resources Wales (NRW) website and consultation; 
 Information from City Council of Swansea (CCS) website and consultation; 
 Information from Ordnance Survey Map covering the study area; 
 Report of the Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) 
 Relevant European Union (EU) legislation – Status report of WFD designated 
water bodies identified within the study area;  
 Observations made during a site visit on 8 November 2017; and 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-24 
 
 Envirocheck report, Landmark (2017) (Appendix 10.1). 
9.5.3 
Taking into account the defined study area as described in Section 9.4(c), the value 
and sensitivity of the main environmental receptors and resources identified within 
the study area is summarised in Table 9-11 (water quality) and Table 9-12 (flood 
risk and surface water drainage). 
9.5.4 
The criteria used in determining the sensitivity and value, significance of the 
magnitude and effects impact on the water environment baseline conditions are set 
out in Section 9.4 of this PEIR. 
a) 
Topography and land use 
9.5.5 
The topography of the study area is reasonably elevated and steeply sloping. 
Ground levels across the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m AOD in the 
north with ground levels at the Generating Equipment Site reaching an elevation of 
about 90 m AOD before generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction 
to an elevation of approximately 80 m AOD along the Afon Llan River and its 
tributaries.  Felindre Gas Compressor Station located immediately to the north of 
the Access Road is constructed on raised ground at a level of approximately 87 m 
AOD. This is approximately 5-8 m above the flood plain of the field drainage and 
ordinary watercourse to the south of the Access Road, which drains to the Afon 
Llan. 
9.5.6 
The land within the Project Site is currently used for sheep and horse grazing with 
existing development consisting of farm buildings and access roads. The area 
surrounding the Project Site is, at present, predominantly rural, although there is a 
Felindre Park and Share to the south and a substantial amount of utility 
infrastructure in the area, some of which cross the Project Site. There are a number 
of solar farms in fields neighbouring the Site. Some springs and drainage 
channels/ditches within the Project Site drain the land and discharge into the Afon 
Llan River. The current land uses are considered “Less vulnerable” to flooding 
according to the TAN15 classifications. 
b) Ground conditions and hydrogeology 
9.5.7 
A full description of ground conditions and hydrogeology of the Project Site is 
provided in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology. A 
summary is provided here to understand the possible linkages with surface water 
features and groundwater resources explicitly used for private groundwater supply 
within the study area. 
9.5.8 
The British Geological Survey (BGS), online mapping data, provides details of both 
the regional and local geology of the study area. The data indicates that the Project 
Site is underlain by bedrock of the Grovesend Formation, comprising mudstone, 
siltstone and sandstone (Figure 9.3). Superficial deposits across the Project Site 
are quite variable. However, they primarily comprise till and glaciofluvial deposits 
(sands and gravels) with a smaller area of peat, to the west of the north-western 
corner of the Project Site (Figure 9.4). The thickness of the superficial deposits 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-25 
 
beneath the Project Site is currently unknown. Groundwater occurs in both the 
superficial and bedrock beneath the study area. 
9.5.9 
NRW has designated the bedrock geology beneath the Project Site and the study 
area as a Secondary A aquifer with the superficial deposits designated a mixture of 
Secondary A aquifer and unproductive strata. Secondary A aquifers are permeable 
layers capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale 
and, in some cases, can form a vital source of base flow to rivers. Unproductive 
strata are rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible 
significance for water supply or river base flow. Soils in the study area are variable, 
designated to have high, intermediate and low leachate potential. 
9.5.10 Groundwater movement within the underlying geology is likely to be limited 
considering the aquifer designations as discussed above. Although the Project Site 
is elevated, shallow or perched groundwater within the superficial deposits is 
expected to be reasonably close to the surface and in hydraulic connectivity with 
the surface watercourses present within the Project Site and immediate 
surroundings.  From the site visit in November 2017, it was noted that infiltration is 
likely to be limited on the Generating Equipment Site where collections of surface 
water and saturated ground were observed throughout the locality. The timing of 
the visit did not follow a particularly wet period of weather. 
9.5.11 The objectives of the WFD have been used to assess the groundwater quality in 
the study area. The Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB41002G200600) and Swansea Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB410002G201000) are two WFD groundwater bodies within the study area 
(Figure 9.5). Information on their status regarding water quality is available from 
NRW Rivers and Waterbodies website (accessed October 2017). According to 
NRW website, the current quantitative water quality for both the Carmarthen and 
Swansea water bodies is good and predicted to remain so beyond 2015, based on 
the most recent available data from 2015.  
9.5.12 However, the overall 2015 Cycle 2 Status and current chemical quality for both 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures and Swansea Carboniferous Coal 
Measures groundwater bodies are reported to be poor and are expected to remain 
so beyond 2015. There are no identified designated groundwater SPZs or drinking 
water Safeguard Zones with regards to agricultural activities within 1 km of the 
Project Site. Furthermore, information on the status of the Carmarthen and 
Swansea Carboniferous WFD groundwater bodies shows that they are not targeted 
for improvement within the Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP). 
9.5.13 The Landmark Envirocheck report (Appendix 10.1) has identified no groundwater 
abstraction licences associated with the Project Site. The Landmark report 
identified only one licence located within 100 m of the Project Site, recorded 56 m 
to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated 
February 1993, for general farming and domestic use. Recent (received on 9 
October 2017) data on private groundwater and abstraction licences received from 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

AECOM 
 
9-26 
 
CCS and NRW respectively did not identify this licence or any other licences within 
the 4 km of the Project Site. . 
c) Contaminated land 
9.5.14 A detailed assessment of the potential for contaminated land is included in Chapter 
10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology. A summary of the possible 
risks to surface water features and the groundwater bodies and aquifer is provided 
below. 
9.5.15 No intrusive site investigation has been completed to inform this assessment. 
However, as the majority of the Project Site is undeveloped, it is unlikely to have 
experienced significant potentially contaminative activities. Figure 9.6 shows 
current or historical potential pollution point/aerial sources within 1 km of the Project 
Site. It also includes historic landfill and industrial land use activities that have a 
higher potential for ground contamination such as the disused (inert) landfill site 
located approximately 100 m west of the Gas Connection, a coal mine north of 
Abergelli Farm and the Substation towards the south west of the Project Site. 
9.5.16 The Project Site is overlying mine workings. An assessment of the workings, adits 
and mine entries is discussed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and 
Hydrogeology. A comprehensive ground investigation will be undertaken as part of 
embedded mitigation, prior to construction, and will provide more detail of ground 
conditions. 
9.5.17 A mine spoil dump covered approximately three-quarters of the landfill area from 
the former Abergelli Colliery (Figure 9.6). This mine waste largely was removed 
leaving a layer of well compacted mine waste over the majority of the landfill area. 
Part of the ground that was covered by mine spoil was formerly used for drying out 
of water treatment sludge (aluminium sulphate) though this ceased when the landfill 
became operational. No further information regarding potential impacts to the water 
environment from this operation is known. 
d) Surface water and groundwater features 
9.5.18 There are both designated "ordinary" and "main" surface water bodies within the 
study area (Figures B2 and B3, Appendix B of FCA provided in Appendix 9.1). 
Within the Project Site, there are springs and spring-drainage rivulets and drainage 
ditches that drain the Project Site into the Afon Llan River. The Afon Llan River and 
its tributaries are the closest surface water features in the vicinity of the Project Site 
considered in the assessment. The Afon Llan River catchment includes all of the 
Project Site. The Loughor Estuary, alongside other ecological statutory designated 
sites more distant from the Project Site downstream of the Project Site, are also 
discussed. 
9.5.19 There are three WFD classified surface water bodies (Figure 9.1) within the study 
area: the Afon Llan (Water body ID GB110058032070 to the south of the Project 
Site), the Afon Lliw (Water body ID GB110059032100 to the north of the Project 
Site) and the Loughor Estuary (Burry Inlet Inner) (Water body ID GB531005913500

located approximately 7 km south of the Project Site) into which these water bodies 
discharges.  
9.5.20 The Afon Llan River is the closest WFD designated surface watercourse that 
traverses the immediate vicinity of the Project Site. It flows in a south-westerly 
direction and is designated as a Main River by Natural Resources Wales (NRW).  
The Afon Llan borders the southern boundary of the Project Site.  The Afon Llan 
links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen 
Bay.  The Power Generation Plant is located approximately 400 m from the Afon 
Llan watercourse.  The rivers will not be directly altered by the Project. 
9.5.21 There is one WFD groundwater body (Table 9-10) (i.e. the Carmarthen 
Carboniferous Coal Measures Water body ID GB41002G200600) in the vicinity of 
the Project Site. This WFD water body is not targeted for improvements within the 
Western Wales RBMP. 
9.5.22 Information about the current and predicted status of the Afon Llan River and the 
other designated WFD water bodies within the study area are available from  NRW 
Cycle 2 River and Waterbodies websites1 (accessed May 2017) and is summarised 
in Table 9-8. Details of groundwater bodies are provided in Table 9-10.

9.5.23 The Afon Lliw is located approximately 1.3 km north of the Project Site and has 
been assessed under the WFD as shown in Table 9-9.  
9.5.24 There are other smaller watercourses in the vicinity of the Project Site that drain to 
the Afon Llan, along with some springs and small ponds. These have not been 
individually assessed previously under the WFD. The selection of waterbodies to 
be evaluated in 2015 was based on the judgment of NRW considering the 
catchment size, available data and overall significance. It is thought that these 
waterbodies were not previously assessed partly due to lack of data and because 
their small size means their overall importance to the river basin district is reduced. 
9.5.25 The largest ordinary watercourse traversing the eastern perimeter of the Project 
Site has been observed to be 2.0-2.5 m wide at the bank and 1 m deep.  Some 
ordinary watercourses will be directly altered by the Project (Figures 2.4-2.6, 
Appendix E (Outline Drainage Strategy) provided in FCA in Appendix 9.1)..  
9.5.26 Both the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw discharge to the Loughor Estuary west of 
Swansea, approximately 7 km from the Project Site. The Project Site lies outside of 
the Afon Lliw topographic catchment and therefore it is expected that any direct 
hydraulic connectivity will be limited. The Afon Llan does, however, join with the 
Afon Lliw approximately 9 km downstream of the Project Site. There may also be 
some potential for the cross-transfer of shallow groundwater flows between the two 
catchments. The Loughor Estuary has been assessed under the WFD as shown in 
Table 9-9. NRW has identified that the Loughor Estuary contains designated 
Shellfisheries. 
9.5.27 No surface water abstraction points have been identified within the Project Site. 
The closest surface water abstractions, assumed to be from a tributary of the Afon 
Llan, have been identified approximately 1.6 km northeast and upstream of the 
Project Site.  Accordingly, no impact to this receptor is envisaged and it is not 
considered further in this assessment. 
9.5.28 There are a number of small drainage ditches and land drains which cross the 
Project Site and output into the ordinary watercourses and then the Afon Llan.  
There are also springs with associated streams which discharge into the Afon Llan 
throughout the Project Site.

9-29 
 
9.5.29 There are two heavily vegetated ponds located within the Generating Equipment 
Site. These are of unverified extent owing to vegetation cover but are thought to 
have a radius of approximately 5 m. 
e) Flood risk 
9.5.30 There are no flood defence structures in the study area. 
9.5.31 The Lle Geo-Portal  Development Advice Map (DAM) (Ref 9-25) determines that a 
relatively small area in the Project Site, south of the Generating Equipment lie 
within DAM Zone C2 (areas of the floodplain without significant defence 
infrastructure).  Small areas along the eastern edge of the Project Site 
boundary, east and south of the Generating Equipment Site lie within DAM Zone B 
(areas known to have flooded in the past).  The remainder of the Project Site is 
outside the DAM Zones and considered to be at very low risk of flooding i.e. DAM 
Zone A. Figure D1 in Appendix 9.1 displays the flood zones and Project Site 
boundary.   
9.5.32 During the site visit, the area between the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and 
the Generating Equipment Site was notably saturated.  It is assumed that this area 
and the lower lying area to the south may be susceptible to groundwater or surface 
water flooding.  This is consistent with BGS groundwater flooding susceptibility 
mapping showing the south area of Project Site as potential groundwater flooding 
at surface, while the rest of the Project Site lies in limited potential or potential for 
flooding properties below ground level.  Chapter 10: Geology, Ground 
Conditions and  Hydrogeology 
describes 
additional 
information 
on 
the 
Landmark Envirocheck Report (2017).  
9.5.33 The literature review has not identified any historic incidents of flooding affecting 
the Project Site from any source.  The references considered are in the References 
section (Section 9.12). 
9.5.34 The CCS PFRA (2011), Level 1 (2010) and Level 2 (2012) SFCA’s do not report 
any recorded flood events from groundwater sources within the CCS region.  The 
FRMP (2015) indicates that there is a low risk of groundwater flooding across the 
CCS region. 
9.5.35 NRW online maps show that reservoir flooding is not predicted to affect the Project 
Site.  This is relevant with respect to the upstream Lliw Reservoir. 
9.5.36 The existing Water Main that crosses the Project Site in a northwest to southeast 
orientation could present a flood risk if inadvertently damaged or leaking.  Previous 
consultation on the Project with Welsh Water ascertained that flow rates in the pipe 
are approximately 1.2.-1.7 m3/s. The flood risk from this source if it were to leak is 
considered to be very low.   
f) 
Artificial water features 
9.5.37 Situated north of the Project Site is Felindre Water Treatment Works with a covered 
reservoir.  There is a Water Main connected to Felindre water treatment works via a 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

AECOM 
 
9-30 
 
1.68 m diameter pipe which follows a south-east to north-west direction across the 
Generating Equipment Site and along the line of an existing access track.  The 
treated water is supplied to Swansea, Llanelli and Bridgend areas. 
9.5.38 The Lower Lliw Reservoir is also situated north and upstream of the Site, 
approximately 1.1 km away.  It is part of the water supply infrastructure in the 
adjacent Lliw catchment.  
g) Ecological designations 
9.5.39 A detailed description of ecological designations within the study area is provided in 
Chapter 8: Ecology and illustrated in Figures 8.1 and Figure 8.2. A summary of 
features relevant to the assessment of impacts on the water environment is 
provided below. 
9.5.40 The Loughor Estuary is located approximately 7 km west of the Project Site and 
receives water from the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw. It is designated as an SSSI with 
the Burry Inlet further downstream also a designated Ramsar site. Both form part of 
the Carmarthen Bay SAC. 
9.5.41 Two SSSI sites (Figure 9.2) located closer to and potentially in hydraulic 
connectivity with the Project Site are: 
 Nant y Crimp SSSI, located approximately 2.2 km west which is designated for 
its wet pastures, grassland/woodland habitat and marsh fritillary butterfly. The 
Project Site is not located within the catchment of the Nant y Crimp and 
therefore any hydraulic connectivity with the Project Site would be limited to 
potential groundwater flows; and 
 Penllergaer railway cutting SSSI, approximately 3 km to the south-west which 
is designated for geological interest. An unnamed tributary of the Afon Llan 
flows through the Penllergaer SSSI. Geological designations are not relevant to 
this assessment as there will not be any effects of the Project on the geological 
conditions from the perspective of water quality and resources. 
9.5.42 Effects on the SSSIs are addressed in Chapter 8: Ecology. 
9.5.43 There are SINCs situated within and surrounding the Project Site (Figure 9.2). 
Three are considered relevant to this assessment: the Lletty Morfil SINC, which is 
partly within the Project Site and is designated for purple moor grass and rush 
pasture and scrub habitats; and the Waun Garn Wen and Rhos Fawr SINCs 
adjacent to the Project Site, which are also designated for purple moor grass and 
rush pasture, wet woodland, scrub and watercourse habitats. The SINCs may, 
therefore, have some sensitivity to changes in water table and water quality. The 
area of peat adjacent to the north-west corner of the Project Site extends into the 
Waun Garn Wen SINC. 
h) Drainage 
9.5.44 Most of the Project Site is undeveloped and surface water run-off flows overland 
and through field drains discharging into the Afon Llan. These field drains and 
drainage ditches can be seen to cross the Project Site and flow to the ordinary 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-31 
 
watercourses. The largest ordinary watercourse flows south along the east 
perimeter of the Project Site before discharging to the Afon Llan.   
9.5.45 It has been identified that there are no foul sewers within the Project Site, and 
therefore assumed that the foul effluent from the nearby farm and residential 
properties discharge to cess pits and septic tanks.  
i) 
Summary of Receptors 
9.5.46 Based on the information reviewed for this PEIR, the water quality and resources 
and flood receptors/features with the potential to be affected by the Project have 
been identified.  
9.5.47 Table 9-8 summarises the key receptors and classifies their importance.  This has 
been undertaken using professional judgement and with reference to the baseline 
information and the policy guidance noted in Section 9.2. The identified receptors 
are assessed to have a hydrological or hydraulic connection to the Project Site. The 
Lower Lliw reservoir and Afon Lliw are upgradient and not in direct hydraulic 
continuity so are excluded from further assessment.

Embedded Mitigation 
9.6.1 
As detailed in Chapter 3: Project Site and Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project. 
9.6.2 
As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal 
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of 
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place. 
9.7 
Assessment of Effects 
9.7.1 
This section presents the findings of the water quality and resources impact 
assessment and flood risk impact assessment during the construction, operation 
and decommissioning phases of the Project. 
9.7.2 
This section identifies any likely significant effects that are likely to occur and the 
additional mitigation and monitoring measures that are proposed to reduce or 
eliminate the identified significant effects. 
j) 
Construction effects – Power Generation Plant 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.3 
This section considers the potential impacts and effects that construction works for 
the Project pose to water quality and resources.  A description of the anticipated 
scope of the construction works required is included in Chapter 3: Project Site 
and Description. 
9.7.4 
The principal risks of the construction works to water quality and resources 
therefore comprise: 
 Pollution impacts on surface watercourses and groundwater associated with: 
o increased sediment loads in site runoff containing elevated suspended 
sediment levels disturbed during site clearance; 
o the release of hydrocarbons and oils due to a large number of vehicles 
accessing the site, leakages from temporary oil/fuel storage tanks and 
accidental spillages; and 
o accidental leaks of hazardous materials, such as concrete and cement 
products, which can be contained in uncontrolled wash-down water and 
surface water runoff;  
o dewatering of excavations and the discharge of potentially polluted/high 
sediment loading water to the water receptors;and 
o pollution from dust and debris. 
9.7.5 
Measures to address the above have been identified and, where appropriate, are 
included in the embedded mitigation given in Chapter 3: Project and Site 
Description and in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
 
 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-36 
 
Increased pollution and sediment load 
9.7.6 
The magnitude of potential impacts to surface water receptors will be most 
significant when working in areas adjacent to a water body or drainage channel. If 
they occur, the impacts will be direct and temporary - water quality within the 
affected water body is expected to improve over time as sediments settle or are 
trapped by vegetation and pollutants such as hydrocarbons, oils and other 
hazardous products are dispersed, diluted and treated by natural processes.  
9.7.7 
Surface water runoff from the Project Site will be conveyed to the tributaries of the 
Afon Llan River, east of the Project Site. This tributary to the Afon Llan is a 
designated ordinary watercourse with a Medium sensitivity. Consequently, the 
magnitude of any potential impacts to this water receptor during the construction 
phase of the Project will be Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effects is 
assessed to be Negligible and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.8 
There is potential for hydraulic connectivity (most likely through shallow 
groundwater) and therefore for runoff to migrate to the Lletty Morfil, Waun Garn 
Wen and Rhos Fawr SINCs located within the  Project Site at approximately 200 m 
and 300 m from the Power Generation Plant (Figure 9.2). Given the approximate 
distances and locations of these features, their Medium sensitivity and the inferred 
groundwater flow direction (Figure 9.2), the magnitude of potential impacts on 
these receptors is assessed as Negligible. Hence the significance of any effects 
will be Negligible and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.9 
Surface water runoff from the Project Site may infiltrate and migrate further afield 
via groundwater. The primary groundwater flow direction is assessed to be towards 
the Afon Llan (Figure 9.3) but will be confirmed through future geotechnical/ground 
investigations at the Project Site post DCO Application. The groundwater aquifer 
beneath the Project Site is a WFD designated water body (i.e. Carmarthen 
Carboniferous Coal Measures groundwater body) (Figure 9.5) of medium 
sensititivity. Taking into account its current and forecasted WFD water quality status 
which is expected to remain poor, its dilution and dispersion potential, it is 
envisaged that infiltration of surface runoff will not significantly impact the flow or 
quality of groundwater. The receptor sensitivity is Medium, the magnitude of 
potential impact on groundwater arising from pollution by surface water runoff is 
considered to be Negligible so the significance of effects is assessed to be 
Negligible and no mitigation is required. Potential impacts to groundwater 
resources are discussed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and 
Hydrogeology. 
9.7.10 Runoff from the Generating Equipment Site will contribute only a small proportion of 
flow in the Afon Llan. The Afon Llan is hydrologically connected with the Loughor 
Estuary which is also a WFD designated surface water body of High sensitivity 
located about 7 km south of the Project Site. In the event that surface water runoff 
is accidentally polluted, before it is discharged from the Project Site into the Afon 
Llan River, it will have to travel several kilometres before reaching the Loughor 
Estuary (SAC, SSSI). As such, any pollutants would have settled, dispersed, diluted 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-37 
 
and be treated by natural processes thereby limiting any subsequent impact to the 
Loughor Estuary.  The sensitivity of the Loughor Estuary is High, the magnitude of 
potential pollution impacts will be Negligible, hence the significance of effect has 
been assessed as Minor and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.11 The two existing ponds within the Power Generation Plant area will be lost as a 
result of the Project. Based on this, from a water quality and resources perspective, 
the potential pollution and sediment loading impacts on these ponds is scoped out 
of the assessment. 
9.7.12 Potential impacts and effects associated with ground instability and piling works are 
discussed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology. 
Dewatering discharges 
9.7.13 Dewatering of site excavations may be required for piling or construction of 
foundations within the Generating Equipment Site. As described previously, given 
the current and historic land uses, ground contamination is unlikely to pose a 
significant groundwater quality risk as a result of mobilisation of existing 
contaminants. Therefore dewatering of excavations is unlikely to introduce polluted 
water to the water environment. Water removed during dewatering activities may 
contain elevated suspended solids and will be subject to appropriate mitigation 
(e.g. settlement ponds) before discharge to the water environment off-site.  
9.7.14 As noted above, water from dewatering activities will be discharged a treatment 
process (e.g. settlement ponds/oil removal system) and this will likely be 
discharged directly into the tributary to the Afon Llan east of the Project Site. This 
tributary is not a WFD designated water body but an ordinary water body of 
Medium sensitivity. The magnitude of potential impacts from dewatering 
discharges on this tributary to the Afon Llan during construction is considered to be 
Low. Accordingly, the significance of potential effects is assessed as Minor and no 
additional mitigation is required. 
Sediment filled and turbid surface water resulting from dust and debris 
9.7.15 Construction activities have the potential to release debris and dust that may be 
blown into adjacent surface water features. Increased dust levels in surface water 
bodies may reduce the levels of light reaching aquatic plant and animal species 
and cover sensitive habitats on the floor of the streams and ponds. Debris blown 
into water bodies can decrease the aesthetic quality of the water body. Impacts will 
be direct and temporary. 
9.7.16 The Project does not involve any demolition activities therefore high levels of dust 
and debris are unlikely particularly with the implementation of the dust control 
measures incorporated into the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
9.7.17 The ordinary surface water bodies (i.e the watercourses close to and within the 
Generating Equipment Site) including the tributary to the Afon Llan east of the the 
Project Site are potential surface water receptors that could be impacted by dust

9-38 
 
and debris during construction. These will be directly affected by physical works 
however the embedded mitigation measures in the Outline CEMP will control 
potential pollution impacts. The sensitivity of the receptors is Medium, the 
magnitude of impacts associated with dust generation and debris has been 
assessed as Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effects is assessed to be 
Negligible no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.18 It is envisaged that the embedded mitigation measures will help control dust and 
debris related impacts such that they do not affect waterbodies and SINCs at a 
distance from the Power Generation Plant. The sensitivity of the ordinary 
waterbodies and SINCs within the Project Site is Medium. In the event of any 
accidental escape of dust and debris into any of the ordinary surface water 
receptors (e.g. ponds, rivulets and ditches) within and nearby watercourses (e.g. 
the tributary to the Afon Llan) to the Project Site the magnitude of impact will be 
Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effect at any of these ordinary water 
receptors (i.e. the tributary to the Afon Llan, ponds, rivulets and ditches) is 
assessed as Negligible and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.19 The magnitude of the potential impacts likely to arise during the construction works 
on the identified water receptors at the Power Generation Plant are considered to 
be negligible. Accordingly the effect significance on the water receptors within the 
Project Site and study area is assessed as minor or negligible and Not significant. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.20 This section considers the potential impacts and effect that construction works for 
the Power Generation Plant may have on flood risk and drainage. A description of 
the anticipated scope of construction works required is included in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  The construction phase is expected to take 
approximately 22 months. 
9.7.21 The potential flood risks include: 
 Damage to Water main;  
 Water Main Temporary Bridge; and  
 Maintenance Compound and construction car parking within temporary 
Laydown Area. 
Damage to Water main 
9.7.22 A 1.68 m diameter Water Main, the Felindre-Margam trunk main, traverses the 
Generating Equipment Site, and is a key part of the main water supply 
infrastructure in the area.  The exact location and depth of the Water Main will be 
determined during site investigations (currently scheduled to be completed in 
January 2018), liaison with Dwr Cymru Welsh Water and a precautionary 
safeguarded area of 30 m will be in place either side during construction to avoid 
the chance of striking the Water Main.   
9.7.23 Within the Water Main easement area, the existing ground level has been retained.  
In the very unlikely event of an accidental rupture, any resultant outflow is likely to 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-39 
 
pass through the Project Site but is unlikely to impact the elevated Generating 
Equipment Site.  The predicted flow volumes and land levels are such that the 
adjacent ordinary watercourses, either side of the main, and the receiving Afon Llan 
should accommodate the temporary increase in overland flow until the fracture is 
repaired or flow is halted, avoiding an effect on third parties. Therefore, based on 
the sensitivity of the receptor being Low, and a Low magnitude impact as a result 
of embedded mitigation and accounting for the unlikely event of an accident, the 
significance of effect via safeguarding is predicted to be Negligible, and therefore 
not significant.  
Water Main Temporary Bridge 
9.7.24 The Water Main will be crossed by a temporary bridge designed for construction 
loads from the Access Road to Generating Equipment Site.  Welsh Water will be 
consulted during detailed design to include the required protective measures to the 
crossing to preserve the Water Main’s integrity.  There will also be a specialist 
engineering consultant on site during the bridge’s construction to ensure the safe 
crossing of heavy loads in the construction period, some in excess of 300 tons, 
over the Water Main.  Historic Welsh Water consultation has preferred a Bailey 
bridge solution, previously used to cross the same Water Main, which will be 
discussed further. Any crossing solution will be subject to Welsh Water agreement. 
With a receptor sensitivity of Low and a predicted impact magnitude of Negligible 
owing to appropriate loading mitigation, the effect significance predicted to be 
Negligible, and therefore not significant. 
Maintenance Compound and construction car parking within the temporary 
Laydown Area 
9.7.25 The temporary Laydown Area will provide storage space for materials, plant and 
equipment.  It will also comprise accommodation and welfare facilities for 
construction staff as well as parking.  The location of the Laydown Area is currently 
greenfield.  The construction of the Laydown Area will involve vegetation clearance 
and laying down of granular material which, subject to infiltration tests, should 
permit surface water to drain to ground at a rate close to the existing conditions.  
The granular area amounts to 2.8 ha.  The footprints of the construction compound 
building facilities will result in some, temporary, loss of surface draining area; 
however, this amounts to a negligible portion of the Laydown Area.   
9.7.26 The temporary, low permeability of the surface during construction from building 
facilities and changes in runoff have not been considered in calculations for 
permanent construction runoff.  Therefore, this has not been allowed for in the 
compensatory attenuation pond, proposed for the south eastern corner of the 
Generating Equipment Site.  However, there is provision for consideration of 
temporary runoff in the Outline CEMP.  The temporary Laydown Area will be 
returned to its original pre-construction composition (grassland) following 
construction, Based on the sensitivity of the receptor (other non-specific locations 
within study area) being Negligible because of the very low flood risk, and the 
Negligible magnitude of the impact through embedded mitigation of predominantly 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

AECOM 
 
9-40 
 
gravel surfacing. The significance of the temporary effect is considered to be 
Negligible. 
9.7.27 The size of the temporary Laydown Area car park is 0.3 ha and is additional to the 
2.8 ha referred to above for the remainder of the Laydown Area i.e. it is 
approximately 10% of the total Laydown Area.  The surface of the car parking area 
is assumed to be constructed using a gravel / granular surface finish, under the 
‘General Site Area’ runoff designation of the Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E 
of FCA provided in Appendix 9.1).  This should, subject to infiltration tests, permit 
surface water to drain to ground at a rate close to existing conditions. Based on the 
sensitivity of the receptor (other non-specific locations within study area) being 
Negligible because of the very low flood risk, and the Negligible magnitude of the 
impact through embedded mitigation, the significance of the permanent effect is 
considered to be Negligible. 
k) Construction effects - Gas Connection  
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.28 The potential impacts associated with the activities and the water receptors likely to 
be impacted during the construction phase are the same as those identified for the 
Power Generation Plant. From water quality and resources perspective, it is 
envisaged that the Gas Pipeline will not give rise to an increase in impermeable 
area within the Project Site and impact upon the surface water run-off regime for 
the Gas Connection. Consequently, given the nature of the works and the size of 
the area required for the Gas Connection construction works, the overall effects of 
the potential impacts associated with the construction activities at the Gas 
Connection areas are considered to be similar or less than the impacts determined 
at the Power Generation Plant and as detailed above. 
9.7.29 Accordingly, given that the water receptors and their sensitivities remains the same, 
the Nagnitude of the potential water quality impacts likely to arise during the 
construction works at the Gas Connection point is considered to be Negligible and 
the overall significance of effects on the range of sensitivity water receptors as a 
result of the construction activities is therefore considered to range from minor to 
Negligible and therefore Not significant with no further mitigation required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.30 No Gas Connection effects for flooding have been identified during the construction 
phase. 
l) 
Construction effects – Electrical Connection 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.31 A detailed description of the construction activities for the Electrical Connection is 
provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. In summary, the Electrical 
Connection will run along side the Access Road for the majority of the route. 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-41 
 
9.7.32 The potential impacts associated with the activities and the water receptors likely to 
be impacted during this construction phase are likely to be similar to those 
identified for the Power Generation Plant. Consequently, given the nature of the 
works and the size of the area required for the Electrical Connection construction 
works, the overall effects of the potential impacts associated with the construction 
activities at the Electrical Connection are considered to be similar, but slightly less 
than the impacts determined at the Power Generation Plant as detailed above. 
9.7.33 Taking into account the medium sensitivity of the groundwater body beneath the 
Project Site and the current and forecasted WFD status (i.e. poor water quality) for 
the groundwater body, the Magnitude of potential impacts likely to arise from  the 
installation of the Electrical Connection is considered to be Negligible. Hence the 
significance of effect is assessed as Negligible. 
9.7.34 Additionally, given that the water receptors and their sensitivities remains the same, 
the overall Magnitude of the potential water quality impacts likely to arise during 
the construction of the Electrical Connection is considered to be Negligible and the 
overall significance of effects on the range of sensitivity water receptors as a result 
of the construction activities is therefore considered to range from Minor to 
Negligible and therefore Not significant with no further mitigation required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.35 No Electrical Connection effects for flooding have been identified during the 
construction phase. 
m) Operational Effects – Power Generation Plant 
9.7.36 A full description of the operational phase of the Project is included in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.37 The main activities with the potential to affect the water environment have been 
identified as follows: 
 Potable water use for staff welfare and discharge of grey water/sewage (i.e. 
treated foul wastewater discharges); 
 Water for emergency use (e.g. fire control) (water discharges); 
 Storage and use of fuels or other chemicals on-site; and 
 Vehicle movement to and around the Project Site. 
9.7.38 The key risks to the water environment during the operational phase include: 
 Pollution from oil (lubrication etc.) and fuels leakage from storage facilities or 
resulting from accidental spillages during delivery which may be carried by 
surface water runoff discharging to the water environment through the 
proposed surface water drainage system; and 
 Water quality impacts associated with treated wastewater discharges. 
 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

9-42 
 
Pollution  
9.7.39 Within the drainage strategy (Appendix E of Appendix 9.1) it is proposed that 
surface water runoff from the Power Generation Plant will be discharged either via 
infiltration (where ground conditions allow) or to the local watercourses on and 
around the Power Generation Plant which eventually drain to the Afon Llan. It is 
expected that the Power Generation Plant drainage will include a combination of 
piped and SuDS systems, including oil interceptors, trapped gullies/filter drains, 
attenuation ponds and swales providing appropriate water quality treatment stages 
in line with current guidance to reduce the risk of surface water and groundwater 
contamination. 
9.7.40 The tributary to the Afon Llan east of the Project Site will be the receiving surface 
water body for discharges from the Project Site. The sensitivity of this water body is 
Medium. Taking into account the embedded mitigation measures, the Magnitude 
of potential impacts from pollution during the operational phase is considered to be 
Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effects is therefore assessed to be 
Negligible. 
9.7.41 The potential water quality related pollutants likely to arise from the Project Site 
during operation are expected to be hydrocarbon-related, mainly from fuel, oil and 
lubricant stored at the Project Site. Where pollution occurs due to a breach of the 
embedded mitigation measures, impacts arising from leachate from the attenuation 
pond or accidental hydrocarbon spillage, for example, there is the potential for 
infiltration to groundwater to occur. However, the impacts will likely be localised. 
The sensitivity of the groundwater beneath the Project Site is Medium. Taking into 
account natural attenuation, the quantity of hydrocarbon likely to be stored at the 
Project Site at a given time as well as the dilution potential of the groundwater, the 
magnitude of potential impacts arising from pollution is Negligible. Accordingly, the 
significance of effects is assessed to be Negligible and no additional mitigation is 
required. 
Water quality impacts associated with treated wastewater discharges  
9.7.42 The quantity of foul effluent generated on site is expected to be small due to the 
limited number of workers on site at any one time during regular operational hours. 
Connection to a public sewer is not deemed feasible. The drainage strategy has 
considered the use of either septic tanks within the site or a package sewage 
treatment plants for foul effluent. However, package treatment plants are the 
preferred option, subject to detailed design following completion of ground 
investigations. The choice of one or other of these disposal methods is not 
considered to have a material effect on the impact assessment. Due to the small 
quantity of foul water generated during operations, it is anticipated that treated 
water can be discharged via infiltration (soakaway) on site. The foul water drainage 
system will be positioned to minimise the risk of inundation by floodwaters. Where 
there is an inadequate unsaturated zone beneath the site, the option of discharging 
to local watercourses will be adopted. Any discharges will be subject to the 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-43 
 
Environmental Permitting Regulations and will need to meet quality criteria set by 
NRW.  
9.7.43 The sensitivity of the surface water and/or groundwater receptors (i.e. the tributary 
to the east of the Afon Llan and/or Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures 
groundwater body beneath the Project Site) likely to receive foul effluent from the 
Project Site is Medium. Taking into account the quantity of treated foul 
waste/watstewater likely to be generated from the packaged sewage treatment 
plant and dilution properties of these receiving receptors, the magnitude of pollution 
impacts from discharges is considered to be Negligible. Hence, the significance of 
effect is considered to be Negligible and not significant. 
9.7.44 It envisaged that temporary toilets with appropriate foul waste facility will be in 
place during maintenance operation and all foul waste generated during this period 
will be taken off-site for disposal at appropriate facilities by specialist contractors. 
Accordingly, no impact on water receptors is expected and no further mitigation is 
required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.45 Potential impacts and effects on flood risk and surface water drainage during 
operation are detailed in this section. 
Surface water runoff from impermeable areas  
9.7.46 There will be a change in the existing surface water drainage behaviour and 
storage capacity as a result of the development.  This will result in a reduction in 
infiltration rates compared to existing conditions.  To compensate for this impact, an 
attenuation pond is proposed for the south eastern corner of the Generating 
Equipment Site.  The purpose of the attenuation pond is to attenuate surface water 
runoff in order to maintain the equivalent greenfield runoff. Additional information 
regarding the attenuation pond is in FCA Section 8.4. The discharge will enter the 
ordinary watercourse immediately to the east of the Generating Equipment Site via 
a drainage swale, subject to the agreement of CCS.  An emergency overflow will be 
provided to the attenuation pond to prevent the site becoming inundated in the 
event of an extreme rainfall event. 
9.7.47 The sensitivity of the receptor (Generating Equipment Site) is considered to be 
High as a result of the Generating Equipment Site coinciding with an area of high 
risk of surface water, and historic (Dam Zone B), flooding.  The magnitude of the 
impact is considered to be Negligible through the embedded attenuation 
mitigation.  The significance of the permanent effect is therefore considered to be 
Minor and Not significant. 
9.7.48 For the Access Road, and internal roads, it is proposed that roadside swales or 
infiltration drains will be used to remove and convey surface water from the road 
surface. Alternatively, where there are space constraints, the new site roads will be 
kerbed and drain via road gullies with pollution control measures. It is proposed that 
roadside swales will discharge to the nearest local watercourse, attenuated the 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

AECOM 
 
9-44 
 
existing greenfield runoff rate.  The sensitivity of the Access Road as a flood risk 
receptor is considered to be Negligible since the Access Road is in a very low 
flood risk area.  The magnitude of the impact is considered to be Low through 
embedded mitigation.  The significance of the permanent effect is therefore 
considered to be Negligible, and Not significant. 
 
Drainage System Modifications (diversions of ditches for cut offs including Gas 
Connection diversion, swales) 
9.7.49 The existing site benefits from a combination of ordinary watercourses and 
drainage ditches that drain surface water towards the Afon Llan main river.  The 
presence of the development may impede existing surface water flow paths.  Cut 
off drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill site perimeter of the 
Generating Equipment Site.  The new drainage ditches will be designed to divert 
existing surface water runoff around the Project Site and downstream to rejoin the 
existing drainage ditches and local watercourses.  They will also be designed to 
avoid any loss of existing conveyance capacity.  The sensitivity of the Generating 
Equipment Site as a flood risk receptor is considered to be High as a result of the 
Generating Equipment Site coinciding with an area of high risk of surface water and 
historic (Dam Zone B), flooding.  The magnitude of the impact is considered to be 
Negligible through the embedded drainage diversion mitigation.  The significance 
of the permanent effect is therefore considered to be Minor and Not significant. 
9.7.50 The new Access Road may also impede existing surface water drainage channels 
and overland flow routes.  Therefore, existing field drainage that coincides with the 
new Access Road will be culverted or bridged for a short length to allow flow up to 
the 1 in 100 year return period.   This is required in the area to the south of the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station, where the new Access Road extends from the 
existing access road, and swings east and northeast towards the Generating 
Equipment Site.  The sensitivity of the Access Road as a flood risk receptor is 
considered to be Negligible since the Access Road is in a very low flood risk area.  
The magnitude of the impact is considered to be Low.  The significance of the 
permanent effect is therefore considered to be Negligible, and Not significant. 
Water Main Permanent Bridge 
9.7.51 The Water Main will be crossed by a single, permanent access bridge replacing the 
temporary one for construction to allow access from the new Access Road and 
Laydown Area.  This section of road will be built on an embankment above the 
easement or on a suspended bridge structure. The embankment would include 
open pipes to allow surface water run-off from the north to drain through and the 
suspended bridge option allows surface water to flow unhindered underneath 
without being impeded.  It is considered that the sensitivity of the bridge to flood 
risk is Low because the crossing is in an area of low risk of surface water flooding.  
The predicted magnitude of the impact is Negligible through the implementation of 
embedded mitigation to avoid flow impedance.  The significance of the permanent 
effect is therefore considered to be Negligible and Not significant.

9-45 
 
Impedance and storage of overland flow route 
9.7.52 There is an existing overland flow route that crosses the eastern boundary of the 
Generating Equipment Site, which also flanks an ordinary watercourse immediately 
east.  This route, according to NRW surface water maps is considered to be 
‘medium to high’ risk of surface water flooding. Part of this overland flow route 
could enter the Generating Equipment Site because of the raised topography of the 
land surrounding the northern tip of the Project Site.  To mitigate this potential 
impact, localised land reprofiling and appropriate orientation of the uphill perimeter 
ditch is planned.  In the event that some flow does enter the site, the onsite 
drainage and surface water attenuation storage in the south eastern corner has 
been designed to accommodate it. 
9.7.53 There is land raising at the Generating Equipment Site, which could impede the 
existing overland flow route to be diverted along the eastern boundary of the 
Project Site. CCS have noted the need to retain access to this overland flow path 
along the eastern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site.  This means it 
should be kept clear and formalised to encourage water downslope and away from 
the development towards the Ecological Mitigation Area to the south. By taking 
these steps, it would provide the access easement required by CCS for 
maintenance access to the watercourse.  This would need to be subject to an 
agreement between APL and CCS, but legislation permits access by CCS for up to 
7 m either side of the ordinary watercourse. 
9.7.54 The sensitivity of the Generating Equipment Site receptor as a flood risk receptor is 
considered to be High as a result of the Project Site coinciding with an area of high 
risk of surface water, and historic (DAM Zone B) flooding.  The magnitude of the 
impact is considered to be Negligible through the embedded mitigation to 
accommodate and retain the overland flow path.  The significance of the permanent 
effect is therefore considered to be Minor. 
n) Operational effects - Gas Connection 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.55 A detailed description of the activities at the Gas Connection point during this phase 
is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. From a water quality and 
resources point of view, no impact is expected to arise from the Gas Connection 
during the operational phase of the Project. The effects are not material during the 
operation of the Project and have been scoped out of the assessment. No 
mitigation is therefore required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.56 The only permanent structure constructed for the Gas Connection is the Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) at the connection to the National Gas Transmission 
System (Figure 3.4), which will change the infiltration capacity of the ground.   
9.7.57 The installation will have exposed plant on reinforced foundations with gravel 
surfacing in between.  The detailed layout will be determined in the next design 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES

AECOM 
 
9-46 
 
phase.  It is anticipated that, like the main Generating Equipment Site, 
infrastructure will be identified to appropriately attenuate surface water runoff in 
order to maintain the equivalent greenfield runoff.  The total size of the AGI, 
including access spur road is approximately 0.3 ha.  The sensitivity of theAGI as a 
flood risk receptor receptor is considered to be Low as a result of the AGI being 
located in an area of very low surface water risk.  The magnitude of the impact is 
considered to be Negligible through the embedded attenuation mitigation. The 
significance of the permanent effect is therefore considered to be Negligible and 
Not significant. 
o) Operational effects – Electrical Connection 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.58 Detailed description of the activities at the Electrical Connection during the 
operational phase is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. For 
water quality and resources, no impact is expected to arise from the Electrical 
Connection location during the operational phase of the Project. The effects are not 
material during the operation of the Electrical Connection and have therefore been 
scoped out of the assessment. No mitigation is therefore required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.59 For flooding, no impact is expected to arise from the Electrical Connection during 
the operational phase of the Electrical Connection. The effects are not material 
during the operation of the Electrical Connection and have therefore been scoped 
out of the assessment. No mitigation is therefore required. 
p) Decommissioning effects – Power Generation Plant 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.60 The assessment has considered the effects of decommissioning the Power 
Generation Plant after 25 years. At that time, the Generating Equipment would be 
removed and the Generating Equipment Site re-instated to a similar condition as 
before construction. The decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar 
duration to construction i.e. 22 months.  Based on the principle of the construction 
effects being wholly reversed, the assessment considers that decommissioning will 
not result in any change to the effects identified for construction and operation. The 
significance of effects would be Negligible and no further mitigation is required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.61 Reinstatement of the Power Generation Plant to the existing characteristics would 
bring back the drainage benefits of the existing ‘greenfield’ characteristics. The 
significance of effects would be Negligible and no further mitigation is required.  
q) Decommissioning effects – Gas Connection 
9.7.62 The assessment has also considered the effects of decommissioning Gas 
Connection after 25 years. It is probable that the Gas Connection may be left in situ 
as this is likely to cause less environmental effects than removal. 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-47 
 
9.7.63 Assuming the gas pipeline is left in situ, no impact from the Gas Connection on 
water quality and resources and flooding is expected during the decommissioning 
phase of the Project and no additional mitigation is required. 
r) 
Decommissioning effects – Electrical Connection 
9.7.64 As for the Gas Connection, no impact from the Electrical Connection on water 
quality and resources and flooding is expected during this phase of the Project. 
Accordingly no additional mitigation is required. 
9.8 
Water Framework Directive Assessment 
9.8.1 
This section provides a summary of the Water Framework Directive Assessment 
(WFD) of the WFD water bodies likely to be impacted by the Project. A separate 
assessment to the EIA required to satisfy the objectives of the WFD is provided in 
Appendix 9.2 and should be read along this section of the PEIR. 
9.8.2 
It is envisaged that the construction works will require diversion of existing ordinary 
watercourses (i.e. watercourses that are not WFD designated water bodies, but are 
tributaries to WFD designated water bodies) currently crossing the Generating 
Equipment Site to instead run around the perimeter of the Generating Equipment 
Site. This diversion is expected not to significantly affect the general drainage 
paths, flow regime or connectivity of watercourses in the area. It is also anticipated 
that bankside vegetation lost on the Generating Equipment Site will be returned 
along the route of the new watercourses. There may be some short-term loss of 
habitat while vegetation establishes, however, no reduction is expected in the 
longer term. 
9.8.3 
The Project will involve culverting of ordinary watercourses (i.e. watercourses that 
are not WFD designated water bodies) where these are crossed by the Access 
Road. In accordance with the embedded design mitigation the crossings will be 
designed so as not to restrict flood flows, to maintain a natural bed through the 
structure, and where necessary to include specific measures to maintain species 
connectivity through the structure such as otter ledges. There will be some 
permanent loss of bankside habitat at the culverts. However, this will be for short 
lengths only and is therefore not expected to affect the integrity of the aquatic 
ecosystems significantly. 
9.8.4 
There is an existing pond on the Power Generation Plant which supports aquatic 
ecology and ecological habitat. The embedded mitigation provides for a permanent 
attenuation pond for the Project, which will be sited close to this location, including 
suitable habitat insofar as this does not compromise the storage volume.. 
Consequently, no significant permanent loss of habitat is, therefore, envisaged with 
these mitigation measures implemented. 
9.8.5 
The Project will incorporate appropriate SuDS and proprietary products as part of 
both its embedded and additional mitigation to provide adequate water treatment 
before discharging from the Project Site to any nearby ordinary (i.e. tributaries to 
WFD designated) water bodies or main (WFD designated) water bodies in 
Abergelli 2018 PEIR – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-48 
 
accordance with current guidance. It is predicted that even with these mitigation 
measures in place, slight changes in the water quality of the receiving water bodies 
may occur. However, due to dispersion and dilution, changes that will cause a fall in 
one class of any relevant element of the WFD water quality elements is unlikely. 
Consequently, while the Project may create a slight change in the water quality of 
WFD surface and groundwater bodies nearby, this will not threaten the current 
status of the water bodies and therefore does not pose a risk to achieving the 
objectives of the WFD. 
9.8.6 
Risks during construction will be temporary and will not cause any long term effects 
beyond the construction phase. The construction works will therefore not pose a 
risk to achieving the objectives of the WFD. 
9.9 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
9.9.1 
As a general rule, additional mitigation measures are proposed where a significant 
effect is predicted to occur.  Embedded mitigation measures, which have been 
incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice measures that 
have been committed to are summarised in the Outline CEMP in Appendix 3.1. 
9.9.2 
It is considered that no additional mitigation is required, to supplement the identified 
embedded mitigation effects.  The implemented embedded mitigation should result 
in minor or less significant risks from the operation of the Project. 
9.9.3 
No monitoring is proposed to supplement and verify the embedded mitigation 
proposed, which will be delivered via the Outline CEMP.

a) Project “in combination” Effects 
9.10.2 From the perspective of both water quality and flood risk, there are no significant 
effects likely to arise from any elements of the Project during the different phases of 
the Project Life. Therefore, overall, it has been considered that there is no 
significant effect predicted for the Project.   
9.11 
Cumulative Effects 
a) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Construction and Demolition 
9.11.1 There is no potential for cumulative impacts on Water Quality and Resources and 
Flooding as a result of construction of the whole Project through the three different 
project elements, and also in combination with other schemes. None of the impacts 
identified in the assessment for the Project are considered to be significant, no 
significant cumulative impacts are predicted and therefore no significant cumulative 
effects are predicted. 
b) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Operation 
9.11.2 There is no potential for cumulative impacts on Water Quality and Resources and 
Flooding as a result of operation of the Project in combination with the identified 
other schemes. None of the impacts identified in the assessment for the Project are 
considered to be significant, no significant cumulative impacts are predicted and 
therefore no significant cumulative effects are predicted.
