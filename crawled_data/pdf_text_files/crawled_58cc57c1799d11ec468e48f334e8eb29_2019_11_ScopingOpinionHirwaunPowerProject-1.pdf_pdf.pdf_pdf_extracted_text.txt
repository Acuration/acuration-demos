EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This is the Scoping Opinion (the Opinion) provided by the Secretary of 
State in respect of the content of the Environmental Statement for 
Hirwaun Power Project, Aberdare, Mid-Glamorgan, South Wales. The 
proposal is for a new thermal generating station on land at the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate in Aberdare, South Wales. The power generation plant 
will be designed to provide an electrical output of up to 299MWa and 
would be fuelled by natural gas.  
This report sets out the Secretary of State’s opinion on the basis of the 
information provided in Hirwaun Power Limited’s report entitled Hirwaun 
Power Project Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping report ( May 
2013). The Opinion can only reflect the proposals as currently described 
by the Applicant.  
The Secretary of State has consulted on the Scoping Report and the 
responses received have been taken into account in adopting this Opinion. 
The Secretary of State is satisfied that the topic areas identified in the 
Scoping Report encompass those matters identified in Schedule 4, Part 1, 
paragraph 19 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended). 
The Secretary of State draws attention both to the general points and 
those made in respect of each of the specialist topic areas in this Opinion. 
The main potential issues identified are  
• 
Air quality; 
• 
Ecology; 
• 
Water resources; 
• 
Geology, ground conditions and land use; 
•

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Background 
1.1 
On 13th May 2013, the Secretary of State (SoS) received a scoping 
report submitted by Hirwaun Power Limited (the Applicant) under 
Regulation 8 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2263) (as amended) (the EIA 
Regulations) in order to request a scoping opinion for the proposed 
Hirwaun Power Project. This Scoping Opinion is made in response 
to this request and should be read in conjunction with the 
Applicant’s Scoping Report. 
1.2 
In submitting the information included in their request for a 
scoping opinion, the Applicant is deemed to have notified the SoS 
under Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations that it proposes to 
provide an ES in respect of the proposed Project Name. Therefore 
the 
proposed 
development 
is 
determined 
to 
be 
an 
EIA 
development in accordance with Regulation 4(2)(a) of the EIA 
Regulations. 
1.3 
In a letter dated 13th May 2013 addressed to the SoS and 
accompanying the Scoping Report, the Applicant formally notified 
the SoS under Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations that it 
proposes to provide an 
ES in respect of the proposed 
development. Therefore, in accordance with Regulation 4(2)(a) of 
the EIA Regulations, the proposed development is determined to 
be EIA development. The EIA Regulations enable an applicant, 
before making an application for an order granting development 
consent, to ask the SoS to state in writing their formal opinion (a 
‘scoping opinion’) on the information to be provided in the 
environmental statement (ES).   
1.4 
The proposed development concerns the construction of an 
onshore electricity generating station with a heat output of 300 
megawatts or more. It falls within the description of a Schedule 1 
development under the EIA regulations as being an infrastructure 
project. An EIA is mandatory for a Schedule 1 development.    
1.5 
Before adopting a scoping opinion the SoS must take into account: 
(a) the specific characteristics of the particular development; 
(b) the specific characteristics of the development of the type 
concerned; and 
(c) environmental 
features 
likely 
to 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
development’.  
(EIA Regulation 8 (9)) 
 
 
 
Page 2 
 
 
                                        
1.6 
This Opinion sets out what information the SoS considers should 
be included in the ES for the proposed development. The Opinion 
has taken account of:  
i 
the EIA Regulations  
ii 
the nature and scale of the proposed development  
iii 
the nature of the receiving environment, and 
iv 
current best practice in the preparation of environmental 
statements.  
1.7 
The SoS has also taken account of the responses received from 
the statutory consultees (see Appendix 2 of this Opinion). The 
matters addressed by the Applicant have been carefully considered 
and use has been made of professional judgement and experience 
in order to adopt this Opinion. It should be noted that when it 
comes to consider the ES, the SoS will take account of relevant 
legislation and guidelines (as appropriate). The SoS will not be 
precluded from requiring additional information if it is considered 
necessary in connection with the ES submitted with that 
application when considering the application for a development 
consent order (DCO). 
1.8 
This Opinion should not be construed as implying that the SoS 
agrees with the information or comments provided by the 
Applicant in their request for an opinion from the SoS. In 
particular, comments from the SoS in this Opinion are without 
prejudice to any decision taken by the SoS (on submission of the 
application) that any development identified by the Applicant is 
necessarily to be treated as part of a nationally significant 
infrastructure project (NSIP), or associated development, or 
development that does not require development consent. 
1.9 
Regulation 8(3) of the EIA Regulations states that a request for a 
scoping opinion must include:  
(a) ‘a plan sufficient to identify the land; 
(b) a brief description of the nature and purpose of the 
development and of its possible effects on the environment; 
and 
(c) such other information or representations as the person 
making the request may wish to provide or make’. 
(EIA Regulation 8 (3)) 
1.10 
The SoS considers that this has been provided in the Applicant’s 
Scoping Report.

The Secretary of State’s Consultation 
1.11 
The SoS has a duty under Regulation 8(6) of the EIA Regulations 
to consult widely before adopting a scoping opinion. A full list of 
the consultation bodies is provided at Appendix 1. The list has 
been compiled by the SoS under their duty to notify the consultees 
in accordance with Regulation 9(1)(a). The Applicant should note 
that whilst the SoS list can inform their consultation, it should not 
be relied upon for that purpose.   
1.12 
The list of respondents who replied within the statutory timeframe 
and whose comments have been taken into account in the 
preparation of this Opinion is provided at Appendix 2 along with 
copies of their comments, to which the Applicant should refer in 
undertaking the EIA. 
1.13 
The 
ES 
submitted 
by 
the 
Applicant 
should 
demonstrate 
consideration of the points raised by the consultation bodies. It is 
recommended that a table is provided in the ES summarising the 
scoping responses from the consultation bodies and how they are, 
or are not, addressed in the ES. 
1.14 
Any consultation responses received after the statutory deadline 
for receipt of comments will not be taken into account within this 
Opinion. Late responses will be forwarded to the Applicant and will 
be made available on the Planning Inspectorate’s website. The 
Applicant should also give due consideration to those comments in 
carrying out the EIA.

2.0 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT 
Introduction 
2.1 
The following is a summary of the information on the proposed 
development and its site and surroundings prepared by the 
Applicant and included in their Scoping Report. The information 
has not been verified and it has been assumed that the 
information provided reflects the existing knowledge of the 
proposed development and the potential receptors/resources. 
The Applicant’s Information 
Overview of the Proposed Development 
2.2 
The proposed Hirwaun Power Project comprises the construction of 
a new gas fired thermal generating station with an electrical 
output of up to 299 MWe, and thermal output in the order of 400-
950MW (depending on the final technology choice). 
2.3 
Section 1.2 of the Scoping Report has identified the following 
principal components of the proposed development:   
• 
a gas fired power station capable of providing up to 299 MWe 
and thermal output in the order of 400-950MW; 
• 
a new electrical connection to export power from the new 
generation plant to the National Grid; and 
• 
a new gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the 
power generation plant from the National Gas Transmission 
System (NTS). 
 
Description of the site and surroundings  
The Application Site 
2.4 
The application site is situated entirely within the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate and covers an area of approximately 7.5 ha. The 
site is entirely within the jurisdiction of Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council. The site is located close to the Brecon Beacons 
National Park, administered by the Brecon Beacons National Park 
Authority.  
2.5 
The site and surrounding area are characterised by industrial 
buildings.  There are areas of scrub, grassland and plantation 
woodland.  
2.6 
The proposal is for a power generation plant; gas connection and 
electrical connection. An existing warehouse building covers a 
large proportion of the proposed plant area. A plantation woodland 
 
 
 
Page 5 
 
 
                                        
partly surrounds the site. The proposed plant site is approximately 
500m to the south of a proposed Energy from Waste plant, 
planning consent for which was granted in 2010.  The plant is 
proposed to process 150,000 tonnes per year of waste by 2015 
and 240,000 tonnes per year by 2016.   
2.7 
Land to the south of Hirwaun has been designated a Strategic  Site 
that has been allocated for 400 homes, 89 ha of employment use, 
a new primary school, a 2000 square metre retail store, 
medical/community facilities and informal recreation.  
2.8 
Access is currently via Main Avenue and Fourth Avenue which run 
through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
2.9 
The gas connection would comprise a new gas pipeline which 
would connect the plant site with Feeder 2 (Garway to Rhigos 
pipeline) on the NTS. The existing pipeline runs south and east of 
the plant site. Four route corridor options are being considered for 
their suitability. The corridor options will be refined to a single 
route prior to submission of the DCO application. Route corridor 
options for the gas connection are shown on Figure 3 of the 
Scoping Report. 
2.10 
There are two corridors for electrical connections being considered 
to export power to the National Grid. The proposal is for a new 
400kV 
electricity 
export 
cable, 
either 
overground 
line 
or 
underground cable to the new Rhigos Substation. A new 
switchyard is also proposed, to be contained within the plant site. 
The potential route corridor options are shown on Figure 3 of the 
Scoping Report. The options for electrical connections will be 
refined to a single connection route prior to submission of the DCO 
application. 
The Surrounding Area 
2.11 
The Brecon Beacons National Park lies to the north of the site, 
administered by the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority. The 
area immediately surrounding the site is within the jurisdiction of 
the Rhonda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC), and 
comprises 
a 
mixture 
of 
urban, 
semi-suburban 
and 
rural 
communities situated in mountains and lowland farmland. 
2.12 
The closest residential areas include: Rhigos (1.3km to the south 
west); Hirwaun (1.4km to the east); Penderyn (1.8km to the 
north); and Aberdare (5km to the east) 
2.13 
Section 5.5 of the Scoping Report refers to the presence of six 
statutory designated sites for nature conservation within a 2km 
search radius: Brecon Beacons National Park; Woodland Park and 
Pontpren Site of Special Scientific Interest; Cors Bryn-y-Gaer 
SSSI; Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation; Coedydd Nedd a 
Melte SAC; and Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Melte Moel Penderyn SSSI. 
 
 
 
Page 6 
 
 
                                        
There are seven Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
identified within 2km of the plant site. There are 10 protected 
species identified within 1km of the plant site. 
2.14 
A number of water bodies have been identified in the vicinity of 
the plant site – Penderyn reservoir; numerous drainage ditches 
and several small ponds on agricultural land to the south of Rhigos 
Road, and Hirwaun Ponds. 
2.15 
Initial searches within 2km of the plant site have identified three 
listed buildings; colliery buildings at Tower Colliery; a group of 
listed buildings and structures in Hirwaun, including the War 
Memorial and Clock Tower, and Old House with outbuildings at 
Trebanog fach. There are larger clusters of listed buildings just 
beyond the 2km search area in Pentreclwydau, Aberdare and 
Penderyn. An entry on the National Monuments Record of Wales, 
associated with the former Hirwaun Royal Armaments Factory is 
recorded 50m (approx.) to the north of the Plant site. 
Description of the Proposed Development  
2.16 
The Proposed Power Generation Station Complex plant dimensions 
will be in the order of 2.4ha and would be designed to provide a 
total output of up to 299 MWe (gross capacity) at rated site 
conditions. The choice of plant and technology are not yet 
confirmed but will comprise either one or a combination of the 
following: 
• 
a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; 
• 
a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant; or  
• 
a Reciprocating Gas Ignition Engine (RGE) plant. 
2.17 
Section 3.3.5 onwards of the Scoping Report provides details of 
components required for a CCGT plant and describes the operation 
of such infrastructure; Section 3.3.15 onwards provides the 
components required and operational information for a SCGT plant 
and Section 3.3.22 provides details of the components and 
operational information of a RGE plant. Indicative dimensions of 
the main plant components are provided in Table 3.1 of the 
Scoping Report. 
2.18 
An underground gas connection of between 1.1km and 1.71km in 
length, depending on which connection corridor is chosen, would 
be required to connect the proposed power generation plant to 
Feeder 2 of the gas NTS. Inserts 5-8 of the Scoping Report show 
the options for the potential Gas Connection Corridors which are 
also shown together on Figure 3 of the Scoping Report. 
2.19 
Connection to the NTS would require the installation of a Minimum 
Offtake Connection (MOC) facility of around 30m x 30m and a 
Pipeline Inspection Gauge Trap facility (PTF) of around 30m x 
 
 
 
Page 7 
 
 
                                        
23m. The pipeline would be buried to a depth of cover in 
accordance with industry standards which is no less than 1.2m in 
agricultural land; no less than 2m under road crossings; and no 
less than 1.7m under water crossings.  
2.20 
An electrical connection is proposed to connect the power 
generation plant to a new substation at Rhigos which will require a 
dedicated 400kV cable of between 60-475m in length. The 
substation is expected to be completed by 2016 when the Pen y 
Cymoedd wind farm is due to be connected. The Scoping Report 
expresses uncertainty over whether the connection will comprise 
overhead line or underground cable. 
2.21 
Two indicative route corridors for the electrical connection have 
been provided in the Scoping Report, shown on Inserts 9-10. 
2.22 
The electric cable may be buried or an overhead line may be used.  
2.23 
An overhead line, if required, would be likely to have tower heights 
ranging between 35m and 60m depending on design requirements  
2.24 
Sections 3.3.40 – 3.3.42 of the Scoping Report refer to the 
possibility of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) being part of the 
proposed development but this is to be the subject of further 
assessment. 
Proposed Access  
2.25 
The site is accessed by road via Main Avenue and Fourth Avenue 
both of which run through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. The A465 
“Heads of the Valleys” Road runs 0.1km (approx) to the north of 
the site. 
Construction  
2.26 
The laydown area for storage of plant and equipment during 
construction will be within the red line boundary of the power 
generation plant as shown in Figures 1 and 2 of the Scoping 
Report. 
2.27 
Section 3.3.33 of the Scoping Report states that construction and 
commissioning 
of 
the 
proposed 
development 
will 
take 
approximately 12 to 36 months, depending on the final choice of 
plant technology. 
2.28 
The main works associated with the construction phase include: 
• 
demolition of existing buildings; 
• 
the removal of old foundations and hardstanding; 
• 
excavation and site levelling for new foundations; 
• 
potential piling; and  
 
 
 
Page 8 
 
 
                                        
• 
the laying of the gas and electrical connection. 
2.29 
Section 5.3.29 of the Scoping Report refers to the production of a 
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) which is to 
be provided. 
2.30 
Expected transport during the construction phase includes: civil 
works traffic; mechanical works traffic and heavy/abnormal loads. 
2.31 
Section 5.10.1 of the Scoping Report states that there are likely to 
be large items of plant involved in the construction of all aspects 
of the development. 
Operation and Maintenance 
2.32 
The power generation plant would have an operational life of 25 
years 
after 
which 
it 
would 
either 
be 
re-powered 
or 
decommissioned. For the purpose of the EIA, the Scoping Report 
has assumed that it will be decommissioned. 
2.33 
At its peak, construction is expected to employ between 150 and 
250 personnel. Operation would require from 10 to 30 full time 
staff, depending on which technology is used.  
Decommissioning 
2.34 
Section 3.3.37 of the Scoping Report states that decommissioning 
would involve the removal of all power generation plant items and 
restoration of the site to a similar, pre-construction condition.  
2.35 
Gas and electricity connections may be left in situ to avoid any 
adverse environmental impacts associated with their removal. 
2.36 
Items of plant would be recycled or re-used where possible. 
 
The Secretary of State’s Comments  
Description of the Application Site and Surrounding Area  
2.37 
In addition to detailed baseline information to be provided within 
topic specific chapters of the ES, the SoS is pleased to note the 
inclusion of a section that summarises the site and surroundings. 
This will establish the context for the proposed development 
including relevant designations and sensitive receptors. This 
section should identify land that could be directly or indirectly 
affected by the proposed development and any associated 
auxiliary facilities, landscaping areas and potential off site 
mitigation or compensation schemes. 
 
 
 
Page 9 
 
 
                                        
2.38 
The energy centre application site and the surrounding area are 
clearly described within the Scoping Report and it is expected that 
a comprehensive description would also be provided within the ES. 
2.39 
The Secretary of State notes that gas and electricity connections 
will be required for the project, and that the various potential 
routes for these connections are described in the Scoping Report.  
The Scoping Report, at Section 3.2, provides a brief description of 
the site and its surroundings but this description appears to only 
cover the power station site.  The Applicant is reminded that the 
ES must address all the effects of the different project elements 
applied for under the DCO.  If gas and electrical connections are 
included within the DCO then the ES should also include a clear 
description of the chosen routes and their associate environmental 
effects, including the identification of designated areas and 
sensitive receptors. 
Description of the Proposed Development  
2.40 
The Applicant should ensure that the description of the proposed 
development that is being applied for is as accurate and firm as 
possible as this will form the basis of the environmental impact 
assessment. It is understood that at this stage in the evolution of 
the scheme the description of the proposals and even the location 
of the site may not be confirmed. The Applicant should be aware 
however, that the description of the development in the ES must 
be sufficiently certain to meet the requirements of paragraph 17 of 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations and there should 
therefore be more certainty by the time the ES is submitted with 
the DCO.  
2.41 
The SoS notes from Sections 3.3.40 – 3.3.42 of the Scoping 
Report, that consideration will be given to CHP in accordance with 
Section 4.6 of National Policy Statement EN-1. The ES should 
provide clear evidence to show that the possibilities of CHP have 
been fully explored and clearly state whether it is intended to 
bring CHP forward as part of the proposed scheme. 
2.42 
The SoS notes from Section 3.3.38-3.3.39 of the Scoping Report 
that the proposed development will be of 299MWe and therefore 
excluded from the requirement of National Policy Statement EN – 
1 to be designed to be carbon capture ready.  
2.43 
If a draft DCO is to be submitted, the Applicant should clearly 
define what elements of the proposed development are integral to 
the NSIP and which will require consent under different regimes. 
Any proposed works consented under regimes other than the 
Planning Act 2008 processes may generate cumulative effects with 
the project which must be addressed in the ES.  
 
 
 
Page 10 
 
 
                                        
2.44 
The SoS recommends that the ES should include a clear 
description of all aspects of the proposed development, at the 
construction, operation and decommissioning stages, and include: 
• 
Land use requirements;  
• 
Site preparation; 
• 
Construction processes and methods; 
• 
Transport routes; 
• 
Operational requirements including the main characteristics 
of the production process and the nature and quantity of 
materials used, as well as waste arisings and their disposal; 
• 
Maintenance activities including any potential environmental 
impacts; and 
• 
Emissions- water, air and soil pollution, noise, vibration, light, 
heat, radiation. 
2.45 
The environmental effects of all wastes to be processed and 
removed from the site should be addressed. The ES will need to 
identify and describe the control processes and mitigation 
procedures for storing and transporting waste off site. All waste 
types should be quantified and classified.  
Flexibility  
2.46 
The SoS notes the comments in the Scoping Report that the 
detailed design of the power station is still being developed and 
that the draft description of development contains a number of 
variables. The SoS welcomes the intention to firm up the proposals  
during the pre-application stages and encourages consultation with 
relevant bodies. The description of the proposed development in 
the ES will need to be as accurate and firm as possible so that the 
EIA can robustly support the DCO application. 
2.47 
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the ‘Flexibility’ section in 
Appendix 3 of this Opinion which provides additional details.  
2.48 
The Applicant should make every attempt to narrow the range of 
options and explain clearly in the ES which elements of the 
scheme have yet to be finalised and provide the reasons. At the 
time of application, any proposed scheme parameters should not 
be so wide ranging as to represent effectively different schemes. 
The scheme parameters will need to be clearly defined in the draft 
DCO and therefore in the accompanying ES. It is a matter for the 
Applicant, in preparing an ES, to consider whether it is possible to 
robustly assess a range of impacts resulting from a large number 
of undecided parameters. The description of the proposed 
development in the ES must not be so wide that it is insufficiently 
certain to comply with requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 
Part 1 of the EIA Regulations. 
 
 
 
Page 11 
 
 
                                        
2.49 
It should be noted that if the proposed development changes 
substantially 
during 
the 
EIA 
process, 
prior 
to 
application 
submission, the Applicant may wish to consider the need to 
request a new Scoping Opinion. 
Proposed Access 
2.50 
It is noted that the access arrangements for the gas and electricity 
connections have not been determined and will be developed 
through 
further 
studies. 
The 
SoS 
would 
anticipate 
a 
comprehensive description of the temporary and permanent 
access to all sites to be provided within the ES. 
Construction  
2.51 
The SoS considers that information on construction including: 
phasing of programme; construction methods and activities 
associated with each phase; siting of construction compounds 
(including on and off site); lighting equipment/requirements; and 
number, movements and parking of construction vehicles (both 
HGVs and staff) should be clearly indicated in the ES.  
2.52 
The SoS  that an outline Construction Environmental Management 
Plan (CEMP) be appended to the ES providing details of specific 
mitigation measures required to reduce construction related 
impacts. 
Operation and Maintenance 
2.53 
The Scoping Report does not provide information regarding the 
operation and maintenance requirements for the power station or 
the electricity and gas connections. The ES should clearly describe 
these requirements for all elements of the development and 
should cover but not be limited to such matters as:  the number of 
full/part-time jobs; the operational hours and if appropriate, shift 
patterns; the number and types of vehicle movements generated 
during the operational stage. 
Decommissioning 
2.54 
In terms of decommissioning, the SoS welcomes the initial 
consideration of decommissioning. Whilst it is acknowledged that 
information on the decommissioning strategy may not be fully 
developed at this early stage, the purpose of such a long term 
assessment is to enable the decommissioning of the works to be 
taken into account in the design and use of materials such that 
structures can be taken down with the minimum of disruption. The 
SoS advises that as much detail as possible on the proposed 
approach, including the process and methods of decommissioning, 
is provided within the ES to ensure that the long term assessment 
can consider the impacts of decommissioning for each element of 
the proposed scheme.

3.0 EIA APPROACH AND TOPIC AREAS 
Introduction 
3.1 
This section contains the SoS’s specific comments on the approach 
to the ES and topic areas as set out in the Scoping Report. General 
advice on the presentation of an ES is provided at Appendix 3 of 
this Scoping Opinion and should be read in conjunction with this 
Section.  
3.2 
Applicants are advised that the scope of the DCO application 
should be clearly addressed and assessed consistently within the 
ES.  
ES Approach 
3.3 
The information provided in the Scoping Report sets out the 
proposed approach to the preparation of the ES in Table 4.1 of the 
Scoping Report. Whilst early engagement on the scope of the ES is 
to be welcomed, the SoS notes that the level of information 
provided at this stage is not always sufficient to allow for detailed 
comments from either the SoS or the consultees.  
3.4 
The Applicant should ensure that appropriate consultation is 
undertaken with the relevant consultees in order to agree 
wherever possible the timing and relevance of survey work as well 
as the methodologies to be used. The SoS notes and welcomes the 
intention to finalise the scope of investigations for some topics in 
conjunction with ongoing stakeholder liaison and consultation with 
the relevant regulatory authorities and their advisors.  The SoS 
recommends that this approach be applied to all the topics within 
the ES. 
3.5 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas 
should be identified under all the environmental topics and should 
be sufficiently robust in order to undertake the assessment. The 
extent of the study areas should be on the basis of recognised 
professional guidance, whenever such guidance is available. The 
study areas should also be agreed with the relevant consultees 
and, where this is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the 
ES and a reasoned justification given. The scope should also cover 
the breadth of the topic area and the temporal scope, and these 
aspects should be described and justified. 
Matters to be Scoped Out 
3.6 
The Applicant has identified in the relevant sections of the Scoping 
Report the matters proposed to be ‘scoped out’. These include:  
• 
Odours generated by the operation of the Power Generation 
Plant; 
 
 
 
Page 13 
 
 
                                        
• 
Noise resulting from the operation of the gas connection; 
• 
Noise resulting from the operation of the electrical connection 
if the connection is underground; 
3.7 
Matters are not scoped out unless specifically addressed and 
justified by the Applicant, and confirmed as being scoped out by 
the SoS.   
3.8 
The Scoping Report states that it is unlikely that there will be any 
noticeable odours associated with the operation of the Power 
Generation Plant at or beyond the boundary of the project site.  As 
a result, it is not considered necessary to carry out a detailed 
assessment of odour.  The SoS is satisfied that these effects can 
be scoped out. 
3.9 
The SoS notes the comments regarding the assessment of noise 
during operation for the gas and the electricity connections.  Based 
on the assumption that the connections will be below ground, the 
SoS agrees to this.  The noise generated by the operation of all 
above ground installations will require assessment within the ES. 
3.10 
Where topics are scoped out prior to submission of the DCO 
application, the ES should still explain the reasoning and justify 
the approach taken, in order to demonstrate that topics have not 
simply been overlooked. 
ES Structure  
3.11 
Section 4.2 of the Scoping Report sets out the proposed structure 
of the ES.  The SoS notes that the gas and electrical connections 
will be reported on separately to the main impacts of the Power 
Generation Plant.  The SoS advises that the Applicant must ensure 
that any cumulative effects generated by interactions of different 
project elements are fully addressed. 
3.12 
The SoS notes the reference to National Policy Statements (NPS) 
in section 2.4 of the Scoping Report.  The Applicant is reminded 
that they must ensure that their ES provides the necessary 
evidence to allow the SoS to assess the potential impacts of the 
project as outlined in the relevant NPS. 
3.13 
The SoS notes from Table 4.1 of the Scoping Report that the EIA 
would cover a number of assessments under the broad headings 
of:  
• 
Air quality; 
• 
Noise and vibration; 
• 
Ecology; 
• 
Water resources; 
• 
Geology, ground conditions and land use; 
 
 
 
Page 14 
 
 
                                        
• 
Landscape and visual; 
• 
Waste Management; 
• 
Traffic, Transport and Access; 
• 
Cultural heritage and archaeology; 
• 
Socio-economics; 
• 
Electromagnetic fields (EMF), and 
• 
Cumulative assessment. 
3.14 
The SoS recommends that the ES should include a description of 
the proposed construction programme and methods and any 
additional land needed during the construction period if this is part 
of the DCO application.  This information should be used to inform 
the assessment of construction impacts. 
3.15 
Table 4.2 of the Scoping Report lists additional environmental 
information that will be supplied with the DCO in addition to the 
ES: 
• 
Design and access statement; 
• 
Flood risk assessment; 
• 
Planning statement; 
• 
Climate change/sustainability assessment; 
• 
Consultation report; 
• 
Statement to inform Habitats Regulations Assessment; 
• 
Site Waste Management Plan; 
• 
Surface Water Management Plan. 
3.16 
In this regard, the SoS draws attention to recent guidance: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-act-2008-
application-form.   
3.17 
The flood risk assessment does not need to be a completely 
separate plan or report but could be included as an Appendix to 
the relevant chapter of the environmental statement, provided it is 
appropriately referenced 
3.18 
The SoS welcomes the Applicant’s proposal to take into account 
the effects of climate change and requires any adaptation 
measures to be based on the latest set of UK Climate Projections, 
the Government’s latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment and 
in consultation with Natural Resources Wales.   
3.19 
The SoS notes the inclusion of Section 3.6 of the Scoping Report 
which deals with site selection and design evolution.  The SoS 
welcomes the proposal to include a more detailed appraisal of the 
site selection process and design evolution in the ES.  The 
 
 
 
Page 15 
 
 
                                        
Applicant is reminded of the requirement to provide an outline of 
the main alternatives studied as described in Schedule 4 of the 
Infrastructure 
Planning 
(Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment) 
Regulations. 
Topic Areas 
 Air Quality (see Scoping Report Section 5.3)  
3.20 
The use of atmospheric dispersion modelling is welcomed.  The 
SoS notes the intention to discuss the exact study area and 
detailed methodology with statutory consultees.  The SoS 
recommends that both the assessment methodology and the 
sensitive receptors are agreed in consultation with Rhondda Cynon 
Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC), Natural Resources Wales 
(NRW) and the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA).  
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments from the 
BBNPA (see Appendix 2) on the need to include methane in the air 
quality assessment. 
3.21 
It is noted that the air quality modelling and assessment will 
consider impacts at European and nationally designated wildlife 
sites and other ecological sites within 10km of the proposed 
development.  The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments 
from NRW (see Appendix 2) on the need to ensure that all the 
relevant wildlife sites and habitats are considered within the air 
quality assessment.   
3.22 
All assumptions and limitations to assessments, including the 
number, location and height of flue stacks should be clearly 
specified in all relevant sections of the ES.  If details including the 
number, location and height of the flue stacks are not confirmed at 
the point of application the ES should assess operational air quality 
based on a worst case scenario, taking into account other nearby 
pollution sources (existing and proposed).  The implications of 
stack height and dispersion of the discharge should also be clearly 
explained..  
3.23 
Predicted pollutant concentrations should be assessed against the 
applicable standard guideline value (eg relevant European air 
quality limit values and National Air Quality Objectives). 
3.24 
The assessment should take account of the air emissions from the 
proposed development and emissions related to increased 
vehicular movements associated with the proposed development.  
Such information should also inform the ecological assessment. 
3.25 
Changes in air quality and dust levels should be considered not 
only on site but also off site, including along access roads, local 
footpaths and other Public Rights of Way (PROW).  The Applicant’s 
attention is drawn to the comments from NRW (see Appendix 2) 
 
 
 
Page 16 
 
 
                                        
on the need to give particular consideration to the impacts of dust 
on habitats and designated wildlife sites. 
3.26 
The SoS notes the references to embedded mitigation measures 
that will be employed during the construction phase of the project 
in addition to any project specific measures that may be required.  
The SoS advises that the ES must make it clear what mitigation 
measures are proposed, how they will be delivered, how effective 
they will be and what the residual effects would be. 
3.27 
Consideration should be given to monitoring dust complaints. 
3.28 
The ES should also address the inter-relationships with other 
topics within the ES particularly ecology and water quality.  The 
Applicant should also consider whether air quality and health 
issues should be addressed within the ES.  The Applicant’s 
attention is drawn to the advice from Public Health England in 
Appendix 2.  The SoS notes that a worst case assessment of stack 
height in respect of air quality may not constitute a worst case 
assessment in respect of other topic areas. 
 Noise and vibration (see Scoping Report Section 5.4) 
3.29 
The SoS recommends that the methodology and choice of noise 
receptors should be agreed with the relevant Environmental Health 
Department of RCTCBC and with NRW.   The extent of the study 
area should be justified; at present the Scoping Report states that 
it will be defined as the region within 1000m of the proposed 
Power Generation Plant but does not explain the reasoning for this 
choice.  It is also not clear, given that the site layout and 
technology have not been finally identified, how the 1000m study 
area would be established..  These points must be addressed in 
the ES. 
3.30 
Information should be provided on the types of vehicles and plant 
to be used during the construction phase. The noise and vibration 
assessments should take account of the traffic movements along 
access routes, especially during the construction phase. The 
results from the noise and vibration assessments will also provide 
information to inform the ecological assessments.  Exceptional but 
essential operations should be included in the assessment. 
3.31 
The SoS notes that noise monitoring will be undertaken to 
establish the baseline which will then be used in a model, together 
with the sound power levels of proposed plant.  Where sound 
power levels are not available suitable data will be substituted 
although a realistic worst case scenario would always be 
considered.  The SoS advises that the choice of data for use in the 
model and the worst case scenario must be clearly defined and 
justified in the ES.  If aspects of the project have not been fully 
defined at the time of justification (such as the choice of 
 
 
 
Page 17 
 
 
                                        
technology or electrical connection) then the ES should cover each 
of the likely scenarios. 
3.32 
Noise impacts on people should be specifically addressed, and 
particularly any potential noise disturbance at night and other 
unsocial hours such as weekends and public holidays.  
3.33 
Where appropriate, effective measures should be provided to 
mitigate against noise nuisance.  Negative effects of any proposed 
mitigation on other areas of assessment in the EIA should also be 
assessed, such as the contribution of noise barriers or bunds to 
visual impact.  The ES should clearly identify what these measures 
are, how they will be delivered and any residual effects. 
3.34 
Consideration should be given to monitoring noise complaints 
during construction and when the development is operational.  
Ecology (see Scoping Report Section 5.5)  
3.35 
The SoS recommends that surveys should be thorough, up to date 
and take account of other development proposed in the vicinity.  
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments from NRW in 
Appendix 2.  The SoS also recommends that the methodology for 
any surveys should be agreed with NRW and the ecologist from 
RCTCBC. 
3.36 
The reference to Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey in paragraph 
5.5.23 of the Scoping Report appears to be incorrect; from the 
context it appears that this should actually refer to the Desk Based 
Analysis.  The SoS welcomes the intention to carry out extended 
Phase 1 habitat surveys of the gas and electrical connections.  The 
results of these surveys, along with the existing Phase 1 survey 
and any Phase 2 surveys should be reported in the ES.  
3.37 
The potential impacts on international and nationally designated 
sites should be addressed as well as county level habitats. The 
SoS notes the possible need for Statement to Support an 
Appropriate Assessment in view of the development site’s location 
in relation to Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation.  The 
Applicant’s attention is also drawn to the comments from NRW in 
Appendix 2 on the need to consider potential effects on Coedydd 
Nedd a Mellte and Cwm Cadlan Special Areas of Conservation, 
Cwm Cadlan National Nature Reserve and various Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest.  The Applicant should also take note of the 
advice in Section 4 of this report. 
3.38 
The operational and decommissioning phases of the works should 
be addressed. The SoS recommends the need to consider 
cumulative and combined impacts and advises this is particularly 
relevant in terms of assessing the impacts on ecology.  
 
 
 
Page 18 
 
 
                                        
3.39 
The SoS recommends that the proposals should address fully the 
needs of protecting and enhancing biodiversity. The assessment 
should cover habitats, species and processes with the sites and 
surroundings.  The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments 
from NRW (see Appendix 2) on the particular need to consider 
legally protected species.  The Applicant should also take note of 
the advice in Section 4 of this report on European Protected 
Species. 
3.40 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to undertake assessment and 
reporting using the Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management’s ‘Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment’.  The 
SoS draws the Applicants attention to the requirements of this 
guidance, which includes definition of a Zone of Ecological 
Influence, based on the distance over which ecological effects 
occur, rather than on an arbitrary distance. 
3.41 
The SoS notes the references to embedded mitigation measures 
that will be employed during the construction phase of the project 
in addition to any project specific measures that may be required.  
The SoS advises that the ES must make it clear what mitigation 
measures are proposed, how they will be delivered, how effective 
they will be and what the residual effects would be.  The ES should 
make clear which measures are being proposed for the mitigation 
of the effects of the project and which are being proposed as 
compensation where mitigation is not possible.  Paragraph 5.5.29 
appears to confuse mitigation and compensation. 
3.42 
The proposal to produce a Method Statement for undertaking 
works within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of Importance for 
Nature Conservation (SINC) is welcomed.  At least a preliminary 
Method Statement should be attached to the ES to provide the 
SoS with the confidence that any effects from the project on the 
SINC will be adequately addressed. 
3.43 
The ES should also address the inter-relationships with other 
topics within the ES particularly air and water quality.   
Water Resources (see Scoping Report Section 5.6) 
3.44 
The methodology used, and any assumptions behind the 
conclusions of the assessment should be clearly stated in the ES.  
The SoS recommends that the methodology used for assessing the 
effects of the project on water resources are agreed with NWR and 
Dwr Cymru Welsh Water.   
3.45 
The intention to identify surface water bodies in the vicinity of the 
Power Generation Plant is noted.  The SoS advises that the ES 
must address potential effects on the water environment, 
particularly in relation to potable water.   The Applicant’s attention 
is drawn to the comments from Dwr Cymru Welsh Water in 
relation to the Penderyn Reservoir and the Hirwaun Treatment 
 
 
 
Page 19 
 
 
                                        
Works and also to the general comments from Public Health 
England (Appendix 2).   
3.46 
NRW (Appendix 2) also advise of the existence of licensed 
groundwater abstractions and private water supplies within the 
local area.  The SoS notes that abstraction points and licences in 
the area will be investigated and potential impacts on these 
abstractions quantified in the ES.  The SoS recommends that the 
scope of the investigation is agreed with NRW.   
3.47 
Potential sources of pollution should be identified, as well as 
pathways to potential hydrological and surface water receptors.  
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the advice from NRW in 
Appendix 2 on the presence of a Secondary A aquifer, and the 
existence of a Source Protection Zone 1 approximately 2km to the 
north east of the site. 
3.48 
The intention to produce a Water Framework Directive Report if 
required by NRW is noted.  The Applicant should take note of the 
advice from NRW in Appendix 2 on the presence of the River 
Camnant beneath the site.  The SoS recommends that the 
Applicant consults NRW on the requirements for a Water 
Framework Directive Report.  
3.49 
The rates of potable use at each stage of development should be 
fully assessed.  Sufficient evidence must be provided for the SoS 
to be able to assess the effects of the development on the 
environment 
and 
to 
have 
confidence 
that 
any 
necessary 
abstraction could be licensed.  The Applicant’s attention is drawn 
to the comments from NRW in Appendix 2.   
3.50 
If, at the time the application is submitted, it has not been 
confirmed that the Power Generation Plant will use air cooling then 
the extra requirements for cooling water should also be addressed 
in the ES.  If the choice of technology has not been finalised at the 
time of application then the different water requirements of each 
of the likely technologies should be assessed, or a realistic worst 
case scenario assessed.  The choice of the scenario should be fully 
defined and justified in the ES. 
3.51 
Mitigation measures should be addressed and the SoS advises that 
reference should be made to other regimes (such as pollution 
prevention from NRW). On-going monitoring should also be 
addressed and agreed with the relevant authorities to ensure that 
any mitigation measures are effective. 
3.52 
The SoS welcomes the commitment to provide a Flood Risk 
Assessment (FRA) in accordance with the Applications Prescribed 
Forms and Procedures Regulations (APFP).  The FRA should cover 
ground water, surface water and fluvial impacts and the scope 
should be agreed with NRW.  The SoS recommends that a Surface 
Water Management Plan should be prepared which may include a 
 
 
 
Page 20 
 
 
                                        
review of existing drainage facilities and the provision of 
interceptors on site. 
3.53 
The FRA should form an appendix to the ES.  The SoS 
recommends that the sections considering the water environment 
in the ES should be cross referenced to the FRA. 
3.54 
The ES should also address the inter-relationships with other 
topics within the ES particularly air quality and ecology.   
Geology, ground conditions and land use (see Scoping Report 
Section 5.7) 
3.55 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to undertake assessment of 
ground and groundwater contamination.  The baseline for the ES 
should explain in detail the extent of the study area, ensuring that 
the effects are considered over a sufficiently wide area.   
3.56 
The SoS also welcomes the proposal to investigate the underlying 
ground conditions and to obtain a Coal Authority Report.  The 
Applicant’s attention is drawn to the advice from the Coal 
Authority in Appendix 2. 
3.57 
The SoS recommends that the methodology used for the 
assessment should be agreed with NRW and RCTCBC.  The 
Applicant is referred to the comments from NRW (Appendix 2). 
3.58 
The Scoping Report states that the main impact of the gas 
connection is the sterilisation of agricultural land and that an 
assessment of the amount of land affected will be included in the 
ES.  The Applicant is reminded of the requirements in paragraph 
5.10.8 of National Policy Statement EN-1 to seek to minimise 
impacts on the best and most versatile agricultural land.  The SoS 
advises that the ES should identify the grade of land likely to be 
affected by the project and the measures taken to minimise 
impacts on land grades 1, 2 and 3a of the Agricultural Land 
Classification. 
3.59 
The SoS notes the references to embedded mitigation measures 
that will be employed in addition to any project specific measures 
that may be required.  The SoS advises that the ES must make it 
clear what mitigation measures are proposed, how they will be 
delivered, how effective they will be and what the residual effects 
would be.   
Landscape and Visual (see Scoping Report Section 5.8) 
3.60 
The SoS notes that the landscape assessment will be undertaken 
using the second edition of the ‘Guidelines for Landscape and 
Visual Impact Assessment’ (Landscape Institute and Institute of 
Environmental Management).  The Applicant’s attention is drawn 
to the recent publication of the third edition of the guidance; the 
 
 
 
Page 21 
 
 
                                        
SoS recommends that this edition is used rather than the second 
edition. 
3.61 
The ES should identify landscape planning designations, landscape 
character areas and potentially sensitive receptors.  The choice of 
receptors should be explained and justified in the ES.  Reference 
to any LANDMAP landscape character assessment produced for the 
area is also recommended. 
3.62 
The SoS advises that the assessment within the ES must address 
the full range of visual effects from the project, including the 
construction and decommissioning phase. Effects at night as well 
as during the day should be addressed, particularly in view of the 
Brecon Beacons National Park status as an International Dark Sky 
Reserve. 
3.63 
The SoS draws the attention of the Applicant of the need to liaise 
with the local planning authorities to ensure use is made in the EIA 
of the most up to date policy documents. 
3.64 
The landscape and visual assessment in the scoping report refers 
to the Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV). The SoS advises that 
the ES should describe the methodology and model used, provide 
information on the area covered and the timing of any survey 
work.  Having regard to local topography, the ZTV should seek to 
ensure that all potential sensitive receptors are considered and 
viewpoints are agreed with RCTCBC and BBNPA.  The Applicant’s 
attention is drawn to the comments from BBNPA and NRW in 
Appendix 2. 
3.65 
All parameters, including the assumptions for the number and 
heights of stacks used in the assessment should be clearly detailed 
and justified. Care should be taken to ensure that the worst case 
scenario for stack height is reflected as appropriate.  The SoS 
notes that this may represent a different worst case to that 
considered for other topic areas.  The effect of visible vapour 
plumes should also be considered. 
3.66 
The proposals will be for large structures. The SoS requests that 
careful consideration should be given to the form, siting, and use 
of materials and colours in terms of minimising the adverse visual 
impact of these structures. This should include night time views, 
including the impact of lighting. 
3.67 
Appropriate use of photomontages will help to illustrate the views 
prior to development, upon completion and at an agreed future 
date when mitigation measures are fully established. Photographs, 
photomontages and wireframes should be presented in a clear and 
readable format that includes clear points of reference to allow the 
reader to readily identify and fully understand the potential effects 
of the proposed development. 
 
 
 
Page 22 
 
 
                                        
3.68 
The SoS recommends that the location and the timing of 
viewpoints, photographs and visualisations should be agreed with 
RCTCBC and BBNPA. 
3.69 
The SoS notes the references to embedded mitigation measures 
that will be employed in addition to any project specific measures 
that may be required.  The SoS advises that the ES must make it 
clear what mitigation measures are proposed, how they will be 
delivered, how effective they will be and what the residual effects 
would be.   
3.70 
The ES should also address the inter-relationships with other 
topics within the ES including effect of lighting, proposed planting  
or screening structures on ecology.   
Waste (see Scoping Report Section 5.9) 
3.71 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to undertake a waste assessment 
and to produce a Site Waste Management Plan.  This should be 
provided as an appendix to the ES. 
3.72 
The SoS considers it essential to also take account of materials to 
be removed from the site and to identify where potential traffic 
movements would be routed.  
3.73 
The SoS advises that the ES should clarify the types of all wastes 
to be processed and that the effect of the proposal, in terms of 
waste, should be included in the ES.  
3.74 
The SoS notes the references to embedded mitigation measures 
that will be employed in addition to any project specific measures 
that may be required.  The SoS advises that the ES must make it 
clear what mitigation measures are proposed, how they will be 
delivered, how effective they will be and what the residual effects 
would be.   
Transport and Access (see Scoping Report Section 5.10) 
3.75 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to develop the assessment of 
transport impacts in association with the local highways authority 
(RCTCBC) and the body responsible for the strategic road network. 
It should be noted that this is the Welsh Government and not the 
Highways Agency as stated in the Scoping Report.  The SoS would 
expect on-going discussions and agreement, where possible, with 
such bodies. 
3.76 
Information should be provided on the types of vehicles and plant 
to be used and the number of vehicle trips during construction and 
operation phases.  This should include vehicular movements 
required during shut down and maintenance periods, and any 
requirements for the delivery of abnormal indivisible loads. 
 
 
 
Page 23 
 
 
                                        
3.77 
The SoS welcomes the proposals to take account of potential 
impacts on pedestrians.  The SoS recommends that the ES should 
take account of the location of footpaths and any public rights of 
way (PROW) including bridleways and byways. The ES should 
clearly set out impacts on them including within the wider area. It 
is important to minimise hindrance to them where possible.   
3.78 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to produce a Travel Plan for the 
construction and operational phases of the proposed development.  
If this is to form a separate document to the ES, the Applicant 
should ensure that sufficient information is contained within the ES 
for it to be a stand alone document. 
3.79 
The ES should also address the inter-relationships with other 
topics within the ES particularly air quality, noise and vibration, 
socio-economics and waste assessments. 
Cultural Heritage including Archaeology (see Scoping Report 
Section 5.11) 
3.80 
The SoS notes that the archaeological investigations will be based 
on a Desk Based Assessment (DBA); intrusive investigations will 
be considered if the DBA suggests they are required and in 
consultation with the Glamorgan and Gwent Archaeological Trust 
(GGAT)and CADW.  The ES should confirm the role of GGAT, and 
whether they are acting on behalf of RCTCBC and BBNPA.  If this 
is not the case then the SoS recommends that these bodies are 
also consulted on the approach that should be used for 
archaeological assessment.  It is noted that the Scoping Report 
states that land affected by the gas and electrical connections is 
less likely to be disturbed by past activities on the site than the 
land in the industrial estate. The SoS advises that these areas 
should be subject to detailed assessment if necessary. 
3.81 
The setting of cultural heritage resources could be affected; this 
includes historic buildings, historic landscapes and archaeological 
sites and the SoS considers that these should be addressed in the 
ES. The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments from 
BBPNA in Appendix 2 on the need to fully consider the various 
statutory and non-statutory historic monuments and landscapes. 
3.82 
The Scoping Report states (paragraph 5.11.27) that an initial 
study will be undertaken making reference to desk-based research 
and the Zone of Theoretical Visibility.  However paragraph 5.11.29 
states that the search area for historic assets will be limited to 5 
km from the centre of the proposed Power Generation Plant.  The 
ES should clearly explain what approach has been used and justify 
the extent of the search area. 
3.83 
The ES should identify the names and characteristics of the 
important heritage assets that could be affected by the proposed 
development.  Any cultural heritage or archaeological features 
 
 
 
Page 24 
 
 
                                        
likely to be affected, directly or indirectly, by the project should be 
clearly identified in the plans of the ES.  This should include assets 
considered to be of national, regional or local importance. 
3.84 
The SoS advises that the ES must make it clear what mitigation 
measures are proposed, how they will be delivered, how effective 
they will be and what the residual effects would be.   
3.85 
The ES should also address the inter-relationships with other 
topics within the ES particularly landscape and visual impact 
assessment. 
Socio-economics (see Scoping Report Section 5.12) 
3.86 
The SoS recommends that the types of jobs generated should be 
considered in the context of the available workforce in the area, 
this applies equally to the construction and operational stages. 
3.87 
The SoS notes the proposal to study the socio-economic impacts 
for construction, operation and decommissioning, with a potential 
workforce of between 150 and 250 persons during construction 
and up to 30 full time staff during operation. Subject to 
procurement rules, much of this workforce will be recruited locally. 
The SoS recommends that the assessment includes direct and 
indirect impact with full explanation and justification for any 
presumptions used.  
3.88 
The SoS recommends that the assessment criteria should be 
locationally specific and consider the potential significance of the 
impacts of the proposal within the local and regional context. 
Electromagnetic Fields (see Scoping Report Section 5.13) 
3.89 
The intention is of this section of the Scoping Report is not entirely 
clear. The SoS recommends that the ES should include either an 
appropriate assessment that meets the requirements of the 
relevant National Policy Statements or evidence that supports a 
conclusion that effects are unlikely.  The Applicant’s attention is 
drawn to the comments from Public Health England in Appendix 2. 
Cumulative assessment (see Scoping Report Section 5.14) 
3.90 
The SoS notes the intention to take into account the cumulative 
impact of other existing and planned developments within the 
area.  The SoS recommends that the ES should make it clear 
which developments are covered within the existing environmental 
baseline and which are covered by the cumulative assessment.  
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the ‘Guidance on the pre-
application process’ produced by the Department of Communities 
and Local Government.  Paragraph 86 outlines which projects 
should be considered in cumulative impacts. 
 
 
 
Page 25 
 
 
                                        
3.91 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to consult with the local planning 
authority to identify any other development in the area which 
should be considered. 
Other matters 
3.92 
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments from the 
Ministry of Defence on the need to notify UK DVOF and Powerlines 
at the Defence Geographic Centre with information prior to 
development commencing (Appendix 2). 
3.93 
The Applicant should take note of the advice from National Grid 
(Appendix 2), particularly in relation to the impact of the project 
on National Grid’s existing assets within the area. 
3.94 
The Applicant should take note of the advice from South Wales 
Fire and Rescue Service on the need to take fire safety 
requirements into account. 
3.95 
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the advice from the Civil 
Aviation Authority in Appendix 2, particularly in respect of: 
• 
the need to check for aerodrome safeguarding maps; 
• 
the potential requirement for aviation warning lighting on tall 
structures; 
• 
if gas venting is intended the need to have further 
discussions with the Civil Aviation Authority; and 
• 
the need to consult local emergency services air support 
units.

4.0 OTHER INFORMATION 
4.1 
This section does not form part of the SoS’s opinion as to the 
information to be provided in the environmental statement. 
However, it does respond to other issues that the SoS has 
identified which may help to inform the preparation of the 
application for the DCO.  
Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) 
4.2 
The SoS notes that European sites may be located close to the 
proposed development. It is the Applicant’s responsibility to 
provide sufficient information to the Competent Authority (CA) to 
enable them to carry out a HRA if required. The Applicant should 
note that the CA is the SoS.  
4.3 
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to The Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 
(as amended) (The APFP Regulations) and the need to include 
information identifying European sites to which the Habitats 
Regulations applies or any Ramsar site or potential SPA which may 
be affected by a proposal. The submitted information should be 
sufficient for the competent authority to make an appropriate 
assessment (AA) of the implications for the site if required by 
Regulation 61(1) of the Habitats Regulations. 
4.4 
The report to be submitted under Regulation 5(2)(g) of the APFP 
Regulations with the application must deal with two issues: the 
first is to enable a formal assessment by the CA of whether there 
is a likely significant effect; and the second, should it be required, 
is to enable the carrying out of an AA by the CA.  
4.5 
When considering aspects of the environment likely to be affected 
by the proposed development; including flora, fauna, soil, water, 
air and the inter-relationship between these, consideration should 
be given to the designated sites in the vicinity of the proposed 
development. 
4.6 
Further information with regard to the HRA process is contained 
within Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 10 available on the 
National Infrastructure Planning’s website.  
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
4.7 
The SoS notes that a number of SSSIs are located close to or 
within the proposed development. Where there may be potential 
impacts on the SSSIs, the SoS has duties under sections 28(G) 
and 28(I) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
(the W&C Act). These are set out below for information. 
 
 
 
Page 27 
 
 
                                        
4.8 
Under s28(G), the SoS has a general duty ‘… to take reasonable 
steps, consistent with the proper exercise of the authority’s 
functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the 
flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features by reason of 
which the site is of special scientific interest’.   
4.9 
Under 
s28(I), 
the 
SoS 
must 
notify 
the 
relevant 
nature 
conservation body (NCB), Natural Resources Wales (NRW) in this 
case, before authorising the carrying out of operations likely to 
damage the special interest features of a SSSI. Under these 
circumstances 28 days must elapse before deciding whether to 
grant consent, and the SoS must take account of any advice 
received from the NCB, including advice on attaching conditions to 
the consent. The NCB will be notified during the examination 
period.  
4.10 
If applicants consider it likely that notification may be necessary 
under s28(I), they are advised to resolve any issues with the NCB 
before the DCO application is submitted to the SoS. If, following 
assessment by applicants, it is considered that operations affecting 
the SSSI will not lead to damage of the special interest features, 
applicants should make this clear in the ES. The application 
documents submitted in accordance with Regulation 5(2)(l) could 
also provide this information. Applicants should seek to agree with 
NE the DCO requirements which will provide protection for the 
SSSI before the DCO application is submitted. 
European Protected Species (EPS)  
4.11 
The Applicant should also be aware that the decision maker under 
the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) has, as the CA, a duty to engage 
with the Habitats Directive. 
4.12 
The SoS considers that there is potential for the presence of EPS 
within the study area for the proposed development. Where a 
potential risk to an EPS is identified and before making a decision 
to grant development consent the CA must, amongst other things, 
address the derogation tests in Regulation 53 of the Habitats 
Regulations. Therefore the Applicant may wish to provide 
information which will assist the decision maker to meet this duty. 
Where required the Applicant should, in consultation with NRW, 
agree appropriate requirements to secure necessary mitigation. 
4.13 
If the Applicant has concluded (in consultation with NRW) that an 
EPS licence is required the SoS will need to understand whether 
there is any impediment to the licence being granted. It would 
assist the examination if the Applicant could provide with the 
application confirmation from NRW whether they intend to issue 
the licence in due course. 
 
 
 
 
Page 28 
 
 
                                        
Health Impact Assessment  
4.14 
The SoS considers that it is a matter for the Applicant to decide 
whether or not to submit a stand-alone Health Impact Assessment 
(HIA). However, the Applicant should have regard to the 
responses received from the relevant consultees regarding health, 
and in particular to the comments from the Health and Safety 
Executive in relation to electrical safety issues (see Appendix 2). 
4.15 
The methodology for the HIA, if prepared, should be agreed with 
the relevant statutory consultees and take into account mitigation 
measures for acute risks. 
Other regulatory regimes 
4.16 
The SoS recommends that the Applicant should state clearly what 
regulatory areas are addressed in the ES and that the Applicant 
should ensure that all relevant authorisations, licences, permits 
and consents that are necessary to enable operations to proceed 
are described in the ES. Also it should be clear that any likely 
significant effects of the proposed development which may be 
regulated by other statutory regimes have been properly taken 
into account in the ES. 
4.17 
It will not necessarily follow that the granting of consent under one 
regime will ensure consent under another regime. For those 
consents not capable of being included in an application for 
consent under the PA 2008, the SoS will require a level of 
assurance or comfort from the relevant regulatory authorities that 
the proposal is acceptable and likely to be approved, before they 
make a recommendation or decision on an application. The 
Applicant is encouraged to make early contact with other 
regulators. Information from the Applicant about progress in 
obtaining other permits, licences or consents, including any 
confirmation that there is no obvious reason why these will not 
subsequently be granted, will be helpful in supporting an 
application for development consent to the SoS.

Ms Jill Warren (via e-mail) 
The Planning Inspectorate 
 
12 June 2013 
 
Reference: ERM/DAP/Planning/HirwaunPowerStation 
 
Dear Ms Warren, 
 
Proposed Hirwaun Power Station – Scoping Opinion 
 
Thank you for the recent Planning Inspectorate correspondence which sought Civil Aviation Authority 
scoping comment relating to the subject development.  I trust the following is useful. 
 
From the associated Scoping Report (SR) I gather that the height of the tallest structure associate with 
the Progress Power Station project is expected to be an as yet undecided number of chimney stacks 
that will be a maximum of 90m in height.  On that basis, I trust the following comment is useful: 
 
• 
Aerodromes.  In respect of any potential aerodrome related issue, I should highlight the need to 
check any safeguarding maps lodged with relevant planning authorities to identify any 
aerodrome specific safeguarding issues.  Noting the presence that aerodrome safeguarding 
responsibility rests in all cases with the relevant aerodrome operator / licensee, not the CAA, it 
is important that the related viewpoints of any relevant aerodrome license holders / operators is 
established and planning deliberations take appropriate consideration of any issues highlighted.  
To that end I note the close proximity of Rhigos Airfield, the home of the Vale of Neath Gliding 
Club, the operators of which are likely to have a related interest.    
 
• 
Aviation Warning Lighting.  Given the assumed maximum height of associated structures (90m) 
I believe there to be a need for aviation warning lighting.  For background: 
 
o In the UK, the need for aviation obstruction lighting on 'tall' structures depends in the 
first instance upon any particular structure's location in relationship to an aerodrome. If 
the structure constitutes an 'aerodrome obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that 
with review the lighting requirement. For civil aerodromes, they will, in general terms, 
follow the requirements of CAP 168 - Licensing of Aerodromes. This document can be 
downloaded from the CAA website - Chapter 4 (12.8) refers to obstacle lighting.  
 
o Away from aerodromes Article 219 of the UK Air Navigation Order (ANO) applies. This 
Article requires that for en-route obstructions (ie away from aerodromes) lighting only 
becomes legally mandated for structures of a height of 150m or more. However, 
structures of lesser high might need aviation obstruction lighting if, by virtue of their 
location and nature, they are considered a significant navigational hazard. 
 
o Cranes, whether in situ temporarily or long term are captured by the points heighted 
above.  Note that if a crane is located on top of another structure, it is the overall height 
(structure + crane) than is relevant. 
 
o In this case, even in the event that there proves to be no aerodrome related lighting 
requirement and the clear non applicability of Article 219, as the chimneys are likely to 
be the tallest structures in the immediate vicinity, I believe that the ‘by virtue of their 
location and nature’ holds true and that the developer considers the employment of 
aviation warning lighting. 
 
• 
Gas Venting and/or Flaring.  It is assumed that the Hirwaun Power Station is not intended to 
vent or flare gas either routinely or as an emergency procedure such as to cause a danger to 
overlying aircraft.  If that is not the case parties are invited to use myself as an appropriate 
point of contact for any further related discussion. 
 
• 
Aviation Promulgation.  There is a civil aviation requirement in the UK for all structures over 
300 feet high to be charted on aviation maps.  It follows that, at a maximum of 90m (295 feet) 
high, there is no en-route (ie non-aerodrome specific) civil aviation charting requirement.   
 
• 
Military Aviation.  For completeness, the Ministry of Defence position in regards to the proposed 
development and military aviation activity should be established. 
 
• 
I should also add that that due to the unique nature of associated operations in respect of 
operating altitudes and potentially unusual landing sites, it would also be sensible to establish 
the related viewpoint of local emergency services air support units.      
 
Any associated Environmental Statement / Development Consent Order (or equivalent / similar) would 
be expected to acknowledge and where applicable address the issues highlighted above and 
accordingly the scoping opinion should make related comment. 
 
Whilst none of the above negates any aforementioned need to consult in line with Government 
requirements associated with the safeguarding of aerodromes and other technical sites (Government 
Circular 1/2003 refers), I hope this information matches your requirements.  Please do not hesitate to 
get in touch if the Planning Inspectorate requires any further comment or needs clarification of any 
point.    
 
Yours sincerely,

1 July 2013 
  
Dear Ms Warren 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING (EIA) REGULATIONS 2009 SI 2263 
 
Proposed Hirwaun Power Station 
 
Thank you for your consultation letter of 3 June 2013 seeking the views of The Coal 
Authority on the EIA Scoping Opinion for the above proposal. 
 
The Coal Authority is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change.  As a statutory consultee, The Coal Authority has a duty to 
respond to planning applications and development plans in order to protect the public 
and the environment in mining areas. 
 
The Coal Authority Response 
 
The proposed EIA development is located within the defined Development High Risk 
Area; the site therefore has been subject to past coal mining activity and is located 
within an area of surface coal resource. 
 
In accordance with the agreed risk-based approach to development management in 
Development High Risk Areas, the past coal mining activities and the presence of 
surface coal resources within the site should be fully considered as part of the 
Environmental Statement (ES); this should take the form of a risk assessment, together 
with any necessary mitigation measures. 
 
The Coal Authority is therefore pleased to note that Section 5.7 of the Scoping Report 
submitted acknowledges the coal mining legacy of the site and commits to assessing 
the impacts of ground conditions on the proposed development and identifying 
appropriate remedial measures, if necessary. 
2 
 
Protecting the public and the environment in coal mining areas 
 
 
Consideration of Coal Mining Issues in the ES 
 
There are a number of coal mining legacy issues that can potentially pose a risk to new 
development and therefore should be considered as part of an Environmental 
Statement for development proposals within coalfield areas: 
� The location and stability of abandoned mine entries 
� The extent and stability of shallow mine workings 
� Outcropping coal seams and unrecorded mine workings 
� Hydrogeology, minewater and minegas 
 
In addition, consideration should be afforded as part of development proposals and 
the ES to the following: 
� If surface coal resources are present, whether prior extraction of the mineral 
resource is practicable and viable 
� Whether Coal Authority permission is required to intersect, enter, or disturb 
any coal or coal workings during site investigation or development work 
 
Coal Mining Information 
 
Information on these issues can be obtained from The Coal Authority's Property Search 
Services Team (Tel: 0845 762 6848 or via the website: www.groundstability.com) or 
book an appointment to visit The Coal Authority’s Mining Records Centre in Mansfield to 
view our mining information (Tel: 01623 637 233). 
 
An assessment of the risks associated with the presence of coal mining legacy issues 
on a proposed development should be prepared by a “competent body”.  Links to the 
relevant professional institutions of competent bodies can be found at: 
http://coal.decc.gov.uk/en/coal/cms/services/planning/strategy/strategy.aspx 
 
In accordance with our consultation requirements, we look forward to receiving the 
planning application and Environmental Statement for comment in due course. 
 
I trust this is acceptable, please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any 
additional information or would like to discuss this matter further. 
 
 Yours sincerely

Dear Sir / Madam 
 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 SI 2263 (as amended) 
Proposed Hirwaun Power Station 
 
We refer to your correspondence dated 3rd June 2013, regarding the above and wish to comment as 
follows. 
 
Our Hirwaun Water Treatment Works (WTW) and Penderyn Reservoir are close to the proposed 
development site.  This WTW is of strategic importance providing water supplies to approximately 15,000 
properties along the Cynon Valley to Aberdare and the surrounding areas. 
 
As a statutory water undertaker we have a duty to provide wholesome water to our customers with 
water quality regulated by the Drinking Water Inspectorate. This enables us to abstract and treat raw 
water to the required potable standards.  Any changes to the raw water quality could make the water 
untreatable and/or have an impact upon control at our WTW.  Should there be a potential derogation of 
water supply, then our customers would suffer severe disruption with loss of supply from a prolonged 
works shut down.   
 
In light of the above, our comments in relation to the submitted EIA Scoping Report are as follows: 
 
 The Environmental Statement (ES) should acknowledge the existance and possible impacts of the 
development on Penderyn Reservoir as a public water suppy reservoir and Hirwaun water 
Treatment Works.

 We would expect the ES to consider the impact of the development on air quality in the vicinity of 
the Hirwaun Treatment Works and Penderyn Reservoir and its tributaries;  Nant Bodwigiad and 
Nant Bwlfa. 
 The Scoping Report does not propose any monitoring of water quality of Penderyn Reservoir and 
its tributaries during the construction, operation and decomissioning phases. In the asbence of a 
scheme of monitoring the impact of the proposed development on the identified water resources 
cannot be fully considered. Accordingly, we would expect the ES to include a programme of water 
quality monitoring for the reservoir and its tributaries.  
 We would expect details of proposed mitigation and/or contingency measures in the event that the 
proposed development has a detrimental impact on air quality and/or water quality to be fully 
considered and included in the Environmental Statement. 
 Further details are required in respect of the ‘Blowdown’ process, including details of the chemical 
composition, volume and frequency of the discharge. 
 The report does not state the chemical composition of the emissions from the proposed stack(s), 
their concentrations, and their dispersal rates, and we would expect these details to be provided 
and their potential impact considered in full. 
 It is stated that details of the stack are to be determined after an air quality modelling exercise is 
completed; we consider that the impact upon Penderyn Reservoir and Hirwaun WTW should be 
included in this modelling exercise.  
 The ES does not take into account adjacent and forthcoming development in its consideration of 
other significant sources of emission.  
 
Notwithstanding the above, we advise that the impact of the proposed development should not be 
considered in isolation. To comprehensively consider the impact of the proposed development the 
Environmental Statement should have regard to possible cummulative impact of existing and proposed 
development within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate area.  
 
We trust the above is helpful in the consideration of this scoping report. In light of the issues raised, we 
would encourage the developer to engage with us at the earliest opportunity to discuss the above.  If you 
have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact Jason Price on the above number.

INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING (ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT) 
REGULATIONS 2009 SI 2263 (as amended) (the EIA Regulations) 
PROPOSED Hirwaun Power Station (the project) 
PROPOSAL BY Hirwaun Power Limited (the applicant) 
 
I refer to your letter dated 3rd June 2013 regarding the above proposed application. Having 
reviewed the Scoping Report documents, I would like to make the following comments: 
 
National Grid Infrastructure within or in close proximity to the Proposed Order Limits 
 
National Grid Electricity Transmission 
National Grid Transmission has a high voltage electricity overhead transmission line which lies 
within or in close proximity to the proposed order limits. This line forms an essential part of the 
electricity transmission network in England and Wales and include the following: 
� 
4YU 400kV Overhead Line  
The following substation is also located within the proposed order limits:  
 
� 
New Rhigos Substation 
 
I enclose plans showing the routes of our overhead lines and the location of our substation within 
the area shown in the consultation documents.  
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
� 
Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed 
buildings must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends 
that no permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are 
set out in EN 43 – 8 Technical Specification for “overhead line clearances Issue 3 (2004) 
available at: 
http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/LandandDevelopment/DDC/devnearohl_final/appendixIII/ap
pIII-part2 
 
� 
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our 
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such

overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all 
circumstances. 
 
� 
Further guidance on development near electricity transmission overhead lines is available 
here: http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/1E990EE5-D068-4DD6-8C9A-
4D0B06A1BA79/31436/Developmentnearoverheadlines1.pdf 
 
� 
The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is 
contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS 
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should 
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
� 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse 
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and 
“swing”) drawings should be obtained via the National Grid’s  Asset Protection Team at 
Warwick. 
 
� 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb 
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation 
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained via the Asset Protection Team at Warwick.

National Grid Gas Transmission  
 
National Grid has a high pressure gas transmission pipeline located within or in close proximity to 
the proposed order limits. The high pressure gas pipeline located within this area is: 
 
� 
FM02 – Dowlais to Dyffryn Clydach 
 
 
Specific Comments – Gas Infrastructure 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
� 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the 
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
• 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline 
at previously agreed locations.  
 
• 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.

• 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
• 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be 
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National 
Grid.  
 
• 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of 
the proposed protective measure.  
 
• 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
• 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip. 
 
• 
A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the 
pipeline to comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22. 
• 
A Deed of Indemnity is required for any crossing of the easement 
 
Cables Crossing: 
 
• 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
• 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
• 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline. 
 
• 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is 
above the pipeline. 
 
• 
A Deed of Indemnity is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
• 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres 
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If 
this cannot be achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance 
distance of 0.6 metres. 
 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
• 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
• 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and 
after construction.  
• 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased.

• 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established 
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed 
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final 
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
• 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the 
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power 
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with 
NG supervision and guidance.

Further Advice 
 
We would request that the potential impact of the proposed scheme on National Grid’s 
existing assets including habitat surrounding the new Rhigos substation is considered in 
any subsequent reports, including in the Environmental Statement, and as part of any 
subsequent application.  
 
Where the promoter intends to acquire land, extinguish rights, or interfere with any of 
National Grid apparatus protective provisions will be required in a form acceptable to it to 
be included within the DCO.  
 
Where any diversion of apparatus may be required to facilitate a scheme, National Grid is 
unable to give any certainty with the regard to diversions until such time as adequate 
feasibility and conceptual design studies have been undertaken by National Grid. Further 
information relating to this can be obtained by contacting the email address below.  
 
National Grid requests to be consulted at the earliest stages to ensure that the most 
appropriate protective provisions are included within the DCO application to safeguard the 
integrity of our apparatus and to remove the requirement for objection. All consultations 
should be sent to the following: DCOConsultations@nationalgrid.com as well as by post to 
the following address:

PROPOSED HIRWAUN POWER STATION (THE PROJECT) PROPOSAL BY HIRWAUN POWER 
LIMITED (THE APPLICANT). 
 
NATURAL RESOURCES WALES (NRW) SCOPING OPINION ON PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT. 
 
Thank you for your consultation dated 3 June 2013, seeking Natural Resources Wales (NRW) comments 
on the information that should be included in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the above 
proposal. 
 
Please note that our comments are without prejudice to any comments we may wish to make when 
consulted on the Preliminary Environmental Information (PEI) or on the submission of the full 
Environmental Statement (ES). At the time of any application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) 
application there may be new information available which we will need to take into account in making a 
formal response to the Planning Inspectorate. 
 
The EIA for this development should include sufficient information to enable the planning authority (in 
this instance the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of State) to determine fully the extent of 
any environmental impacts arising from the proposed scheme on statutory designated sites, protected 
species, air quality, waste and water management, contaminated land, flood risk and landscape interests. 
 
NRW welcomes submission of the scoping report produced by Parsons Brinckerhoff; we have a number 
of comments to make on its content and these are outlined below. 
 
We intend to meet with the applicant soon to discuss some of the finer details of the proposals in relation 
to the various sections of the EIA listed below and the specifics of the information we consider is required 
for each.

In general terms, we advise that the EIA considers the potential impact on the following issues for all 
phases of the project (e.g. construction, operation and decommissioning phases). 
 
• Statutory Nature Conservation Sites (SAC, SPA, SSSI, NNR, LNR etc.) 
• Non-statutory Nature Conservation Sites of importance (e.g. SINC or sites containing UKBAP 
habitats) 
• Air Quality (impacts on the above receptors) 
• Legally Protected Species 
• UK and Local Biodiversity Action Plan Habitats and Species 
• Water Management (to include water resources, foul water disposal, surface water management and 
impact on receiving waters) 
• Land affected by contamination 
• Pollution prevention 
• Flood risk 
• Landscape and visual impact 
• Access and recreation. 
 
Further detail for each is provided in turn below: 
 
 
Statutory Nature Conservation Sites 
There are a number of statutory designated sites within 15km of the proposals site. Special Areas of 
Conservation (SAC) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within 15 and 10km radii of the main 
proposed power plant building respectively are illustrated on the maps provided in Appendix 1.    
 
In particular, sufficient information is required to assist the determining authority in reaching a 
view on the possible significant effect of these proposals in the context of Regulation 61 (3) of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended). 
 
The relevant sites are also listed below:

Where potential significant impacts are identified, measures to avoid and mitigate impacts should be 
identified and the residual impacts assessed. Compensation should be identified where residual impacts 
remain. Assessments should be made using good quality information and enhancements should also be 
identified, in accordance with TAN5: Nature Conservation and Planning September 2009. Similarly, this 
approach/requirement will apply to all other environmental impacts or sites, habitats, species, aspects 
affected, whether outlined below or otherwise identified.

Non-Statutory Nature Conservation Sites 
The EIA should identify any impacts and necessary measures on any non-statutory nature conservation 
sites/Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC), identified/designated because of their 
importance at the county level for their biodiversity/nature conservation interest. 
 
 
Air Quality Impacts 
NRW welcomes the general approach to air quality assessment suggested in the EIA scoping document. 
We have a number of comments and recommendations on the various relevant sections of the report 
which are detailed below: 
 
List of abbreviations (p4) 
NOx is the abbreviation for nitrogen oxides not nitrous oxides (N2S), which is laughing gas. 
 
5.3 Air Quality 
5.3.5 (p78) 
We strongly advise that the developer collect their own baseline data for NOx, NO2, nitrogen deposition, 
acid deposition and dusts as these would be the main aerial pollutants that would be of concern at the 
designated sites.   On-going monitoring during construction would also provide important data to 
determine whether any on site embedded mitigation measures (5.3.29) are working, particularly for dusts. 
 
5.3.7 (p77) 
As stated in our advice in 5.3.5 we strongly recommend the developer collect their own data in addition to 
the available information from the websites listed as this would provide site specific data. 
 
5.3.8 (p77) 
As stated in 5.3.15 Horizontal Guidance Note H1 Annex (f): Air Emissions will be used then a screening 
distance of 10km is required.   Cwm Cadlan SAC is approximately 3km to the northeast of this 
development and must be included in the assessment process.   We agree that the impact of nitrogen 
deposition on the features of the designated sites will need to be assessed. 
 
5.3.14 (p78) 
Dusts:  The majority of literature indicates that large dust particles (>30µm) deposit within 100m of 
source and deposit quite quickly, whereas intermediate sized particles (10 – 30µm) are likely to travel 200 
– 500m and small particles (<10µm) may travel 1000m from source and deposit more slowly.   Blaen 
Cynon SAC (also designated Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI) is approximately 400m from the edge of 
development. 
 
For dust particles to become airborne the minimum wind speed must be 5.3m/s (19km/h).   Also, 
precipitation rates of >2mm/hour will reduce dust migration.   Conversely, precipitation rates <2mm/hr

will not discourage dust movement.   Therefore, it is important to determine how often the wind speed is 
≥5.3m/s with a rainfall of <2mm/hr in the direction of the designated sites.   From this the rate of dust 
deposition (in g/m2/day) and can be calculated and also how often it could occur in the direction of the 
designated sites. 
 
Traffic:  The DMRB uses the volume of traffic as an indicator of significance.   This may be entirely 
appropriate for determining nuisance to humans but it is inappropriate for determining the impact on 
sensitive habitats.  It is the pollution produced by the traffic that is of concern rather than the volume of 
traffic, though the two are correlated.   We therefore advise that NOx concentrations and nitrogen 
deposition be assessed against the relevant critical level and critical loads.   This form of assessment was 
completed recently for the A465 dualling.   See advice 5.10 below.  
 
5.3.15 (p79) 
We welcome the use of the H1 Annex (f) guidance to assess impacts from aerial emissions.   Annex (f) 
also highlights the need to assess nitrogen deposition and acid deposition against the relevant critical 
loads of the features in the designated sites. 
 
5.3.18 (p79) 
Please clarify the meaning of ‘base load’.   Worst case scenarios are usually assessed on full load running 
continuously 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.   A realistic scenario would be based on the expected 
actual running of the installation.   Please clarify the meaning of ‘realistic worst case scenario’. 
 
5.3.21 (p80) 
It is encouraging to note that both EPUK 2010 and EA H1 will be used in conjunction with one another.   
We remind you that EPUK accept the use of a contribution of 1% or less as the criterion for an 
‘imperceptible’ change and this is consistent with the screening methods promoted by the Environment 
Agency, Natural England and Natural Resources Wales (i.e. H1). 
 
5.3.22 (p80) 
See advice 5.3.8 for screening distance.   We welcome the use of AQTAG06 and that an assessment of 
acid and nutrient nitrogen deposition will be completed. 
 
5.3.25 & 5.3.27 (p81) 
We do not agree that dust is ‘unlikely to have any impact upon…ecological receptors’ but we welcome 
the fact that an assessment will be completed (5.3.26 & 5.3.28). 
 
NRW assumes that construction dust will primarily consist of cement dusts and, like dusts in general, will 
affect vegetation by both physical and chemical processes.   Physically, dust may cover the leaf surface 
and reduce the amount of light available for photosynthesis, or it may occlude stomata.   Occlusion may 
lead to increased resistance to gas exchange, or may prevent full stomatal closure, leading to water stress.

Increased transpiration is a common response to dust exposure.   Chemically, cement dusts are strongly 
alkaline, and may have detrimental effects on leaf surfaces.   Infestation by pests and pathogens is also 
likely to be enhanced. 
 
Trees and woodlands receive greater deposition of dust than adjacent short vegetation because of 
increased air turbulence.   In extreme cases, dust deposition may lead to tree death, but less severe 
symptoms are changes in pigments, sugars, and overall growth, detectable over a few km from a major 
source (Mandre et al., 1999). 
 
Indirect effects may be caused through the soil, especially on acid soils, where the cement dust can 
increase the pH and available calcium, leading to changes in vegetation composition.   The subject has 
been reviewed in depth by Farmer (1993). 
 
Effects of cement dust have been observed for deposition rates as low as 0.5 g/m2/day.   Often, deposition 
rates are not measured, and exposure is judged by amounts retained on leaves.   Removal of dust from 
leaves by rain however, varies very greatly among plant species, from those that are ‘self-cleaning’ (the 
lotus effect) to those that accumulate large quantities.   Most industrial processes are regulated to prevent 
the emission of cement dust.   (See dust advice 5.3.14 above.) 
 
 
5.10 Traffic, Transport and Access 
 
5.10.1 (p111) 
We assume that the NOx, dust and other relevant pollutants from transport prior to and during 
construction will be assessed as part of the proposed on-going monitoring programme as advised for 
5.3.5, 5.3.14, 5.3.25 & 5.3.27 above. 
 
Please note that the critical loads presented in Table F1 of the DMRB Volume 11, Chapter 3, Section 3, 
Annex F are incorrect and should not be used.   The nitrogen critical loads were reviewed and revised by 
the UNECE in 2010.   The correct values are available from the APIS website. 
 
5.14 Cumulative Assessment 
5.14.1 (p124) 
What search radius will be used to determine which existing and planned developments to include?   We 
suggest the 10km radius already stated in 5.3.22 (p80) and recommended in H1 Annex (f).

Legally Protected Species 
A request should be made to the South-East Wales Biological Records Centre (SeWBReC) and the 
ecologists of the relevant local planning authorities should be consulted for records to provide a full 
scoping of species and sites for species that may need to be addressed within the EIA. 
 
The EIA should include a detailed and comprehensive assessment of those protected species likely to be 
significantly affected. New surveys should be undertaken where their presence is likely but existing 
records are insufficient to allow a meaningful assessment. Survey work should be carried out in 
accordance with published guidance, where this exists and at the appropriate time(s) of year. It is possible 
that survey may be required in more than one year to allow proper assessment. Surveys should be 
undertaken by suitably qualified ecologists, under licence as required. 
 
 
UK and Local Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Habitats & Species 
Phase II habitat surveys using standard National Vegetation Classification (NVC) methodology of any 
semi natural habitats to be affected by the proposed development and its associated infrastructure should 
be carried out and a search/survey for notable plant and animal species undertaken. Surveys should be 
carried out at appropriate times of year and in appropriate weather conditions. This information should be 
used to identify the presence of and scale of impact upon National and Local Biodiversity Action Plan 
Species. 
 
 
Water Management 
 
Water Resources 
The Environmental Statement will need to asses how the proposed development is likely to affect water 
resources.  Information is needed on how the proposed development intends to be supplied with water, 
during the construction phase and subsequent operation of the development.  The Environmental 
Statement should also address how the proposed development will make the most efficient use of water 
on the site. 
 
If water is to be abstracted directly from the environment then this should be detailed in the 
Environmental Statement; an abstraction licence is likely to be required.  If this is the case, we 
recommend that the applicant contacts our Permitting Support Centre on 08708 506 506 to discuss this 
matter. 
 
The proposed development site is located on Secondary A aquifer. There is a Source Protection Zone 1 
approximately 2km to the north east of the site for the Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water abstraction at Penderyn. 
There are also licensed groundwater abstractions and private water supplies within the local area. We 
advise that a water feature survey should be undertaken as part of the Environmental Statement. This

should have a radius of 1km from the site boundary (also including the proposed development site). The 
Water Feature Survey should include the following: 
 
- 
Identification of all water features both surface and groundwater (ponds, springs, ditches, culverts 
etc.) within a 1000 metre radius of the site. 
- 
Use made of any of these water features. This should include the construction details of wells and 
boreholes and details of the lithology in which they are installed;  
- 
An indication of the flow regime in the spring or surface water feature, for example whether or not the 
water feature flows throughout the year or dries up during summer months;  
- 
Accessibility to the spring/well; 
 
This information should be identified on a suitably scaled map (i.e. 1:10,000), then tabulated and 
submitted to Natural Resources Wales. It would be useful for the developer to photograph each of the 
identified water features during the survey.  
 
Based on the results of the survey the developer should assess the likely impacts from the development on 
both quantity and quality of the surface water and groundwater. This should take into consideration both 
the preferred methods of construction and the assumed hydrogeology in the vicinity of the development.  
 
We may require identified groundwater features to be monitored during the proposed workings. We 
would therefore recommend that the survey be undertaken as soon as possible to enable the developer to 
carry out suitable baseline monitoring prior to the commencement of workings at the site. 
 
Foul Water Disposal 
Full details will be required of the pollution prevention and environmental controls to be deployed during 
the following phases of the proposed development: 
 
- 
Demolition of existing buildings and removal/making good of infrastructure. As the proposed site has 
a historic industrial use, have the appropriate contamination assessments been undertaken? Will 
remediation techniques need to be deployed prior to construction?  
- 
Construction process to include: temporary vehicle parking arrangements, welfare facilities, material 
lay down area, access route, pipeline and cable route installation.  
- 
Infrastructure specified for the operational phase to include support facilities such as electricity sub 
stations and switch gear, storage of substances etc.  
- 
Full details relating to the proposed design of the: surface water, foul water and effluent collection 
and treatment systems will be required.  
- 
Decommissioning and site restoration post construction phase and site operation. 
  
The River Camnant appears to be culverted directly under the proposed development site. The scoping 
report appears not to have referred to the existence of this watercourse, whilst other surface water bodies

have been identified within the project outline. NRW would expect a WFD assessment to be carried out 
on this waterbody by the developer. 
  
We require further information and proposals relating to the implications on water resources as a 
consequence of this development, such as: identification of the source (abstraction) and potential water 
supply, will water require treatment prior to use within the process, what are the estimated volumes of 
water required and volumes of effluent produced, what is the composition of the effluent likely to be? 
What are the effluent treatment and disposal options? 
 
 
Surface Water Management 
A surface water management plan should be included as part of the Environmental Statement to address 
the management of any risk of polluting the water environment.  This should link to and/or incorporate 
any surface water drainage strategy, and consider matters such as any on-site treatment and interceptors 
for hard standing areas such as car parks.   
 
 
Land Potentially Affected by Contamination 
Within the proposed red line boundary (as defined in Figure 1 of the EIA Scoping Report), there is a 
historical landfill on the industrial estate. If works are to be undertaken in this area then site investigation 
and 
risk 
assessment 
will 
be 
required. 
 
We also note from section 3.2 of the Scoping Report that the site has previously been a Royal Ordnance 
Factory, electrical goods manufacturing factory and a distribution and storage centre. Given the 
potentially contaminative nature of the previous uses of the site we will require, as a minimum, a 
preliminary risk assessment and preferably site investigation and risk assessment (as required) to establish 
whether contamination is present within the soil and groundwater that may have an impact on controlled 
water within the local area. These investigations should follow British Standards, CLR11 and our 
guidance “Guiding Principles for Land Contamination (2010)”. 
 
We 
recommend 
that 
developers 
should: 
a. Follow the risk management framework provided in CLR11, Model Procedures for the Management of 
Land 
Contamination, 
when 
dealing 
with 
land 
affected 
by 
contamination.  
b. Refer to Natural Resources Wales guiding principles for land contamination for the type of information 
that we require in order to assess risks to controlled waters from the site. The Local Authority will be able 
to advise on risks posed to other receptors, such as human health.

Pollution Prevention 
 
 
Environmental Permitting 
The proposal will require an environmental permit to operate and an application will need to be made 
under the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2010 (as amended). Pre-application 
discussions with Natural Resources Wales are recommended. 
 
Technology selection 
Open (simple) cycle gas turbine (GT) operation is not usually considered to represent Best Available 
Technique (BAT) for normal power plant GT operation and rigorous justification of efficiency penalties 
would be required if this type of operation were to be proposed. 
 
The technology selection process should also consider the best achievable efficiency, in particular the 
potential for CHP (see below). 
 
It is noted that air cooled condensers or coolers are proposed as the cooling system for the project. 
Alternative cooling options should be considered and technique selection justified based upon efficiency, 
water resources and waste water discharge as well as economic considerations. 
 
 
Combined heat and power (CHP) 
The intention to keep options for local heat utilisation under review is noted. Guidance on determining 
BAT for CHP readiness can be found in the following Environment Agency guidance document: 
 
http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117470.aspx 
 
CHP should be considered for all technology options. 
 
This link also includes references to other guidance relevant to environmental permitting of power 
generation activities. 
 
Noise impact assessment 
The limitation of the proposed operational noise assessment to within 1000 m of the development should 
be justified, in particular with reference to abnormal operating conditions, including commissioning, full 
load steam turbine by-pass operation for CCGT option and plant trip scenarios. 
 
Noise mitigation measures should also include reference to use of acoustic enclosures and cladding for 
plant and pipe work or ducting likely to produce noise under all operating conditions including abnormal 
operation.

Water Quality (WQ) impact assessment 
Assessment of WQ impacts should also include consideration of periodic or intermittent waste water 
effluent arising from commissioning procedures, HRSG make up water treatment, plant maintenance and 
cleaning procedures and cooling system blow down in the event that wet or hybrid cooling technology is 
considered to be appropriate. 
 
Water treatment and recovery options should be considered in addition to treatment and discharge. 
 
 
Site condition 
Site survey work undertaken should take into account current environmental permitting and likely future 
requirements under the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) to undertake intrusive works to gather 
baseline contamination data as part of the environmental permitting process. 
 
 
Flood Risk 
(See also ‘Water Management’ section above) 
The proposed development site is in Zone A, as indicated by the Welsh Government’s Development 
Advice Maps.  This Zone is considered to be at little or no risk of fluvial flooding.  Where there is reason 
to believe that proposed developments in Zone A or B would be prone to flooding, or that such 
developments could have an impact on other people or their property, we would advise that a Flood 
Consequence Assessment (FCA) be undertaken.  
 
Although our understanding is that the guidance set out in TAN15 would not require a detailed FCA to be 
undertaken for this proposed development, we do note the intention to provide one as part of the 
Environmental Statement (see section 5.6 of the EIA Scoping Report).  We are pleased to note this as we 
consider it to be good practice as there will need to be an assessment of the surface water implications of 
this proposed development on the catchment, and consideration of flooding from other sources.  The 
assessment will need to demonstrate that surface water discharges will not cause or exacerbate any 
flooding within this area of the catchment.  We encourage investigation of improvements/enhancements 
where existing problems of flooding have been identified in the catchment. 
 
We advise that a surface water assessment should consider the following: 
- 
How the principles of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) have been applied to the development 
and identify what techniques will be used. 
- 
Estimate the discharge rate for the site. Greenfield discharge rates should be sought on Greenfield 
sites, and also on Brownfield sites (where possible). Notwithstanding this, the local sewerage 
undertaker or drainage operating authority may specify a lower maximum discharge rate.

- 
Estimate the volume of 1 in 100 year attenuation to be provided and what techniques will be used to 
provide the attenuation. 
- 
Take into account TAN 15 climate change requirements. 
 
 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
 
The EIA should consider protected landscapes in the vicinity of the proposals. With respect to the Brecon 
Beacons National Park this should also consider the statutory purposes of the designation. 
The landscape and visual impact assessment (LVIA) should utilise appropriate viewpoints to consider the 
impacts of the proposals on these protected landscapes, particularly given the potential for the proposals 
to be visible from a wide area.  
 
5.8.3 Introduction  - Power Generation Plant 
Much of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, although reasonably well assimilated by blocks and belts of 
maturing woodland, is highly visible in medium to long range views, as a direct consequence of the pale 
colours of the roof and wall cladding used on many of its larger buildings, including apparently recent 
developments. Therefore, it will be essential that the LVIA and CLVIA elements of the ES deal 
comprehensively with this very important aspect of the proposed development, including the potential 
visual impacts of reflective glazed and metallic surfaces and their potential to exacerbate visual intrusion 
in certain climatic conditions.  This factor is especially important for chimney stacks and other tall 
structures. Potential effects of any proposed materials and finishes will need to be fully assessed.   
 
 
5.8.4 to 5.8.6 Introduction - Gas and Electricity Connections 
We note that it is not anticipated the connections would give rise to 'significant visual impacts', since they 
would be mostly placed underground, although the report states in 5.8.6 that there is an option to use an 
overhead connection for electricity. We would advise that there is the potential for significant landscape 
and visual effects arising during the construction stage of these works. In addition, there are potentially 
significant adverse cumulative landscape and visual effects in the operational stage of the project in the 
event of an overhead electricity connection being constructed.  These would be likely to occur in 
combination with the existing and proposed high-voltage overhead lines infrastructure in the locality - 
especially the new grid connection and sub-station to be constructed to serve the consented Pen y 
Cymoedd wind farm.  
 
5.8.8 Introduction - Electrical Connection 
NRW welcomes the fact that 'a full visual impact assessment of this infrastructure will be carried out 
following guidelines set out in EN-1 and EN-5.' 1.

5.8.10 Baseline - Power Generation Plant 
In the scoping report it is noted that the Brecon Beacons National Park (BBNP) would be 'situated 
approximately 0.3km to the north of the proposed Power Generation Plant site at its closest point.' NRW 
agrees that the BBNP rural setting and protected landscape is a major landscape receptor and we would 
add that the potential impacts upon it are significant.   
However, we disagree with the implication that the presence of the Pen y Cymoedd wind farm on the 
higher ground 5km beyond the industrial developments to the south has the effect of degrading the local 
baseline landscape condition.  We would comment on two specific matters in this regard: 
 
- 
The stated area of 46.8 km2 of the Pen y Cymoedd wind farm is not seen in full from this location - 
there will be turbines visible above a proportion of the ridge forming the southern horizon, but this is 
only a small proportion of the total area of the wind farm, so the scale argument is misleading. 
- 
Views from the high ground on the ridge - including the promoted viewpoint car park above Craig y 
Llyn on the A4061 Treherbert to Rhigos mountain road have the turbines behind and therefore not in 
the view; so the cumulative landscape and visual effects of the proposed Power Generation Plant and 
associated electricity grid connection infrastructure are potentially significant in views northwards 
towards the BBNP, which forms the northern horizon and the land backdrop to the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate. 
 
To have regard for wider enjoyment of the countryside the LVIA and CLVIA documents will need to 
address potential impacts upon views towards the BBNP from the higher ground to the south. This should 
consider, in particular promoted viewpoint areas easily accessible by the public with a wide range of 
levels of personal mobility in addition to Open Access Land as well as land within identified Special 
Landscape areas in the wider locality. 
 
5.8.13 Baseline - Electricity Grid Connection 
In the scoping report it is written that, in the event of an overhead line grid connection being 
implemented,  'the visual impact would be considerably greater, and it would be likely be visible from 
number of viewpoints'. We note that no supporting text is provided to either qualify or clarify this 
statement and no viewpoints are described. The viewpoints to be used in the LVIA and CLVIA should 
take account of this potential impact. 
 
5.8.18 Assessment - Power Generation Plant 
We would recommend that the stated 'desk review of all related documents and landscape planning policy 
and guidance' specifically includes reference to the following documents:

5.8.19 Assessment – Power Generation Plant 
Reference is made to use of the ‘Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 2nd Edition, 
2002’. This Guidance was superseded by the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 3rd 
Edition (GLVIA3), with effect from April 2013.  Recent information on the use of the Guidance has been 
issued by the Landscape Institute, to the effect that all assessments being undertaken from April 2013 
should use GLVIA3.  
 
We welcome the proposal to use, in addition to the above, the Countryside Council for Wales/Cadw 
(2007) Guide to Good Practice on Using the Register of Landscapes of Historic Interest in Wales in the 
Planning and Development Process. 
 
5.8.21 Assessment – Power Generation Plant 
NRW welcomes the intention to produce a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) Plan as part of the 
assessment.  We would suggest that the minimum radius for the ZTV should be 7.5km from the edge of 
the proposed Power Generation Plant site.  This plan should indicate the differences in theoretical 
visibility for a 30-metre and a 90-metre high chimney stack. We would also expect the assessment of the 
scheme to comment upon the potential for enhanced visual effects arising from vapour plumes issuing 
from stacks during particular atmospheric conditions.  
 
5.8.24 to 5.8.27 Assessment – Power Generation Plant  
NRW considers the list of viewpoints provided to be inadequate; viewpoints relevant to the remit of both 
NRW and the BBNPA will need to be agreed with each of the organisations prior to the commencement 
of the assessment work.  We suggest that the starting point for these discussions should be the viewpoints 
used for the LVIA and CLVIA for the nearby 'Enviroparks' scheme.   
 
With regard to photomontages, we consider that it is premature to suggest that 'up to six photomontages 
would be produced to illustrate the development from key views' would be adequate or reasonable

without further dialogue with NRW and BBNPA.  The precise number and location of the viewpoints 
from which photomontages will be produced should be agreed between the relevant parties.  
 
 
Access and Recreation 
The EIA should consider the implications of the proposals in terms of people’s access to and enjoyment 
of public open space and the countryside. It should assess the likely effects of the proposals on the local 
Public Rights of Way network as well as open access land and public open space in the area. 
 
If the proposals are likely to affect the local Public Rights of Way network or people’s access to Open 
Access Land or public open space, the EIA should detail the measures that will be implemented to ensure 
that satisfactory alternatives are provided so that, overall the general public’s accessibility to public open 
space and the countryside is maintained and enhanced. 
I hope these comments are of assistance. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries or 
require any further information.

Dear Jill Warren
 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING (ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT)
REGULATIONS 2009 SI 2263 (as amended) (the EIA Regulations)
PROPOSED Hirwaun Power Station (the project)
PROPOSAL BY Hirwaun Power Limited (the applicant)
 
I refer to the Environmental Impact Assessment received by Network Rail with regard to the above proposal.
Network Rail has a statutory obligation of ensure the availability of safe train paths and as such we are required to take an 
active interest in any development adjacent to our infrastructure that potentially could affect the safe operation of the 
railway. 
On specific matters, clearly our interest is to protect the physical railway infrastructure and we need to be satisfied there will 
be no adverse safety issues arising as a result of the development to rail users.
 
The only area affecting Network Rail’s infrastructure is the Gas Route 4 Corridor.  Any under track crossing required across 
Network Rail’s land will be subject to an easement with the appropriate utility company and Network Rail’s clearance 
process will apply which may not be conclusive.
 
Full technical requirements will be provided once an easement is in place and ground investigation reports have been 
provided.
 
Network Rail would need to be consulted on any planning application submitted as our primary concern is the safety of the 
operational railway.
 
Please feel free to get in contact if you have any questions.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir/Madam 
 
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT 1990 
PROPOSAL: HIRWAUN POWER STATION 
LOCATION: HIRWAUN POWER LIMITED 
 
I acknowledge receipt of the notification to the South Wales Fire and Rescue 
Authority in relation to the above application. 
 
The proposed site plan in relation to the above has been examined and the Fire and 
Rescue Authority wish the following comments to be brought to the attention of the 
committee/applicant.  It is important that these matters are dealt with in the early 
stages of any proposed development. 
 
The developer should consider the need for the provision of:- 
 
a. 
adequate water supplies on the site for firefighting purposes; and 
 
b. 
access for emergency firefighting appliances. 
 
Should the applicant require further information in relation to these matters they 
should contact the above named fire safety officer. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
Duly signed and authorised by 
 
Signed

Pedestrian Priority 
 
 
Pedestrian schemes must take into account the need for permanent and 
unobstructed access for firefighting appliances.  The siting of ornamental 
structures such as flower beds, must take account, not only of the access 
requirements of the fire appliances but the need to be able to site then in 
strategic positions; in particular, account must be taken of the working space 
requirements for aerial appliances.  Consultation must take place with the Fire 
Authority during the earliest planning stages of any development to ensure 
adequate access for fire appliances, their siting and use. 
 
2.0 
Water Supplies for Firefighting 
 
The existing output of the statutory water supply network may need to be 
upgraded in certain parts of the local plan area to cater for firefighting needs of 
new developments.  It is recommended that this provision be a condition of 
planning consent. 
 
 
Access to Open Water Supplies 
 
 
Where development of water front sites takes place, the need for permanent 
and unobstructed access for firefighting appliances to the water should be 
made a condition of any planning consent. 
 
 
Consultation must take place with the Fire Authority during the earliest 
planning stages of any development to ensure access for fire pumping 
appliances is satisfactory. 
 
2.1 
Housing 
 
 
Minimum main size 100mm.  Housing developments with units of detached or 
semi-detached houses of not more than two floors should have a water supply 
capable of delivering a minimum of eight litres per second through any hydrant 
on the development. 
 
 
Housing developments with units of more than two floors should have a water 
supply capable of delivering a minimum of 20 to 35 litres per second through 
any hydrant on the development. 
 
2.2 
Transportation 
 
 
Lorry/Coach Parks - Multi-Storey Car Parks-Service Stations 
 
 
Minimum main size 100mm.  All of these amenities should have a water 
supply capable of delivering a minimum of 25 litres per second through any 
hydrant on the development or within a vehicular distance of 90 metres from 
the complex. 
 
2.3 
Industry 
 
 
In order that an adequate supply of water is available for use by the Fire 
Authority in case of fire, it is recommended that the water supply infrastructure 
to any Industrial estate is as follows: 
 
 
Light Industrial 
 
 
Minimum Main Size 100mm 
 
Up to one hectare, 20 litres per second 
 
 
Commercial/Industrial 
 
 
Up to two hectares, 35 litres per second - Minimum Main Size 150mm 
 
 
 
High Risk Industrial 
 
 
Two to three hectares 50 litres per second - Minimum Main Size 150mm. Over 
three hectares, 75 litres per second. 
 
 
In rural areas it may not be possible to provide sufficient mains water.  To 
overcome this, static or river supplies would be considered on site at the 
above flow rates for at least one hour. 
 
 
The Fire Authority should be consulted at the outline planning stage of any 
proposed projects to ascertain the exact requirements, as high risk units may 
require a greater flow. 
 
2.4 
Shopping, Health and Community Facilities 
 
 
Village Halls 
 
Should have a water supply capable of delivering a minimum of 15 litres per 
second through any hydrant on the development or within a vehicular distance 
of 100 metres from the complex. 
 
 
Primary Schools and single storey Health Centres 
 
Should have a water supply capable of delivering a minimum of 20 litres per 
second through any hydrant on the development or within a vehicular distance 
of 70 metres from the complex. 
 
 
Secondary Schools, Colleges, Large Health and Community Facilities 
 
Should have a water supply capable of delivering a minimum of 35 litres per 
second through any hydrant on the development or within a vehicular distance 
of 70 metres from the complex. 
 
2.6 
Distances Between Fire Hydrants 
 
 
The distance between fire hydrants should not exceed the following: 
 
Residential areas 
 
 
 
- 
200 metres 
 
Industrial Estates (Subject  
 
- 
150 metres 
 
to operational needs) 
 
Town centre areas  
 
 
-        90 metres 
 
Commercial (Offices & Shops) 
 
-

2.7 
Conclusion 
 
 
Developers should hold joint discussion with Dwr Cymru - Welsh Water or the 
National Rivers Authority and the Fire Authority to ensure that adequate water 
supplies are available in case of fire. the Fire Authority reserve the right to ask 
for static water supplies for firefighting on site as a condition of planning 
consent, if the supply infrastructure is inadequate for any given risk.

APPENDIX 3 
PRESENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT 
The 
Infrastructure 
Planning 
(Applications: 
Prescribed 
Forms 
and 
Procedure) Regulations 2009 (SI 2264) (as amended) sets out the 
information which must be provided for an application for a development 
consent order (DCO) for nationally significant infrastructure under the 
Planning Act 2008. Where required, this includes an environmental 
statement. Applicants may also provide any other documents considered 
necessary 
to 
support 
the 
application. 
Information 
which 
is 
not 
environmental information need not be replicated or included in the ES.  
An environmental statement (ES) is described under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2263) 
(as amended) (the EIA Regulations) as a statement: 
a) 
‘that includes such of the information referred to in Part 1 of 
Schedule 4 as is reasonably required to assess the environmental 
effects of the development and of any associated development and 
which the applicant can, having regard in particular to current 
knowledge and methods of assessment, reasonably be required to 
compile; but 
b) 
that includes at least the information required in Part 2 of Schedule 
4’. 
(EIA Regulations Regulation 2) 
The purpose of an ES is to ensure that the environmental effects of a 
proposed development are fully considered, together with the economic or 
social benefits of the development, before the development consent 
application under the Planning Act 2008 is determined.  The ES should be 
an aid to decision making. 
The SoS advises that the ES should be laid out clearly with a minimum 
amount of technical terms and should provide a clear objective and 
realistic description of the likely significant impacts of the proposed 
development. The information should be presented so as to be 
comprehensible to the specialist and non-specialist alike. The SoS 
recommends that the ES be concise with technical information placed in 
appendices. 
ES Indicative Contents 
The SoS emphasises that the ES should be a ‘stand alone’ document in 
line with best practice and case law. The EIA Regulations Schedule 4, 
Parts 1 and 2, set out the information for inclusion in environmental 
statements.  
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations states this information includes: 
‘17.  
Description of the development, including in particular— 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
(a)  
a description of the physical characteristics of the 
whole development and the land-use requirements 
during the construction and operational phases; 
(b)  
a description of the main characteristics of the 
production processes, for instance, nature and quantity 
of the materials used; 
(c)  
an estimate, by type and quantity, of expected 
residues and emissions (water, air and soil pollution, 
noise, vibration, light, heat, radiation, etc) resulting 
from the operation of the proposed development. 
 
18.  
An outline of the main alternatives studied by the applicant 
and an indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s 
choice, taking into account the environmental effects. 
 
19.  
A description of the aspects of the environment likely to be 
significantly affected by the development, including, in 
particular, population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic 
factors, material assets, including the architectural and 
archaeological heritage, landscape and the interrelationship 
between the above factors. 
 
20.  
A description of the likely significant effects of the 
development on the environment, which should cover the 
direct effects and any indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, 
medium and long-term, permanent and temporary, positive 
and negative effects of the development, resulting from: 
(a)  
the existence of the development; 
(b) 
the use of natural resources; 
(c)  
the emission of pollutants, the creation of nuisances 
and the elimination of waste,  
and the description by the applicant of the forecasting 
methods used to assess the effects on the environment. 
 
21.  
A description of the measures envisaged to prevent, reduce 
and where possible offset any significant adverse effects on 
the environment. 
 
22.  
A non-technical summary of the information provided under 
paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Part. 
 
23.  
An indication of any difficulties (technical deficiencies or lack 
of know-how) encountered by the applicant in compiling the 
required information’. 
EIA Regulations Schedule 4 Part 1 
4.18 
The content of the ES must include as a minimum those matters 
set out in Schedule 4 Part 2 of the EIA Regulations.  This includes 
the consideration of ‘the main alternatives studied by the 
applicant’ which the SoS recommends could be addressed as a 
separate chapter in the ES.  Part 2 is included below for reference: 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
4.19 
Schedule 4 Part 2 
• 
A description of the development comprising information on the 
site, design and size of the development 
• 
A description of the measures envisaged in order to avoid, reduce 
and, if possible, remedy significant adverse effects 
• 
The data required to identify and assess the main effects which the 
development is likely to have on the environment 
• 
An outline of the main alternatives studies by the applicant and an 
indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into 
account the environmental effects, and 
• 
A non-technical summary of the information provided [under the 
four paragraphs above]. 
Traffic and transport is not specified as a topic for assessment under 
Schedule 4; although in line with good practice the SoS considers it is an 
important consideration per se, as well as being the source of further 
impacts in terms of air quality and noise and vibration. 
Balance 
The SoS recommends that the ES should be balanced, with matters which 
give rise to a greater number or more significant impacts being given 
greater prominence. Where few or no impacts are identified, the technical 
section may be much shorter, with greater use of information in 
appendices as appropriate. 
The SoS considers that the ES should not be a series of disparate reports 
and stresses the importance of considering inter-relationships between 
factors and cumulative impacts. 
Scheme Proposals  
The scheme parameters will need to be clearly defined in the draft DCO 
and therefore in the accompanying ES which should support the 
application as described. The SoS is not able to entertain material changes 
to a project once an application is submitted. The SoS draws the attention 
of the applicant to the DCLG and the Planning Inspectorate’s published 
advice on the preparation of a draft DCO and accompanying application 
documents. 
Flexibility  
The SoS acknowledges that the EIA process is iterative, and therefore the 
proposals may change and evolve. For example, there may be changes to 
the scheme design in response to consultation. Such changes should be 
addressed in the ES. However, at the time of the application for a DCO, 
any proposed scheme parameters should not be so wide ranging as to 
represent effectively different schemes. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
It is a matter for the applicant, in preparing an ES, to consider whether it 
is possible to assess robustly a range of impacts resulting from a large 
number of undecided parameters. The description of the proposed 
development in the ES must not be so wide that it is insufficiently certain 
to comply with requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the 
EIA Regulations. 
The Rochdale Envelope principle (see R v Rochdale MBC ex parte Tew 
(1999) and R v Rochdale MBC ex parte Milne (2000)) is an accepted way 
of dealing with uncertainty in preparing development applications. The 
applicant’s attention is drawn to the Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 9 
‘Rochdale Envelope’ which is available on the Advice Note’s page of the 
National Infrastructure Planning website.  
The applicant should make every attempt to narrow the range of options 
and explain clearly in the ES which elements of the scheme have yet to be 
finalised and provide the reasons. Where some flexibility is sought and the 
precise details are not known, the applicant should assess the maximum 
potential adverse impacts the project could have to ensure that the 
project as it may be constructed has been properly assessed.  
The ES should be able to confirm that any changes to the development 
within any proposed parameters would not result in significant impacts not 
previously identified and assessed. The maximum and other dimensions of 
the proposed development should be clearly described in the ES, with 
appropriate justification. It will also be important to consider choice of 
materials, colour and the form of the structures and of any buildings. 
Lighting proposals should also be described. 
Scope 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas should be 
identified under all the environmental topics and should be sufficiently 
robust in order to undertake the assessment. The extent of the study 
areas should be on the basis of recognised professional guidance, 
whenever such guidance is available. The study areas should also be 
agreed with the relevant consultees and local authorities and, where this 
is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the ES and a reasoned 
justification given. The scope should also cover the breadth of the topic 
area and the temporal scope, and these aspects should be described and 
justified. 
Physical Scope 
In general the SoS recommends that the physical scope for the EIA should 
be determined in the light of: 
• 
the nature of the proposal being considered 
• 
the relevance in terms of the specialist topic  
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
• 
the breadth of the topic 
• 
the physical extent of any surveys or the study area, and 
• 
the potential significant impacts. 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas should be 
identified for each of the environmental topics and should be sufficiently 
robust in order to undertake the assessment. This should include at least 
the whole of the application site, and include all offsite works. For certain 
topics, such as landscape and transport, the study area will need to be 
wider. The extent of the study areas should be on the basis of recognised 
professional guidance and best practice, whenever this is available, and 
determined by establishing the physical extent of the likely impacts. The 
study areas should also be agreed with the relevant consultees and, 
where this is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the ES and a 
reasoned justification given.  
Breadth of the Topic Area 
The ES should explain the range of matters to be considered under each 
topic and this may respond partly to the type of project being considered.  
If the range considered is drawn narrowly then a justification for the 
approach should be provided. 
Temporal Scope 
The assessment should consider: 
• 
environmental impacts during construction works 
• 
environmental impacts on completion/operation of the development 
• 
where appropriate, environmental impacts a suitable number of 
years after completion of the development (for example, in order to 
allow for traffic growth or maturing of any landscape proposals), and 
• 
environmental impacts during decommissioning. 
In terms of decommissioning, the SoS acknowledges that the further into 
the future any assessment is made, the less reliance may be placed on 
the outcome. However, the purpose of such a long term assessment, as 
well as to enable the decommissioning of the works to be taken into 
account, is to encourage early consideration as to how structures can be 
taken down. The purpose of this is to seek to minimise disruption, to re-
use materials and to restore the site or put it to a suitable new use. The 
SoS encourages consideration of such matters in the ES. 
The SoS recommends that these matters should be set out clearly in the 
ES and that the suitable time period for the assessment should be agreed 
with the relevant statutory consultees.  
The SoS recommends that throughout the ES a standard terminology for 
time periods should be defined, such that for example, ‘short term’ always 
refers to the same period of time.   
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
Baseline 
The SoS recommends that the baseline should describe the position from 
which the impacts of the proposed development are measured. The 
baseline should be chosen carefully and, whenever possible, be consistent 
between topics. The identification of a single baseline is to be welcomed in 
terms of the approach to the assessment, although it is recognised that 
this may not always be possible. 
The SoS recommends that the baseline environment should be clearly 
explained in the ES, including any dates of surveys, and care should be 
taken to ensure that all the baseline data remains relevant and up to date.  
For each of the environmental topics, the data source(s) for the baseline 
should be set out together with any survey work undertaken with the 
dates.  The timing and scope of all surveys should be agreed with the 
relevant statutory bodies and appropriate consultees, wherever possible.   
The baseline situation and the proposed development should be described 
within the context of the site and any other proposals in the vicinity. 
Identification of Impacts and Method Statement 
Legislation and Guidelines 
In terms of the EIA methodology, the SoS recommends that reference 
should be made to best practice and any standards, guidelines and 
legislation that have been used to inform the assessment. This should 
include guidelines prepared by relevant professional bodies. 
In terms of other regulatory regimes, the SoS recommends that relevant 
legislation and all permit and licences required should be listed in the ES 
where relevant to each topic. This information should also be submitted 
with the application in accordance with the APFP Regulations. 
In terms of assessing the impacts, the ES should approach all relevant 
planning and environmental policy – local, regional and national (and 
where appropriate international) – in a consistent manner. 
Assessment of Effects and Impact Significance 
The EIA Regulations require the identification of the ‘likely significant 
effects of the development on the environment’ (Schedule 4 Part 1 
paragraph 20). 
As a matter of principle, the SoS applies the precautionary approach to 
follow the Court’s2 reasoning in judging ‘significant effects’. In other words 
                                       
2 See Landelijke Vereniging tot Behoud van de Waddenzee and Nederlandse 
Vereniging tot Bescherming van Vogels v Staatssecretris van Landbouw 
(Waddenzee Case No C 127/02/2004) 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
‘likely to affect’ will be taken as meaning that there is a probability or risk 
that the development will have an effect, and not that a development will 
definitely have an effect. 
The SoS considers it is imperative for the ES to define the meaning of 
‘significant’ in the context of each of the specialist topics and for 
significant impacts to be clearly identified. The SoS recommends that the 
criteria should be set out fully and that the ES should set out clearly the 
interpretation of ‘significant’ in terms of each of the EIA topics. 
Quantitative criteria should be used where available. The SoS considers 
that this should also apply to the consideration of cumulative impacts and 
impact inter-relationships. 
The SoS recognises that the way in which each element of the 
environment may be affected by the proposed development can be 
approached in a number of ways. However it considers that it would be 
helpful, in terms of ease of understanding and in terms of clarity of 
presentation, to consider the impact assessment in a similar manner for 
each of the specialist topic areas. The SoS recommends that a common 
format should be applied where possible.  
Inter-relationships between environmental factors 
The inter-relationship between aspects of the environments likely to be 
significantly affected is a requirement of the EIA Regulations (see 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations). These occur where a number of 
separate impacts, e.g. noise and air quality, affect a single receptor such 
as fauna. 
The SoS considers that the inter-relationships between factors must be 
assessed in order to address the environmental impacts of the proposal as 
a whole. This will help to ensure that the ES is not a series of separate 
reports collated into one document, but rather a comprehensive 
assessment drawing together the environmental impacts of the proposed 
development. This is particularly important when considering impacts in 
terms of any permutations or parameters to the proposed development. 
Cumulative Impacts  
The potential cumulative impacts with other major developments will need 
to be identified, as required by the Directive. The significance of such 
impacts should be shown to have been assessed against the baseline 
position (which would include built and operational development). In 
assessing cumulative impacts, other major development should be 
identified through consultation with the local planning authorities and 
other relevant authorities on the basis of those that are: 
• 
under construction 
• 
permitted application(s), but not yet implemented 
• 
submitted application(s) not yet determined  
• 
projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects 
                                                                                                              
 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
• 
identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging 
development plans - with appropriate weight being given as they 
move closer to adoption) recognising that much information on any 
relevant proposals will be limited, and 
• 
identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set 
the framework for future development consents/approvals, where 
such development is reasonably likely to come forward. 
Details should be provided in the ES, including the types of development, 
location and key aspects that may affect the EIA and how these have been 
taken into account as part of the assessment.   
The SoS recommends that offshore wind farms should also take account 
of any offshore licensed and consented activities in the area, for the 
purposes of assessing cumulative effects, through consultation with the 
relevant licensing/consenting bodies. 
For the purposes of identifying any cumulative effects with other 
developments in the area, applicants should also consult consenting 
bodies in other EU states to assist in identifying those developments (see 
commentary on Transboundary Effects below). 
Related Development 
The ES should give equal prominence to any development which is related 
with the proposed development to ensure that all the impacts of the 
proposal are assessed.   
The SoS recommends that the applicant should distinguish between 
development for which development consent will be sought and any other 
development. This distinction should be clear in the ES.  
Alternatives 
The ES must set out an outline of the main alternatives studied by the 
applicant and provide an indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s 
choice, taking account of the environmental effect (Schedule 4 Part 1 
paragraph 18). 
Matters should be included, such as inter alia alternative design options 
and alternative mitigation measures. The justification for the final choice 
and evolution of the scheme development should be made clear.  Where 
other sites have been considered, the reasons for the final choice should 
be addressed.  
The SoS advises that the ES should give sufficient attention to the 
alternative forms and locations for the off-site proposals, where 
appropriate, and justify the needs and choices made in terms of the form 
of the development proposed and the sites chosen. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
Mitigation Measures  
Mitigation measures may fall into certain categories namely: avoid; 
reduce; compensate or enhance (see Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 21); 
and should be identified as such in the specialist topics. Mitigation 
measures should not be developed in isolation as they may relate to more 
than one topic area. For each topic, the ES should set out any mitigation 
measures required to prevent, reduce and where possible offset any 
significant adverse effects, and to identify any residual effects with 
mitigation in place. Any proposed mitigation should be discussed and 
agreed with the relevant consultees. 
The effectiveness of mitigation should be apparent. Only mitigation 
measures which are a firm commitment and can be shown to be 
deliverable should be taken into account as part of the assessment. 
It would be helpful if the mitigation measures proposed could be cross 
referred to specific provisions and/or requirements proposed within the 
draft development consent order. This could be achieved by means of 
describing the mitigation measures proposed either in each of the 
specialist reports or collating these within a summary section on 
mitigation. 
The SoS advises that it is considered best practice to outline in the ES, the 
structure of the environmental management and monitoring plan and 
safety procedures which will be adopted during construction and operation 
and may be adopted during decommissioning. 
Cross References and Interactions 
The SoS recommends that all the specialist topics in the ES should cross 
reference their text to other relevant disciplines. Interactions between the 
specialist topics is essential to the production of a robust assessment, as 
the ES should not be a collection of separate specialist topics, but a 
comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposal 
and how these impacts can be mitigated. 
As set out in EIA Regulations Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 23, the ES 
should include an indication of any technical difficulties (technical 
deficiencies or lack of know-how) encountered by the applicant in 
compiling the required information. 
Consultation 
The SoS recommends that any changes to the scheme design in response 
to consultation should be addressed in the ES. 
It is recommended that the applicant provides preliminary environmental 
information (PEI) (this term is defined in the EIA Regulations under 
regulation 2 ‘Interpretation’) to the local authorities.  
Consultation with the local community should be carried out in accordance 
with the SoCC which will state how the applicant intends to consult on the 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
preliminary environmental information (PEI). This PEI could include results 
of detailed surveys and recommended mitigation actions. Where effective 
consultation is carried out in accordance with Section 47 of the Planning 
Act, this could usefully assist the applicant in the EIA process – for 
example the local community may be able to identify possible mitigation 
measures to address the impacts identified in the PEI. Attention is drawn 
to the duty upon applicants under Section 50 of the Planning Act to have 
regard to the guidance on pre-application consultation. 
Transboundary Effects 
The SoS recommends that consideration should be given in the ES to any 
likely significant effects on the environment of another Member State of 
the European Economic Area. In particular, the SoS recommends 
consideration should be given to discharges to the air and water and to 
potential impacts on migratory species and to impacts on shipping and 
fishing areas.  
The Applicant’s attention is also drawn to the Planning Inspectorate’s 
Advice Note 12 ‘Development with significant transboundary impacts 
consultation’ which is available on the Advice Notes Page of the National 
Infrastructure Planning website 
Summary Tables 
The SoS recommends that in order to assist the decision making process, 
the applicant may wish to consider the use of tables: 
Table X 
to identify and collate the residual impacts after mitigation on 
the 
basis 
of 
specialist 
topics, 
inter-relationships 
and 
cumulative impacts. 
Table XX 
to demonstrate how the assessment has taken account of 
this Opinion and other responses to consultation.  
Table XXX to set out the mitigation measures proposed, as well as 
assisting the reader, the SoS considers that this would also 
enable the applicant to cross refer mitigation to specific 
provisions 
proposed 
to 
be 
included 
within 
the 
draft 
Development Consent Order. 
Table XXXX to cross reference where details in the HRA (where one is 
provided) such as descriptions of sites and their locations, 
together with any mitigation or compensation measures, are 
to be found in the ES. 
Terminology and Glossary of Technical Terms 
The SoS recommends that a common terminology should be adopted. This 
will help to ensure consistency and ease of understanding for the decision 
making process. For example, ‘the site’ should be defined and used only in 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
terms of this definition so as to avoid confusion with, for example, the 
wider site area or the surrounding site.  
A glossary of technical terms should be included in the ES.  
Presentation 
The ES should have all of its paragraphs numbered, as this makes 
referencing easier as well as accurate.  
Appendices must be clearly referenced, again with all paragraphs 
numbered.  
All figures and drawings, photographs and photomontages should be 
clearly referenced.  Figures should clearly show the proposed site 
application boundary. 
Bibliography 
A bibliography should be included in the ES. The author, date and 
publication title should be included for all references.  All publications 
referred to within the technical reports should be included. 
Non Technical Summary 
The EIA Regulations require a Non Technical Summary (EIA Regulations 
Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 22). This should be a summary of the 
assessment in simple language. It should be supported by appropriate 
figures, photographs and photomontages.
