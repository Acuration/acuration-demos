Background 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 This document comprises a Habitats Regulations Assessment: No Significant 
Effects Report, relating to the Millbrook Power Project (hereafter referred to as 
the “Project”). It has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on 
behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), (the "Applicant"). 
1.1.2 The Project is proposed at the former clay extraction pit named Rookery South 
Pit, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the approximate centre of the site at grid 
reference 501373, 240734 (the "Project Site").  The boundary of the Project Site 
falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC) areas.  The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 (the "Act") and 
therefore requires development consent under the Act.  
1.1.3 The application for the DCO is being made to the Planning Inspectorate 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 and is in accordance with the Infrastructure 
Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2009 
(the “APFP Regulations”). 
1.1.4 Before the Secretary of State can decide to grant a DCO for the Project they 
must determine whether it is likely to have a significant effect on a European 
site (whether alone or in combination with other plans or projects), in view of 
that site's conservation objectives.  This requirement is set down in Regulation 
61 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
(the "Habitats Regulations").   
1.1.5 APFP Regulation 5(2)(g) requires that the Application should be accompanied 
by a report which identifies any site that may be affected by the development 
and to which Regulation 61 of the Habitats Regulations applies. These sites are 
commonly referred to as ‘European Sites’.  European Sites include: Sites of 
Community Importance (SCIs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) 
(including candidate SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), which 
together, form the Natura 2000 network, which aims to assure the long-term 
survival of Europe’s most valuable and threatened habitats. 
1.1.6 In accordance with paragraph 1.4 of PINS Advice Note 101, potential SPAs and 
possible SACs being considered by the Secretary of State for classification as 
a SPA/ SAC, should be given the same protection as a fully classified SPA/ 
SAC. In addition, Ramsar Sites and proposed Ramsar Sites (wetlands of 
international importance listed under the Ramsar convention) should be given 
the same protection as European Sites. Sites identified, or required, as 
compensatory measures for adverse effects on European Sites, potential SPAs,

possible SACs, and listed or proposed Ramsar sites should also be considered 
as European Sites. 
1.1.7 This report is intended to provide the information necessary for the Secretary of 
State to make their assessment and it has been prepared in accordance with 
PINS Advice Note 102.  It has been prepared in accordance with the 
methodology for HRA set out in The Habitats Regulations Assessment 
Handbook3. 
1.1.8 The Project would comprise: 
� 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of 
up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the 
terminals of the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
� 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
� 
a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
‘Access Road’ or ‘Short Access Road’);  
� 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’); 
� 
a new underground gas pipeline connection approximately 1.8km in length (the ‘Pipeline’) 
to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System 
(the ‘Gas Connection’). This Gas Connection also incorporates an Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System. and 
� 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), 
comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower 
(which will replace an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option 
would require two SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and 
both circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres 
in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
1.1.9 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 
ha in area.  
1.1.10 The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land 
upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order 
to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’.

The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is described in more 
detail in Chapter 3 of the ES, Document Reference 6.1. 
1.1.11 A full glossary of defined terms is presented in the Project Glossary (Document 
Reference 1.4). 
1.1.12 The Project Site and all elements of the Project listed above are shown on 
Figure 1.2 of the ES for the Project (Document Reference 6.3).    
1.1.13 The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former clay 
pits known as ‘The Rookery’, with the Gas and Electrical Connections extending 
from The Rookery into adjacent agricultural land to the south.  
1.1.14 The total construction programme will be approximately 22 months, with an 
anticipated start date of 2020 and an end date of 2022.  The operational life of 
the Power Generation Plant will be 25 years.   
1.1.15 The decommissioning phase will be similar in duration to the construction 
phase.  The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at the 
end of its operational life.  Elements such as the Pipeline may be capped and 
left in situ.  
1.2 
Project Site and Surroundings 
The Rookery 
1.2.1 The Project Site is partially located within 'The Rookery'.  The Rookery 
comprises two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South (both shown 
on Figure 1.2)) covering an area of some 210 ha, separated by an east-west 
spine of unexcavated clay.  The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale 
between Milton Keynes and Bedford. It lies predominantly within the 
administrative area of Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) although it also falls, 
in part, within the administrative area of the adjacent Bedford Borough Council 
(BBC).  
1.2.2 The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within part of 
Rookery South Pit which is approximately 95 ha in area and is bound by steep 
clay banks that are varied in nature and substrate. The level of the pit base 
currently varies between approximately 10 and 15 m below ground level and 
includes open water, reed beds, pools and bare inundated clay.  The land that 
remains at the original ground level, approximately 42 m above ordnance datum 
(AOD) immediately around the periphery of Rookery South Pit is predominantly 
bare ground that has been previously cleared of vegetation and subsequently 
maintained in this state over approximately the last 30 years or so.  
1.2.3 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would extend from Rookery 
South Pit into farmland to the south as shown on ES Figure 1.2 of Document 
Reference 6.3. Part of the Access Road would lie within Rookery North Pit.

Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
1.2.4 The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing LLRS being undertaken by the 
landowner pursuant to a separate planning consent (application number -  
BC/CM/2000/8) in order to restore the former clay workings (i.e. below pre-
excavation ground levels) to low-intensity agricultural land, with measures 
included in the restoration to enhance biodiversity and landscape.  This 
restoration work is taking place independently of the Project, although a five-
year option agreement, which is extendable to seven under certain conditions, 
has been put in place between the Applicant and the landowner of Rookery Pit. 
Included in the agreement is a clause which ensures that the elements of the 
LLRS, as set out below, will be completed prior to the commencement of the 
development of the Project (anticipated to be in 2020). The HRA assessment 
assumes that the following LLRS works for Rookery South Pit have been 
completed:   
� 
the re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils and clays from the 
permitted extraction area on the southern side with re-grading of the base of the pit to an 
approximate level of 15mbgl; 
� 
implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction of an attenuation 
pond and pumping station in order to facilitate a managed surface water drainage 
strategy; 
� 
a landscape strategy to include planting on the boundary of the [Rookery South Pit] and 
the margins of the attenuation pond;  
� 
provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to ensure the long-
term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through excavation; 
� 
provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of Rookery North Pit 
and around the attenuation pond within Rookery South Pit;  
� 
provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North Pit which 
connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along the western side of 
Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp and existing track are both of an agricultural 
standard; and 
� 
provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery South Pit from the 
south side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, near Millbrook Station. 
1.2.5 To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of the existing extent of Rookery South 
Pit will be undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms part of 
the existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not historically been 
subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will provide material 
for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to Rookery South Pit 
together with the implementation of a landscape and ecology strategy, which 
will integrate with ecological mitigation works and strategic landscape planting 
in Rookery North Pit.  
1.2.6 The LLRS works will be completed prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project, with the possible exception of buttressing and re-profiling 
HRA No Significant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
to the eastern side of Rookery South Pit, which has no bearing on the Project 
as it lies outside the boundary of the Project Site.  
1.2.7 Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 
15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating 
Equipment Site, Laydown Area and the Substation.  
1.3 
European Sites in the Vicinity of the Project 
1.3.1 There are no specific criteria in PINS Advice Note 10 for the Screening of effects 
on European Sites (Appendix A).  The study area for Screening is dependent 
upon the scale and nature of the project and European Site, and the surrounding 
environment where the potential for significant effects could reasonably be 
considered to occur.  A search area of 10 km for European Sites was adopted, 
which would be extended for any European Sites that are hydrologically linked 
with the Project Site e.g. via a watercourse. This is in line with the approach 
taken in the Ecological Impact Assessment for the Project (Chapter 8 of the ES, 
Document Reference 6.1). The nature and scale of potential effects is typically 
limited by distance, and it is considered that beyond 10 km, any potential effects 
arising from the Project would be so minimal as to have an imperceptible effect 
on European Sites beyond this distance. The study area for European sites was 
discussed and agreed during consultation with Natural England as part of the 
Ecological Impact Assessment for the Project (see Appendix B). 
1.3.2 No European Sites (as defined in Sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 above) have been 
identified within the 10 km search area.    
1.3.3 The European Sites considered in this No Significant Effects Report are located 
beyond the 10 km search area (see below); and as such, this report has been 
produced to record the assessment of no likely significant effects. 
1.3.4 The nearest European Site to the Project Site is Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, 
which is located approximately 27 km to the south-west.  The nearest SPA/ 
Ramsar Site is the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA/ Ramsar Site, which is 
28 km away to the north-west of the Project Site.   
1.3.5 The locations of the European Sites in relation to the Project Site are illustrated 
on Figure 1 at the end of this document.   
1.4 
HRA process 
1.4.1 A Habitats Regulations Assessment is a step-wise process involving a series of 
tests undertaken in a strict order so as to ensure a correct and robust 
determination that accords with the Regulations. The requirements of the 
Habitats Directive comprise four distinct stages:  
� 
Stage 1: Screening is the process which initially identifies the likely effects 
upon a European Site of a project or plan, either alone or in combination 
with other projects or plans, and considers whether these effects may be 
significant. It is important to note that the burden of evidence is to show, 
HRA No Significant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
on the basis of objective information, that there will be no significant effect; 
if the effect may be significant, or is not known, that would trigger the need 
for an Appropriate Assessment. There is European Court of Justice case 
law to the effect that unless the likelihood of a significant effect can be 
ruled out on the basis of objective information, then an Appropriate 
Assessment must be made.  
� 
Stage 2: Appropriate Assessment is the detailed consideration of the effects 
on the integrity of the European Site of the project or plan, either alone or 
in combination with other projects or plans, with respect to the site’s 
conservation objectives and its structure and function.  This is to determine 
whether or not there will be adverse effects on the integrity of the site. This 
stage also includes the development of mitigation measures to avoid or 
reduce any possible effects.   
� 
Stage 3: Assessment of alternative solutions is the process which examines 
alternative ways of achieving the objectives of the project or plan that 
would avoid adverse effects on the integrity of the European Site, should 
avoidance or mitigation measures associated with the proposed project be 
unable to cancel out adverse effects.  
� 
Stage 4: Assessment where no alternative solutions exist and where 
adverse effects remain. Should no alternative solutions be available, at 
Stage 4 an assessment is made with regard to whether or not the 
development is necessary for imperative reasons of overriding public 
interest (IROPI) and, if so, of the compensatory measures needed to 
maintain the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network. 
1.4.2 This HRA No Significant Effects Report (Stage 1) has assessed effects resulting 
from the Project in order to determine whether these are likely to result in a 
significant effect on any one of the European Sites in the vicinity of the Project 
Site, either alone, or in combination with other projects. The potential for the 
Project to require other consents relevant to the assessment of likely significant 
effects has also been considered.  
1.4.3 If the assessment concludes the Project is likely to have significant effects on a 
European site, the process of assessment will then progress to Stage 2 
(Appropriate Assessment) to consider, in consultation with Natural England, 
whether the proposal will adversely affect the integrity of any one of the 
European Sites identified, either alone or in combination with other projects. 
However, if the assessment concludes the Project will have no likely significant 
effect(s) on the interest features of the European sites, no further HRA 
assessment is required, allowing the Project to proceed, subject to other 
relevant regulatory controls.

2.2 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA 
2.2.1 The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA comprises an extensive area of 
disused sand and gravel pits adjacent to the River Nene in Northamptonshire.  
The shallow and deep open waters, marginal features, (including sparsely-
vegetated islands, gravel bars and shorelines) and other habitats (including 
reedswamp, marsh, wet ditches, rush pasture, rough grassland and scattered 
scrub) provide foraging and roosting habitat for assemblages of wetland birds 
of international importance during the non-breeding season. 
2.2.2 The SPA qualifies under Article 4.1 of Directive 2009/147/EC as it is used 
regularly by 1% or more of the Great Britain populations of the Annex I species 
(wintering) listed in Table 1 below.

Screening 
3.1 
Methodology 
3.1.1 European Commission guidance (2001)5 recommends that screening should 
fulfil the following steps:  
1. Determine whether the plan (or policy) is directly connected with or 
necessary for the management of Natura 2000 sites. 
2. Describe the plan and describe and characterise any other plans or 
projects which, in combination, have the potential for having significant 
effects on Natura 2000 sites.  
3. Identify the potential effects on Natura 2000 sites.  
4. Assess the likely significance of any effects on Natura 2000 sites.  
3.1.2 The first part of the screening process therefore requires consideration of the 
project or plan in respect of whether it is directly connected with or necessary 
for the management of European Sites. ‘Directly’ in this context means solely 
conceived for the conservation management of a site and ‘management’ in this 
context refers to the management measures required in order to maintain in 
favourable condition the features for which the European Site has been 
designated. 
3.1.3 The Project is not directly connected with, or necessary for, the management of 
Chilterns Beechwoods SAC or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA or 
Ramsar Site.  
3.1.4 It is possible that the Project will require other consents such as in relation to 
works on existing drains/ watercourses or electrical/ gas infrastructure. 
However, as there are no connections via the water environment, and given the 
distance of the Project Site from Chilterns Beechwoods SAC or the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits SPA or Ramsar Site and lack of effect pathways; it is 
considered unlikely that any other consents will require consideration of likely 
significant effects by other Competent Authorities. The Project Site does not 
overlap into devolved administrations or other EEA States, and there are 
therefore no significant effects in respect of European Sites in such areas.  
3.1.5 The screening assessment for the Project, which addresses the other three 
steps of the process, is presented in matrix form in Section 3.2 (below).  In 
addition, screening matrices provided within the Planning Inspectorate Advice 
Note 10 are included as Appendix A1 to A3 of this NSER.   
3.1.6 A critical part of the HRA screening process is determining whether or not the 
proposals are likely to have a significant effect on European Sites and,

therefore, if they will require an Appropriate Assessment. Judgements regarding 
significance should be made in relation to the qualifying interests for which the 
site is of European importance and also its conservation objectives. A significant 
effect is defined as being any effect that would undermine the conservation 
objectives for a European Site.    
3.2 
Screening Assessment 
3.2.1 The Chilterns Beechwoods SAC is 27 km from the Project Site and is the 
nearest European Site. It is separated from the Project Site by extensive areas 
of agricultural land, the M1 motorway and the urban areas of Dunstable and 
Luton. There are no watercourses or other natural features which directly 
connect the SAC to the Project Site.  
3.2.2 The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits 
Ramsar Site follow the same boundary.  The SPA and Ramsar Site are located 
approximately 28 km to the north-west of the Project Site.  These sites are 
separated from the Project Site by the town of Bedford and other urban areas, 
the River Great Ouse, and extensive areas of agricultural land. 
3.2.3 The consideration of potential effects on Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Site, as a result of the Project, 
is detailed in the screening assessment in Table 4 below. The format of Table 
4 is adapted from the Screening Matrix template provided in HD 44/09 Volume 
11 Section 4 Part 1 of the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges6. 
Table 4: Consideration of effects in the Screening Assessment 
Description of project 
Description of any likely direct, indirect or secondary impacts of the project (either 
alone or in combination with other plans or projects) on the European Site by virtue 
of: 
Size and scale 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away 
from the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites (which are located 
approximately 27 km and 28 km away, 
respectively), no impacts by virtue of the 
scale and size of the Project are expected. 
The maximum area for the Generating 
Equipment Site will be 4 ha.  The equipment 
to be installed includes a gas turbine, an 
emission stack of up to 35 m in height, 
buildings associated with operation and 
maintenance. A temporary Laydown Area for 
the storage of plant and equipment during

construction would also be provided adjacent 
to the Generating Equipment Site.  New Gas 
and Electrical Connections will also be 
established at the Project Site. In addition, an 
existing access track will be upgraded (the 
Access Road). 
Land take 
There will be no land-take in the Chilterns 
Beechwoods SAC, and the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites. 
Distance from the European Site or 
key features of the site (from Project 
boundary) 
The Chilterns Beechwoods SAC is located 
approximately 27 km to the south-west of the 
Project Site.  It is separated from the Project 
Site by extensive areas of agricultural land, 
the M1 motorway, a railway line, and the 
urban areas of Dunstable and Luton. 
The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Ramsar 
Site follow the same boundary.  The Upper 
Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar 
Site are located approximately 28 km to the 
north-west of the Project Site.  These sites 
are separated from the Project Site by the 
town of Bedford and other urban areas, the 
River Great Ouse, and extensive areas of 
agricultural land. 
Resource requirements (from the 
European Site or from areas in 
proximity to the site, where of 
relevance to consideration of 
impacts) 
No resource requirements from the Chilterns 
Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites or in 
proximity to these sites are required. 
Emissions (e.g. polluted surface 
water runoff both soluble and 
insoluble pollutants, atmospheric 
pollution) 
An assessment of potential effects on Air 
Quality as a result of the Project has been 
included as part of the Environmental Impact 
Assessment (chapter 6 of Document 
Reference 6.1).  This included consideration 
of potential effects on ecological receptors, 
including European Sites.  During this 
process, the potential for significant effects 
on the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites were ‘scoped out’ of further 
assessment, in accordance with the Institute 
of Air Quality Management’s ‘Guidance on 
the assessment of dust from demolition and 
construction’ (IAQM, 2016), and the EAs ‘Air 
Emissions Risk Assessment for your 
Environmental Permit’. Further information is 
provided in Section 6.5 of the ES for the 
Project (Document Reference 6.1).   
HRA No Significant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
Under these guidelines, the screening 
distances for construction and 
decommissioning dust effects for ecological 
receptors are: 50 m from the boundary of the 
site or 50 m from the routes used by 
construction vehicles on the public highway, 
within 500 m of the Project Site entrance.  
During Operation, the screening distance for 
European Sites, is 10 km from the 
approximate centre of the Generating 
Equipment Site.  As such, given that the 
Chilterns Beechwoods SAC and Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits SPA are located 27 km 
and 28 km away from the Project Site 
respectively, no significant effects as a result 
of the Project are expected. 
Even for those ecological receptors (that are 
not associated with the Chilterns 
Beechwoods SAC, and the Upper Nene 
Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites) 
and which fall within the screening distances, 
the assessment concluded that the Project 
will not result in any likely significant effects 
in relation to air quality either as a standalone 
project or cumulatively with other projects.  
All predicted nitrogen and deposition rates 
are insignificant when compared to the 
critical loads for the habitats under 
consideration, and no specific mitigation is 
required. 
There are no water bodies which connect the 
Project Site with the SAC, SPA or Ramsar 
Site.  There are therefore no conceivable 
effect pathways via the water environment as 
a result of the Project.   
Excavation requirements (e.g. 
impacts on local hydrogeology) 
There are no excavation requirements within 
the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper 
Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar 
Sites.  All excavation works that are required 
(detailed below) are confined within the 
Project Site, which is located approximately 
27 km and 28 km away from the Chilterns 
Beechwoods SAC and Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites 
respectively.  There are therefore no 
conceivable effect pathways due to 
excavations as a result of the Project. 
In any case, an outline of the excavation 
requirements and mitigation measures that 
will be implemented is provided below. 
To facilitate the proposed Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) of The Rookery,

extraction of clay from a currently un-worked 
area situated directly to the south of the 
existing extent of Rookery South Pit will be 
undertaken.  These works will be completed 
prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project. 
During the construction period for the Project, 
excavation works will be undertaken within 
the Project Site for: plant and building 
foundations, underground services, cable 
draw pits, site roads, and gas pipeline 
trenches.  During construction of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections, best practice working 
methods will be utilised at all watercourse 
crossings to ensure that there are no adverse 
impacts on flow or drainage and that no 
contamination is allowed to enter 
waterbodies within the vicinity of the Project 
Site. These measures are secured through 
delivery of the CEMP which will be 
Requirement 10 of the DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1); an outline CEMP is provided 
with the ES (Appendix 3.2 of Document 
Reference 6.2) and submitted with the DCO 
Application. 
The CEMP will also include best practice 
working methods to prevent pollution to the 
ground and ground water. 
Transportation requirements 
The transportation requirements of the 
Project will have no conceivable effects on 
the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites. 
No ‘affected roads’ have been identified in 
accordance with criteria in the Department 
for Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and 
Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 Section 3, Part 
1: Air Quality’, as a result of the Project.  An 
‘affected road’ is defined as a road where: 
Road alignment will change by 5 m 
or more; or 
Daily traffic flows will change by 
1,000 or more; or 
Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) flows will 
change by 200 AADT or more; or 
Daily average speed will change by 
10 km/hr or more; or 
HRA No Significant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
Peak hour speed will change by 20 
km/hr or more. 
The potential for significant effects due to 
vehicle emissions has therefore been scoped 
out of the assessment; see Section 6.5 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1) for the 
Project. 
In any case, a Construction Traffic 
Management Plan (CTMP) (Requirement 11 
of the DCO, Document Reference 3.1) will be 
prepared by the Contractors prior to 
construction.  This plan will contain 
information such as timing and routing of 
traffic.  
Duration of construction, operation, 
etc. 
The total construction programme will be 
approximately 22 months, with a start date of 
2020 and an end date of 2022.  The 
operational life of the Power Generation 
Plant is expected to be 25 years.   
The decommissioning phase will be similar in 
duration to the construction phase.  The 
Generating Equipment will be 
decommissioned and removed at the end of 
its operational life.  Certain elements of the 
Project e.g. the Gas Pipeline, will be left in 
situ. 
Other  
None 
Description of avoidance and/ or mitigation measures 
Nature of proposals 
No effects have been identified on the 
Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper 
Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar 
Sites as a result of the Project, so there is no 
requirement for specific avoidance or 
mitigation measures.  
In any event, a CEMP (Requirement 10 of 
the DCO, Document Reference 3.1) will be 
produced by the Contractor prior to the start 
of construction to ensure that best practice 
working methods are implemented to avoid 
potential pollution events in the local 
environment. An outline CEMP will be 
provided with the ES (Appendix 3.2 of 
Document Reference 6.2) and submitted with 
the DCO Application.

Assessment Criteria 
Individual elements of the project (either alone or in combination with other plans or 
projects) likely to give rise to effects on the European Site: 
The Project comprises a new Power Generating Plant and associated Gas and 
Electrical Connections.  The Project involves the potential generation of dust during 
construction, emissions to air during operation, construction site noise, operational 
noise, and the potential for incidental pollution/ siltation of surface and ground water.  
The following other projects are located within the vicinity of the Project Site: 
Covanta RRF Project - immediately adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site; 
integrated Waste Management Operations at Rookery South - immediately adjacent 
to the Generating Equipment Site; 
land at Moreteyne Farm at Wood End in Marston Moretaine proposed for residential 
properties – 2km west of the Project Site; 
land at Warrant Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill proposed for residential properties 
– 3.5km south of Gas Connection AGI; 
land East and West of Broadmead Road, Stewartby proposed for residential 
properties (under construction) – 500m north of closest point of the Access Road; 
new settlement at Wixams (under construction) – 5km north-east of closest point of 
Access Road; 
land off Marston Road, Lidlington – proposed residential development of 31 
dwellings - approximately 2km west of Electrical Connection; 
land opposite The Lane & Lombard Street, East of Marston Road, Lidlington – 
proposed residential development of 40 dwellings approximately 2km west of 
Electrical Connection; 
lower Shelton Road, Marston Moretaine - proposed residential development of 15 
dwellings approximately 4km north of Access Road; 
land to the rear of Cowlgrove Parade, Steppingley Road, Flitwick – Multi-storey car 
park to provide 232 parking spaces – approximately 4km south of Gas Connection; 
land East of Ampthill Road and North of Bedford Road, Houghton Conquest - 
proposed mixed use development including 650 dwellings approximately 4km north-
east of Generating Facility; 
land off Chapel End Road, Houghton Conquest – proposed residential development 
of 125 dwellings approximately 4km north-east of Generating Facility; and  
HRA No Significant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
land South of Fields Road and East of Cranfield Road, Wootton – proposed 
residential development of 600 dwellings – approximately 5k north of Access Road. 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites (approximately 27 km and 28 km 
respectively), and given the lack of effect pathways via the water environment; these 
elements of the Project (either alone or in combination with the other projects listed above) 
are not likely to give rise to effects on the European Sites. 
Likely changes to the European Sites arising as a result of: 
Reduction in habitat area 
None – due to the distance away from the 
Project Site, there will be no direct impacts 
on habitats in the Chilterns Beechwoods 
SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits 
SPA and Ramsar Sites.  No indirect impacts 
on habitats within the European Sites (such 
as through effects on water or air quality) 
have been identified. No changes to the 
European Sites as a result of reduction in 
habitat area are therefore expected. 
Disturbance to key species 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away 
from the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites (which are located 
approximately 27 km and 28 km away, 
respectively), no disturbance to key species 
as a result of noise and vibration is expected. 
In any case, all construction activities will be 
undertaken in accordance with Requirements 
attached to the DCO (Document Reference 
3.1) and the recommendations of BS 5228 
‘Noise and Vibration Control on Construction 
and Open Sites’. These measures are 
secured through delivery of the CEMP 
(Requirement 10 of the DCO, Document 
Reference 3.1); an outline CEMP will be 
provided with the ES (Appendix 3.2 of 
Document Reference 6.2) and submitted with 
the DCO Application. 
Habitats or species fragmentation 
None – the Project will not fragment (either 
directly or indirectly) any habitat features, 
which connect the European Sites with the 
wider environment. 
Reduction in species density 
None – the Project will not alter (either 
directly or indirectly) the availability of 
resources within the Chilterns Beechwoods 
SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits 
SPA and Ramsar Site.  Due to the distance 
HRA No Significant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
19 
away from the Project Site, no disturbance 
effects have been identified. 
Changes in key indicators of 
conservation value (water quality etc.) 
None – there are therefore no conceivable 
effect pathways via the water environment as 
a result of the Project.  The potential for 
significant effects associated with air quality 
in the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, or the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites has been scoped out of the 
assessment.  Due to the distance away from 
the Project Site, there will be no direct 
impacts on habitats in the SAC, SPA or 
Ramsar Site, and no effects in relation to 
habitat condition. 
Climate change 
None – no changes to the Chilterns 
Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites in relation 
to climate change have been identified.  The 
Project will not fragment any habitat features, 
which connect the European Sites with the 
wider environment; and will not result in any 
changes in local hydrology or air quality. 
Likely impacts on the European Site as a whole in terms of: 
Interference with the key relationships 
that define the structure of the site 
None. 
The Project will not fragment any habitat 
features, which connect the European Sites 
with the wider environment; will not result in 
any changes in local hydrology or air quality. 
Interference with the key relationships 
that define the function of the site 
None. 
The Project will not fragment any habitat 
features, which connect the European Sites 
with the wider environment; and will not 
result in any changes in local hydrology or air 
quality. 
Significance of the effects set out above:

Not significant (no effects identified) 
Disturbance to key species

Describe from the above those elements of the project, or combination of elements, 
where the above effects are likely to be significant or where the scale or magnitude 
of effects is not known. 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, and the 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites (approximately 27 km and 28 km 
respectively), and given the lack of conceivable effect pathways via the water environment; 
there are no elements of the Project, or combination of elements, which are likely to result in 
effects on the European Sites. 
Outcome of screening stage 
Not likely to be significant effects. 
Are the appropriate statutory environmental 
bodies in agreement with this conclusion 
Yes (see correspondence in Appendix B).

Outcome 
4.1.1 There will be no loss or fragmentation of habitat within or associated with the 
Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites Site, or deterioration in habitat quality as a result of the Project. 
There will be no disturbance to habitats or species for which the Chilterns 
Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Sites 
is designated, and no reduction in species density is anticipated.   
4.1.2 Neither the construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project will 
interfere with any of the key relationships that define the structure or function of 
the Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
Ramsar Sites, as none of the habitats or species will be directly or indirectly 
affected.  
4.1.3 Based on the results of the screening exercise the Project will not result in any 
likely significant effects on Chilterns Beechwoods SAC, Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits SPA, or Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Ramsar Site, and no 
scientific doubt remains.   
4.1.4 There are no likely significant effects on the European sites, either alone or in 
combination with other plans or projects and no scientific doubt remains.  On 
this basis no further assessment in the form of an Appropriate Assessment 
(Stage 2) is necessary (in accordance with PINS Advice Note 10).   
4.1.5 Consultation was undertaken with Natural England as part of the Phase 1 
statutory consultation (2014) and agreement reached with the findings of this 
assessment, that no likely significant effects on any European Sites are 
anticipated as a result of the Project.  Natural England were consulted again as 
part of the Phase 2 statutory consultation (2017) and confirmed that they are 
still in agreement (see Appendix B Correspondence with Natural England).

Evidence supporting conclusions 
a. Please see Chapter 3 of this No Significant Effects Report.  There will be no land-take, no resource requirements and no 
excavation works within the boundary of the designated site.  Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the SAC, no 
impacts on air quality are anticipated, in accordance with statutory guidelines.  There are no water bodies which connect the 
Project Site with the SAC, and there are therefore no conceivable effect pathways via the water environment as a result of the 
Project.  The Project will not fragment any habitat features, which connect the SAC with the wider environment.

Evidence supporting conclusions 
a. Please see Chapter 3 of this No Significant Effects Report.  There will be no land-take, no resource requirements and no 
excavation works within the boundary of the designated site.  Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the SPA, no 
impacts on air quality are anticipated (in accordance with statutory guidelines); and there are no anticipated disturbance effects 
due to noise.  There are no water bodies which connect the Project Site with the SPA, and there are therefore no conceivable 
effect pathways via the water environment as a result of the Project.  The Project will not fragment any habitat features, which 
connect the SPA with the wider environment.

Ross, 
 
We are aiming to submit our DCO application in early March and would very much appreciate any comments on the 
attached No Significant Effects Report. I believe Elaine Richmond, our ecologist at PBA, has been in close contact 
with NE throughout the process of preparing our documents so I don’t think there will be anything new here. 
 
I very much look forward to hearing from you shortly,

Dear Mr Scanlon 
 
Section 42 Planning Act 2008 consultation: Proposed gas fired power plant 
Location: Rookery South Pit, Nr.Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Thank you for your consultation which was received by Natural England on 22 May 2017. 
 
Natural England is a non-departmental public body. Our statutory purpose is to ensure that the 
natural environment is conserved, enhanced, and managed for the benefit of present and future 
generations, thereby contributing to sustainable development.  
 
 
Natural England advises that air quality impacts from the proposal will not impact upon 
King’s Wood and Glebe Meadows Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or Coopers Hill 
SSSI. However, further information is required regarding protected species and soil and land 
quality. 
 
 
We understand that you are consulting us in line with paragraph 67 of the Planning Act 2008 
“Guidance on pre-application consultation”, and that further consultation may be required in line with 
paragraph 85, particularly if/when the draft Environmental Statement has been prepared. We also 
appreciate that this consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 also encompasses 
consultation on the preliminary environmental information, and that some overlap exists between 
these various requirements. Natural England welcomes both formal and informal pre application 
consultation and refers you to Annex C to the NID advice note 11. 
 
We provided advice on 18 July 2014 (our ref: 124328) to the Secretary of State on the scope of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) where we advised we were broadly happy with the 
approach outlined for the EIA. We also provided advice on an earlier version of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (hereafter the ‘PEIR’) on 29 October 2014 (our ref: 133972, your 
ref: PGW/MPL). We now acknowledge receipt of the Section 48 Notice of proposed application for a 
Development Consent Order that you have provided. We have examined the PEIR (by Peter Brett 
Associates, Project Ref: 40335 Rev: 1.0, dated May 2017) and we provide further information in 
Annex A. 
 
We would be happy to comment further through our Discretionary Advice Service should the need 
arise but if in the meantime you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us. For any 
queries relating to the specific advice in this letter only please contact me on 0208 225 7685. For 
any new consultations, or to provide further information on this consultation please send your 
correspondences to consultations@naturalengland.org.uk. 
 
We really value your feedback to help us improve the service we offer. We have attached a 
Page 2 of 4 
 
feedback form to this letter and welcome any comments you might have about our service.  
 
Yours sincerely

Annex A – Additional information 
 
Designated Sites  
Air Quality 
In our advice of 29 October 2014 we advised that modelled process contributions for nearby SSSIs 
were required to determine whether there would be adverse impacts. The PEIR now provide values 
for the process contributions (PCs) at ecological receptors, including the two nearby SSSIs. The 
proposed power plant will result in the emission of oxides of nitrogen and we are aware that a 
Resource Recovery Facility (the Covanta waste incineration plant) is proposed nearby. We 
acknowledge at para 4.10.8 of the PEIR that a ‘worst case’ scenario assessment of the potential 
impacts from air quality has been undertaken. Note that we have not checked the validity of the 
Covanta air quality data, only the cumulative modelling that you have undertaken. We note that your 
assessment has used Air Pollution Information System http://www.apis.ac.uk/ to determine existing 
nitrogen and acid deposition rates within the study area, and that the air quality assessment has 
used an appropriate ADMS 5 model (described in para 6.5.20 of the PEIR). 
 
Volume D of the PEIR considers the potential impacts on King’s Wood and Glebe Meadows SSSI 
and Coopers Hill SSSI as ecological receptors and uses air quality modelling to assess the impact 
of the proposal on the three habitat features of the two SSSIs. See our advice below on potential 
impacts to European Sites. Natural England is satisfied that there would not be any adverse effects 
to SSSIs through the construction or decommissioning stages: the main potential for impact to 
SSSIs would be through changes in air quality during operation of the power plant. In considering 
the operation of the power plant we note the results in Table A6 of pollutant concentrations and in 
Table A8 of nitrogen deposition and we conclude that the proposal will not impact upon King’s 
Wood and Glebe Meadows SSSI or Coopers Hill SSSI. Our reasoning is because screening has 
indicated that the process contribution (PC) for all pollutants at all sites will be <1% of the relevant 
critical level or load for the most sensitive habitat at each site. 
 
European Sites 
We note that the Habitat Regulations Assessment: No Significant Effects Report (by Peter Brett 
Associates, Project Ref: 31116/001 Rev: AA, Dated March 2015) has been produced to record a 
Habitats Regulations assessment. We confirm our previous advice (email from Ross Holdgate on 2 
March 2015) that there would be no likely significant effects to Chiltern Beechwoods Special Area of 
Conservation, Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area and Ramsar Site, either alone 
or in combination with other plans or projects. 
 
 
Protected Species  
We note that Volume F Ecology contains the Herpetofauna Report dated 2 December 2014 and we 
understand that great crested newt (GCN) exclusion fence (that was part of the licence 2014-1762-
EPS-MIT-1) as part of previous translocation work will remain on site until April 2018. We also 
understand from Hayley Scoffham (email dated 13 June 2017) that “no material changes in the 
nature and extent of the habitats were identified during the survey, and no further survey 
requirements were identified to inform the DCO application.”  We are concerned that if this fence 
is taken down before the DCO works commence then there is likelihood that GCNs may 
access the site. We require further information as to why it is considered that no further 
surveys for GCNs are required. This echoes the guidance provided by the Secretary of State in 
the Scoping Opinion of the Proposed Millbrook Power Project (July 2014) at para 3.47 that 
“ecological surveys should be thorough, up to date and take account of other developments 
proposed in the vicinity.” 
 
We also note the presence of other protected species including bats and badgers within the 
proposal area. Should the development involve a requirement for any protected species licences to 
be issued by Natural England it is important that the details are agreed with us at an early stage, to 
ensure that Letters of No Impediment can be issued with submission.

Soils and Agricultural Land  
Detailed information on Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) Grade is not supplied in the PEIR. 
Further, we note at para 5.7.7 of the Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report (dated 
June 2014, Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 10) that the vicinity of Rookery South Pit is located 
within agricultural fields classified as ALC Grade 3. In our previous advice of 29 October 2014 we 
recommended that “that the area of agricultural land to be affected by the works is quantified”. We 
understand from an email of 27 June 2017 from Hayley Scoffham of Peter Brett Associates that the 
following land areas are involved: 
 
 
The Gas Connection is 6.25ha; 
 
The Electrical Connection is 19.07ha; 
 
We acknowledge that a certain area within the Gas Connection comprises the pipeline itself, and 
likewise within the Electrical Connection the cable itself, and that such areas will be re-instated after 
installation. Further we understand that the laydown area (~4ha) and the substation (~3ha) are sited 
in brownfield land (the base of the former clay pit). However, in order to assess the significance of 
the impact of the Gas and Electrical Connections, Natural England recommends it is necessary 
to undertake an agricultural land quality and soil resources survey of the site – particularly 
any areas of land  that will not be re-instated or are likely to suffer permanent loss. This would 
identify whether best and most versatile land is affected and if so to what extent. The survey should 
also inform the methodology for soil handling during the works. To safeguard soil resources as part 
of the overall sustainability of the development, it is important that the soil is able to retain as many 
of its many important functions and services (ecosystem services) as possible through careful soil 
management.
