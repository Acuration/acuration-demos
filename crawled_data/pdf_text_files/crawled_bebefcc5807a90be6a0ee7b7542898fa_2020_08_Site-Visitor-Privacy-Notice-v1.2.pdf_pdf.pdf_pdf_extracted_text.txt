Site Visitor Privacy Notice 
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT? 
This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) is intended to provide information regarding how any personal 
information we collect from you before, during and after you’re a visitor to one of our sites will be 
processed within the Drax Group of companies.  It relates to personal data (defined under data 
protection law) about you that we refer to as personal information in this Notice.     
 
WHO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION? 
 
Drax Group companies, including Drax Corporate Limited, Drax Power Limited, Drax Generation 
Enterprise Limited, SMW Limited, Haven Power Limited and Opus Energy Limited (“Company”, “we”, 
“us”, or “our”), are the data controllers of personal information provided by you or collected about 
you. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about 
you and that we are required to notify you of the information contained in this Notice. It is important 
that you read this Notice so that you are aware of how and why we are using your personal 
information and how we will treat it. 
 
We may update this Notice at any time, so you are advised to review this Notice at regular intervals. 
  
It is important that you read this Notice, together with any other privacy notice we may provide on 
specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you, so that you 
are aware of how and why we are using such information.  In particular, you should read our CCTV 
Privacy Notices and our Tours Privacy Notices (if relevant to you) that are available on our websites. 
 
Please read this Notice as if it’s from the Company whose site you are visiting.  However, your personal 
information may also be shared within our group of companies (our “group companies”) and so, in 
this Notice, references to ‘we’ or ‘us’ mean the Company and our group companies. 
 
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.  Our Group Data 
Protection Officer is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this Notice.  If you have any 
questions about this Notice, please use the contact details set out at the end of this Notice in the 
“Contacting Us” section. 
 
LEGAL BASIS AND PURPOSE FOR PROCESSING  
 
We will collect various types of personal information from you. Further details of how we use 
your personal information are set out below.  
 
In the section below, we have indicated with asterisks whether we need to process your 
personal information:  
 
• 
* to pursue our legitimate interests, provided that your interests and fundamental 
rights do not override those interests 
• 
** to enable us to comply with our legal obligations 
 
 
 
 
There may also be occasions where we need to process your personal information because it 
is in your vital interests, for example, if you become ill during your visit to one of our sites and 
we need to call for medical assistance. 
 
HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION  
 
When you arrange in advance to, or arrive at, one of our sites, we will need to collect the following 
information about you and*/**:  
 
• 
First and last name 
• 
Business name 
• 
Vehicle registration number (if applicable) 
• 
Arrival and departure times 
 
This information will be used for the following purposes: 
 
• 
In case there is an emergency on site 
• 
To ensure site security is maintained 
• 
To ensure appropriate and safe use of our car parks 
 
Depending on your reasons for visiting our site, we may take photographs of you and if that is the 
case, we will make you aware that images are being recorded and for what purpose.  If you do not 
want to have your image recorded (e.g. photo or video), then if it is not a security requirement, we 
will respect your wishes and not record you, or obfuscate your image from the record.  
 
CHANGE OF PURPOSE  
 
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless 
we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is 
compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an 
unrelated purpose, we will usually notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows 
us to do so.  
 
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION  
 
We are unlikely to share your personal information with anyone outside of the Company but 
if we do, we require all service providers (e.g. security or occupational health) and our Group 
companies that we share your personal information with to respect the privacy and security 
of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our 
third-party service providers, including Group companies, to use your personal information 
for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for 
specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.  
 
A service provider or their sub-processor may be based in the United Kingdom (UK) or 
European Union (EU) and so, they are required to comply with UK or European data 
protection law. On occasion, we may appoint a third-party service provider whose operation 
or a server or sub-processor may be based outside of the UK or EU. As part of our Third-Party 
Onboarding Privacy Policy, we carry out due diligence on our third-party providers and assess 
whether your personal information will be transferred to them or accessed by them from 
 
 
 
 
outside the UK or EU. If that is the case, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded 
to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place.  
 
STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
 
We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the relevant 
purpose(s) we collected it for, as set out above in this Notice, and for as long as we are 
required to keep it for legal purposes.  
 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the 
amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from 
unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we 
process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other 
means, and the applicable legal requirements.  
 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information 
from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.  
 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, 
contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know that information. They 
will only process your personal information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty 
of confidentiality.  
 
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and 
will notify you and any applicable regulator where appropriate.  
 
YOUR RIGHTS  
 
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights where we are processing your 
personal information (but not in respect of information about a corporation) to:  
 
• 
request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject 
access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we 
hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;  
• 
request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables 
you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;  
• 
request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to 
process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal 
information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);  
• 
request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to 
ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if 
you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and  
• 
request a copy of your personal information which you have provided to us, in a 
structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transfer it, 
or to require us to transfer it directly, to another controller.  
 
 
 
 
 
You also have the “right to object” to the processing of your personal information where we 
are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about 
your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You 
also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct 
marketing purposes.  
 
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the 
other rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is 
clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in 
such circumstances.  
 
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and 
ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to 
any person who has no right to receive it.  
 
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office 
(ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues. The ICO can be contacted by 
telephone on 0303 123 1113 or by post as follows: Information Commissioners Office, 
Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF or via email at 
casework@ico.org.uk. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns 
before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in the first instance using any of the details 
set out below in the “Contacting Us” section.
