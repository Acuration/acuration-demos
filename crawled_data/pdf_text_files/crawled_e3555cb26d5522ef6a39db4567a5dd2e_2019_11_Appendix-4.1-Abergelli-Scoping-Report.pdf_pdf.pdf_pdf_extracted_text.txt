Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping 
Report for the Abergelli Power Project (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project’) 
which sets out the proposed scope and content of the EIA to support the 
Development Consent Order (DCO) Application and the method by which it 
is intended to be carried out. The report has been prepared by Orbis Energy 
Limited on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited (APL). 
1.1.2 
The Project as shown on Figure 1 would comprise:  
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by 
natural gas and capable of providing an electrical capacity of up to 
299 Megawatts (MW) comprising:  
 
The 
Generating 
Equipment 
including 
the 
Gas 
Turbine 
Generators and Balance of Plant which are located on the 
Generating Equipment Site;  
 
A new purpose built Access Road either from the Rhyd-y-pandy 
Road to the north (Access Road – Option 1) or the B4489 to the 
west (Access Road – Option 2) to the Generating Equipment 
Site; and  
 
During construction a temporary construction compound (the 
Laydown Area).   
 
A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from either the National Transmission System (NTS) or 
the Local Transmission System (LTS), which is located within the 
Gas Opportunity Area; and 
 
A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) for distribution to homes and businesses which is located 
within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area. 
1.1.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.   
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are 
all integral to the generation of electricity and together are referred to as the 
‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  
1.1.5 
The Project would be situated on farmland located north of Swansea in the 
City and County of Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 2 
 
 
m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The approximate 
centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference is 265284, 201431. 
1.1.6 
The Project is described in more detail in Section 3, including the options 
currently under consideration for the Access Road, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection.   
1.2 
Need for and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
There is considerable national need for this type of development, 
acknowledged at all levels of Government policy. National planning policy 
supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the current ageing 
and inevitable closure of older coal fired power plants and the likely increase 
in demand for electricity over the coming decades.  
1.2.2 
The overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1)1 states 
that ‘gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – 
providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon 
generation and to maintain security of supply’ (paragraph 3.6.2).  
1.2.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project provide back-up 
to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which 
is an increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired 
power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity 
power generation.   
1.2.4 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to the 
nature of the electricity generation mix on the NETS. There is therefore a 
clear and significant requirement for further capacity to meet the projected 
need for reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated gas fired peaking plant 
such as the Project could allow for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to 
the NETS, thus playing a role in meeting the energy requirements of the UK 
going forward.   
1.3 
The Applicant 
1.3.1 
The Project Applicant is Abergelli Power Limited (APL). APL is an energy 
development company established for the Project by Watt Power Limited 
(WPL).  
1.3.2 
WPL has been established to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to 
support the UK Government drive to a low carbon economy. Stag Energy 
provides the resources through a management services agreement with 
WPL. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth 
of experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW 
of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of 
which 2,500 MW was delivered in the UK.

WPL currently has two other 299 MW projects being brought forward through 
the planning process. They are Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk) and Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South 
Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk). Both projects are now in the pre-
examination phase following acceptance of the DCO Applications by the 
Planning Inspectorate. 
1.3.4 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to the Gateway Storage Company 
Ltd, which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage facility in the 
East Irish Sea. The project has been consented by the UK Government, the 
Marine Management Organisation and the local planning authority (Barrow-
in-Furness Borough Council, Cumbria). Further information on the project is 
available at www.gatewaystorage.co.uk. 
1.3.5 
WPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. APL recognises the need to 
balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and concerns of 
energy projects and believes this can be responsibly delivered at a local 
level. The Project and supporting infrastructure will be designed and 
developed to high quality, safety and environmental standards.

1.4 
The Consenting Regime and EIA Process 
The Planning Act 2008 
1.4.1 
In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is 
considered to be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under 
the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) if its generating capacity is more than 50 
MW. As the proposed Power Generation Plant would have a generating 
capacity of at least 50 MW, and up to 299 MW, it would be classified as a 
NSIP under Section 14(1)a and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008. Under Section 
31 of the PA 2008, development consent is required for development that is 
or forms part of a NSIP and therefore a DCO Application will be made to the 
Secretary of State (SoS).   
Requirement for an EIA and Notification under Regulation 6(1)(b)  
1.4.2 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the EIA Regulations)2 and regulation 5(2)(a) of The Infrastructure 
Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 20093 
impose procedural requirements, in particular, the carrying out of EIA in 
relation to DCO Applications. All development in Schedule 1 (Schedule 1 
development) requires EIA to be carried out. Development in Schedule 2 
(Schedule 2 development) requires an EIA to be carried out if the project is 
likely to have significant effects on the environment.

1.4.3 
The Project has been identified as a Schedule 1 development and therefore 
the Applicant intends to carry out an EIA for the Project in accordance with 
the EIA Regulations.  The findings of the EIA will be summarised in an 
Environmental Statement (ES) which along with the scoping opinion will be 
submitted alongside the DCO Application.   
Consultation Strategy  
1.4.4 
A consultation strategy will be implemented in accordance with Sections 42, 
47 and 48 of PA 2008 and its associated secondary legislation which will 
allow the local community, statutory consultees and interested parties, 
including persons with an interest in any land that is affected by the DCO 
Application, to comment on and input into the planning and development 
process. All representations made during the consultation process will be 
considered carefully and APL will have regard to all relevant responses prior 
to submission of the DCO Application. The outputs generated from the 
formal statutory consultation will be summarised in a consultation report, 
submitted alongside the DCO Application.  
1.4.5 
A Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) will be agreed with the City 
and County of Swansea Council before being published. The SoCC will set 
out how APL intends to consult with the local community in accordance with 
Section 47 of the PA 2008 throughout the preparation of the DCO 
Application.   
1.4.6 
APL has already commenced some preliminary discussions with various 
departments of City and County of Swansea Council and, where relevant, 
the outcome of these consultations has informed this report.   
1.5 
Purpose of the Scoping Report 
1.5.1 
This Scoping Report represents APL’s formal notification to the SoS under 
regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations. The report sets out the proposed 
scope and content of the EIA to support the DCO Application and the 
method by which it is intended to be carried out.   
1.5.2 
On behalf of the SoS, the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) is requested to 
acknowledge the regulation 6 notification and confirm that the Project is an 
EIA development in accordance with regulation 4(2)(a) of the EIA 
Regulations. In addition, PINS is requested to provide a Scoping Opinion on 
the possible significant environmental effects of all elements of the Project, 
the proposed methodologies to assess the impacts, and the proposed 
structure of the Environmental Statement (ES) (as presented in Sections 4 
and 5 of this report). 
1.5.3 
PINS and consultees are also invited to highlight any additional issues that 
they believe should be addressed within the EIA, and to identify any sources 
of information that may be of interest to APL and the EIA team.

2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 and Policy 
Context 
2.3.1 
The Project is categorised as a NSIP and will be examined by PINS with the 
decision on the DCO Application made by the SoS under the regime 
established by the PA 2008 as described in Chapter 1.   
2.3.2 
As set out in NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy), 
‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-specific energy NPS, 
provides the primary basis for decisions’ (Paragraph 1.1.1). The decision-
maker ‘should start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to 
applications for energy NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2) and on the basis that the 
urgent national need for such projects is settled.   
2.3.3 
Decisions must also be taken by the SoS having regard to the local impact 
reports and any other matters which the SoS ‘thinks are both important and 
relevant to its decision’ (Section 104 of the PA 2008), which may include 
Planning Policy Wales, Development Plan Documents (DPDs) or other 
documents in the Local Development Framework (LDFs).  
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
PA 2008 required new policy to inform decisions on NSIPs in England and 
Wales. Policy for such infrastructure is set out in National Policy Statements 
(NPS). Those that are potentially relevant to the consideration of the DCO 
Application are:  
 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1);  
 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2) 10;   
 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines11; and   
 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure12.

development plans. The principles and objectives of TANs prescribe the 
overarching national guidance for specific individual environmental topics. 
Both the PPW and TANs are material considerations in determining planning 
applications under the Town and County Planning Act 1990 regime. It may 
be determined that these policy documents are relevant and important under 
the PA 2008 regime.   
2.5.2 
Potentially relevant TANs to the Project are: 
 
TAN 5: Nature Conservation and Planning; 
 
TAN 6: Planning for Sustainable Rural Communities; 
 
TAN 11: Noise; 
 
TAN 12: Design;

Local Planning Policy 
The City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (UDP)14 
2.6.1 
The City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (UDP) was 
adopted on 10th November 2008. It is the most up to date Development Plan 
covering the administrative area within the City and County of Swansea and 
is used in the determination of planning applications. The UDP sets out a 
range of policies and proposals relating to future development, and deals 
with the use and conservation of land and buildings within the City and 
County up to 2016.   
2.6.2 
Its purpose is to promote sustainable development, protect the environment, 
facilitate regeneration and support community planning by ensuring that 
sufficient land is available for all development needs (for housing, industry 
etc.) and that the allocations are well located in terms of environmental, 
social and economic aspirations.   
2.6.3 
The UDP has allocated the land within the Project Site for coal (R2) as well 
as sand and aggregate resource management (R4).   
Swansea Local Development Plan 
2.6.4 
The Unitary Development Plan (UDP) is to be replaced within the next few 
years by the Swansea Local Development Plan (LDP). The Preferred 
Strategy was published in July 201315 for consultation. The Local 
Development Preferred Strategy is a strategic level planning document that

Project Description 
3.1 
Project Site 
3.1.1 
The Project Site would be situated on pastoral fields north of Swansea in the 
City and County of Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 
m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The farmland is 
currently used for sheep and horse grazing as well as horse training and 
breeding. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses National 
Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station. In addition areas within the Project Site have in the past, been 
subject to a variety of permissions for mineral extraction, inert landfill and 
other commercial activities.   
3.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site would be located primarily within fields 
used for grazing bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and 
defunct hedgerows with substantial gaps in them. There is an existing farm 
road at the northern end of Access Road – Option 1. The Generating 
Equipment Site and Laydown Area are divided into two areas by a soft 
surface horse training track known as ‘the gallops’ with a block of 
broadleaved woodland to the east classified as Ancient Woodland and a Site 
of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). There are also further blocks 
of woodland to the west where Access Road – Option 2 is located. The land 
within the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m above 
Ordnance Datum (AOD) and gently slopes down towards the south. 
3.1.3 
The Gas Connection would lie within the Opportunity Area identified on 
Figure 1 and would either be located to the north, northwest or south of the 
Generating Equipment Site crossing grazing fields bound by hedgerows and 
ditches as well as a public footpath. The fields are interspersed by small 
deciduous copses, some of which are classified as Ancient Woodland and 
SINCs to the north, northeast and northwest of the Generating Equipment 
Site, as identified on Figure 3.   
3.1.4 
The Electrical Connection would lie within the Opportunity Area identified in 
Figure 1 and would be located to the southwest of the Generating Equipment 
Site passing through grass fields and the Aber-gelli-fach plantation which is 
partially designated as a SINC.   
3.1.5 
The Project Site would be accessed from Junction 46 of the M4 either from: 
the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road; or from the west via the B4489 as 
shown on Figure 2.  
Surrounding Area 
3.1.6 
The area surrounding the Project Site is rural with a substantial amount of 
utilities infrastructure in the area. A gas NTS Pipeline, and water pipelines 
cross the Project Site and there is also a network of electricity pylons which 
lead to and from National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations to the 
southwest of Abergelli Farm. Furthermore a Water Treatment Works is 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

located immediately to the northwest while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park is 
located to the east of Project Site.   
3.1.7 
The closest residential dwellings to the Project Site are:  
 
Abergelli Farm, located within the Project Site;  
 
Abergelli fawr, located within the Project Site;  
 
Cefn-betingau approximately 400 m to the west; and  
 
Maes-eglwys approximately 176 m to the southwest.   
3.1.8 
Within the Project Site there is a small landfill and the remains of Aber-gelli 
Colliery, both of which are located north of Abergelli Farm.  
3.1.9 
Other features of the area include a number of existing public footpaths, 
bridleways and tracks located in and around the Project Site, linking it to the 
wider area. In addition within the Project Site there are a number of springs 
with their associated streams and drainage ditches which discharge into the 
Afon Llan. 
3.2 
Description of the Project  
3.2.1 
The elements of the Project are described below. The description is based 
on a ‘Rochdale Envelope’ approach (i.e. a single project with a range of 
parameters). The scope of each of the technical assessments described in 
Chapter 5 has been based on the parameters provided below. Assessing a 
worst case realistic configuration from within the parameters enables an 
assessment of the ‘worst case’ likely significant environmental effects within 
each technical assessment. Each technical chapter within the PEIR and ES 
will identify which parameters represent the ‘worst case’ for that topic. It is 
acknowledged that the parameters may be refined during the design process 
for the Project and following consultation. If this occurs the modified 
parameters will be described and taken into account within the PEIR and ES 
as appropriate.   
3.3 
Power Generation Plant 
3.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be designed as a peaking plant fired by 
natural gas supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the 
Power Generation Plant to the existing NTS. It would have a capacity of up 
to 299 MW (enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes).  
3.3.2 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment would operate for up to 1,500 
hours per year. Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a 
‘stress event’. This occurs when there is a surge in demand for electricity 
associated with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the 
country boil kettles following the end of a popular television programme) or 
where there is a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which 
are constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking plants also help 
to ‘balance out’ the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy

sources, such as wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to 
their intermittent operation and reliance on weather conditions.  
3.3.3 
Given these parameters, it has been determined that a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) plant is the preferred and most appropriate technology 
choice for the Project.   
SCGT Plant 
3.3.4 
There are several alternative types of SCGT plant available to generate up 
to 299 MW. SCGT plants often use aero-derivative gas turbines (i.e. turbines 
derived from aeronautical applications), primarily because of their suitability 
for frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability 
maintenance techniques. For the aero-derivative case, APL envisages using 
three, four or five individual aero-derivative turbine generators to achieve 
299 MW.   
3.3.5 
However, ‘industrial’ type gas turbines can also be used which are typically 
larger and often more suited to longer operational hours. They offer similar 
efficiency but less fast loading flexibility. Industrial gas turbines differ from 
aeronautical designs in that the casings, rotors and blading are of heavier 
construction. For the industrial gas turbine case, it is anticipated that one or 
two individual industrial gas turbine generators will be used to achieve 299 
MW.   
3.3.6 
The main equipment in a SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising the 
following components:  
 
Inlet air filter; 
 
Air compressor; 
 
Combustion chamber; 
 
Power turbine(s); and  
 
Exhaust silencer.   
3.3.7 
Air on entering the gas turbines, would be compressed and natural gas 
injected into the air. The natural gas would then burn in the combustion 
chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would then expand 
across the blades of the gas turbine driving the electrical generators to 
produce electricity.   
3.3.8 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process would then be 
released to the atmosphere via between one and five stacks (chimneys). 
The stack(s) would contain equipment which will reduce emissions released 
to the atmosphere.   
3.3.9 
A stack height sensitivity study will be undertaken for the Project to 
determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generators, 
required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air 
quality targets. This height would apply to all technology choices, as 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

discussed above, and would not be dependent on the number of units 
present at the Generating Equipment Site.  
3.3.10 The DCO Application will therefore be flexible enough using the Rochdale 
Envelope approach to allow APL to achieve a 299 MW project by building 
between one to five Gas Turbine Generators, with up to five exhaust gas flue 
stacks. Figure 4 shows a simple schematic of SCGT operation. 
Figure 4: Schematic of SCGT Operation  
 
Laydown Area 
3.3.11 A temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site 
as shown in Figure 1. It is not proposed that land would be required for a 
permanent maintenance/laydown area during operation.  
Access Road 
3.3.12 A new purpose built Access Road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site. Two options are being considered for access to the 
Generating Equipment Site from Junction 46 of the M4. Access Road - 
Option 1 is from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the existing 
access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm which would need to be 
extended to the Generating Equipment Site, as shown on Figure 1.   
3.3.13 Access Road - Option 2 is from the west via the B4489, along the access 
road to National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and then along a purpose built Access Road to be 
constructed, across undeveloped land to the Generating Equipment Site as 
shown on Figure 1.

Dimensions 
3.3.14 The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be in the order 
of 6 ha. The Generating Equipment may be sited in a number of locations 
within the wider Generating Equipment Site depending on its final design. 
The Generating Equipment Site may also be reduced in size during the 
design process with any changes acknowledged in the PEIR and/or ES.   
3.3.15 Table 3.1 provides indicative dimensions for the main plant items which 
would be present at the Generating Equipment Site.

Construction, Operational and Decommissioning Timescales 
3.3.16 Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months. The main works associated with the construction phase would be 
the removal of hardstanding, excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations, potential piling (if required) and the laying of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections.  
3.3.17 The Power Generation Plant would be designed to have an operational life 
of 25 years, after which time it would be decommissioned or re-powered 
depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy mix at the time. 
For the purposes of the EIA, it would be assumed that the Power Generation 
Plant would be decommissioned.   
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 15 
 
 
3.3.18 Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation Plant 
items and restoration of the Project Site to a similar condition compared to 
before the construction of the Project. This process would also take 
approximately 22 months. It is likely that some underground structures, 
including the Gas and Electrical Connections (if an underground Electrical 
Connection is implemented) may be capped and left in situ to avoid any 
adverse environmental impacts associated with their removal. Due regard 
would be paid to all best practice guidelines and legislation on 
decommissioning of projects which are relevant at the time of the 
decommissioning activities. Where possible, items of plant would be 
recycled or reused.   
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CCS) 
3.3.19 At up to 299MW, the Project would be below the threshold set out in 
Directive 2009/31/EC24 and National Policy Statement EN-1 and EN-2 for 
when operators of combustion plants are required to have assessed the 
feasibility of: a storage site, transport facilities and economic considerations 
of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a result of the 
combustion process. Therefore it is not considered necessary to assess the 
viability of CO2 capture or include it further in this report.   
3.4 
Gas Connection  
3.4.1 
The Gas Connection would be in the form of a new underground gas 
pipeline connection (the Pipeline) and above ground installation (AGI) and is 
required to connect the Generating Equipment to the existing high pressure 
NTS or the LTS HP Pipeline in order to provide a reliable supply of fuel.   
Gas Connection Opportunity Area  
3.4.2 
A Gas Connection Feasibility Study was undertaken in March 2014 to define 
and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating Equipment 
to a suitable source of fuel gas. This identified Feeder 28 of the NTS or a 
nearby LTS HP Pipeline as possible connection points. The location of these 
in relation to the Project Site is shown on Figure 1.   
3.4.3 
At present, investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the 
NTS or LTS HP Pipelines are still ongoing. It is anticipated that the Gas 
Connection would be situated within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area 
which extends north and south from the Generating Equipment Site as 
shown on Figure 1. The Gas Connection Opportunity Area comprises large 
pastoral fields bounded by hedgerows and ditches which slope down 
towards the south and are interspersed by areas of woodland (some of 
which are classified as Ancient Woodland and SINCs) and areas of wet 
grassland (some of which are designated as SINCs) as shown on Figure 3. 
There are also a group of springs to the north of Aber-gelli fawr which feed

into Afon Llan close to the LTS HP Pipeline. The feeder for the NTS which 
feeds into and out of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station crosses through 
the Project Site between the Gas Compressor Station and Abergelli Farm.   
3.4.4 
Specific connection options will be explored and further refined to a single 
Gas Connection Route prior to submission of the DCO Application. Due 
regard will be paid to relevant factors including environmental, planning, 
safety, engineering and constructability. Further details of the options being 
considered will be provided to consultees when they are available and the 
selected option will be assessed in the PEIR and ES that will be submitted in 
support of the DCO Application.   
Connection to the NTS or LTS HP Pipeline 
3.4.5 
Connection of the Pipeline to the NTS or LTS HP Pipeline would require two 
Above Ground Installations (AGIs) to be installed which will include: a 
Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC) facility, which would be owned by 
National Grid Company (NGC); and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) which will be 
owned by APL. 
3.4.6 
The MOC (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain: 
 
Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.7 
The PTF (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain:  
 
PIG launching facility; 
 
Emergency control valve (possible); 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and  
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.8 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at a PTF on the Generating 
Equipment Site. A further facility known as the Gas Receiving Facility (GRF) 
would be situated downstream of the PTF within the Generating Equipment 
Site. The PTF would contain the following equipment:  
 
PIG receiving facility;  
 
Emergency control valve (possible); and  
 
Isolation valves.  
3.4.9 
The GRF would contain the following equipment:  
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

Page No: 17 
 
 
 
Metering, heating, filtering, compression and pressure regulation 
equipment; 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Electricity supply kiosk; and  
 
Control and instrumentation kiosks. 
3.4.10 The PTF and GRF would be sited close to each other and if possible they 
will be joined on a single plot.   
3.5 
Electrical Connection  
3.5.1 
The Electrical Connection will comprise all the necessary elements to enable 
power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS such as 
new electrical circuits (either in the form of an underground cable or 
overhead line). 
3.5.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Project Site in March 
2014 in order to define and evaluate the options available for connecting the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS. The most suitable point of connection is 
currently anticipated to be a cable terminal chamber on the Gas Insulated 
Switchgear (GIS) circuit at the point where the underground cable or 
overhead line emerges to facilitate its connection into the NETS.   
3.5.3 
If the connection is via an underground export cable then a Sealing End 
Compound (SEC) would be required. It is possible that the SEC would be 
required off site from the Generating Equipment Site depending on the 
configuration of the Electrical Connection.

Specific route corridor options for the Electrical Connection have not been 
identified at present, with options being investigated within an area referred 
to as the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area to the southwest of the 
Generating Equipment Site as shown on Figure 1.   
3.5.5 
The area comprises gently sloping pastoral land grazed by sheep and 
horses with areas of wet grassland to the east and scrub and deciduous 
woodland to the west. Some of these areas are designated as SINCs with 
areas of the woodland also classified as Ancient Woodland, as shown on 
Figure 3. The field boundaries are delineated by fences with defunct 
hedgerows and drainage ditches. The nearest residential properties to the 
Electrical Connection Opportunity Area are Lletty Morfil, Abergelli Farm and 
Maes-eglwys. There is one public right of way within the area which follows 
the boundary of the Felindre Gas Compression Station.   
3.5.6 
Two existing National Grid double circuit 400kV overhead lines are located 
on an approximate southwest-northeast alignment through the Project Site.   
3.5.7 
Specific connection options will be explored and further refined to a single 
Electrical Connection route prior to submission of the DCO Application. Due

regard will be paid to relevant factors including environmental, planning and 
feasibility. Further details of the options being considered will be provided to 
consultees when they are available and the selected option will be assessed 
in the PEIR and ES that will be submitted in support of the DCO Application.   
3.6 
Project Site Selection/Design Evolution 
3.6.1 
The choice of site for the Power Generation Plant has been carefully 
considered with various sites and a number of relevant factors looked at 
during this process in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of the NPS EN-1 and 
NPS EN-2. Key factors included in the selection of the Power Generation 
Plant Site are:  
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Electrical Connection point; 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Gas Connection point; 
 
It is in a developed setting dominated by the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and National Grid’s two 400kV electrical 
substations ; and 
 
It has a well-developed road network and access to the Project Site.  
3.6.2 
The final choice of the Gas and Electrical Connection routes would be 
selected following further consultation and a more thorough assessment of 
constraints and environmental impacts. 
3.6.3 
In terms of design evolution of the Project, the following technology options 
were originally considered for the 299 MW Power Generation Plant: SCGT 
plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; and Reciprocating Gas 
Engines (RGE) plant.   
3.6.4 
SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant at the Project Site based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations:  
 
Visual impact: SCGT plant require shorter stack(s) compared to 
CCGT plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the 
surrounding environment; 
 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is 
significantly lower than for a CCGT plant; 
 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant would 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE 
units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate 
up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
 
Financial: based on the current electricity market, it is essential that 
the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly 
cost effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance 
out the National Grid and meet changing demands of customers. 
SCGT plants are better suited to this type of operational regime; and  
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 19 
 
 
 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better 
suited to meeting variable demands.   
3.6.5 
The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also 
considered. However it is not technically or economically feasible with a 
SCGT peaking power station because the profile for the generation of 
electrical energy from the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the 
required heat demand profile of any potential customer.   
3.6.6 
A more detailed appraisal of the Project Site selection process and design 
evolution would be set out in the PEIR and ES.

Scope and Structure of the EIA 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This Chapter describes the proposed scope and structure for the EIA that 
will be undertaken to support the DCO Application in accordance with the 
EIA Regulations. The key output of the EIA process is ultimately the ES, 
which sets out the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The 
ES will enable PINS, consultees and the SoS to understand the anticipated 
environmental impacts and effects of the Project. 
4.1.2 
To allow for a precautionary approach, the assessments in the ES will be 
based on a realistic worst case scenario specific to each topic based on the 
Rochdale Envelope parameters as described in Chapter 3.     
4.2 
Overall ES Structure 
4.2.1 
Table 4.1 sets out the proposed structure of the ES. A number of supporting

(NRW), City and County of Swansea and PINS. 
This will draw on the Ecology chapter of the ES 
(described in Section 5.5 below). 
4.3 
Cumulative Assessment 
4.3.1 
In accordance with the EIA Regulations, the EIA will take into account other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site and will consider the 
cumulative impacts associated with these development in-conjunction with 
the Project. Developments considered within the cumulative assessment 
include those that are:  
 
In the process of being built; 
 
Permitted application(s) but not yet implemented; 
 
Submitted application(s) not yet determined; 
 
Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects; 
 
Projects identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging 
development plants – with appropriate weight being given as they 
move closer to adoption) recognising that information on the relevant 
proposals will be limited; and  
 
Projects identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) 
which set the framework for future development consents/approvals, 
where such development is reasonably likely to come forward.   
4.3.2 
At present, it is anticipated that the following developments will be 
considered as part of the cumulative assessment.   
 
Planning Application 2013/0795 – Installation of four 5 kW wind 
turbines 120.7 m to tip and associated infrastructure at Myle Coch 
Mawr;

 
Planning Application 2013/0135 – Installation of ground mounted 
array of solar panels, inverter substations and 2.4 m high fencing on 
land at Abergelli Farm.  This development would be located within the 
Gas Connection Opportunity Area on the Project Site. 
 
Planning Application 2013/1639 (Rhyd-y-pandy Solar Park) – 
Construction of 7 MW solar park consisting of installation of up to 
28,250 photovoltaic panels and up to six inverter/transformer cabins, 
a single control building and provision of security fencing.   
4.3.3 
Further to these individual planning applications, proposed development 
within the Swansea Vale Development Area will also be considered for 
assessment of any significant cumulative impacts. Swansea Vale is situated 
approximately 5 km from the Project Site and extends to some 190 ha south 
of a railway line and the M4.  
4.3.4 
In addition during the EIA other developments may be identified if more 
information becomes publicly available.   
4.3.5 
Any views on the inclusion of any particular cumulative scheme will be 
welcome as part of the Scoping Opinion.

Detailed Description of ES Impact Sections 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This chapter provides a description of the proposed EIA. It addresses each 
proposed ES technical chapter and describes the current understanding of 
the baseline conditions and assessment methodology for each discipline that 
will determine the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. 
Potential mitigation measures have also been identified where appropriate, 
although these will be set out in detail in the ES. Consultees are invited to 
comment on the methodologies within their scoping responses.  
5.1.2 
Although the sections below deal with the Project as a whole, it is anticipated 
that the ES technical chapters will be sub-divided allowing the assessment of 
effects during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases, 
description of mitigation measures and residual effects to be addressed 
separately for the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connections as well as together for the overall Project. Cumulative effects 
will be assessed for the Project as a whole.  
5.1.3 
The sections described are set out in the following list:  
 
Air Quality (5.3);  
 
Noise and Vibration (5.4);  
 
Ecology (5.5);  
 
Water Quality and Resources (5.6);  
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (5.7);  
 
Landscape and Visual (5.8);  
 
Traffic, Transport and Access (5.9);  
 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (5.10); and 
 
Socio-Economics (5.11). 
5.2 
Significance Criteria 
5.2.1 
The significance of environmental effects resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project will generally be categorised 
using a series of matrices. These will be developed to describe the 
sensitivity of receptors and resources which have the potential to be 
impacted by the Project and the magnitude of any impacts that are likely to 
arise. The sensitivity of receptors and resources and magnitude of impact 
will be cross-referenced to give an overall significance of effect for any 
potential impact. Where it is not possible to quantify impacts, qualitative 
assessments will be carried out, based on available knowledge and 
professional judgement. 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

Page No: 25 
 
 
5.2.2 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of effects 
upon different environmental components, the assessments will generally 
follow the structure and use the terminology outlined below in Tables 5.1 to 
5.3. However for some sections, significance criteria may need to differ 
depending on the assessment methodology used. Each technical chapter of 
the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria used as well as 
defining what constitutes a significant impact and/or effect. 
5.2.3 
Potential mitigation measures described in the ES will include embedded 
mitigation through design/standard control measures (which will be used to 
produce an initial assessment of impact) and any further specific mitigation 
required (which will be taken into account to produce an assessment of 
residual impacts).

Air Quality 
Introduction 
5.3.1 
The air quality assessment will consider potentially significant air quality 
impacts 
and 
effects 
caused 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project on sensitive human and ecological receptors 
in and around the vicinity of the Project Site. Potential effects could include 
those that result from dust during construction and decommissioning and 
stack emissions during operation of the Gas Turbine Generators.

Baseline 
5.3.2 
Existing ambient air quality and baseline conditions will be reviewed using 
available air quality monitoring data and the most recent local authority 
publications published in accordance with their duties under the Environment 
Act 199525. The assessment will include particular consideration of: 
designated Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs); any relevant previous 
studies undertaken in the area; the location of sensitive receptors (including 
designated ecological sites and Morriston Hospital); and other significant 
sources of emissions. 
5.3.3 
The nearest AQMA is Swansea Air Quality Management Area 2010 which is 
in the Lower Swansea Valley encompassing the areas of Hafod, Sketty and 
Fforestfach26. It is approximately 4.5 km from the Project Site and has been 
declared primarily on the basis of traffic related NO2.  
5.3.4 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station is present within the Project Site and 
occasionally flares and therefore the emissions will be considered as part of 
the baseline conditions. Further consultation will be sought with The City and 
County of Swansea Council and National Resources Wales (NRW) to 
determine a definitive list of significant emission sources to consider as part 
of the air quality assessment.  
5.3.5 
The existing air quality concentrations at sensitive ecologically designated 
sites will be obtained from DEFRA27. The existing acid and nutrient nitrogen 
deposition rates will be obtained from the UK Air Pollution Information 
System (UK APIS).28  
5.3.6

Assessment 
5.3.9 
The assessment methodology will be agreed in consultation with the 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at City and County of Swansea Council 
and NRW.   
5.3.10 The emissions of dust during the construction and decommissioning phases 
of the Project will be assessed in accordance with ‘Guidance on the 
Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air Quality and the 
Determination of their Significance’ (IAQM, 2012)29 and the Department for 
Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 
Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality’ and the associated DMRB Screening Method, 
developed by the Highways Agency30. The significance of the potential 
impacts identified will be determined based on the sensitivity of the identified 
receptors within the potential zones of influence outlined in the IAQM 
Guidance.  
5.3.11 The air quality assessment for the operational phase will follow the 
Environment Agency documents ‘Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f): 
Air Emissions’31 and the Environment Agency Air Quality Modelling and 
Assessment Unit (AQMAU) ‘Air dispersion modelling report requirements (for 
detailed air dispersion modelling)’32. The conversion of NOx to NO2, as 
applicable for the protection of human health under the UK Air Quality 
Standards Regulations 201033, will adopt the approach outlined in the 
AQMAU Guidance Note ‘Conversion Ratios for NOx and NO2’ (2006)34.  
5.3.12 As a peaking plant, the operation of the Generating Equipment will be limited 
through the permitting regime to 1500 hours per annum. The assessment 
will, therefore, be based on the operation of the Generating Equipment, at 
full load, for 1500 hours per annum.  
5.3.13 The atmospheric emissions from the operation of the Generating Equipment 
will be quantified by obtaining information from relevant plant suppliers. 
Where two or more suppliers are being considered, a realistic worst case 
scenario will be used to ensure flexibility. However, only plant that meet 
national emissions limits will be considered.  
5.3.14 The atmospheric dispersion modelling will be performed using the 
Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC) Air Dispersion 
                                                                 
29 IAQM (2012)Guidance on the Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air Quality and the

Modelling Software (ADMS 5.0). An air dispersion model will be set up that 
considers the effects of terrain and buildings (as appropriate to the location 
of the Generating Equipment), together with the most recent available 
meteorological data covering a consecutive five year period (e.g. 2009 to 
2014, inclusive) in accordance with current guidance.  
5.3.15 The modelling assessment will estimate the mass concentration of NOx and 
CO at sensitive receptors using the emission limits as specified in Part 2 of 
Annex V to the IED. Initial screening runs will be undertaken to determine an 
acceptable stack height suitable for adequate dispersion based on predicted 
maximum short term and long term ground level concentrations. Detailed 
atmospheric dispersion modelling will then be undertaken on the basis of the 
selected stack height.  
5.3.16 The results of the detailed dispersion modelling will be presented as 
isopleths, and compared with background levels and relevant standards and 
guidelines (i.e. the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010). Direct 
comparison will be made between the long-term and short-term process 
contributions from the Generating Equipment, the predicted environmental 
concentrations of relevant substances (i.e. process contribution plus 
background levels) and the limits and objectives within the relevant Air 
Quality Standards Regulations 2010. Where appropriate, the significance of 
the potential impact will be determined using the criteria set out in the 
‘Development Control: Planning for Air Quality’ (EPUK, 2010) in conjunction 
with the Environment Agency Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f).   
5.3.17 The abatement of emissions will be discussed in relation to application of 
Best Available Techniques (BAT), in accordance with the Environment 
Agency Sector Guidance Note for Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01)35 and 
the UK’s position with regards to the on-going review of the EU IPPC 
Reference Document on BAT for Large Combustion Plants36. Should 
additional mitigation prove to be necessary, the severity of impact, frequency 
of emissions and the resultant environmental risk associated with any 
residual impact will be examined.  
5.3.18 Changes in air quality levels for NOx will be assessed with respect to ecology 
for the European and nationally designated habitat sites within 10 km of the 
Project Site (including, but not necessarily limited to, those identified above). 
The non-statutory habitat sites within 2 km of the Project Site will also be 
considered. An assessment of the increased deposition of both nutrient 
nitrogen and acid due to nitrogen will also be carried out at the statutory 
(both EU and UK) designated sites in accordance with the methodologies 
described in the Environment Agency AQMAU ‘AQTAG06 Technical 
Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate assessment for 
emissions to air’37.

5.3.19 It is considered that there would not be any noticeable odours associated 
with the operation of the Generating Equipment at or beyond the boundary of 
the Generating Equipment Site and therefore it is not considered necessary 
to undertake a detailed assessment of odour.   
5.3.20 The operation of the Gas and Electrical Connections would not produce any 
significant emissions and therefore these elements of the assessment during 
operation have been scoped out.  
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.3.21 An outline Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be 
drafted and appended to the ES which will set out best practice methods of 
limiting dust on site during construction and decommissioning.   
5.3.22 During operation, the Generating Equipment would operate as a peaking 
plant, with operations limited to 1,500 hours per year. This operating limit will 
be set out in the site permit and will not be exceeded. In addition, embedded 
mitigation measures will include: incorporating stack(s) of sufficient height to 
achieve adequate dispersal of pollutants; and using flue gas cleaning 
equipment if required to ensure that all emissions are within concentrations 
permitted by legislation and guidance.   
5.3.23 The need or otherwise for further, project specific mitigation measures will be 
addressed within the ES chapter. 
5.4 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
5.4.1 
In accordance with Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1, a noise and vibration 
assessment will consider potentially significant noise and vibration impacts 
and effects caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of 
the Project on Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) in and around the vicinity 
of the Project Site 
Baseline 
5.4.2 
The Project Site would be sited within pastoral fields interspersed by scrub 
and deciduous woodland in a rural area with the National Grid’s two 400kV 
electrical substations and Felindre Gas Compressor Station in the western 
extent of the Project Site. There are currently no sources of significant noise 
or vibration within close proximity to the Project Site other than that 
associated with nearby agricultural activities, Team Force Swansea Paintball 
Centre and a skip hire business as well as the M4 motorway approximately 
1.5 km to the south.  National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station are assumed to operate within agreed 
thresholds.   
5.4.3 
The closest NSRs within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau, Llwyncelyn and Felindre. In

addition there are also isolated dwellings and farmsteads outside of the 
settlements including but not exclusive to:  


Assessment 
5.4.4 
The assessment methodology will be agreed with the EHO at the City and 
County of Swansea Council.   
5.4.5 
Construction and decommissioning noise and vibration assessments of the 
Project will be undertaken following the guidance in British Standard (BS) 
522838. The assessment will be undertaken as a desk study and shall 
involve:  
 
Identification of construction and decommissioning activities that 
produce significant noise and vibration;   
                                                                 
38 British Standards Institute (2009) BS 5228-1: Code of practice for noise and vibration control on 
construction and open sites 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 34 
 
 
 
Identification 
of 
NSRs 
within 
100 
m 
of 
construction 
and 
decommissioning activities; and 
 
Prediction of noise and vibration using the methodology contained 
within BS5228.  
5.4.6 
The exact construction and decommissioning methodologies are unlikely to 
be defined until the construction contractor is appointed, which is likely to be 
after the submission of the DCO Application. However, in the absence of this 
information, an outline construction programme will be developed based on 
knowledge and experience of other similar developments. Additionally, the 
typical make up of construction equipment at each stage of the project 
programme will be ascertained in the same way. For ground improvement 
works (e.g. piling) the noise and vibration assessment will pay due regard to 
the ground conditions at the Generating Equipment Site. Where 
uncertainties exist, realistic worst case assumptions will be used.  
5.4.7 
The quantification of impacts shall be undertaken by comparison with agreed 
project criteria or limits either from previous schemes and relevant guidance 
and standards such as BS5228, BS647239 and BS738540, or local legislative 
requirements. The desk study shall outline suitable measures for the 
mitigation of construction and decommissioning impacts, and an assessment 
of residual impacts and effects.   
5.4.8 
Operational noise will be assessed using the methodology from a 
combination of: BS414241; BS823342; and WHO Guidelines for Community 
Noise43. The likelihood of complaints about noise from industrial 
developments will be predicted using the following criteria from BS4142:  
 
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints;  
 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints are 
likely; 
 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance; and 
 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured background 
noise level then this is a positive indication that complaints are 
unlikely.  
5.4.9 
The guidance contained in BS8233 will also be used to assess the effects on 
indoor ambient noise levels in living rooms and bedrooms of NSRs when 
they are unoccupied.

5.4.10 The WHO ‘Guidelines for Community Noise’ provides health-based guidance 
on suitable noise levels intended to avoid or minimise community annoyance 
by noise. The guidance provides guideline noise levels for both indoor and 
outdoor areas.   
5.4.11 It is proposed that the study area for the noise assessment of operational 
effects shall be defined as the region within 1 km of the Project Site. All 
sensitive receptors, such as residential properties, hospitals, schools, etc. 
within the study area shall be identified in the assessment.  
5.4.12 A baseline noise survey will then be undertaken in the vicinity of the Project 
Site to establish the current baseline noise levels. The locations for the 
baseline noise survey (i.e. locations of the nearest NSRs) will be agreed in 
advance with the EHO.   
5.4.13 Following baseline noise measurements, a noise model will be produced 
using Cadna software (3-dimensional noise propagation software) which will 
model the measured baseline levels at NSRs, together with sound power 
levels of proposed plant (obtained from relevant suppliers). Where sound 
power levels for proposed plant are not available, suitable data will be 
substituted, although a realistic worst case scenario would always be 
considered. The noise model will highlight the main noise sources and the 
associated noise levels at the NSR locations. Contour plots will also be 
produced clearly showing noise levels at the Project Site, NSRs and 
surrounding areas.   
5.4.14 If the model shows that there is potential for a significant effect to be 
generated by noise from any of the NSRs, the level of required noise 
mitigation would be specified, and measures that could be used to achieve 
this level of mitigation will be incorporated into the model, to provide a ‘with 
mitigation’ scenario.  
5.4.15 The ES section will be compiled using the Institute of Acoustics (IoA) / 
Institute for Environmental Management (IEMA) draft document ‘Guidelines 
for Noise Impact Assessment’44.  
5.4.16 The operation of the Gas Connection is not anticipated to cause any 
significant increase in background noise or vibration and therefore this 
element has been scoped out of the assessment.   
5.4.17 Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has been scoped out as 
there would be no significant effects associated with the potential for a low 
level electrical hum emanating from an overhead line option, if one is 
required. In addition if a SEC is required, any low level electrical hum 
associated with the infrastructure will not be perceptible at the NSRs and 
therefore this has also been scoped out of the assessment.

Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.4.18 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting noise and vibration on site during 
construction and decommissioning.   
5.4.19 During operation, mitigation measures could include the use of silencers on 
the loudest plant items within the Generating Equipment.   
5.5 
Ecology 
Introduction 
5.5.1 
An ecology assessment will consider potentially significant impacts and 
effects caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project on ecological resources and receptors in and around the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
Baseline  
5.5.2 
The Project Site is predominantly on pastoral farmland, mostly agriculturally 
improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland and interspersed by 
woodland and scrub. Some of the marshy grassland qualifies as a Section 
42 habitat ‘purple moor-grass and rush pastures’ (under the Natural 
Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC)45) and is designated 
as SINCs. Furthermore areas of the woodland qualify as Section 42 habitat 
‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, some of which is also classified as 
Ancient Woodland and SINCs. The Ancient Woodland and SINCs are shown 
on Figure 3.  
5.5.3 
The fields are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by 
fences running along the line of defunct hedgerows with large gaps. There 
are numerous watercourses on site, mostly in the form of ditches or streams 
along field boundaries. There is a potential for bats, great crested newts, 
dormice, otters, water voles, reptiles, badger, woodland and farmland bird 
species and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to be located within these 
habitats. Full details of the habitats located within the Project Site and the 
potential for protected species and species of conservation importance are 
provided in Appendix A.   
5.5.4 
A desk based assessment (DBA) and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey was 
undertaken at the Project Site during Spring 2014 (see Appendix A). The 
purpose of the assessment and survey were to:  
 
Identify the main habitats present at the Project Site; 
 
Identify the sensitive ecological receptors (e.g. statutory designated 
sites) in the vicinity of the Project Site;

 
Assess the potential of the Project Site to support protected species; 
and  
 
Provide recommendations for further assessment works (e.g. Phase 
2 Protected Species Surveys).   
5.5.5 
The following European Sites are within 10 km of the Project Site:

5.5.8 
Appendix A provides the full records of the protected species and species of 
conservation concern within 1 km of the Project Site. The main ecological 
value of the Project Site lies with the marshy grassland or ‘purple moor-grass 
and rush pastures’, ‘ponds’ and the ‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ 
which are all Section 42 habitats under the NERC Act and are located within 
SINCs. 
Assessment 
5.5.9 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 (paragraph 5.3.3) the Ecological Impact 
Assessment (EcIA) will provide an assessment of any potentially significant 
effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological 
or geological conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats 
and other species identified as being of principal importance for the 
conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore opportunities will be taken, where 
practicable, to conserve and enhance biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests. NPS EN-1 also requires that lighting effects will be 
considered on sensitive ecological receptors.   
5.5.10 Based on the results of the extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, the following 
Phase 2 protected species surveys are currently being carried out on and 
surrounding the Project Site. 
Bats 
5.5.11 A roped-access tree survey is being carried out for trees to be removed or 
modified that have been identified as having potential to support roosting 
bats. Where the potential for bats to roost in a surveyed tree is confirmed 
then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey will be carried out to 
confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the status of any roost 
present.   
5.5.12 In addition bat activity surveys are being carried out across the Project Site 
in accordance with the guidance provided by Hundt (2012)46 which involves 
walked transect routes carried out monthly between April and October and

an automated survey using static bat detectors. These surveys will 
determine the species of bats present on the Project Site as well as the 
spatial distribution and relative activity levels of these species.   
Great Crested Newts  
5.5.13 Preliminary pond surveys (Habitat Suitability Assessment) indicated that 
there are a number of ponds within 250 m of the Project Site which are 
potentially suitable for great crested newts. An additional four to six surveys 
are being undertaken between mid-March to mid-June to establish presence 
or absence and to estimate population size if great crested newts are found 
during the surveys. More detail on the methodology is provided in Appendix 
A. 
Dormouse 
5.5.14 A dormouse survey is being undertaken following a methodology based on 
those prescribed in best practice guidance (Bright et al, 2006)47. The surveys 
involve the use of dormouse boxes in areas of woodland and nest tubes in 
cluttered environments where boxes cannot be used. The survey is designed 
to detect the presence or absence of dormice.   
Otter and Water Vole 
5.5.15 A survey for water voles and otters along the banks of the water courses is 
being carried out in accordance with best practice guidelines (Chanin 
(2003)48 and Strachan et al., (2011)49 respectively). Signs that water voles 
may be present will be indicated by the presence of feeding remains, 
characteristic grass lawns, burrows, runs, footprints, latrines and droppings.  
Signs that otters may be present will be indicated by the presence of spraints 
and footprints. 
Reptiles 
5.5.16 A reptile survey is being carried out on the Project Site to establish the 
presence/absence of reptiles, the species present and the approximate 
population size. The survey uses artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to 
aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of their distribution and 
abundance, following good practice guidance, including that set out in the 
Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 200350) and Reptile Survey 
Guidance (Froglife, 199951).

Badgers  
5.5.17 All potential habitats within and surrounding the Project Site are being 
surveyed to search for and record characteristic signs of badger activity, 
including: setts, latrine pits, foraging holes, badger hair and paw prints 
following best practice guidance (Neal and Cheesman, 199652). Potential 
habitat includes areas of woodland, scrub and hedgerows. If the Gas 
Connection Route Corridor, once chosen, potentially requires the closure of 
any badger setts then a badger bait marking survey will be carried out 
between early September and mid-October.   
Breeding birds 
5.5.18 The breeding bird survey focuses on the farmland birds (occurring both 
within the Project Site and a buffer of up to 50 m). Their territories are being 
mapped using surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s Common 
Bird Census (CBC) methodology with an initial site visit carried out in mid-
April, followed by additional visits in May and June. 
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.5.19 The block of marshy grassland to the west of Abergelli Farm, will be 
surveyed for marsh fritillary butterflies following standard methods53 for 
walking transects during late May/June looking for adults and larval webs 
during mid-August to mid-September.   
5.5.20 A survey of Lepidoptera (notably moths) will be undertaken in the woodland 
within the Project Site in late spring and mid-summer. The survey will involve 
two night-time moth surveys using Skinner or Robinson moth traps fitted with 
mercury vapour bulbs. Any species hard to identify from external markings 
alone, and those requiring further confirmation, will be retained and 
dissected if necessary to ascertain their identity with the use of a 
stereoscopic microscope.   
5.5.21 Beetle assemblages in the woodland within the Project Site will be sampled 
using a method following the Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et al, 
2007)54 via hand searches, sweep netting and pitfall trapping. Subsequent 
laboratory identification will be required for many of the specimens collected.   
5.5.22 In order to determine the assemblage of aquatic invertebrates present on 
Project Site, the flowing ditches and ponds will be surveyed if a Water 
Framework Directive Report is required (refer to Section 5.6).   
5.5.23 Kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates will be undertaken at selected 
locations along ditches or streams. Furthermore the water chemistry status 
will be determined for watercourses by extracting a single water sample at 
three locations within as well as upstream and downstream of the Project

Site. Samples will be dispatched to a UKAS accredited laboratory for 
subsequent analysis.   
5.5.24 The national pond monitoring survey protocol will be adhered to for 
surveying ponds which involves timed netting and searches for invertebrates 
in summer (but may also cover spring and autumn).   
Invasive Species 
5.5.25 A walkover survey of the Project Site will be carried out to map all locations 
where Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are growing. This will be 
done within the period June - July when both species are most in evidence.  
Assessment 
5.5.26 Following the completion of the surveys, reports will be produced, detailing 
the extent to which the species are present, the likely impacts that the 
elements of the Project would have on the species and habitats and the 
potential mitigation measures that could be employed to reduce impacts to 
an acceptable level.   
5.5.27 The EcIA will be undertaken in accordance with the relevant guidance 
including the Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (Institute of 
Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM), 2006)55. The potential 
effects will also be assessed against and informed by national and local 
planning guidance including the PPW and TANs as well as National and 
Local Biodiversity Action Plans. Consultation will be undertaken with NRW 
and City and County of Swansea Council to identify any particular issues of 
concern.   
Habitats Regulation Assessment  
5.5.28 The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
56 require an assessment to be made as to whether the Project, either alone 
or in combination with other plans or projects could have a likely significant 
effect on European sites including SPAs, SACs and Ramsar Sites.  Within 
10 km of the Project Site lie Burry Inlet Ramsar Site and SPA; Carmarthen 
Bay and Estuaries SAC and Crymlyn Bog Ramsar Site and SAC.   
5.5.29 Consultation with the City and County of Swansea Council will determine the 
requirement for a screening exercise, in accordance with the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended). The screening 
exercise will identify any likely impacts of the Project upon the above 
European Sites, either alone or in combination with other plans and projects, 
and consider whether the impacts are likely to be significant.   
5.5.30 If screening concludes there may be likely significant effects on the special 
features for which the European Sites are classified or designated then a 
report will be provided with the DCO Application showing the European Sites

that may be affected together with sufficient information to enable the 
decision maker to make an appropriate assessment, if required.  If screening 
concludes there is no likely significant effect on a European Site sufficient 
information will be provided with the DCO Application in the form of a ‘No 
Significant Effects Report’ to allow the Competent Authority to assess and 
review the information and make its own determination that there are no 
likely significant effects and be satisfied there is no significant residual 
effect.   
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.5.31 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting effects on ecology and biodiversity during 
construction and decommissioning. If necessary, further, specific mitigation 
measures will include the consideration for provision of new habitat to 
suitably replace any habitat areas which would be permanently lost through 
development of the Project.   
5.6 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
5.6.1 
An assessment on the effects on water quality and resources will consider all 
of the potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
5.6.2 
The chapter will also provide a summary of the main issues and risks posed 
to and from flooding identified during the Flood Consequences Assessment 
(FCA) which will be submitted as a separate document as part of the DCO 
Application. The FCA will take the form of a qualitative assessment based on 
existing NRW data and consultation with the NRW and Lead Local Flood 
Authority (LLFA). Additionally, potential impacts on hydrogeology will be 
assessed as part of the chapter describing geology, ground conditions and 
agriculture (outlined in Section 5.7 of this Scoping Report). 
Baseline 
5.6.3 
The main watercourse that traverses the area is Afon Llan which flows in a 
south-westerly direction to the west and south of the Project Site, through 
Swansea into Swansea Bay. In addition, there are a number of ordinary 
watercourses in the form of springs, streams and drainage ditches within the 
Project Site that ultimately flow into Afon Llan. The location of Afon Llan is 
shown on Figure 2. 
5.6.4 
The streams, ponds and ditches within the Gas and Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Areas will be carefully considered during the process of 
identifying the Gas and Electrical Connection Route Corridors. The design 
process will aim to minimise crossings or interactions with water bodies 
where practical.

5.6.5 
Historical and current maps will be studied to identify abstraction points and 
licences in the area as well as the course of any former watercourses which 
may have been underground or culverted in the past.   
Assessment  
5.6.6 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 the assessment will account for the existing 
status of, and impacts of the Project on water quality, water resources and 
physical characteristics of the water environment including any potential 
eutrophication impacts. The assessment will be undertaken using a risk 
based approach to determine the level of potential impacts by using a 
Source-Pathway-Receptor 
model 
to 
identify 
which 
receptors 
could 
realistically be impacted by a given action. This will include any sources of 
pollution that have the potential to impact on surface water bodies.   
5.6.7 
All aspects of supply, demand and disposal of water and process effluents 
will be addressed for the construction, operational and decommissioning 
phases. Furthermore the disposal of surface water drainage and the process 
effluents will be discussed with a view to maximising the opportunities for 
water recovery and re-use as far as is practicable.   
5.6.8 
Potential discharge locations for site surface waters and process waste 
waters will be identified and a site drainage plan, which may incorporate a 
sustainable drainage system (SuDS) will be discussed at a high level.   
5.6.9 
There are not anticipated to be any significant impacts on key water bodies 
resulting from the Project through physical works to them. It is also not 
anticipated that water will be directly abstracted or discharged to or from any 
of these sources during construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Power Generation Plant.   
5.6.10 Where projects are away from, or unlikely to interact with any water courses, 
it is likely that a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report will be scoped 
out. However, if NRW does require the inclusion of a WFD Report, it would 
form an Appendix to the ES. 
5.6.11 During construction of the Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection (if 
in the form of an underground cable), best working methods will be utilised at 
all water crossings to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on flow or 
drainage and that no contamination is allowed to enter the water bodies. 
Effects during operation and decommissioning are unlikely to occur or be 
significant and therefore have been scoped out.   
5.6.12 If an overhead line is used for the Electrical Connection, there will be no 
need for any permanent water crossings or interaction with water bodies of 
any kind. However any temporary water crossings required during 
construction will be assessed.

Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.6.13 Mitigation measures will be designed in accordance with BS603157, 
BS800458, as well as CIRIA C64959 and C64860. An outline CEMP will be 
drafted and appended to the ES which will set out best practice methods of 
limiting impacts on water quality and resources during construction and 
decommissioning. Measures would include: siting stockpiles a minimum 
distance from watercourses to avoid pollution runoff; and adhering to best 
practice working guidelines to avoid spillages near watercourses. 
5.6.14 Where the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection (in the form of an 
underground cable or construction vehicles during installation of overhead 
lines) would cross a water body, various crossing techniques would be 
considered. These may include trenchless techniques such as horizontal 
directional drilling, particularly for larger water bodies, or temporary bunding 
and over-pumping where flows are lower. 
5.6.15 Additionally, during construction, operation and decommissioning, silt traps 
and oil interceptors would be placed in drains on site. No untreated surface 
or waste waters would be allowed to drain into water bodies during 
construction, operation or decommissioning. SuDS would be used if found to 
be required. 
5.6.16 During all phases of the Project all aqueous process effluents would be 
discharged via the plant drainage systems in accordance with NRW limits. 
The use of biocides would be optimised to ensure that the least amount 
possible is required.   
5.6.17 All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored would 
be surrounded by an impermeable bund sized to contain 110% of capacity. 
In addition multiple tanks or drums would be within bunds sized to contain 
the greater of 110% of the capacity of the largest tank or 25% of the total 
tank’s contents.   
5.6.18 During operation, NRW would set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the Power Generation Plant under an Environmental 
Permit. The need, or otherwise for further, specific mitigation measures will 
be determined through the EIA process.

Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture 
Introduction  
5.7.1 
An assessment on the effects of geology, ground conditions and agriculture 
will consider potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project. It will also detail 
the baseline conditions in terms of ground and groundwater contamination

and the risks posed to human health particularly in relation to future site 
users.   
Baseline 
5.7.2 
The Project Site is located in an area where the geology is characterised by 
boulder clay and the underlying Grovesend Beds, Upper Carboniferous 
sandstones and thin coals61. These are overlain by glacial sand and gravel, 
alluvium and some peat. Overlying this geology are raw gley and brown 
soils. There are no aquifers or groundwater protection zones in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
5.7.3 
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding the 
Project Site is grade 4 (poor quality agricultural land)62 and is dominated by 
improved grassland fields used for grazing sheep and horses. In addition 
within the Project Site, are located a disused coal mine, a landfill as well as 
small areas of marshy grassland and woodland copses interspersing the 
improved grassland to the north and east.  
Assessment  
5.7.4 
The assessment will be underpinned by the DEFRA/EA publication 
Contaminated Land Report 11, 2004, ‘Model Procedures for the 
Management of Land Contamination’63 and associated subsequent 
guidance.  
5.7.5 
The assessment approach will be undertaken with a clear understanding of 
the following:  
 
Previous land uses – through a review of historical maps;   
 
Underlying ground conditions – thorough review of BGS maps, a 
review of previous site investigations (where available) and by 
undertaking geotechnical investigations where deemed necessary; 
and 
 
Existing physical baseline conditions through a site walkover survey 
and review of a Landmark Envirocheck Report.   
5.7.6 
The Landmark Envirocheck Report (or equivalent) will identify groundwater 
vulnerability, sites designated for geological importance, details of any 
previous pollution events, details of landfills, waste management sites and 
Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) sites within the Project Site 
and surrounding area.   
5.7.7 
A conceptual site model approach will be used to assess the risks posed by 
contaminants to sensitive receptors using a Source-Pathway-Receptor 
model, based on the following:

 
Source – potential source of contamination; 
 
Pathway – means by which contamination can reach and impact upon 
a receptor; and  
 
Receptor – that which may be adversely affected by the presence of 
contamination.   
5.7.8 
Desk studies will identify potential environmental and geotechnical liabilities 
associated with the Project, including an assessment of potential impacts of 
previous uses of the Project Site and surrounding area. This will enable the 
identification of any potential environmental and geotechnical risks, and the 
design of a focussed and cost efficient intrusive investigation (if required).   
5.7.9 
In undertaking the desk studies, all available information on the Project Site 
and surrounding area will be reviewed to establish local ground conditions 
and the environmental settings. Furthermore, consultation will be held with 
the City and County of Swansea Council and the NRW to obtain any other 
environmental records available for the Project Site, and to further refine the 
assessment methodology.   
5.7.10 A site walkover will be undertaken of the Project Site and immediate 
surrounding areas. This will help ensure all potential source, pathway and 
receptor linkages for potential contamination issues have been identified.  
5.7.11 Based on the findings of the desk studies, site walkovers and preliminary risk 
assessment, recommendations will be provided for any further intrusive 
investigation work required to satisfy current standards and guidance and fill 
any data gaps identified to fully inform the assessments of environmental 
and geotechnical risks or liabilities.   
5.7.12 Using the information obtained, suitable remediation strategies will be 
developed to render the Project Site ready for development. These will 
include estimates of the types and volumes of waste material that will need 
to be removed from the Project Site prior to development.   
5.7.13 Additionally, an assessment will be made of the amount of agricultural land, 
if any, that may become sterilised by the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
Should an overhead Electrical Connection be considered, the same 
methodology will be used, although it is considered likely that the potential 
impact on geology, ground conditions and agriculture would be significantly 
less than for a buried connection.   
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.7.14 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Embedded mitigation measures would include adherence 
to good practice guidelines and could potentially involve the following:  
 
Any additional soil materials that are to be imported to the Project 
Site would be required to have certification of their chemical 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

concentrations to ensure that contaminative materials are not being 
introduced to the area; 
 
In order to further limit disturbance, the site access tracks would be 
constructed first to allow movement of vehicles around the Project 
Site on areas of soft-standing;   
 
Any vegetation, topsoil and subsoil would be removed to expose a 
suitable sub-grade. Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for 
reuse would be stockpiled on impermeable liners;  
 
Soils which are to be reused onsite would be tested for contamination 
and geotechnical suitability. This would form part of a site waste 
management strategy which would be drafted prior to construction 
and would focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of waste spoil;  
 
Surface water, perched waters or groundwater from dewatering 
operations would not be discharged to surface water bodies, foul or 
surface water drains without the appropriate consents from the local 
water or sewage company and / or NRW. The disposal of this effluent 
would be the responsibility of the principal construction contractor. If 
necessary, this water would be tanked off-site for disposal at a 
suitable facility;   
 
All foundations would be appropriately specified to resist chemical 
attack from soils or groundwater; and  
 
Foundations would also be designed so as not to present a 
preferential pathway for contaminant migration, if present at the 
Project Site.   
5.8 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
Introduction 
5.8.1 
A landscape and visual impact assessment will consider potentially 
significant impacts and effects caused by construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The assessment will establish:  
 
A clear understanding of the Project Site and its wider landscape 
setting, identifying the landscape character, resources, value and 
sensitivity to the development;  
 
An assessment of the composition, character and aesthetic value of 
views from visual receptors including occupiers of residential 
properties and people using amenity landscapes, and the sensitivity 
of views;   
 
The nature of the different development scenarios and mitigation 
measures; and 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

 
The likely significant direct and indirect effects of the Project on the 
landscape resource (i.e. landscape elements and character) and on 
visual receptors.  
Baseline  
5.8.2 
The Project Site is located within an area of lowland rolling farmland known 
locally as the ‘Welsh Gower’. It is within an essentially rural landscape, criss-
crossed by networks of minor roads, overhead wires on steel pylons and 
other utilities infrastructure.   
5.8.3 
The Welsh Gower was historically part of the Lordship of Gower, but is now 
separated physically and perceptibly from the historic area. It consists largely 
of moorland, with any settlements of size - Craig Cefn Parc and 
Pontarddulais - on the southern fringes. Economic activity is confined largely 
to upland farming and forestry, although there is a commercial fishery and 
two large reservoirs to the north of the Project Site. The area also contains 
extensive evidence of human exploitation and occupation over millennia, 
with a proliferation of cairns and earthworks, evidence of a Roman fort and 
marching camps. 
5.8.4 
The area around the Project Site is rural in character, although there is a 
large amount of utilities infrastructure in the area due to its close proximity to 
Swansea. Gas and water pipelines cross the Project Site and there is also a 
network of electricity pylons southwest of Abergelli Farm, which lead to and 
from Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National Grid’s two 400kV 
electrical substations. Furthermore a Water Treatment Works is located 
immediately to the northwest while Cefn Betingau Solar Park is operational 
to the east of the Project Site.   
5.8.5 
Amongst this wider landscape, the Project Site is located within open gently 
sloping grass fields used for grazing sheep and horses interspersed by 
woodland copses, some of which are classified as Ancient Woodland as 
shown on Figure 3.   
5.8.6 
Residential receptors within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau and Llwyncelyn, Felindre. In 
addition there are also isolated dwellings and farmsteads outside of the 
settlements including but not exclusive to:  
 
Aber gelli fawr; 


 
Cefn-betingau;

Assessment  
5.8.7 
The assessment will be carried out in accordance to NPS EN-1 using the 
methodology set out in the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment 
(Landscape 
Institute 
and 
Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Management and Assessment, 3rd Edition, 2013)64 and Countryside Council 
for Wales / CADW (2007) ‘Guide to Good Practice on Using the Register of 
Landscapes of Historic Interest in Wales in the Planning and Development 
Process’65. It will include:  
 
A desk review of all relevant documents and landscape planning 
policy and guidance;   
 
A field survey to assess baseline landscape character and visual 
amenity;  
 
A description of the key features associated with the Project that 
have the potential to alter the characteristics of the landscape and 
visual baseline;  
 
Appropriate generic and site specific mitigation that is reasonable and 
possible;  
 
Assessment of the predicted significance of residual effects on the 
landscape resource / character and visual amenity and compliance 
with landscape policy; and

 
An assessment of cumulative impacts arising from the Project, in 
combination with other proposed large scale industrial developments 
in the locality.   
5.8.8 
Initially, a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan will be generated for the 
Power Generation Plant using specialist software. The ZTV will show a 
maximum theoretical visibility of the Power Generation Plant and any 
overhead line towers, should an overhead Electrical Connection by pursued 
across the surrounding area. The ZTV will be based solely on topography 
and the proposed height of the plant envelope, and any overhead line 
towers. No allowance will be made for intervening screening vegetation or 
buildings, although in practice this tends to have a substantial mitigating 
effect.   
5.8.9 
A review of all relevant landscape planning policy and LANDMAP (the 
national information system, devised by CCW (now NRW), for taking 
landscape into account in decision-making) will be undertaken. Particular 
attention will be paid to AONBs, popular tourist spots and viewpoints, and 
Public Rights of Way. The nearest AONB is the Gower which is remote from 
the Project Site and visually separated from the Project Site by intervening 
topography and therefore has been scoped out of the assessment.   
5.8.10 The Project will be discussed in detail including dimensions of the larger 
buildings, the stack heights, and any other ancillary infrastructure that may 
have an impact on the landscape character or visual amenity.  
5.8.11 To assist in the impact assessment, a site visit will be made by a qualified 
Chartered Landscape Architect, who will assess the study area in detail. 
Additionally, and following consultation with relevant stakeholders, a 
selection of photomontages will be taken from key sensitive viewpoints (e.g. 
residential receptors, designated ecological sites, cultural heritage assets 
and key rights of way). Suggested viewpoint locations of photomontages for 
consultation are:  
 
View north east from the Public Right of Way to the west of Maes-
eglwys; 
 
View south from the Public Right of Way junction south of 
Brynheulog; 
 
View east from the Public Right of Way junction north of Lletty Morfil 
Farm;  
 
View northeast from B4489 at the junction with the Public Right of 
Way close to Brynwhilhach; 
 
View north from the road and Public Right of Way junction at Pant-
lasau; 
 
View south from the Gower Way at Lower Lliw Reservoir;  
 
View north from Kilvey Hill in Swansea; and

 
View north from the A48 to the south of the M4. 
5.8.12 Photomontages will be produced with reference to ‘Photography and 
photomontage in landscape and visual impact assessment Landscape 
Institute 
Advice 
Note 
01/11’66. 
The 
photomontages 
will 
show 
a 
representation of how the Project would be viewed within the landscape and 
will be used to illustrate the potential impact of the Project.   
5.8.13 Given that the majority of the Gas Connection would be underground, the 
landscape and visual impact assessment for this element will focus solely on 
the impact of the AGI and the impacts and effects that will result from the 
construction phase.    
5.8.14 As for the Gas Connection, if the underground Electrical Connection is 
carried forward, then the LVIA for this element of the work will focus solely 
on the impacts resulting from the presence of a SEC, if required, and the 
impacts and effects that will result from the construction phase.   
5.8.15 If an overhead line is taken forward, the assessment will follow the standard 
LVIA methodology as described above, but will make reference to the 
Holford Rules where appropriate. 
Potential Mitigation Measures   
5.8.16 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Embedded mitigation measures would include the careful 
consideration of siting stockpiles and cranes to avoid detrimental impacts on 
the visual amenity of closest receptors.   
5.8.17 During operation, the main embedded mitigation measures would be the 
careful siting and arrangement of the: Power Generation Plant; AGI for the 
Gas Connection; and SEC for the Electrical Connection, if required. The final 
architectural design of the buildings and upstanding structures would be 
carefully considered to provide a high standard of visual amenity, given 
practical and economic constraints.    
5.8.18 Further, detailed mitigation measures could include the consideration for 
onsite or off-site screen planting to screen views of the Power Generation 
Plant.   
5.8.19 Due regard will be paid to NPS EN-1, EN-2, and EN-5 and the guidance they 
provide on ‘good design’ in relation to the Gas and Electrical Connections 
and include (to the extent relevant in the case of an underground connection 
for Gas and Electrical Connection):   
 
Avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of highest amenity 
value, by planning the general route of the line in the first place, even 
if total mileage is somewhat increased in consequence;

 
Avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest by 
deviation, provided this can be done without using too many angle 
towers, i.e. the bigger structures which are used when lines change 
direction;  
 
Other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp 
changes of direction and thus with fewer angle towers;  
 
Choose tree and hill backgrounds in preference to sky backgrounds 
wherever possible. Where a line has to cross a ridge, secure this 
opaque background as long as possible, cross obliquely when a dip 
in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross directly, 
preferably between belts of trees;  
 
Prefer moderately open valleys with woods where the apparent height 
of towers will be reduced, and views of the line will be broken by 
trees;  
 
Where country is flat and sparsely planted, keep the high voltage 
lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging 
routes, distribution poles and other masts, wires and cables, so as to 
avoid a concentration of lines or ‘wirescape’; and  
 
Approach urban areas through industrial zones, where they exist; and 
when pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes between 
the approach line, National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations 
and Felindre Gas Compressor Station carefully assess the 
comparative costs of undergrounding.   
5.9 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
Introduction 
5.9.1 
An assessment on traffic, transport and access effects will consider 
potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
5.9.2 
The main impacts of the Project on traffic, transport and access would occur 
during construction and decommissioning resulting from the movement of 
vehicles for the transport of construction or decommissioning personnel, 
equipment and materials to and from the Project Site. The transport of 
abnormal loads, which may lead to delays and cause inconvenience to other 
road users, would be timed following consultation with the relevant 
authorities to minimise disruption to the other road users.   
5.9.3 
Normal activities during operation would result in fewer traffic movements 
and would be associated with personnel required for operation and 
maintenance of the Project. As such, during operation no significant increase 
in traffic in the area of the Project Site is expected, and no effect on local 
traffic patterns and infrastructure would therefore be anticipated.

Baseline 
5.9.4 
There are two options being considered in regards to accessing the Project 
Site from Junction 46 of the M4. Access Road – Option 1 would be via the 
Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli 
Farm. Access Road – Option 2 is via the B4489, along the access road to 
the National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and then along an access road to be constructed as 
part of the Project, across undeveloped land to the Generating Equipment 
Site. Both options are shown on Figure 1. 
Assessment  
5.9.5 
The assessment will be undertaken in accordance with the ‘Welsh Transport 
Planning and Appraisal Guidance WeITAG67 and the Institute of 
Environmental Assessment’s (IEA) ‘Guidelines for the Environmental 
Assessment of Road Traffic’ (1993)68 in order to assess the likely significant 
impacts of the Project on the local road network.   
5.9.6 
Comparisons between existing traffic flows and estimates of likely traffic 
flows on potentially affected roads will be made to help establish whether 
significant effects are likely. This will take into account: the sensitivity of 
receptors and resources likely to be affected; any potential for disruption to 
local routes; and any changes in the composition of traffic. If considered 
necessary, traffic surveys will be undertaken which will further quantify the 
number of vehicle movements on the existing road network in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
5.9.7 
The majority of the proposed access routes are ‘main roads’ that do not have 
pavements for pedestrian use. Nonetheless, the traffic assessment will also 
take full account of the potential impact on pedestrians, and will ensure that 
pedestrians and other road users (cyclists and equestrians) are not cut off 
from amenity areas as a result of the works.   
5.9.8 
The assessment will consider the following: access and construction routes 
and the types of vehicles used; local highway and rail networks; existing 
traffic flows; current traffic generation; road traffic accident information; 
predicted traffic trends; local highway improvements and planned works; 
and, potential receptors. The full appraisal will be presented (if appropriate) 
in a Transport Assessment which will be accompanied by a draft 
Construction Traffic Management Plan. 
5.9.9 
Discussions will be held with the Highways Agency and the City and County 
of Swansea Council to identify any existing issues relating to traffic in the 
area. Information will also be sought on future development projects in the 
area that could give rise to a significant cumulative impact when considered 
in conjunction with the Project.

5.10.1 An assessment of the effects on cultural heritage and archaeological assets 
will consider potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
Baseline  
5.10.2 The Project Site is within an area of pastoral farmland which has evolved as 
a result of gradual enclosure of the uplands and foothills in the area. There is 
some evidence for enclosure in the pre-Norman period, and the process has 
continued through time into the second half of the 19th century. In addition 
there are some areas of unenclosed land and woodland (some which is 
classified as Ancient Woodland) remaining as shown on Figure 3.   
5.10.3 Also within the area there has been some industrial activity in the form of 
mining and tinplate works which took place in the 19th century. In the areas 
where industrial activity has taken place associated ribbon development 
occurs. In the rest of the area the settlement pattern is mainly dispersed with 
isolated dwellings. 
5.10.4 The following cultural heritage assets are located within 5 km of the Project 
Site:  
 
Clydach Upper Forge Scheduled Monument; 
 
Landore New Quay Scheduled Monument; 


undesignated cultural heritage assets within 5 km of the Project Site. These 
include standing buildings, earthworks, areas of ancient woodland, sites of 
structures 
known 
only 
from 
documentary 
sources,

Assessment 
5.10.6 In accordance with NPS EN-1, the objectives of this assessment are to:  
 
Describe the survival and extent of any archaeological features that 
may 
be 
disturbed 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project;  
 
Provide an assessment of the importance of these assets;  
 
Assess the likely scale of any impacts on the cultural heritage and 
archaeological resource posed by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project;   
 
Outline suitable mitigation measures to prevent, reduce and where 
possible offset any significant adverse effects; and  
 
Provide an assessment of any residual effects remaining after 
mitigation.   
5.10.7 Initially, a Desk Based Assessment (DBA) will be undertaken, and will 
include the following detailed searches:   
 
The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments Wales 
which is the investigative body and national archive for the historic 
environment of Wales and hosts an online search facility (Coflein); 
 
Swansea Historic Environment Record (HER) (which includes records 
of any previous archaeological interventions within the Scheme 
Area). The HER will also include details of Registered Parks and 
Gardens, Listed Buildings and Registered Battlefields; 
 
Historic Mapping; and  
 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation.  
5.10.8 The DBA will be undertaken in accordance with ‘Standard and Guidance for 
Archaeological Assessments’ (Institute for Archaeologists, 2011)69.   
5.10.9 It is proposed that initially, searches are limited to 1 km from the Project Site 
for HER entries for archaeology as the Project will potential impact 
archaeology 
within 
the 
development 
footprint 
and 
the 
immediate 
surroundings. The 1 km Study Area provides the opportunity to better 
understand the context of any archaeology present within the development 
footprint. 
5.10.10 As part of the DBA, a site inspection will be undertaken of the Project Site to 
identify any previously unknown archaeological features and their condition.  
During the site inspection a detailed photographic record will be maintained 
and an assessment of the setting of the cultural heritage assets will be 
undertaken.

5.10.11 In order to gather baseline cultural heritage setting data, and to undertake an 
assessment of the potential impacts that the Project Site may have on the 
setting of any above ground remains, selected cultural heritage assets will 
be visited. This will follow an initial study making reference to the results of 
desk-based research, and the ZTV including searches of the records listed 
above. Assets will be visited where this initial study indicates potential for 
significant impacts. Both the asset and its surrounding area will be visited to 
identify locations that might be relevant to the asset’s setting.  
5.10.12 For the purposes of the setting study, the following cultural heritage assets 
will be considered:  
 
Scheduled Monuments;  
 
Listed Buildings;  
 
Registered Parks and Gardens; 
 
Registered Battlefields;  
 
World Heritage Sites; and 
 
Any other non-scheduled building which is considered to be important 
in terms of cultural heritage and archaeological significance.   
5.10.13 It is proposed that the search area for these cultural heritage assets will be 
limited to 5 km from the Project Site, as significant impacts on setting are 
unlikely to occur beyond 5 km. However, should significant impacts be 
identified at 5 km, then the search area will be expanded accordingly.   
5.10.14 The following factors are also considered to be relevant when assessing 
impacts upon setting:   
 
Visual dominance;   
 
Scale;   
 
Intervisibility;  
 
Vistas and sight lines;  
 
Movement and light; and  
 
Unaltered settings.  
5.10.15 The DBA will form the baseline data for the cultural heritage and 
archaeology section of the ES. The ES will discuss the nature and location of 
all cultural heritage and archaeological sites within the study area. Further to 
this, the ES will provide an assessment of the significance of any impacts to 
the cultural heritage and archaeology sites.   
5.10.16 At this stage, no intrusive investigations are proposed for cultural heritage or 
archaeological purposes, although this will be confirmed (or otherwise) 
based on the findings of the DBA, and in consultation with the City and 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

County of Swansea Planning Archaeologist and representative of Cadw. 
Should intrusive investigations be necessary, their scope will be agreed with 
the Planning Archaeologist through a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI).   
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.10.17 Prior to construction, the nature and extent of archaeology present at the 
Project Site and surrounding areas will be established. However, should any 
archaeological remains be found during construction, work will be halted and 
advice sought from the Planning Archaeologist. Where necessary, 
recommendations will be made for a mitigation strategy to preserve in-situ or 
if not practicable to preserve by record any significant archaeological assets. 
The ES will also include a mitigation strategy for any significant impacts to 
listed buildings and other above ground assets.   
5.10.18 During operation, there may be an opportunity to provide screen planting, 
should the Project give rise to any adverse impacts on above ground 
heritage assets.    
5.11 
Socio-Economics 
Introduction  
5.11.1 An assessment on the effects on socio-economics resulting from the Project 
will be undertaken and reported in the ES. This will consider potentially 
significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project on socio-economic resources and receptors 
in and around the vicinity of the Project Site.   
5.11.2 At its peak, the construction and decommissioning workforces are expected 
to employ between 150 and 250 personnel. Subject to procurement rules it is 
anticipated that as many as possible of these workforces would be recruited 
locally.   
5.11.3 Operation of the Generating Equipment would require up to 15 full time staff 
over the lifetime of the Project working in shifts which means that less than 
15 people will be on site at any one time during normal operations. In 
addition there would be further indirect jobs for contracted engineering staff 
during regular maintenance shutdowns and maintenance of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections.   
5.11.4 The total capital cost of the Project is anticipated to be of the order of £200 
million. Up to approximately 35% of this will be construction, civils and 
fabrication work which would be open to tender from companies in the area. 
5.11.5 During construction and decommissioning, those workers from outside of the 
local area would require places to stay, and regular sustenance, delivering 
knock on benefits to local businesses and services. In addition the Project 
would also represent an additional income source to the local economy 
during the operational phase in terms of local employment and the use of 
local services and suppliers.

Baseline  
5.11.6 The area surrounding the Project Site has a long history of both mining and 
agriculture.   
5.11.7 The Project Site lies within the City and County of Swansea. It is located 
within the region of South West Wales. South West Wales has a resident 
population of approximately 685,000 and supports some 280,000 jobs in 
around 20,000 businesses, making it a major driver of the Welsh economy.  
It is a large and diverse region that contains a wide range of urban and rural 
places, 
with 
distinctive, 
though 
inter-connected, 
economies 
and 
communities. Within the region, Swansea forms the second largest City in 
Wales and the regional centre for South West Wales. The population of the 
City and County of Swansea is approximately 239,02370 which has been 
increasing steadily for nearly a decade. The County has a diverse character, 
covering an area of approximately 380 km2, and can be broadly divided into:  
 
The sparsely populated open moorlands of the north; 
 
The Gower Penisula and its hinterlands in the west; 
 
The urban settlements and communities that are generally spread 
along the main transport corridors into the City where the main 
populations reside; and  
 
The conurbation of Swansea City Centre and the urban waterfront.   
5.11.8 In 2011, 102,793 or 43% of residents aged between 16 to 74 were in 
employment which is comparable to 44.5% of the population of Wales71. The 
key sources of employment in the City and County of Swansea in 2011 
were:  
 
Wholesale and Retail Trade; Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motor 
Cycles at 17%; 
 
Human health and social work activities at 15%; 
 
Education at 11%; 
 
Manufacturing at 7%; and 
 
Construction at 7%. 
5.11.9 Swansea Bay is a popular tourist destination due to the sandy beaches of 
Gower, the Victorian seaside village of Mumbles and Wales’ Waterfront City 
with its Blue Flag marina.  The nearest tourist destination to the Project Site 
is the Team Force Swansea Paintball Centre approximately 50 m south of 
the Project Site.

Assessment Methodology  
5.11.10 In accordance with NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.12.3 the assessment will 
consider all relevant socio-economic impacts such as tourism, influxes of 
workers, and cumulative impacts.   
5.11.11 There is currently no established EIA methodology for the assessment of 
socio-economic impacts. To assess the socio-economic impacts the 
‘Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment’ (May 1994) 
produced by the Interorganizational Committee on Guidelines and Principles 
for Social Impact Assessment72, HM Treasury’s Green Book73 and the 
English Partnerships(EP) Additionally Guide74 will be used.  
5.11.12 The study area will extend to cover the immediate area of City and County of 
Swansea and the wider area of South West Wales, in order to assess the 
likely effects that may be experienced within the local community.   
5.11.13 The methodology for the socio-economic impact assessment will be based 
on the collection of a wide range of data and information from published 
materials, plus consultation with the local authority and key stakeholders. 
Key sources of information will include:  
 
Population characteristics (population dynamics);  
 
Community and institutional structures (employment, training, skills 
and qualifications, economic investment, business development and 
equal opportunities);  
 
Individual and family changes (perceptions of risk, attitudes towards 
the Project, social well-being); and  
 
Community resources (security, access to local amenities including 
Public Rights of Way (PRoWs)).  
Potential Project Enhancements 
5.11.14 During construction, operation and decommissioning, an effort will be made 
to use local goods and services, wherever possible.

Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
1 
18/06/2014 
1 
Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant on agricultural land 
within Abergelli Farm north of Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at 
National Grid Reference 265284, 201431).   
1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
1.3 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary 
ecological appraisal, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This 
preliminary survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats.  
1.4 
The preliminary ecological survey has identified two European designated sites within 10km, five 
statutory designated sites for ecology (four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR)) within 5km, and twenty-three non-statutory designated Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2km of the Survey Site boundary. Three of the 
SINCs are partially within the Survey Site boundary, and a further two are adjacent. Much of the 
woodland on the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. Direct impacts on SINCs 
and Ancient Woodland within and close to the Survey Site boundary could occur, depending on the 
final layout of the Power Generation Plant.     
1.5 
Three Section 421 habitats (‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, ‘purple moor-grass and rush 
pasture’ and ‘ponds’) are present within the Survey Site.  
1.6 
There is habitat in the Survey Site that has the potential to support European Protected Species 
(EPS) including bats, great crested newts Triturus cristatus, dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius 
and otter Lutra lutra.  There are also habitats suitable for nationally protected species such as 
reptiles and water voles Arvicola amphibius. Information on badgers is contained in a confidential 
version of this report.   
1.7 
The following surveys are recommended to inform the ecology baseline chapter of the 
Environmental Statement and full details are provided in Section 5: 
 
Extended Phase 1 habitat survey of inaccessible land at the south-west end of the Survey Site 
and new land that has been identified since the survey was carried out – an access route to 
the west of the site. 
 
A National Vegetation Classification (NVC) botanical survey of marshy grassland and 
woodland that may be affected within the Survey Site as well as any areas identified as SINCs 
within or adjacent to the site; 
 
A survey of invasive plant species within the Survey Site; 
 
Roped access survey of trees identified as having potential to support bat roosts and internal 
and external building inspections, where trees/buildings may be affected directly or indirectly 
by the Project. Inspection surveys should include surveys for barn owls. Subsequent dusk 
emergence / dawn return to roost surveys should be undertaken if roosting potential or 
evidence of roosting is found; 
 
Bat activity surveys including walked transects and automated bat detector surveys; 
 
A survey for otter and water vole along water courses within the Survey Site; 
 
Dormouse surveys in areas of woodland and scrub within the Survey Site; 
                                                      
1 Species referred to within The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) as species of 
principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales which are listed on the Natural Resources Wales 
website. The Welsh Assembly Government must take steps to “further the conservation” of these species under Section 
42 of the NERC ACT 2006.

Introduction 
Site Description 
2.1 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey Site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), in which the Project 
would be located, consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by 
horses. The Survey Site is contained within the red line boundary shown in Figure 1 and is centred 
at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest town is Felindre, which is located 
approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.   
2.2 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and areas around 
the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey 
Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional patches of 
woodland. 
2.3 
The Survey Site boundary is shown on Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b (photographs of the Survey Site 
are found in Appendix 2).  
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation 
Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed 
to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal generating station to the 
existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This preliminary 
ecological survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is presently intended for submission, as 
an integral part of the Development Consent Order (DCO) Application. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
BSG Ecology was commissioned to undertake a preliminary ecological appraisal of the Survey Site 
within which the Project would be located. The main aims of this report are to: 
 
present the findings of the desk study and site surveys; 
 
assess the potential for the Survey Site to support protected or otherwise notable species; 
 
set out the legislative and/or policy protection afforded to any habitats present or any species 
potentially associated with the Survey Site; and 
 
provide recommendations for any further surveys necessary to inform a subsequent ecology 
chapter for an Environmental Statement for the site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European designated 
sites was requested from within 10 km with information on national statutory designated sites was 
requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the Survey Site boundary and 
information regarding non-statutory designated sites and records of protected2 or notable species 
(particularly those identified as priority or Section 42 species and/or of local conservation 
importance or LBAP3 species) was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from 
the Survey Site boundary. Information on locally designated Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary was requested from the Swansea 
Council Ecologist. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic Information 
for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the area were 
also reviewed. 
Field Survey 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
The initial field survey was undertaken by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM 
on 24 February 2014. The Project Site boundary and therefore the Survey Site was subsequently 
extended after a design review, and a second field survey was carried out by Stephanie Boocock 
MCIEEM on 14 April 2014 of the additional area. Habitats within the Survey Site, and up to at least 
50m from the Survey Site boundary, were identified and described following standard JNCC Phase 
1 Habitat Survey methodology as detailed in the Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). 
This uses a system of codes to describe different habitat types based on the dominant vegetation 
present, which are recorded by means of habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this 
report follow The New Flora of British Isles (Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
The survey was extended to give particular consideration to the potential of the habitats present to 
support protected species or species of local conservation importance; recorded as incidental 
information as part of the target notes. 
3.4 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site.  They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual.   
3.5 
Weather conditions during both surveys were clear and largely dry. 
Habitat Suitability Index 
3.6 
During the February field survey a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment (Oldham et al., 2000) 
of all ponds/water bodies within a 500m radius of the Survey Site (where access was possible) was 
undertaken. In the case of this survey, a wider buffer than 250m was used because of the high 
number of ponds within 250 and 500m of the Survey Site. The additional information collected is 
useful to provide context of how ponds within or in proximity to the Survey Site may connect with 
habitat available for newts in the surrounding landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the 
assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.7 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a great crested newt Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) score to be derived for each pond by 
applying the scoring system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008). The 
suitability index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond; these

include features such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are 
then used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being 
the least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in 
one of five categories defining its suitability for great crested newts as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8 
 
= excellent 
Tree Assessment 
3.8 
All the trees on site were examined for their potential to support roosting bats, graded according to 
the scale provided in the Bat Conservation Trust survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012), and summarised 
in Table 1 below.  Those that were rated Category 2 and above were described and their locations 
recorded on a GPS.

Limitations to Methods 
3.9 
Although records secured through the desk study and supplied by third parties provide useful 
background information for initial ecological assessment, they often comprise individual records 
supplied by members of the public or are the result of ad hoc surveys. The data trawl information 
can therefore help to inform the likelihood of a particular species being present in the area, but 
should not be relied upon to definitively determine presence or absence of individual species. 
3.10 
The first site visit was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year (February) for a survey of this type, 
being outside the main growing season, when the greatest variety of plants is in evidence.  
However the habitats on site are readily identifiable to an experienced botanist, and those that 
require further survey work in order to confirm their quality have been identified.  In addition, a 
robust assessment of the Survey Site’s potential to support protected species could also be made. 
Therefore, it is considered that the timing of the survey in this instance is not a significant constraint 
with regard to the findings of this assessment. The second survey on the 14th April was undertaken 
at a time when most plant species are evident and was less constrained in this respect. 
3.11 
Most parts of the Survey Site were accessed and surveyed. Some of the ponds outside of the 
Survey Site could not be accessed (see Figures 2a and 2b) as they were located on private land 
and access was denied to a number of them. Ponds within 250-500m of the Survey Site, where 
accessible, were inspected to gather contextual information and enough have been inspected to 
allow suitable additional background information to be gathered.  
3.12 
The extreme south-west end of the Survey Site could not be surveyed as the land here is in a 
separate ownership and access had not been granted by land owners at the time of survey.  The 
route of the access track (that leads west to the B4489) was added to the Survey Site boundary 
after the April Phase 1 visit, so this was also not included in the survey. A recommendation has 
been made below to survey the remainder of the Survey Site as soon as access has been granted.

Results and Interpretation 
4.1 
In this section the results of the desk study and fieldwork are brought together. The implications of 
these results are then considered.  
4.2 
Figures 1a (the northern part of the site) and 1b (the southern part of the site) illustrate the results 
of the extended Phase 1 habitat survey.  Numbers on the map and in the text below can be cross-
referenced with Target Notes (TN) in Appendix 1.  Photographs of the site can be found in 
Appendix 2.  Figures 2a (the northern part of the site) and 2b (the southern part of the site) 
illustrate areas of the site that support, or have the potential to support, protected species. 
Designated Sites 
Statutory 
4.3 
There are two Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)4 designated under the EC Habitats Directive 
within 10km. One of these, Camarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, has has been afforded multiple 
designations and is referred to under the umbrella term European Marine Site (EMS)5 which 
comprises the SAC, and is also split into two Special Protection Areas (SPA)6 and two Ramsar 
Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar)7 the details of each designation are provided 
below. There are also four statutory protected Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR) within 5km of the Survey Site. These are described in Table 2 below.

4 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive. Article 3 
of the Habitats Directive requires the establishment of a European network of important high-quality conservation sites 
that will make a significant contribution to conserving the 189 habitat types and 788 species identified in Annexes I and II 
of the Directive (as amended). 
5 The term 'European Marine Site' (EMS) (as defined by the Habitats Regulations) refers to those marine areas that area 
both Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs). For management advice see 
http://www.severnestuary.net/asera/docs/Regulation%2033%20Advice.pdf 
6 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) are strictly protected sites classified in accordance with Article 4 of the EC Birds 
Directive, which came into force in April 1979. They are classified for rare and vulnerable birds (as listed on Annex I of 
the Directive), and for regularly occurring migratory species. 
7 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

 Non-statutory 
4.5 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in Table 3 below and their locations are shown on Figure 3.  Three SINCs lie 
partially within the Survey Site boundary. Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which 
includes three fields that lie within the north-east corner of the Survey Site.  Warn Garn Wen is also 
an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the western boundary of 
the Survey Site.  Llety Morfil SINC is a collection of three areas of ancient woodland  with some 
areas of marshy grassland, that includes the woodland on the eastern boundary of the site and at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site.   
4.6 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary.  Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent to the 
southern tip of the proposed access route.   
4.7 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland (See Figure 
3).

Habitats 
4.8 
The Survey Site is roughly an ‘L’ shape, with the majority of the Survey Site running approximately 
north-south and the foot of the ‘L’ branching off to the south-west around either side of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The topography 
drains the land to the south with the highest elevation in the Survey Site along the northern 
boundary (approximately 140m above ordnance datum (aod). The land slopes away to the south 
and the lowest elevation is around the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 
400kV electrical substations (approximately 80m aod). The land is predominantly pastoral 
farmland, mostly agriculturally improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland.  The fields 
are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by fences with occasional trees, scrub 
and one defunct hedgerow.  There are numerous water courses on site, mostly in the form of 
ditches along field boundaries, but also four streams; one which runs along the eastern boundary 
of the Survey Site; another that runs north-west from the woodland in the eastern part of the site; a 
stream that runs through the marshy grassland to the west; and another around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. There is a small 
woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and the land around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations is also largely wooded. 
There are also copses and stands of mature trees around the edges of the marshy grassland in the 
north-western part of the site, as well as along field boundaries in the northern part of the site. 
Improved grassland 
4.9 
The majority of the land on site is agriculturally improved grassland (Photo 1, 2a).  This was all 
grazed short when surveyed, and consists of abundant perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, and 
varying quantities of common grassland herbs such as white clover Trifolium repens, common 
mouse ear Cerastium fontanum, and dandelion Taraxacum fontanum agg.   
Marshy grassland 
4.10 
There are marshy grassland fields at TN3, TN3a, TN4a, TN5, TN9a, TN13a and TN21a and a 
block of marshy grassland at the southern end of the Survey Site.  Although all fit within the same 
Phase 1 category, the habitats in these fields vary across the Survey Site.  The field at TN3 (Photo 
2) had a short, close-grazed sward when surveyed.  It has numerous tussocks of soft rush Juncus 
effusus and frequent sedge species.  These include common sedge Carex.nigra and glaucous 
sedge C. flacca.  Other species noted include creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, a cinquefoil 
Potentilla sp., creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens and sharp-flowered and/or jointed rush 
Juncus actutiflorus / J. articulatus.  
4.11 
The field at TN5 (Photo 3) was also grazed extremely short, when surveyed, to the point where 
individual species are difficult to distinguish.  Soft rush is frequent, along with purple-moor grass 
Molinia caerulea, sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and a sedge species (not possible to identify to 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
species level).  Heather Calluna vulgaris and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus plants are occasional and 
there are patches of sphagnum moss Sphagnum sp. present. 
4.12 
The fields marked TN3a, TN4a and TN13a, are wet semi-improved grassland, with marshy species 
such as lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula, sedges, soft rush and water figwort Scrophularia 
aquatica. 
4.13 
The fields marked TN20 all have over 25% soft rush which places them in the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category, but the intervening grassland is agriculturally improved, with abundant perennial rye-
grass and frequent white clover.  The fields marked TN21 and TN22 (Photo 4) have a much higher 
cover of soft rush - approximately 75% in TN21 and 100% in TN22 and intervening species are 
more typical of wet grassland, such as creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, creeping buttercup and 
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus.   
4.14 
Areas of purple-moor grass dominated vegetation, which also falls into the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category are present at TN14 (Photo 5), TN9a and TN21a where the purple moor grass is 
dominant with very occasional cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather plants in evidence and 
scattered willow Salix sp. scrub. At TN9a additional species recorded include soft rush, bracken, 
common haircap moss Polytrichum commune, unidentified sphagnum moss, heather, cross-leaved 
heath and bilberry along the margins with some birch and willow regeneration in small scattered 
copses. TN21a (Photo 4a) is a large field which is superficially similar to that at TN9a but appears 
to have been managed.   Purple moor-grass is not as dominant with numerous patches of bare 
earth and young ling and cross-leaved heath plants.  In addition hare’s-tail cotton grass Eriphorum 
vaginatum, (Photo 1a) deergrass Trichophorum germanicum and lousewort Pedicularis sp. are 
common. 
Semi-improved Grassland 
4.15 
The field to the south of the woodland at TN10 appears to be slightly less agriculturally improved, 
having a lower cover of perennial rye-grass, and a wider range of grasses such as Yorkshire fog, 
crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus and creeping and common bent Agrostis capillaris.  The field 
is nevertheless species-poor. There are also two species-poor semi-improved fields in the north-
east corner of the site (TN3a, TN13a, Photo 3a). 
Woodland and scrub 
4.16 
There is a block of broadleaved woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site at TN10.  
The western end is on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground 
flora including species such as Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear and creeping buttercup.  The 
trees here are small to medium-stemmed with very little understory, and include birch Betula 
pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur.  
The hill slopes down steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of 
woodland.  Here the tree species composition is similar but the understorey is much thicker with 
bramble predominating.  On wetter areas, where the bramble thins out, carpets of opposite-leaved 
golden-saxifrage Chrysosplenium oppositifolium are present.  There are also extensive areas of 
purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with sphagnum moss species also present. 
4.17 
To the north of this woodland there is a thin strip of deciduous woodland running along the banks of 
a stream running north to south at TN42. The species composition includes occasional birch, 
willow, ash and holly. There is an understory made up largely of gorse with bramble scrub and soft 
rush grading into improved grassland to the east.   
4.18 
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland is present at the south-west end of the 
Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations.  This forms a strip to the south and a more continuous block to the north of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The woodland is 
generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow species frequent along with pedunculate 
oak, birch and holly.  The trees are growing close together and are generally small-stemmed and 
straggly.  The understorey is dense bramble and ground flora was largely absent when surveyed, 
although where the woodland opens out, for example around the margins of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations, soft-rush dominated 
marshy grassland is present.

18/06/2014 
4.19 
There are also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the 
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site. At TN6a there is a small 
wooded spur with tree species including oak, birch, holly, hawthorn and an understorey dominated 
by brambles and including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent, Yorkshire fog, soft rush, hard fern 
Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern Dryopteris affinis, and bracken Pteridium aquilinum.  AtTN23a 
there is a wooded copse comprised of young birch and willow with an understorey of bramble 
scrub.  The ground flora incudes nettle, lady fern Athyrium filix-femina, scaly male fern Dryopteris 
affinis and wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum. A continuous area of scrub is present to 
the south of the woodland at TN10 and around the pond at TN15.  These areas are quite wet and 
include willow species (including grey and goat willow Salix cinerea, S. caprea), alder and bramble.  
At TN15 the scrub merges into stands of purple moor grass that are present around the pond. 
There are also blocks of scrub to the south of Abergelli Farm, along the stream that runs along the 
eastern boundary, at the northernmost point of the Survey Site, and within the marshy grassland to 
the west.  Scattered scrub (mostly common gorse Ulex europaeus) is present along some fence 
lines, and there is a bramble scrub-covered bund at TN4.   
4.20 
Many of the trees within the Survey Site are along site boundaries and are remnant hedgerow 
stools, as described in the section below. 
Boundary features 
4.21 
All boundaries on site are fences, except one length of species-poor hedgerow running north of 
Abergelli Farm.  The fences often run along the line of defunct hedges (Photo 1).  These generally 
take the form of a degraded stone-faced hedge banks, with occasional small sections of overgrown 
hedge.  The overgrown hedges include mature standard trees, large coppice stools and clumps of 
bramble and gorse scrub.  Species present include pedunculate oak, holly, birch, ash Fraxinus 
excelsior, hazel Corylus avellana and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. 
4.22 
Some of the fields on site have overgrown margins where the vegetation is less trampled and 
grazed along the fence line.  For example the northern boundary of the improved field to the north 
of the field marked TN3 has a ditch lined with purple moor-grass and gorse, and further east along 
this boundary fence bracken is frequent.  The western boundary of the field marked TN22 has 
purple moor-grass and heather growing along the fence.   
Water Courses 
4.23 
There are numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These are mostly ditches along 
field boundaries (TN22a, Photo 5a), but there is also some larger streams. The block of marshy 
grassland to the west is criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with marshy 
bases when visited in April.  There is also a stream that runs through this block of land – this is 
shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks.  Another stream (Photos 8, 9 
and 6a) runs south-east through the Survey Site and splits into smaller tributaries through the 
woodland at TN10. There are also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations.  All features that were 
visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet weather preceding the 
survey. Aquatic vegetation is not apparent in any of the water courses, but marginal vegetation 
includes frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse and bramble.   
Water Bodies 
4.24 
There are four water bodies within the Survey Site. The pond at TN15 (Pond17 – see 4.39) is 
approximately 10m in diameter, shallow, and completely covered in an unidentified sedge species.  
It has a small tree-covered island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small willow and alder trees.  
The surrounding vegetation is dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional heather and cross-
leaved heath plants, with densely growing small trees and scrub (grey willow, bramble and alder).  
A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This was not apparent amongst the 
scrub, but there were small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within purple moor 
grass in this area. 
4.25 
A small pond is present at TN19 (P18 – see 4.39) adjacent to an electricity pylon.  The pond is 
approximately circular and 5m in diameter.  It is in woodland and completely surrounded by small 
saplings.  There was no evidence of marginal or emergent aquatic vegetation when surveyed. 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
4.26 
Two ponds are also present immediately to the west of TN30a (Ponds 11 and 12).  Pond 12 is 
approximately 10m in diameter, open and unshaded with both aquatic and marginal vegetation 
present.  It appears to be an extension of two field drains that meet at this point.  Pond 11 is a 
small wet depression containing no vegetation. 
Invasive Species 
4.27 
Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica was noted on at least two locations on the block of land to 
the west of the road that runs through the site.  At Target Note 15a several stands of the species 
were noted on an embankment to a large raised area.  At Target Note 18a a stand of the species 
was noted on a bend in the stream. There are also several stands of this species growing on the 
edge of the road that leads into Abergelli Farm from the west. These extend just beyond the 
western site boundary and into the Survey Site. 
4.28 
Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera was also noted in two areas.  Abundant seedlings of the 
species were noted in the wooded copse at Target Note 23a and on an area of deciduous 
woodland at Target Note 28a.  
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
4.29 
This section presents the protected species records provided by SEWBReC along with any 
evidence of the species, or potential for it to be present gathered during the field survey.  Where 
relevant it also evaluates the potential for the Survey Site to support Section 42 species identified 
within the desk study area.  The legislation and policy relevant to each species or species group is 
described in Appendix 6. 
Bats 
4.30 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site in the records’ approximately 1 km to the 
south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.31 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule Nyctalus noctula, 
and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. There were also unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and records 
where the bat species was not specified. 
4.32 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.   
4.33 
There are a number of buildings associated with Abergelli Farm that fall within the Survey Site.  
These are all situated along the road that runs between the Water Treatment Works to the north of 
the Survey Site and Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations to the south.   Abergelli Farm consists of a rendered brick-built building (Photo 26) with 
a tiled pitched roof.  It has overhanging eaves with wooden soffits.  The associated stable block 
(Photo 27) is of the same construction with an ‘L’-shaped footprint.  Opportunities for roosting bats 
are fairly limited as the buildings appear to be in good condition, although gaps in the woodwork 
around the eaves would allow entry into the soffits. 
4.34 
At TN4 is a small concrete bunker (Photo 31) within an area of waste land.  It is formed of 2 m high 
brick walls with a flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south 
elevation and a 30 cm x 30 cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  This has some potential to 
support roosting bats. 
4.35 
Immediately to the north (Photo 29) and south (Photo 28) of Abergelli Farm are large barns 
constructed of corrugated metal and asbestos.  Potential for roosting bats in these buildings is low.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
13 
18/06/2014 
There are also two brick-built sheds with corrugated metal/asbestos pitched roofs (Photo 30) 
adjacent to the northern barn which may have greater potential to support bats, having some gaps 
in the brickwork that could allow entry in to the buildings. 
4.36 
Further south, to the south of TN25a, is a pair of houses set within plots of hard-standing and 
amenity grassland.  These are newly built and in good condition with no opportunities for roosting 
bats. 
4.37 
There are 21 trees on or within 50 m of the Survey Site that have the potential to support roosting 
bats.  Of these two have been classed as Category 1 (with definite suitable features that may 
support larger roosts of bats – see Table 1), and the remainder are Category 2 (with some limited 
roost features – see Table 1).  The locations of the trees (T1-21) are illustrated in Figures 2a and 
2b and full details of the trees are provided in Appendix 3.   
4.38 
The northern end of the Survey Site offers limited foraging and commuting potential for bats.  The 
boundaries are fences and short sections of remnant hedgerows and the fields are closely grazed.  
The block of marshy grassland, woodland and scrub to the west of the road that runs through the 
Survey Site, and the wooded stream that runs along the eastern boundary offer more potential, and 
both areas have good wooded connections with a network of hedgerows, tree-lines and marshy 
pastures off-site.  The damp wooded area around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electrical substations at the south-west end of the Survey Site also offers 
foraging potential and connects to off-site blocks of woodland to the north and south that may be 
good habitat for bats. 
4.39 
It is concluded that the Survey Site is likely to have moderate value for bats.  There are a few 
potential roosting opportunities, and some  areas (woodland and marshy grassland) of the Survey 
Site which offer foraging opportunities, but the Survey Site as a whole does not have good linear 
commuting features and the majority of the habitats (tightly grazed improved grassland) are of low 
foraging value. 
Great crested newt  
4.40 
There were no records for great crested newts provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey 
Site. 
4.41 
Nineteen ponds have been identified within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two were identified within the Survey Site boundary (Pond 
17 turned out to be a single pond when surveyed) and eight within 250 m of the Survey Site. An 
additional two on-site ponds (Ponds 11 and 12) were found during a reptile survey on 21 May 2014 
in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site that had not previously been seen 
during any other survey, as well as one within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first 
February Phase 1 survey (Pond 18). An HSI assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that 
were accessible within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit.  
This included the two on-site ponds (P17 and P18); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site 
boundary (P16); and the remainder are those ponds within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary for 
which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). Figures 2a and 2b shows which ponds were 
surveyed and which were inaccessible, either on private land or not accessible given the presence 
of horses8. 
4.42 
Table 4 below summarises the results of the HSI, and Appendix 4 gives more detailed results.

4.43 
The Survey Site lies in a part of the country where the distribution of great crested nested newts is 
patchy, with the species largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this might reduce the 
probability that great crested newts would be present on site, it does not rule out their presence.  
There are a number of ponds in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their 
terrestrial phase, including old hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey 
Site.  Those ponds surveyed, whilst most did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, do have 
potential to provide breeding habitat for great crested newts and the possible presence of the 
species on site should be considered further. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within 
the grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate). 
 
Dormouse 
4.44 
SEWBReC did not provide any records of dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius. The woodland 
areas on the eastern boundary, at the south-west end and within the marshy grassland in the 
north-west of the Survey Site do not provide optimum dormouse habitat although they are suitable 
for the species. Most of the woodland consists of relatively immature trees with little hazel 
understorey, limited foraging opportunities for this species and a lack of connectivity in the canopy. 
However, these areas of woodland have good connections to a complex of woodland and thick 
hedgerows to the west, south and east, and consequently could potentially form part of a wider 
network of dormouse-supporting habitat. There are a number of recent examples of dormouse 
occurring in sub-optimal habitat, such as coniferous plantation and species-poor hedges, in south 
and mid-Wales and their presence should not be ruled out if the habitat is sub-optimal but still has 
clear potential to support the species, as in this case. 
4.45 
Figures 2a and 2b illustrate which areas of the Survey Site have the highest potential to support 
dormouse. 
Otter 
4.46 
There are a number of water courses on site, most of which are ditches, but also a small stream 
running from north-west to south-east along the centre and eastern flank of the Survey Site and 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter 
within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 and 2013. The closest record to the 
Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west from the River Llan.  At its closest point the River Llan is 
approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, and it links to the Survey Site 
via the stream running through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  None of the water 
courses on site are likely to provide good foraging opportunities because of their size, but they may 
offer lying up sites for otter, and it is possible that individuals might use the water courses to 
commute along from time to time. 
Water Vole 
4.47 
No evidence of water voles was noted along the water courses on site when surveyed in February 
and April, although February is a time of low activity for the species, when field signs may not be 
evident.  The water courses that were visited in February all had flowing water in them when 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
15 
18/06/2014 
surveyed, following a prolonged period of extremely wet weather during the winter.  It is likely that 
many of these are usually dry or hold only a small amount of water and this was confirmed during 
the April survey. As such they do not provide good habitat for water voles. The stream that runs 
along the eastern boundary of the site; however, does provide suitable habitat for water vole, 
particularly at TN41-43. At TN43, a number of vole tunnels and holes were seen along the western 
side of the bank in long tussocks of grass, although it was not possible to ascertain which species 
had made them.   
4.48 
Water voles have been present in the vicinity: SEWBReC provided three records of water vole from 
the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River is 
hydrologically linked to the Survey Site (see otter section above), so it is possible, if any of the 
water courses retain water, particularly those linked to the River Llan, that water voles could be 
present on site.  
Reptiles 
4.49 
There were 12 records of reptiles provided by SEWBReC, between 1998 and 2010. These 
included records of all the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara, and slow worm Anguis fragilis. The closest record is of a common 
lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the 
south-west side of tinplate workings near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the 
southwest of the Survey Site boundary. 
4.50 
There are several areas of the Survey Site that provide suitable habitat for common reptile species 
(see Figures 2a and 2b).  This includes areas of marshy grassland to the south of the Survey Site, 
mounds of wood to the south of the woodland at TN10 (Photo 11), scrubby woodland fringes 
(Photo 12) and overgrown field margins either along remnant hedge banks or ditch banks. In 
addition a common lizard was seen during the April Phase 1 survey in the marshy grassland area 
in the north-west of the site and this area is particularly suitable for reptiles providing high quality 
habitat for foraging, sheltering and basking. 
Badger 
4.51 
Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
Birds 
4.52 
During the Phase 1 survey a number of common woodland and farmland bird species were 
recorded and these are listed in Appendix 5. The trees and woodland on site may provide nesting 
habitat for a range of common bird species.  The marshy grassland on site could also provide 
nesting habitat for ground-nesting bird species. The Survey Site does not appear to be of particular 
importance for wintering birds with no notable aggregations of common species or any rarer 
species recorded during the walkover survey, except for a red kite Milvus milvus seen in flight over 
the Survey Site (see below) in both February and April.  
4.53 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata, northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus and 
skylark Alauda arvensis. The closest of these records are located at the tinplate workings site near 
to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site boundary.  There 
was one record of curlew, located at the Lliw reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
 
Schedule 1 Birds 
4.54 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl Tyto alba. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the 
west of the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south 
west near Penllergaer Woods in 2000.  It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the 
Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, although no trees were found that appear, from a 
ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy 
fields at the southern end of the Survey Site, although probably sub-optimal, could provide habitat 
for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) given the thick, tussocky structure of 
some parts of the sward. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site provides 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
16 
18/06/2014 
optimal foraging habitat for barn owls due to its extensive areas of tussocky grassland that may 
support breeding field voles Microtus agrestis, their preferred prey species. 
4.55 
A red kite was noted circling above the field at TN3 and also over Abergelli Farm.  Red kites 
generally breed in valley woodlands of which there is extensive habitat to 2-3 km to the east and 
west of the Survey Site.  It is considered likely that the Survey Site is part of a much wider area of 
potential foraging habitat for the species. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red kite between 1999 
and 2013. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 terrestrial invertebrate species. The species 
recorded are marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth 
Hemaris tityus, and small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty-nine of the records are of 
marsh fritillary; the closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site 
boundary in 2009. This location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well 
as the closest of the five small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee 
hawk-moth record. 
4.2 
The marshy grassland to the west provides suitable habitat for marsh fritillaries, although the food 
plant devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis was not noted in any quantity during the April survey.  
Of the other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for 
narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus, which largely relies on devil’s bit scabious, like 
marsh fritillary. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers to 
bask and no areas where its usual food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is found in any 
quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola spp.) as its foodplant and violets 
have not been recorded during either Phase 1 survey (the April survey was well timed to record 
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species is present.  
4.3 
Other habitats that may be suitable for diverse assemblages of terrestrial invertebrates include the 
areas of broad-leaved ancient woodland at Target Note 10, for example, which represents a fairly 
extensive area of semi-natural habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates, 
particularly Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera); which are both strongly 
represented in wooded habitats.   
Aquatic Invertebrates 
4.4 
No records of Section 42 aquatic invertebrate species were provided by SEWBReC, and it is 
unlikely that any of the ponds on or close to the site support unusual or diverse assemblages of 
aquatic invertebrates.

Recommendations 
5.1 
For the purposes of this report it has been assumed at this stage that direct impacts will potentially 
occur across the Survey Site, and that indirect impacts will need to be considered beyond this, 
within the ‘zone of influence’ that will vary dependent on the receptor (habitat, protected species, 
designated site) concerned.  The recommendations presented below are based on preliminary 
assumptions of the potential impacts and the corresponding requirement to confirm presence / 
absence, and where present the distribution and abundance of protected and otherwise notable 
species or habitats that may occur within the Survey Site and a zone of influence surrounding it. 
Statutory Designated Sites  
5.2 
Nant Y Crimp SSSI, Penplas Grasslands SSSI and Cadle Heath LNR are located within 5 km of the 
Survey Site boundary. These sites are designated for their habitat interest and as all are over 2 km 
from the Survey Site, direct impacts resulting from the development are considered unlikely.  Nant 
Y Crimp SSSI also has a colony of marsh fritillary butterflies. The larval food plant (devil’s-bit 
scabious) for this species was found in small patches in the western area of marshy grassland 
during the Phase 1 survey, so this species may be present.  However this assessment will need to 
be reviewed once a botanical survey (see below) of the western block of marshy grassland has 
been carried out.  
 
Habitat Regulations Assessment 
5.3 
Consultation with the Planning Authority, Natural Resources Wales and PINS will determine the 
requirement for a screening exercise (under the Habitat Regulations) that considers the proximity 
of potentially sensitive ecological receptors (notably European protected sites, but potentially 
extended to SSSIs) within a search area that may extend to or beyond a 5 km radius of the Survey 
Site (for example, Camarthen Bay and Estuary SAC, Crymlyn Bog SAC, SPA and Ramsar, and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar all lie within 10 km of the Survey Site), and whether these could be 
affected by CO, NOX and NO2 emissions as well as nitrogen and acid deposition. 
5.4 
The requirement for further surveys or desk based investigation will be determined following review 
of the scoping opinion (and consultation) on this matter. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites  
5.5 
Three SINCs lie partially within the site boundary and could therefore be directly affected by the 
proposed development.  Indirect impacts could also potentially occur on those sites lying adjacent 
or close to the boundary.   
5.6 
The woodland on site that falls within Llety-Morfil SINC and the southern part of Waun Garn Wen 
SINC is also designated as Ancient Woodland and as such is irreplaceable.  Direct impacts on this 
resource may therefore also occur as a result of the proposals. 
Habitats 
5.7 
The marshy grasslands within the Survey Site potentially qualify as a Section 42 habitat ‘purple 
moor-grass and rush pastures’.  The area to the west of Abergelli Farm is also a SINC.  These 
habitats require a NVC botanical survey at an appropriate time of year (June/July) to establish their 
ecological value and inform the level of mitigation required to compensate if they are to be lost or 
modified as a consequence of the Project. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the site is 
potentially of high ecological value, and this needs to be confirmed through botanical and other 
Phase 2 survey work.  The semi-improved grasslands in the north-east corner of the site, whilst not 
having obvious high botanical value, are included within a larger SINC.  As such it is recommended 
that a botanical survey is carried out on these areas to establish their value in the wider context of 
the SINC, and therefore the likely mitigation that would be required for their loss. 
5.8 
‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ is also a Section 42 habitat. The woodland on site all falls 
into this category and the majority of the resource also falls within a SINC and is designated as 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
18 
18/06/2014 
Ancient Woodland.  A botanical survey of these areas in spring/early summer when the ground 
flora is in evidence would allow an evaluation of their ecological value to be made.  
5.9 
There are no other habitats on site of high intrinsic ecological value.  The improved grassland 
habitat is common and widespread in south Wales and of minimal ecological value. In addition, all 
(bar one species poor example) of the hedgerows on the Survey Site are defunct. 
Invasive species 
5.10 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam have both been noted on the Survey Site.  It is 
recommended that a walkover survey of the Survey Site is carried out once access is available to 
all areas, including the proposed access route to map all locations where these species are 
growing.  This should be done within the period June - July when both species are most in 
evidence.  
5.11 
If work is to take place in any areas where these species are present, a Management Plan will 
need to be drawn up detailing the methods that will be used to remove these species under 
controlled conditions as detailed by the Environment Agency (The Knotweed Code of Practice 
2003 and guidance on Environment Agency website). 
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
Bats 
Trees and Buildings 
5.12 
Twenty one trees within the Survey Site have been identified as having potential to support 
roosting bats.  If these trees are to be removed or modified, it is recommended that a roped-access 
tree survey is carried out in order to confirm whether any of the features initially identified support 
roosting bats or have the potential to do so.  Where the potential for bats to roost in the tree is 
confirmed then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey may need to be carried out to 
confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the status of any roost present. If a bat roost 
is confirmed, either through emergence/re-entry survey or through roped-access survey a 
European Protected Species (EPS) Licence is likely to be required before the tree can be felled.  
5.13 
It is recommended that all buildings to be directly or indirectly affected by the Project (if any) should 
be inspected for signs of roosting bats and features with the potential to support roosting bats, 
where access allows. 
5.14 
If signs of roosting bats or features with the potential to be used by roosting bats are identified 
during these inspection surveys, further survey in the form of dusk emergence/ dawn re-entry 
surveys may be required. The level of survey effort required will depend on the potential that the 
building or tree has been assigned in these initial inspection surveys. These further surveys (if 
required) should be undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance (Hundt, 2012) at 
a time of year when breeding roosts may be present (i.e. between mid-May and mid-August). 
Activity Survey 
5.15 
The areas of marshy grassland, woodland and streams on site potentially provide good foraging 
habitat for bats.  It is recommended that bat activity surveys are carried out in order to inform an 
assessment of the Survey Site’s value for bats and to guide the evolution of the Project and 
mitigation accordingly.  Following the guidance provided in Hundt (2012), this would involve two 
walked transect routes (given the size of the Survey Site) carried out monthly between April and 
October, as specified in the guidelines.  An automated survey using four static bat detectors (two 
per transect route) recording for at least three nights would also be carried out. Rather than 
deploying detectors at four locations every month, it is recommended that surveys are carried out 
at four locations for three months and another four locations for the other four months so that half 
the locations would be surveyed in April, June, August and October and the other four in May, July 
and September. This would increase the spatial coverage of the Survey Site but ensure that 
sampling was undertaken at each location in spring, summer and autumn to allow a robust 
seasonal comparison to be made.

Great Crested Newt 
5.16 
The presence of four ponds on site with several more in the vicinity of the Survey Site, and the 
occurrence of suitable terrestrial habitat on site indicate that great crested newts could potentially 
be using the Survey Site. This should be established through further targeted survey work. 
5.17 
Section 5.4 of the GCN Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001) recommends that: 
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
5.18 
Natural England guidance(2001) is further developed in the GCN Method Statement which states 
that:  
‘The decision on whether to survey depends primarily on how likely it is that the development would 
affect newts using those ponds. For developments resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss 
at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, carefully consider whether a survey is 
appropriate.…. normally appropriate only when all of the following conditions are met: 
1. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population,  
2. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority available 
locally,  
3. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
4. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
5.19 
The second piece of guidance, which supersedes the first, specifies that all four conditions should 
be met for surveys to be required of ponds beyond 250m of the Survey Site boundary.  In this case, 
condition 1. is not met as there is no indication from desk study data or the HSI assessment that 
any of the ponds is likely to support a large population of GCN or that they provide particularly 
suitable habitat (condition 2.) with no ponds within 250m of the Survey Site recording better than an 
‘average’ score on the HSI assessment.  
5.20 
As a consequence, it is recommended that all ponds within 250m (not 250-500m) would need to be 
further surveyed. This would initially involve four surveys within the period mid-March to mid-June 
to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during mid-April to mid-May), with an 
additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population size if newts are found during 
the first four surveys.   
 
Dormouse 
5.21 
If the woodland on the Survey Site is to be removed, damaged or significantly modified, it is 
recommended that dormouse surveys are carried out with the aim of establishing whether the 
species is present on site, and therefore whether a EPS Licence will be required before woodland 
can be cleared or significantly modified. It is recommended undertaking a dormouse survey, 
following methods based on those prescribed in best practice guidance (Bright et al. 2006). The 
surveys will involve the use of dormouse boxes in areas of woodland and nest tubes in cluttered 
environments where boxes cannot be used. The survey will be designed to detect the presence or 
absence of dormice rather than to provide an abundance estimate or monitor a population of the 
species. Surveys would be carried out monthly during April-November. 
 
Otter and Water Vole 
5.22 
Otter usage of the Survey Site is likely to be occasional although there are suitable resting/lying up 
places present along the eastern stream corridor within the Survey Site.  Mitigation measures to 
avoid potential killing or injury to individuals during the construction and decommissioning phases 
should be considered, for example covering open workings overnight.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
5.23 
A survey for water voles along the banks of the water courses on site should be carried out as a 
precautionary measure to establish whether the species is likely to be present on site and to design 
mitigation accordingly.  This would involve one visit and should be carried out ideally in spring 
when field signs are likely to be most in evidence but the vegetation has not grown up to obscure 
them. It will also be possible to carry out additional checks for signs of otter at the same time as the 
water vole survey, for completeness. The survey would be carried out in accordance with best 
practice guidelines (Chanin (2003) and Strachan et al., (2011), respectively). 
 
Reptiles 
5.24 
A reptile survey should be carried out on the Survey Site to establish the presence/absence of 
reptiles, the species present and the approximate population size. The survey will be conducted 
using artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of 
their distribution and abundance, following good practice guidance, including that set out in the 
Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance (Froglife, 
1999). This requires a minimum of seven visits conducted at an appropriate time of year (either 
spring/early summer and/or late summer/early autumn) during suitable weather conditions. 
 
Badger 
5.25 
 Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
 
Breeding Birds 
5.26 
Breeding bird surveys of the Survey Site should be carried out with the aim of establishing the 
ecological value of the breeding bird population and to inform mitigation measures. Farmland birds 
(occurring both within the Survey Site and a buffer of up to 50m) would be the main target of the 
survey. Territory mapping surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s Common Bird 
Census (CBC) methodology will be undertaken.  These would be conducted on three occasions 
during the breeding season.  It is recommended that an initial visit is carried out in mid-April, 
followed by additional visits in May and June. 
5.27 
The Phase 1 survey was partly conducted in winter with an experienced ornithologist (Matt Hobbs) 
part of the survey team. As there was no evidence of notable aggregations of common species or 
habitat that may support rarer species it is considered that there is no justification for carrying out 
targeted wintering bird surveys.  
Barn owls 
5.28 
It is recommended that all buildings and mature trees on site to be directly or indirectly affected by 
the Project (if any) should be inspected for signs of roosting or nesting. Signs to be searched for 
include: nest debris, barn owl pellets, white splashes from barn owl droppings and live or dead barn 
owls themselves (Barn Owl Trust, 2012). Barn owl roost inspections can be conducted all year 
round. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
5.29 
The block of marshy grassland to the west, provides potential habitat for marsh fritillary butterflies 
due to the presence of their food plant, devil’s-bit scabious. As such a survey of adults during late 
May/June and also the larval webs should be carried out in mid-August to mid-September. Both 
surveys would involve walking transects over the marshy grassland, the former noting adult marsh 
fritillary butterflies and the latter checking all patches of the food plant for larval webs and larvae 
and following standard methods9. 
5.30 
The woodland at Target Note 10, for example represents a fairly extensive area of semi-natural 
habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates; which are both strongly represented in 
wooded habitats.  If the woodland at TN10 is to be affected by the Project it is proposed that further 
survey will be appropriate that targets both Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera).

Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
21 
18/06/2014 
A moth survey should also be undertaken of the marshy grassland area in the north-west of the 
site. 
5.31 
Survey of Lepidoptera should involve two night-time moth surveys to be undertaken in late spring 
and mid-summer. Trapping using Skinner or Robinson moth traps fitted with mercury vapour bulbs 
is most suitable in terms of attracting an extensive and variable moth fauna. Lights should be 
switched on at dusk and remain lit until dawn the following day.  The traps should be checked 
periodically throughout the night to log any new arrivals.  Any species hard to identify from external 
markings alone, and those requiring further confirmation, should be retained and dissected if 
necessary to ascertain their identity with the use of a stereoscopic microscope. 
5.32 
For beetles, a method should be developed that follows Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et 
al., 2007) to sample beetle assemblages directed at woodland habitats, via hand searches, sweep 
netting and pitfall trapping. To align with the Lepidoptera surveys, this can be undertaken in late 
spring/early summer and mid/late summer/early autumn. Subsequent laboratory identification will 
be required for many of the specimens collected. 
5.33 
Analysis of the results should use the ISIS protocol to determine whether any broad or specialist 
assemblage types of Lepidoptera and / or Coleoptera are present. Consideration should also be 
given to any rare, scarce or nationally threatened species present, including Section 42 species.  
Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.34 
On the assumption that watercourses will be affected by the Project, it may be appropriate to 
undertake an assessment of water quality, compliant with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). A 
main aim of the WFD is to prevent deterioration in the status of aquatic ecosystems, protect them 
and improve the ecological condition of waters. The requirement for such an assessment would be 
driven in consultation with Natural Resources Wales. Should such an assessment be required it 
may be appropriate to assess the ecological quality and surface water chemistry of watercourses to 
be affected. 
5.35 
To determine ecological quality kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates should be undertaken at 
selected locations along the ditch / stream, and the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) 
score applied to inform an assessment of water quality and species present. This survey is best 
undertaken in spring or autumn in swift flowing waters, or in summer in stationary ditches or those 
with a slow flow. All macro-invertebrates should be identified to species level in order to determine 
the presence of any scarce or nationally notable species. 
5.36 
To determine water chemistry status a single water sample should be extracted at three locations; 
within the Survey Site and upstream and downstream of this. Samples should be dispatched to a 
UKAS accredited laboratory for subsequent analysis, to cover a standard range of parameters 
including: Biological Dissolved Oxygen, Total Suspended Solids, nutrient composition (e.g. nitrite 
as nitrogen, total oxidised nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorus), hardness, 
calcium, alkalinity, conductivity and pH. 
5.37 
The condition of the watercourse can subsequently be analysed by recording and comparing the 
aggregated number of taxa, and average score per taxon from the sampling points along the 
watercourse within, upstream and downstream from the Survey Site. The statistical model (RICT) 
developed for WFD classification would be used to calculate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) 
that compares observed with expected results for a watercourse of the same type. The EQR is 
then used to identify the Biological Status of the watercourse which is separated into five bands 
(Bad to High) required by the WFD. 
5.38 
It may also be necessary to undertake invertebrate surveys of any ponds that are likely to be 
affected by the development proposals. These are likely to involve surveys of aquatic beetles in 
June and August 
Un-surveyed Land 
5.39 
There are a number of small parcels of land that have not yet been surveyed in the southern part of 
the site. These are indicated on Figure 1b and will be surveyed once access has been arranged. 
The Phase 1 report will be updated once these surveys are complete.

Appendix 1: Target Notes 
February Survey 
1. A spring running into a wet ditch.  The ditch has a muddy base with sweet-grass Glyceria sp. and soft rush 
the dominant plant species.  Frog spawn was present. 
2. A wet ditch fenced on either side.  The ditch meets a spring which runs into it flowing southwards.  The 
ditch has steeply sloping grassy banks, is open and unshaded with great willow herb Epilobium hirstum and 
soft rush present.  A newly planted hedge runs along the south side – gapping up a defunct hedge.  Also, 
occasional large coppices of holly were recorded. 
3. Marshy grassland with abundant soft rush.   The sward is grazed very short by horses. Frequent patches 
of sedge species were recorded including common sedge and glaucous sedge.  Other species noted include 
sharp-flowered rush and/or jointed rush (difficult to separate in winter and when closely grazed), cinquefoil 
species, daisy and creeping bent.   
4. A small concrete bunker with wasteland area.  The concrete bunker is formed of 2m high brick walls with a 
flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south elevation and a 30cm x 
30cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  No evidence of bats was recorded. The surrounding land is 
compacted course aggregate which is becoming colonised with common grassland species.  There is an 
earth bund around the south-east and north-east boundary, topped with dense bramble and gorse scrub. 
5. An area of marshy grassland which is very closely grazed.  Occasional heather and bilberry plants and 
patches of sphagnum moss were recorded. Purple moor grass is frequent and forms dominant tussocks at 
the north end of the field.  Other species include sheep’s fescue and a sedge species.   
6. An area of marshy grassland dominated by soft rush.  The field was not entered as it is outside the 
ownership boundary, but inspection from the roadside suggests that rushes are interspersed with 
agriculturally improved grassland. 
7. A wet ditch running through the middle of the field containing fast flowing water with orange discolouration. 
The ditch is overgrown with bramble and joins another ditch on its eastern boundary, which is lined with 
purple moor grass, greater willowherb, and soft rush.  The surrounding field is agriculturally improved with 
patches of soft rush. 
8. A derelict stone farmhouse with only the bottom halves of walls still present.  Patches of rubble and 
overgrown vegetation are present, which may provide good habitat for reptiles. 
9. A stream lined with trees, which is fast-flowing with a stony substrate. 
10. An area of broadleaved woodland.  The western end is on a hill, which slopes steeply down to the east.  
This end (delineated by a stream running north-south) is dry with widely spaced trees and a grazed 
grassland ground flora (Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear, and creeping buttercup were the most prominent 
species) and very little understorey was noted.  The eastern end is much wetter, with carpets of opposite-
leaved golden-saxifrage, extensive areas of purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with some sphagnum 
moss species.  The understorey is thicker here and is predominantly bramble.   Tree species include birch, 
crab-apple, holly and pedunculate oak.  Most specimens are small-medium in size. 
11 and 12. These Target Notes relate to evidence of badger activity and are provided in a confidential 
version of this report. They are also omitted from Figures. 
13. A ditch along a line of small-medium trees (beech, holly, pedunculate oak) and a fence. Bilberry is 
growing along the fence. 
14. A marshy grassland field with abundant soft rush tussocks.  The area indicated by this target note is 
dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional cross-leaved heath and scattered small trees/scrub.  
15. A shallow pond (less than 10cm deep), approximately 10m in diameter, completely covered in a sedge 
species (only dead leaves were evident so identification was not possible) and with a small tree-covered 
island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small trees.  The surrounding vegetation includes purple moor-
grass with occasional heather and cross-leaved heath and densely growing small trees and scrub (willow 
species, bramble and alder.  A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This consisted of 
small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within marshy (rushes, purple moor grass) vegetation. 
16.  A strip of land around the gas station, which is higher than the surrounding land.  There is a gravel strip 
immediately surrounding the boundary fence then a steep slope covered in soft-rush dominated grassland.  
At the base of the slope is a mosaic of marshy rush-dominated grassland with dense bramble scrub and wet

woodland.  The woodland consists of closely spaced, small and straggly trees composed largely of holly, 
pedunculate oak, birch, willow and alder.     
17. A patch of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  Small patch of bulrush were found 
towards centre of field.  The field is surrounded by encroaching scrub and straggly woodland. 
18.  An area of wet woodland with dense bramble understorey.  The species present and structure are as for 
Target Note 16.  Wet underfoot. 
19. A small pond within woodland fed by a stream.  No emergent/marginal vegetation was in evidence and 
the pond is surrounded by small saplings. 
20. Marshy grassland fields consisting of more than 25% soft rush.  The intervening grassland is 
agriculturally improved, including perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, common mouse-ear and white clover 
Trifolium repens.   
21. An area of marshy grassland with approximately 75% soft rush cover. The intervening grassland is semi-
improved. 
22. An area of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  The western boundary fence has 
heather and purple moor-grass growing along it.

Appendix 6: Summaries of Relevant Legislation, Policy and Other 
Instruments 
National Planning Policy  
6.2 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 5 provides Welsh Assembly Government advice about how the land 
use planning system in Wales should contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and 
geological conservation.   
6.3 
It follows that the TAN provides guidance to local planning authorities on: the key principles of 
positive planning for nature conservation; nature conservation and Local Development Plans; 
nature conservation in development management procedures; development affecting protected 
internationally and nationally designated sites and habitats; and, development affecting protected 
and priority habitats and species. 
6.4 
Planning considerations with regard to habitats and species are of greatest relevance to the 
Abergelli Farm proposal.  For a full account, the TAN should be referred to, but some of the key 
principles are summarised as follows: 
i. 
When dealing with cases where a European protected species of plant or animal may be affected, 
a local planning authority needs to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive in the 
exercise of its functions. 
ii. 
The TAN refers to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which makes it an offence 
(with certain limited exceptions and in the absence of a licence) to intentionally to kill, injure or take 
any wild bird, or to damage, take or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is being built or 
in use, or to take or destroy its eggs.  Further offences apply to species listed under Schedule 1 of 
the Act. 
iii. 
The above Act also affords protection to wild animals of the species listed in Schedule 5, and to 
wild plants listed in Schedule 8, most of which are not European protected species.  Actions that 
are likely to result in an offence are identified; 
iv. 
With regard to badger, Meles meles, the TAN refers to the provisions of the Protection of Badgers 
Act, 1992; 
v. 
The TAN makes reference to Sections 40 and 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006, which place a duty on the Welsh Assembly Government to have regard to 
the purpose of conserving biodiversity (see Section 1.10 of this report); 
vi. 
In section 2.4 it is noted that when deciding planning applications that may affect nature 
conservation, local planning authorities should protect wildlife and natural features in the wider 
environment, with appropriate weight attached to priority habitats and species in Biodiversity Action 
Plans; 
vii. 
When determining planning applications, planning authorities should ensure that all material 
considerations are taken into account, that decisions are informed by adequate information about 
the potential effects of development on nature conservation, and that the range and population of 
protected species is sustained; 
viii. 
Planning applications should demonstrate a step-wise approach to avoid harm to nature 
conservation, minimise unavoidable harm by mitigation measures, offset residual harm by 
compensation measures and look for new opportunities to enhance nature conservation. 
UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework 
6.5 
The Environment Departments of all four governments in the UK work together through the Four 
Countries Biodiversity Group.  Together they have agreed, and Ministers have signed, a framework 
of priorities for UK-level work for the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Published on 17 July 
2012, the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework' covers the period from 2011 to 2020.

6.6 
Most work which was previously carried out under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) is now 
focussed in the four countries of the UK through the new framework.  The UK BAP partnership no 
longer operates but includes detailed Action Plans for priority habitats and species, which are still in 
use and of relevance. The list of priority habitats and species included within the UK BAP list is 
equivalent to the list of Section 42 habitats and species.  
6.7 
The UK BAP is supported by a series of Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAPs), usually set up on 
a local authority administrative boundary basis. Each LBAP identifies those habitats and species 
considered to be most important in that area (usually referred to as priority habitats and species). 
Commonly, an LBAP will identify a number of habitats and species for which “action plans” have 
been prepared. The Swansea LBAP is was created in 2005 but is unavailable as it is under review. 
Wildlife Legislation 
6.8 
Legislation of most relevance to this assessment includes the following: 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006  
6.9 
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty 
which public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public 
authority must, in exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper 
exercise of those functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority 
includes local authorities and local planning authorities. 
6.10 
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living 
organism or type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”. 
6.11 
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the 
living organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal 
importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list 
that was found in Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act). 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way 
Act 2000) 
Protection afforded to birds 
6.12 
Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) prohibits the intentional killing, injuring or 
taking of any wild bird and the taking, damaging or destroying of the nest (whilst being built or in 
use) or eggs.  Section 1 also prohibits disturbing any bird listed on Schedule 1 of the Act whilst at 
or near the nest and prohibits disturbing the dependent young of such birds. 
Protection afforded to other animals 
6.13 
Species listed on Schedule 5 that may be of relevance to this site include GCNs, bats, otter, water 
vole and all species of reptiles.  The places of shelter used by otter and water vole are protected, 
but reptiles are protected from killing and injury only. 
Protection afforded to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
6.14 
Section 28 allows for the creation of SSSIs by the government (through Natural Resources Wales 
in Wales) where Natural Resources Wales (NRW) “is of the opinion that any area of land is of 
special interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features.” 
6.15 
Section 28G specifies the duty of specific public authorities (including local authorities) to further 
the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is designated and 
also to notify NRW of operations likely to damage such features in order that NRW may consent to 
or refuse permission for such operations.

The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
6.16 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species (Amendment) Regulations 2012 consolidates the 
various amendments that have been made to the Regulations. The original (1994) Regulations 
transposed the EC Habitats Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) into national law. 
6.17 
“European protected species” (EPS) are those which are present on Schedule 2 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. They are subject to the provisions of 
Regulation 41 of those Regulations. All EPS are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended). Taken together, these pieces of legislation make it an offence to: 
a) Intentionally or deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal included amongst these 
species; 
b) Possess or control any live or dead specimens or any part of, or anything derived from a these 
species; 
c) Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species; 
d) Deliberately take or destroy the eggs of such an animal; or 
e) Intentionally, deliberately or recklessly damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of 
such an animal, or obstruct access to such a place. 
6.18 
For the purposes of paragraph (c), disturbance of animals includes in particular any disturbance 
which is likely— 
a) to impair their ability— 
I. 
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
II. 
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or migrate; or 
6.19 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which they belong. 
6.20 
Although the law provides strict protection to these species, it also allows this protection to be set 
aside (derogated) through the issuing of licences. The licences in England are currently determined 
by NE for development works. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulations (2012), a 
licence can only be issued where the following requirements are satisfied: 
a) The proposal is necessary ‘to preserve public health or public safety or other imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature and 
beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment’; 
b) ‘There is no satisfactory alternative’; and 
c) The proposals ‘will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species 
concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range’. 
6.21 
EPS that may be relevant to this proposal include GCNs, bats, dormouse and otter. 
Invasive Species Legislation 
6.22 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are both listed on Part 2, Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  Section 14 of the Act states that it is an offence for a 
person to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any species listed on Part2, Schedule 9.  The 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 contains a number of legal provisions concerning ‘controlled 
waste’.  Any soil or plant material contaminated with Japanese knotweed that is to be discarded is 
classified as controlled waste.
