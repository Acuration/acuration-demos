Introduction 
The ‘Biomass Carbon Calculator’ is a greenhouse gas (GHG) lifecycle emission tool developed by Drax for 
the purpose of calculating wood pellet supply chain GHG emissions in accordance with UK and EU 
regulatory requirements. The Calculator has been independently verified against the Renewables 
Obligation Order 2015 for England and Wales (as amended)1 and Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy 
from renewable sources (“Directive (EU) 2018/2001”) 2. Verification statements are available on the 
Drax website. 
The Biomass Carbon Calculator has been developed by Drax to encourage improved reporting of 
lifecycle biomass emissions across industry by requiring users to use actual data from across the supply 
chain, thus reducing reliance on use of default values or typical data. The Calculator further provides a 
convenient platform for modelling complex supply chains, enabling the GHG emissions of up to 20 
different biomass consignments and 10 different downstream distribution routes to be modelled 
simultaneously for a single biomass producer. The Calculator has several other notable benefits: 
• All equations can be viewed by the user, providing absolute transparency 
• Data input fields have a corresponding verification field, providing a platform suited for third-
party auditing 
• The Calculator structure is aligned to the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) audit report on 
energy and carbon data (SAR) for wood pellets version 2.0, providing a simple means of 
transferring supply chain information where the user is, or is utilising data from, an SBP-
certified party 
The Calculator is appropriate for modelling supply chain GHG emissions for most wood pellet supply 
chains, including wood pellet from forestry products, forestry residues, industrial processing residues 
and wood waste. For wood pellet supply chains derived from products, where land inputs such as 
fertilisers and pesticides are required (e.g. wood pellet from energy crops) or where land use change has

occurred, the calculator must be used alongside other tools (e.g. Biograce II3; The UK Solid and Gaseous 
Biomass Carbon Calculator4) for determining full supply chain emissions. 
The Calculator covers GHG emissions (CO2, CH4 & N2O emissions) arising from all aspects of typical wood 
pellet supply chains including feedstock cultivation & harvesting, feedstock transport, feedstock 
processing, biomass transport & distribution and final use of the biomass.

Calculator methodology 
Calculation structure and alignment to the 
Renewables Obligation methodology 
Definition of supply chain 
The calculator is structured to represent the supply chain activities of typical wood pellet supply chains, 
comprising the activities represented below: 
 
All upstream processing of feedstock is considered within a single module to reduce complexity of the 
calculator. This necessitates that energy requirements for cultivation, harvesting, extraction and other 
upstream emissions are stated per MJ of feedstock as delivered to the processing plant5.  
While drying and pelleting (and all other pellet plant energy demands) are considered under the 
‘processing’ module, feedstock consignments often require different amounts of energy for drying, 
depending on the initial moisture content of the feedstock. The calculator therefore separates the 
 
5 All reference values for diesel use in cultivation, harvesting, extraction and chipping used by the JRC in its policy report 
‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG emissions’ Version 2 provide diesel emissions in this way, 
assuming wood chip to be the output product from the forest. These values are provided in the calculator and can be used by 
users in the absence of actual data.

calculations for drying emissions from pelleting and other site processes, as outlined in the “Allocation 
of drying heat emissions” Section. 
It is also possible that consignments may require different amounts of other site energy such as 
electricity or diesel due to differing processing requirements at the pellet plant (e.g. 
chipping/debarking). However, rarely is this information metered/recorded at a sufficiently 
disaggregated level to allow allocation of these inputs to individual consignments. Equally, the energy 
demands for these processes are usually small when compared to those for drying (where allocation is 
performed) and pelleting (which is necessary for all consignments).  Emissions relating to all pellet plant 
processes other than drying are therefore applied proportionally across the entire pellet output of the 
plant. 
Identify the output of each module 
The outputs of each module are defined as follows: 
MODULE 
OUTPUT 
PROCESSING AT ORIGIN 
Raw biomass feedstock (e.g. logs, wood 
chips, sawdust); gate of origin 
FEEDSTOCK TRANSPORT 
Raw biomass feedstock (e.g. logs, wood 
chips, sawdust); delivered to pellet mill 
PROCESSING 
Wood pellet; pellet plant gate 
PELLET TRANSPORT 
Wood pellet; delivered to generator 
FUEL IN USE

Identify the inputs of each module 
The inputs that could influence the final carbon intensity of the biomass by 1% or more are defined as 
follows: 
MODULE 
INPUT 
PROCESSING AT ORIGIN 
Diesel used in cultivation, harvesting, 
extraction and chipping 
FEEDSTOCK TRANSPORT 
Fuel used in feedstock transport

Chemicals and binders 
PELLET TRANSPORT 
Fuel used in pellet transport to port; 
Fuel used in shipping; 
Fuel used in pellet transport to generator 
Electricity used for pellet handling; 
Fuel used for pellet handling; 
FUEL IN USE 
Combustion non-CO2 emissions 
 
Emissions relating to fertilisers, pesticides and land use change are also likely to contribute more than 
1% of biomass lifecycle emissions where they are applicable. However, as these inputs are largely 
irrelevant for most wood pellet supply chains, they be calculated separately in instances where they 
apply and included in the “Other upstream emissions” field (See Upstream Section for further details). 
Identify appropriate emission factors 
Emission factors for the model are taken from credible resources approved by the EU. In the first 
instance, emission factors are taken from ‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG

emissions’ Version 26. Additional factors not available in the report are taken from Biograce II, Biograce 
additional standard values7 and the UK Solid and Gaseous Biomass Carbon calculator V2.0 (Build 36)8. 
Emission factors for biomass fuels diverted from feedstock input groups are derived from the total 
upstream emissions (in gCO2eq/tdry matter) for the relative feedstock consignment.  
Multiply inputs by emissions factors 
All inputs to the pellet process are required on an absolute basis for the reporting year, to allow for 
simple verification against operator system records (e.g. metering data, weighbridge tickets).Emissions 
are calculated on an absolute basis (i.e. total kgCO2eq for the reporting period) by multiplying the input 
by the total pellet output and its emission factor, as follows: 
𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) =
𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) ×  𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 (𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡
)
1,000
 
Where supply chain activities also result in production of CH4 or N2O combustion emissions (e.g. 
transport or fuel systems), emissions are calculated in accordance with the equation below: 
𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞)
=
𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) × 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 (𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡
) + 𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) × 𝐶𝐻4 & 𝑁2𝑂 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡
) 
1,000
 
Accounting for co-products in conversion modules 
Wood pellet supply chains rarely produce co-products after the initial harvest. Therefore, the calculator 
does not support co-product allocation.

Identify the efficiency of modules 
To provide alignment with EU Commission recommendations9 and the Directive (EU) 2018/200110, 
‘Feedstock factors’ are used for determining supply chain efficiencies instead of ‘module efficiencies’. 
Feedstock factors are the inverse of efficiencies and equal to: 
𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 𝑀𝐽 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡
𝑀𝐽 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 
Total energy contents for each consignment’s inputs and outputs are calculated on a dry mass basis, in 
line with the Commission recommendations. To allocate the output pellet energy to each input 
consignment, the following set of equations are used11: 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑀𝐽) = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑘𝑔 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) × 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐿𝐻𝑉 (𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔  𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 (𝑀𝐽)
= 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 (𝑘𝑔 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) × 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐿𝐻𝑉 (𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔  𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽) = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑀𝐽) − 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 (𝑀𝐽) 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽) =
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽)
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽)12 ×  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽)  
 
For calculating the ‘Consignment input (MJ)’ and ‘‘Consignment output (MJ)’ terms, the calculator 
assumes the dry matter LHV of all feedstock to be equal to the final dry matter of the LHV pellet output. 
The processing (‘Fuel’) feedstock factor is calculated using the following equation: 
 
9 European Commission. 2015. Note on the conducting and verifying actual calculations of GHG emissions savings. 
10 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.328.01.0082.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:328:TOC 
11 The latter three equations are also conducted on a mass basis in the calculator to be used in other calculations (e.g. 
determining drying heat emissions allocations) 
12 The total MJ input for all consignments

𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 =
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽)
∑ 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽) 
In the event of incorrect data entry, such that the MJ of consignment output exceeds the MJ of 
consignment input, a warning message will show in the header on the dashboard. 
For processing and pellet transport modules, feedstock factors are assumed as 1 in line with 
assumptions from JRC ‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG emissions: Version 
2’ report and Biograce II. However, users have the option to overwrite these feedstock factors on the 
‘Reference values’ page in the event losses occur during transport.  
Calculating the carbon intensity of each module 
Total carbon emissions for each input are then calculated per tonne of dry biomass output using the 
following equation: 
𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (
𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)) = 𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞)
𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) 
Module emissions are calculated using the following equation: 
𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (
𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)) = ∑ 𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (
𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)) 
The contribution of the module13 to overall emissions is then calculated using the following equation: 
𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (
𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑀𝐽 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟))
= 
𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (
𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑘𝑔 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)) 14

𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔 (𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟))
 × ∏ 𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑚 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠 
This equation is equivalent to that provided in Table 6; Section 5 of the Renewables Obligation 
Sustainability Criteria guidance, with irrelevant terms excluded: 
 
13 Calculations for processing emissions are separated into drying emissions and processing other site processing emissions 
due to the heat allocation approach taken for estimating heat emissions on a consignment basis 
14 This term is stated in the calculator as kgCO2eq/tdry matter, which is equivalent to gCO2eq/kgdry matter

• Wood fuel supply chains do not typically produce co-products, the ‘Allocation factor fuel’ is 
absent from the equation when compared to the equation published by the Commission i.e. in 
all instances the allocation factor is equal to 1 and so can be ignored from the calculation. 
• The calculator does not provide a function to calculate ‘emission savings for modules’ as this is 
unlikely to be relevant for most wood pellet supply chains. 
Calculating the carbon intensity of the supply chain and converting 
into relevant units 
The carbon intensity of the entire supply chain is calculated on the ‘Dashboard’ by summing all the 
module emission contributions stated in gCO2eq/MJdry matter15. 
Calculating the carbon intensity of electricity generation 
The carbon intensity of final electricity generation is calculated in accordance with the following

Calculator allocations 
Allocation of CHP emissions between heat and electricity providing 
process inputs 
Emissions relating to CHP systems providing inputs to the pellet production process are allocated to 
their heat and electricity outputs based on the total, useable energy of the output in accordance with 
the methodologies outlined in the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 Annex VI, the Renewables Obligation and 
the Renewable Heat Incentive. 
Allocation of CHP electricity emissions is performed using the following equation: 
𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞)
= ((𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) + 𝐹𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠(𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) )) ×
𝐶𝑒𝑙 × ƞ𝑒𝑙
𝐶𝑒𝑙 × ƞ𝑒𝑙 + 𝐶ℎ × ƞℎ 
Allocation of CHP heat emissions is performed using the following equation: 
𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) = ((𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) + 𝐹𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞)) ×
𝐶ℎ × ƞℎ
𝐶𝑒𝑙 × ƞ𝑒𝑙 + 𝐶ℎ × ƞℎ 
Allocation of heat between drying and other site processes 
In some circumstances, a fuel system may provide heat to drying, other site processes and/or exported 
demands16. The total heat emissions for each fuel system are therefore allocated to drying using the 
following equation: 
𝐷𝑟𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) = 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) × 
𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑑𝑟𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑘𝑊ℎ)
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑘𝑊ℎ) 
Total heat emissions are allocated to heat for other onsite wood pellet processing using the following 
equation: 
 
16 Either non-processing heat demands or processing demands of neighbouring facility with operations unrelated to 
production of the wood pellet 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 16 of 40 
 
 
 
 
𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) = 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) × 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑘𝑊ℎ)
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑘𝑊ℎ) 
Any difference between the total heat emissions and the processing heat emissions (heat for drying + 
heat for other processing) of the burner/boiler or CHP represents emissions allocated to heat used 
outside the system and is therefore excluded from the lifecycle emissions of the wood pellet. 
Allocation of electricity between site processes and export 
In some circumstances, a fuel system may provide electricity to site processes and export the remaining 
electricity to the grid or a neighbouring demand. The total electricity emissions for each fuel system are 
allocated to site processing using the following equation:

= 𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) × 𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑘𝑊ℎ)
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑘𝑊ℎ)  
Any difference between the total electricity emissions and the processing electricity emissions of the 
CHP represents emissions allocated to exported electricity and are therefore excluded from the lifecycle 
emissions of the wood pellet. 
Allocation of drying heat emissions to each consignment 
Pellet plants provide several complexities from a GHG accounting perspective. They will typically accept a 
range of different feedstocks to which emissions require allocating to in accordance with the mass balance 
rules of the Renewable Energy Directive and will often use consignments requiring different processing 
requirements. For instance, dry sawmill residues may require very little processing to be converted to 
pellets (e.g. drying and other processing may not be required). Meanwhile, wet stemwood may require a 
lot of energy to convert the material to pellets (e.g. debarking, chipping and drying all required). 
Moreover, some biomass may be diverted to ‘hog fuel’, in which case the material delivered to the site 
will not be equal to the feedstock input for pellet production. 
To ensure pellet plant drying heat emissions are accurately calculated, emissions are allocated to each 
consignment based on the relative amount of water removed by the drying process. This is determined 
by calculating the total water content of the feedstock as received onsite and the total water content of 
the material after the dryer outlet. For instance, if one consignment requires removal of 1,000 tonnes of 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 17 of 40 
 
 
 
 
water and a second 3,000 tonnes of water, 25% of drying emissions will be allocated to the first 
consignment and 75% of drying emissions allocated to the second17.  
The following set of equations are used for performing the allocation of heat drying emissions: 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)
= 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 (𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) − 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 (𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)

The calculator assumes that any material losses (i.e. any difference between the ‘Consignment input’ 
and ‘Consignment output’ terms) at the pellet plant occur during the pelleting process. Where losses at 
the pellet mill occur upstream of pelleting, this will result in an overestimate of the material entering 
and exiting the dryer and ultimately the total amount of water removed by drying. However, it is 
reasonable to assume any losses are likely to be both small and relatively consistent across 
consignments and will thus have a negligible impact on the allocation of drying heat emissions. It is also 
important to note that regardless of any losses, this approach applies a percentage to the total heat 
emissions for each consignment (with the total sum of these percentages equalling 100%), ensuring all 
emissions are accounted for when considering all outputs of the pellet plant. 
Co-product allocation 
As wood pellet supply chains typically only produce a single product (wood pellet), the calculator does 
not allow for allocation of emissions to co-products.

Additional calculations 
Lower heating values 
Lower heating values for feedstock consignments are calculated from the moisture content of the 
consignment and lower heating value (LHV) of the pellet on a dry basis in accordance with the following 
equation: 
𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐿𝐻𝑉 (𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)
= 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐿𝐻𝑉 (𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) × (100% − 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 (%))
− 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒(%) × ∆𝐻𝑣𝑎𝑝 
Where: 
∆Hvap (Latent heat of evaporation for water under standard temperature and pressure) = 2.441 
MJ/kg 
The inverse equation is also used within the calculator for determining the LHV of dry biomass based on 
its moisture content and LHV (on a fresh basis) using the following equation: 
𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐿𝐻𝑉 (𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) =
𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐿𝐻𝑉 (𝑀𝐽
𝑘𝑔 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) + 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒(%) × ∆𝐻𝑣𝑎𝑝
100% − 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 (%)
 
Output contribution 
The percentage of total pellet output attributable to each consignment (‘Output contribution’) is 
calculated using the following equation: 
𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (%) = 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑀𝐽 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)

Guide to inputting data 
Dashboard 
The dashboard is the main landing page of the calculator, providing the user with the ability to make 
scenario selections and view the outputs to the calculator. 
Reporting information 
The following reporting information to assist verifying parties can be entered in the header of the 
dashboard: 
• Pellet plant: Name of the pellet plant for which supply chain emissions are being calculated 
• Start of period: The start date of the reference period (i.e. the period for which operational data 
is collected for analysis of supply chain emissions) 
• End of period: The end date of the reference period, typically one year from the start of the 
period. 
Transport route selections 
A scenario selection tool is available in the header of the dashboard offering the user to select different 
transport route options for both the delivery of feedstock to the pellet mill and downstream distribution 
of the pellet: 
• Feedstock travel distance: For many consignments, feedstock will be transported from a variety 
of different origins, which will inevitably be different distances from the pellet mill. The 
‘Upstream’ page allows users to enter feedstock travel distance information for the maximum 
travel distance and the weighted average distance. The scenario selection tool allows the user 
the option to switch between the two transport options. If an option is not chosen, the 
maximum distance will automatically be assumed.  
• Route identifier: The wood pellet output to a pellet plant may be distributed to a variety of end 
users or distributed the same end user via different routes. The ‘pellet transport’ page allows the 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 20 of 40 
 
 
 
 
input of transport data for up to 10 different downstream distribution routes. The scenario 
selection tool allows the user the option to switch between these different routes based on the 
‘route identifier’. An option must be chosen for GHG emissions to be fully calculated. 
End user 
Where the calculator is required for determining the carbon intensity of heat or electricity, the user 
should select whether the end user is an electricity generator, heat generator or CHP generator. Clicking 
the ‘add’ button next to the list of generators will unhide relevant fields to the type of generator 
selected (columns M:N on the ‘dashboard’ and rows 11-13 on the ‘End use’ page). 
Users can reset the end user data by clicking the ‘Reset’ button. 
Warning – the reset function will delete all data entered by the user on the ‘end user’ page. 
Consignments 
The calculator allows users to select up to 20 different feedstock ‘consignments’ by selecting the 
necessary number in ‘Number of feedstock consignments’ field and clicking the ‘Add’ button. Users can 
reset the consignment data by clicking the ‘Reset’ button. 
Warning – the reset function will delete all consignment data entered by the user on the ‘feedstock’ 
and ‘upstream’ pages. 
Summary table 
The dashboard provides a summary table of supply chain emissions in gCO2eq/MJ pelletdry matter, showing 
the relevant contribution of ‘Processing at origin’, ‘Feedstock transport’, ‘Drying’, ‘Pelleting and other 
processing’, ‘Pellet transport’ and ‘Fuel in use’ to overall emissions. This breakdown of emissions is 
shown in the graph. The table also shows the final emissions for the pellet, emissions for heat and/or 
electricity generation, the total pellet output for each consignment and the contribution of each 
consignment towards the output of the plant. 
 
 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 21 of 40 
 
 
 
 
Feedstock 
Consignments 
Before inputting information on the ‘Feedstock’ page, users should first ensure they have added the 
necessary number of consignments on the ‘Dashboard’ to ensure that enough rows of input data are 
available. 
Options available in the dropdown lists for Feedstock Group, Origin and Physical Description fields align 
to those provided in the SBP SAR for wood pellets v2.0. While it is not vital for all these fields to be 
completed for the calculation of emissions, they are valuable for the auditor for ensuring the input data 
aligns to the source evidence. 
The total amount of each consignment processed during the reporting period should be input into in the 
‘Consignment delivered’ field, with values provided on a fresh tonne basis. This includes all feedstock 
entering the pellet production process, including any material diverted to hog fuel. Biomass sourced 
specifically for hog fuel can either be reported here as a separate consignment # (where upstream data 
is available for the fuel)21 or in the imported fuel tables on the ‘pellet plant’ page. 
The moisture content as received is the weighted average moisture content for the feedstock as initially 
received onsite and is input as a percentage. 
Users are also required to state whether consignments are fed to a dryer at the plant by selecting ‘yes’ 
or ‘no’ in the ‘Drying required at plant?” field. 
The moisture content at the dryer inlet is the weighted average moisture content for the feedstock as 
delivered to the dryer. This will typically be the same as the moisture content as received. However, if a 
feedstock consignment is air dried onsite prior to drying, the moisture content of the feedstock will be 
lower than as received. This is important to document to ensure drying emissions are not over-allocated 
 
21 Users must ensure that the fuel group is then reported in the ‘Biomass boiler/burner inputs - diverted from pellet 
production process’ or ‘Biomass CHP inputs - diverted from pellet production process’ table on the pellet plant page, rather 
than the diverted fuel tables. 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 22 of 40 
 
 
 
 
to the consignment by the calculator. If a feedstock consignment does not enter the dryer or is not air 
dried onsite the user need not enter a value in this field (or can enter “N/A”). 
Notes 
Should the user wish to provide additional notes for justifying the input data used, this can be provided 
in the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom of the page. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g. 
when used in third party audits). The auditor can record when the input data in each row has been 
verified (or where more information is needed) and can provide additional comments accordingly. 
Upstream 
The ‘Upstream’ page covers all supply chain activities upstream of the pellet mill, including the 
‘processing at origin’ and ‘feedstock transport’ modules. As data for supply chain inputs upstream of 
pelleting will often be unavailable, the calculator provides separate options for calculating emissions 
related to forestry operations (e.g. cultivation harvesting and extraction): 
• Actual values – This approach allows actual data collected from forestry activities to be used. It 
can also be used for inputting ‘reference values’ where data may be unknown by using the 
‘Diesel use lookup’ tool available in the header. 
• Disaggregated default values - This approach uses disaggregated default values from Directive 
(EU) 2018/2001 for determining emissions. This approach is a mandatory requirement for 
compliance with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 where energy data for forestry operations is 
unknown. A lookup function for disaggregated default values is provided in the header.  
Diesel use 
As users will often rely on the use of ‘reference values’ for forestry operations (e.g. from the JRC ‘Solid 
and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG emissions: Version 2’ report or Biograce II), all 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 23 of 40 
 
 
 
 
upstream diesel processing requirements have been included in a single field to reduce the complexity 
of the calculator, covering cultivation, harvesting, extraction and chipping. A tool is provided on the 
right-hand side of the header to enable the user to look up reference values. It is important to ensure 
that diesel use for forestry operations are adjusted for any process losses occurring prior to feedstock 
transport (e.g. during seasoning or chipping), otherwise diesel emissions will be underestimated.  
Data should not be entered in this field if intending to use disaggregated default values. 
Other upstream emissions 
For wood pellet supply chains derived from products (i.e. not wastes or residues) and where land inputs 
such as fertilisers and pesticides are required (e.g. wood pellet from energy crops), the calculator must 
be used alongside other tools (e.g. Biograce II; The UK Solid and Gaseous Biomass Carbon Calculator) for 
calculating upstream emissions22. 
Any emissions resulting from land use change or use of additional inputs should be calculated in 
accordance with rules of the relevant legislation (e.g. Renewables Obligation or Directive (EU) 
2018/2001) and stated in kgCO2eq/toutput. It is important to ensure that emissions are adjusted for any 
process losses occurring prior to feedstock transport to site (e.g. during seasoning or chipping). 
A corresponding table is provided on the ‘Reference values’ page to allow the user to keep a record of 
any upstream emissions regularly used in calculations.  
Data should not be entered in this field if intending to use disaggregated default values, unless 
emissions relate to land use change emissions or other land use carbon impacts (e.g. soil carbon 
accumulation). 
Disaggregated default values 
Disaggregated default values for wood pellet supply chains are listed in the ‘Reference values’ and can 
be easily accessed using the lookup table in the header. Only these values, or other disaggregated 
 
22 The necessary calculations for these inputs (e.g. determining changes in carbon stock from land use change or N2O 
emissions from fertiliser application) are omitted on account they would significantly increase the complexity of the 
calculator if included yet are rarely required for wood pellet supply chains 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 24 of 40 
 
 
 
 
default values from Directive (EU) 2018/2001 should be used. Actual or calculated values should not be 
entered. 
Where disaggregated default values are used, users are still required to enter data for feedstock 
transport. 
Data should not be entered into this field if using actual values or ‘reference values’ for forestry 
operations.  
Feedstock transport 
For each consignment, the calculator allows users to select the mode of transport, the transport fuel 
used, the weighted average distance and the maximum distance for up to two separate journeys for the 
transport of feedstock from its origin to the pellet mill. In the event transport modes or fuels are not 
available from the drop-down lists, users can input their own values on the ‘Standard values’ page 
(‘Transport’ and ‘Transport fuels’ tables). However, this will require users to source their own input data 
(e.g. transport efficiencies and exhaust emission) to ensure emissions are fully accounted for. 
Diesel use lookup 
The table provides aggregated and disaggregated values for diesel use in cultivation, harvesting, 
extraction and chipping, taken from the JRC ‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and 
GHG emissions: Version 2’ report.  
For aggregated values (‘Diesel for collection of forestry residues including stump harvesting and 
chipping’ and ‘Diesel for cultivation, harvesting and chipping of stemwood’), yield adjustments are 
accounted for. 
Users must note that the reference values are provided in litre/tdry matter and must be converted to a 
fresh matter basis by multiplying by the dry matter content (i.e. 100% - moisture content) of the 
relevant consignment. Where consignment data is already entered, the user can determine the 
litre/tfresh matter input value by selecting the relevant process and consignment in the lookup table. 
The underlying data for the lookup table is provided in the ‘Reference values’ page.

Notes 
Should the user wish to provide additional notes for justifying the input data used, this can be provided 
in the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom of the page. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g. 
when used in third party audits). The auditor can record when the input data in each row has been 
verified (or where more information is needed) and can provide additional comments accordingly. 
Pellet plant 
The ‘Pellet plant’ page covers all input and output data for the pellet plant, or other processing facility. 
All data should be entered as absolute values for the reporting period of assessment. 
Pellet plant output 
Output information for the pellet plant is required in the top section of the page. Output volumes of 
pellet should be entered on a fresh matter basis (i.e. should include moisture content). The pellet lower 
heating value (LHV) should also be on a fresh matter basis. Where this value is unavailable, the user may 
estimate this from default values using the lower heating value calculator on the ‘Assisting calculations’ 
page. 
The moisture of the feedstock after drying (‘moisture at the dryer outlet %’) and final moisture content 
of the pellet also require entering. Where the moisture at the dryer outlet is unknown, it is appropriate 
to use the final pellet moisture in this field. 
Fuel system inputs 
The calculator allows users to add up to 4 different fuel systems: 
• Fossil fuel boiler/burner 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 26 of 40 
 
 
 
 
• Fossil fuel CHP 
• Biomass boiler/burner 
• Biomass CHP 
The relevant fuel system should be selected in the listbox and the ‘Add’ button pressed to unhide the 
necessary input data for the system selected. Users can reset the fuel system data by clicking the ‘Reset’ 
button. 
Warning – the reset function will delete all fuel system data entered by the user. 
It is important to note that this selection tool is a hide/unhide function. This means that use of the 
‘reset’ button will not delete any data already entered in the calculator but will instead hide any rows 
unnecessary to the user. 
For fossil fuel systems, users can insert consumption data in either kg or MJ, depending on how the 
information is collected onsite (typically MJ for gases or kg for solids and liquids). Where users need to 
convert from one unit into another, a ‘Unit converter’ assistance tool is provided in the right-hand side 
of the page header. If a fuel used in the system is not available from the drop-down list, users can input 
their own values on the ‘Standard values’ page (‘Fossil fuels’ table). However, this will require users to 
source their own input data (e.g. emission factors) to ensure emissions are fully accounted for. 
For biomass systems, users are required to provide input tonnages for hog fuel on a fresh tonne basis. 
For each fuel system, there are two separate tables for reporting hog fuels: 
DIVERTED HOG FUEL 
Hog fuel taken from input consignments listed on the ‘Feedstock’ page should be reported in the 
biomass input tables labelled ‘diverted from pellet production process’. Importantly, users must state 
from which feedstock consignment # the hog fuel is derived to ensure the mass balance for the site is 
accurately calculated. 
If the hog fuel is taken after a process that results in mixing of multiple consignments (e.g. drying), the 
percentage of each consignment contributing to the mix should be manually calculated on a dry mass 
basis based on the relative input contribution. The fuel system consumption for each consignment 
should then be determined by multiplying the total fuel system consumption of the feedstock mix by 
the contributing percentage. 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 27 of 40 
 
 
 
 
For instance, if 1,000 tonnes of stemwood chips at 50% moisture and 2,000 tonnes of sawdust at 25% 
moisture are added to a dryer, of which 300 tonnes of the dried output (at 10% moisture) is used as hog 
fuel, the following calculations should be performed: 
1,000 × (100% − 50%) = 500 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑤𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑝𝑠 
2,000 × (100% − 25%) = 1,500 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑠𝑎𝑤𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡 
500
500 + 1500 =  25% ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑎𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑤𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑝𝑠 
1,500
500 + 1500 =  75% ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑎𝑠 𝑠𝑎𝑤𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡

300 × 75% =  225 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝑠𝑎𝑤𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑔 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑎𝑡 10% 𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 
An assistance tool for performing such calculations is provided on the ‘Assisting calculations’ page. 
IMPORTED HOG FUEL 
For imported hog fuel that has been sourced specifically for providing fuel to the biomass process and 
which has not been reported on the ‘Feedstock’ page, users must enter data in the relevant biomass 
input tables labelled ‘imported fuels’. Default emission values are used for these fuels, derived from 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Users may provide their own emission values for imported hog fuels by 
providing a new set of user values in the ‘Biomass fuels’ table on the ‘Standard values’ page. Users must 
also complete the corresponding ‘Biomass CHP flue gas emissions’ and ‘Biomass boiler flue gas 
emissions’ tables to ensure stack CH4 and N2O emissions are accounted for. 
 
 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 28 of 40 
 
 
 
 
Fuel system outputs 
By default, the calculator applies all heat output of the fuel systems to drying. Therefore, in situations 
where heat is applied only to drying but output is unknown (e.g. direct air heating) certain fields can be 
left blank. For boiler/burner systems, all output fields can be left empty where the entire heat output is 
used for drying. For CHP systems, ‘Heat for drying’ and ‘Heat for processing’ fields may be left empty. 
However, the user must input information for ‘Total usable heat output’ to ensure emissions are 
correctly allocated between heat and electricity outputs. 
Fields for fuel system outputs are defined as below: 
• ‘Total useable heat output’ is the total kWhth of heat generated by the fuel system to satisfy an 
economical justifiable demand for heat, for heating or cooling purposes23; it should not include 
any heat output produced by the fuel system that is ‘wasted’ 
• ‘Heat for drying’ is the total kWhth heat output from the installation used for drying feedstock 
• ‘Heat for other site processing’ is the total kWhth heat output from the installation used for 
wood pellet production processes other than drying 
• ‘Heat exported’ is the total kWhth heat output of the fuel system exported to an external 
demand, either to ancillary facilities or to a neighbouring demand unrelated to the pellet plant 
operation. This value is automatically calculated by deducting heat for drying and heat for other 
processing from the total heat output of the CHP and is shown only for completeness. 
• ‘Temperature of heat at point of delivery’ is the temperature of the energy vector (e.g. hot 
water, steam) in °C when delivered to the process 
• ‘Total electricity output’ is the total electricity output of the fuel system in kWhe 
• ‘Electricity for processing’ is the total electricity output of the fuel system in kWhe that is used 
for onsite processing (e.g. pelleting). It should not include any electricity that is exported to an 
external demand, either to ancillary facilities, the grid or by direct wire to a neighbouring 
operation24 
 
23 ‘Economical justifiable demand’ is defined as the demand that does not exceed the needs for heat or cooling and which 
would otherwise be satisfied at market conditions 
24 It is important to note that where calculations are used for regulatory compliance with the UK Renewables Obligation or 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001, electricity used from a biomass CHP cannot be considered as such under certain conditions (e.g. if 
distributed to the plant via the grid). Please refer to the relevant legislations for further details. Where this is the case, 
electricity for processing should be assumed to be 0, such that is assumed all electricity output is exported. Electricity used 
from the CHP should then be accounted for under grid electricity. 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 29 of 40 
 
 
 
 
• ‘Electricity exported’ is the total electricity output of the fuel system in kWhe exported to an 
external demand, either to ancillary facilities, the grid or by direct wire to a neighbouring 
operation. This value is automatically calculated by deducting processing electricity from the 
total electricity output of the CHP and is shown only for completeness. 
Electricity inputs 
Electricity consumption should include all processes at the site. 
Users have the facility to input data for electricity consumed from both grid or onsite sources in the 
event electricity is derived from multiple sources. For grid electricity, the relevant region should be 
selected by the user. Standard data for grid carbon intensities at the EU level are taken from the JRC 
‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG emissions: Version 2’ report, and at the 
national level from Biograce additional standard values. However, users have the facility to input their 
own data on the ‘Standard values’ page (‘Electricity – Grid’ table) should they have access to more up-
to-date values (e.g. The annual IEA Emissions Factors publication25). 
Electricity from onsite fossil fuel or biomass CHP is shown in the ‘Onsite electricity inputs’ fields and is 
automatically taken from the ‘Electricity for processing’ fields in the Fuel System section and is shown 
here only for completeness. 
For electricity supplied by direct wire from a neighbouring facility, data should be entered into the 
‘Onsite electricity inputs’ field. Where the source is not solar or wind, the user is required to calculate 
the carbon intensity of the electricity supplied and include the emission factor in the ‘Electricity – 
Onsite’ table on the ‘Standard values’ page. 
It is important to note that where calculations are used for regulatory compliance with the UK 
Renewables Obligation or Directive (EU) 2018/2001, electricity from renewable generation cannot be 
considered as such under certain conditions (e.g. if distributed to the plant via the grid). Where this is 
the case, all electricity should be accounted for under grid electricity. Please refer to the relevant 
legislations for further details.

Additional inputs 
Any additional pellet plant fossil requirements (e.g. diesel use for moving feedstock) should be recorded 
in this section. Equally, any non-feedstock binding agents or chemicals used in the process should also 
be added. It is important that the user provides their own emission factor for binders or chemicals on 
the ‘Standard values’ page (‘Binders/chemicals’ table), as default emission factors for relevant inputs are 
not widely available.  
Unit converter 
A ‘Unit converter’ assistance tool is provided in the right-hand side of the page header. This allows users 
to convert from kg, t, litre, m3, MJ, GJ, MWh, GWh and mmBTU to MJ and kg, provided all necessary 
information (mass density and lower heating value) is included on the ‘Standard values’ page (‘Fossil 
fuels’ table). 
Notes 
Should the user wish to provide additional notes for justifying the input data used, this can be provided 
in the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom of the page. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g. 
when used in third party audits). The auditor can record when the input data in each row has been 
verified (or where more information is needed) and can provide additional comments accordingly.

The pellet produced by a mill may be distributed by a variety of different end routes. Each distribution 
route is labelled with a ‘route identifier’. The number of distribution routes can be chosen by selecting 
BIOMASS CARBON CALCULATOR USER GUIDE 
Page 31 of 40 
 
 
 
 
the necessary number (up to a maximum of 10) and clicking the ‘Add’ button. Data can be deleted by 
clicking the ‘Reset’ button.  
The ‘Route definition’ provides a free text field which the user can use to describe the distribution route 
and which can be used to assist auditors for verification. For instance, the following could be used for 
route definition: 
Pellet mill location – Load port – Disport – Generator location 
The ‘Route identifier’ provides a free text field where the user can use a reference code to describe the 
route. For instance, generators using the SBP certification scheme can use production batch ID codes for 
describing each route. This field must be completed to allow selection of route on the dashboard page. 
Each distribution route allows users to input up to 6 different journeys: 
• 2 journeys from the pellet mill to the port of dispatch (Journey 1 & Journey 2) 
• 2 shipping journeys from the port of dispatch to the port of receipt (Shipping 1 & Shipping 2) 
• 2 journeys from the port of receipt to the generator (Journey 3 & Journey 4) 
Users can use any different combination of fields to describe the distribution route. For instance, if a 
route requires three land journeys but does not require shipping, it is appropriate to input information 
for ‘Journey 1’, ‘Journey 2’ and ‘Journey 3’ while leaving other fields blank. 
In the event transport modes or fuels are not available from the drop-down lists, users can input their 
own values on the ‘Standard values’ page (‘Transport’, ‘Transport fuels’ and ‘Shipping’ tables). However, 
this will require users to source their own input data (e.g. transport efficiencies and exhaust emission) to 
ensure emissions are fully accounted for. 
Handling energy requirements 
Input fields for storage & handling electricity and fuel requirements are provided for each distribution 
route. Where electricity is required in two different countries (e.g. the port of loading and the port of 
arrival) consumption should be entered separately for each demand, with the correct region identified.

Notes 
Should the user wish to provide additional notes for justifying the input data used, this can be provided 
in the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom of the page. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g. 
when used in third party audits). The auditor can record when the input data in each row has been 
verified (or where more information is needed) and can provide additional comments accordingly. 
End use 
Fuel type 
The fuel type of the biomass is required to be selected for determining combustion non-CO2 (CH4 and 
N2O) emissions. The calculator automatically calculates these emissions based on the fuel type selected 
using default values for these emissions derived from Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Where actual CH4 and 
N2O emissions are known, users can enter a new fuel type on the ‘Standard values’ page and insert their 
own fuel (e.g. ‘Wood pellet (user value)’) and include their own values for combustion non-CO2 
emissions. 
Electrical efficiency 
The electrical efficiency of the end generator is the annual electricity produced divided by the annual 
fuel input, in MJ of electricity per MJ of pellet. 
Heat efficiency 
The heat efficiency of the end generator is the annual useful heat produced divided by the annual fuel 
input, in MJ of heat per MJ of pellet. Any heat that is ultimately wasted should not be included in 
determining the heat efficiency of the generator.

Temperature of heat at point of delivery 
The temperature of the useful heat at point of delivery to its end use application. 
Notes 
Should the user wish to provide additional notes for justifying the input data used, this can be provided 
in the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom of the page. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g. 
when used in third party audits). The auditor can record when the input data in each row has been 
verified (or where more information is needed) and can provide additional comments accordingly. 
Emissions 
All calculations, as described in the ‘Calculation structure and alignment to the Renewables Obligation 
methodology’ Section, are conducted here. There are no input fields on this page. 
Standard values 
Standard values 
This page contains all standard values (e.g. conversion factors, fuel properties, transport efficiencies and 
emission factors) used in the calculator, largely derived from the JRC ‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy 
pathways: input values and GHG emissions: Version 2’ report and Biograce II. 
For each table, users can include their own values using the rows labelled ‘User value – insert data’. 
Users are recommended to make it clear when they have input and used their own values in the 
calculator to assist the verification process, for instance, by suffixing the name of each new fuel or 
transport mode etc. added with ‘_user value’.

It is important that users input information for all relevant fields when adding new values to ensure 
emissions are calculated correctly. 
However, there are several exceptions: 
• Density in the ‘Fossil fuels’ and ‘Transport fuels’ table is not required as the value is only used for 
converting from volume to mass/energy values in the unit converted on the ‘Pellet plant’ page 
• Density in the ‘Biomass fuels’ table is not currently used in the calculator 
• LHV is not required for electricity in the ‘Transport fuels’ table 
• Exhaust CH4 and N2O emissions in the ‘Shipping’ table unless these values are known, insofar as 
these emissions are assumed to be 0 in Biograce II 
User entered standard values should comply with the relevant regulatory guidelines and should be 
appropriately referenced. References should be numbered, with full details provided on the 
‘References’ page. 
Users are prevented from overwriting standard values (with exception of transport feedstock factors – 
see below). They must instead include any new values as a new row in the relevant table in accordance 
with the guidance above. 
For instance, if the user wishes to input a new emission factor for natural gas used as a transport fuel, 
they must use one of the additional rows available to insert the new fuel name, insert the new value and 
copy any other standard values for information the user does not wish to change (see example below).

Should users need to use their own values in the ‘Biomass CHP flue gas emissions’ or ‘Biomass boiler 
flue gas emissions’ tables, they must first include the new fuel in the ‘Biomass fuels’ table. Equally, if 
users need to use their own values in the ‘Fossil CHP flue gas emissions’ or ‘Fossil boiler flue gas 
emissions’ tables, they must first include the new fuel in the ‘Fossil fuels’ table. 
Transport feedstock factors 
The standard values page contains default ‘Transport feedstock factors’ for feedstock and wood pellet 
transport. These values are directly used in calculating module emission contributions (by accounting for 
supply chain losses) and by default are set to 1, in accordance with the default values outlined in JRC 
‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG emissions: Version 2’ report. If the 
modelled supply chains suffer supply chain losses during transport, users can overwrite these default 
factors. 
Lookup tables 
The page further contains lookup tables for ‘Feedstock groups’, ‘Feedstock origins’, ‘Physical 
descriptions’, ‘Fuel supply options’, ‘Consignment numbers’ and ‘Countries of Origin’. Additional 
countries of origin for feedstock can be added by the user by overwriting the ‘User value - insert data’ 
fields. 
Notes 
Additional notes for justifying the input data used is provided in the ‘Notes’ column for each table. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g. 
when used in third party audits). The auditor can record when the input data in each row has been 
verified (or where more information is needed) and can provide additional comments accordingly.

Reference values 
Reference values 
This page contains reference values for upstream energy demands taken from Directive (EU) 2018/2001, 
the JRC ‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input values and GHG emissions: Version 2’ report and 
Biograce II. These values are not directly used in the calculator and are only provided as a point of 
reference where their use may be required by the user in place of actual input data: 
• The ‘Disaggregated default values’ can be looked up on the ‘Upstream’ page and used in the 
absence of measured supply chain data for compliance with Directive (EU) 2018/2001  
• The ‘Wood handling and processing energy requirements for wood chip production from forestry 
feedstocks’ can be looked up on the ‘Upstream’ page and used in the absence of measured 
supply chain data 
• The ‘Wood handling and processing energy requirements for pellets from fresh forest chips’ are 
used in the ‘assisting calculations’ page if the tool is being used to model supply chain data in the 
absence of pellet plant operational data 
• The ‘Wood processing feedstock factors’ are used for determining reference values in the ‘Wood 
handling and processing energy requirements for wood chip production from forestry 
feedstocks’ table 
• The ‘Upstream emissions table’ allows the user to keep a record of any upstream emissions 
regularly used in its calculations.  
Notes 
Additional notes for justifying the input data used is provided in the ‘Notes’ column for each table. 
Verification 
The page provides additional input fields on the right-hand side for verification of the calculations (e.g.

Assisting calculations 
Assistance for modelling pellet mill mass balance based on different 
fuel systems 
This section is for users wishing to estimate the amount of feedstock required by a pellet plant, based 
on the pellet output of the plant and the fuel system used. The outputs from this page should only be 
used in the calculator to provide a provisional estimate of supply chain emissions and should not be 
used in place of actual data. 
Users are required to provide data for the total output of pellet, the fuel system used, pellet LHV and 
moisture content, the electrical and heat efficiencies of the fuel systems and the initial moisture content 
of the feedstock26. The tool uses values from the JRC ‘Solid and gaseous bioenergy pathways: input 
values and GHG emissions: Version 2’ report to provide estimates of: 
• Total heat demand for drying 
• Total electricity demand for pelleting 
• Total fuel consumption for each fuel system (in MJ for fossil fuels; in MJ and dry tonnes for 
biomass fuels) 
• Total heat and electricity output for each fuel system 
• The total amount of grid electricity required for pelleting (where CHP electricity is insufficient to 
meet demand) 
• The total amount of dry and fresh tonnes of feedstock required to fulfil site feedstock and energy 
demands (assuming the feedstock also provides hog fuel or biomass fuel systems) 
This tool can only be used to estimate feedstock requirements on a fresh tonne basis for consignments 
of equivalent moisture content. Where consignments of different moisture content are required, users 
should conduct their own mass balance from the dry tonne requirements to estimate the tonnage of 
fresh biomass needed.

Calculator for determining relative contributions of biomass within a 
feedstock mixture 
This section is for users to calculate the relative contribution of each biomass consignment within a 
feedstock mix and the estimated tonnage of each consignment where a portion of the mixture is used as 
a processing fuel (e.g. where the output to a biomass dryer is re-used as fuel for the system). 
Users are required to enter data for: 
• Tonnes of biomass mixture 
• Moisture of biomass mixture 
• Consignment # for each consignment contributing to the mixture 
• Tonnes for each consignment entering the mixture 
• Moisture % for each consignment entering the mixture 
The tonnage of each biomass consignment in the fuel mix used is provided on both a dry basis (0% 
moisture) and fresh basis (moisture % of the biomass mixture). 
Biomass physical property calculator 
This tool is for estimating the lower heating value and bulk density of different types of biomass based 
on the moisture content of the feedstock. The tool also allows converting from tonnes of biomass to m3, 
based on standard bulk density estimates available in the Biomass fuels table on the ‘Standard values’ 
page. If the user wishes to use their own estimates of LHV or bulk density, additional fuels should be 
added to the Biomass fuels table and user values entered accordingly.
