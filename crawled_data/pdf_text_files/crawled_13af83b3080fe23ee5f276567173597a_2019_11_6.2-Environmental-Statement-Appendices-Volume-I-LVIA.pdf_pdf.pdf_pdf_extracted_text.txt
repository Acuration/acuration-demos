An area of fieldscape not based on the open-field system, but
evolving as a result of gradual enclosure of the uplands and
their foothills.  There is some evidence for enclosure in the
pre-Norman period, and the process continued into the
second half of the 19th century.  Some unenclosed land and
woodland remains.  Limited industrial activity, mainly mining
took place in the 19th century.  The settlement pattern is
basically dispersed, but ribbon developments occurred in
areas of industrial activity.

Appendix 11.2 Assessment of Landscape Effects 
This Appendix should be read in conjunction with Figures 11.2 – 11.6 and 11.9 and Appendix 11.1.  Note: All landscape and visual mitigation is embedded and described in Chapter 3: Project and Site 
Description. All effects identified in the table below are therefore residual. The cumulative assessment has been undertaken for the project as a whole and not for each individual element.

Area (Figure 11.2) 
Value:  
The aspect areas considered in the 
LANDMAP evaluation as being of High or 
Outstanding 
value 
tend 
not 
to 
be 
particularly apparent within the Project 
Site. Overall the landscape character of 
the Site is considered to be of Medium 
value. 
 
Susceptibility: 
The landscape resource is considered to 
have some capacity to accommodate the 
proposed development without effects 
upon its overall integrity.  The pattern of 
the landscape reflects a mostly intact 
pattern of elements, with features in 
reasonable condition although a number 
of detracting elements exist such as the 
prominent power lines and adjacent Gas 
Compressor 
Station 
and 
Substation. 
Taking all of this into account, landscape 
susceptibility to change is Medium. 
 
Sensitivity: 
Taking into account value judgements 
and susceptibility to change, overall 
sensitivity of the landscape character is 
considered to be Medium. 
 
 
Construction: 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant would result 
in temporary adverse effects as a result of the 
construction plant and activities, laydown areas and 
temporary structures on site. During construction there 
would be a permanent loss of landscape features 
including grazing land, trees and scrub vegetation along 
with extensive earth re-profiling. Construction noise, 
activities and lighting would reduce the relative tranquillity 
in the vicinity of the Project Site. Construction of the 
Access Road would result in the removal of trees and 
some woodland although the wider woodland structure 
and its associated strong degree of enclosure and shelter 
it currently provides would remain intact.  
 
The construction of the Gas Connection would result in 
temporary adverse effects as a result of the construction 
plant and activity involved in constructing the AGI along 
with access from Rhyd-y-pandy road and the Pipeline. 
The open trench method of constructing the Pipeline 
connection would result in the temporary removal of 
grazing land and the permanent removal of sections of 
field boundary hedgerow and trees. 
 
The Electrical Connection route would follow the 
alignment of the new Access Road and so disruption 
associated with its construction would be similar to that of 
the new Access Road as described above. 
 
Across the entire Project Site, the temporary presence of 
construction plant, activities and lighting would introduce 
noticeable features uncharacteristic of the landscape at 
present. As a result of these changes and the partial loss 
and alteration of some of the key characteristics, 
magnitude of change is considered to be Medium.   
 
The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the 
Medium magnitude of change would result in a Moderate 
Moderate Adverse

would result in a partial change to some of 
the landscape characteristics although it

Operation: 
Once operational the Power Generation Plant would be a 
prominent feature within the immediate landscape of the 
Project Site. It would result in the partial loss to landscape 
features, including grazing land, trees and scrub 
vegetation, which would result in a partial change to some 
of the landscape characteristics although it would not 
diminish the overall integrity of the landscape. 
 
The Access Road would lie substantially within the 
woodland characteristic of the Penllergaer Forest Aspect 
Area which would retain its qualities providing a strong 
degree of enclosure and shelter.  
 
The route of the Gas Connection would be reinstated 
upon operation with fields returned to grazing and field 
boundaries reinstated with hedgerow and tree planting.

extend up to existing field boundaries in order to retain 
the field pattern and avoid land severance (refer to Figure 
11.10).  
 
The Electrical Connection route would be buried  
immediately adjacent to the Access Road and the long 
term residual effects on the landscape would be similar to 
the Access Road as described above. 
 
Across the wider site there would be a partial loss to 
some of the key characteristics of the landscape but 
would not result in an obvious change to the overall 
character of the area. These effects would be long term 
and partially reversible. At year of opening the magnitude 
of change would be Medium which when combined with 
the Medium sensitivity to change would result in a 
Moderate Adverse effect. 
 
Once the structure planting around the Power Generation 
Plant and AGI establishes it would assist in providing 
some additional structure to the landscape which 
alongside the reinstatement hedgerow planting and fields 
returned to grazing along the Gas Connection Route 
would assist in integrating elements of the development 
into the local landscape. Nonetheless, despite the 
establishment of the planting, the magnitude of effect is 
considered to remain Medium at year 15 as there would 
remain a noticeable alteration of the existing components 
of the landscape of the Site. This would result in a 
residual Moderate Adverse effect.

The landscape resource is considered to 
have some capacity to accommodate the

a

of 
elements, with features in reasonable

elements exist such as the prominent

such as the Felindre Gas Compressor

Felindre Water Treatment Works. Taking 
all of this into account, landscape 
susceptibility to change is Medium. 
 
Sensitivity: 
Taking into account value judgements 
and susceptibility to change, overall 
sensitivity of the landscape character is 
considered to be Medium. 
Connection and Electrical Connection and AGI would 
result in temporary and indirect effects across some of 
this aspect area. Tall construction plant such as cranes, 
lighting, increased vehicle movements and noise would 
result in greater effects in proximity to the Project Site 
where the construction of the Project would have a 
greater influence on the aesthetic and perceptual aspects 
of the landscape. However for the majority of the aspect 
area there would be little tangible effect upon the 
aesthetic and perceptual qualities as the tracts of 
woodland planting and intervening hedgerows and 
localised variations in landform limit the effects on the 
setting of the wider aspect area resulting in minimal 
change to the overall landscape character.  
 
Magnitude of change would be Low which combined with 
a Medium sensitivity would result in a Minor Adverse 
effect. 
 
Operation: 
Direct effects on this aspect area are covered above as 
part of the Project Site. Once operational the Power 
Generation 
Plant 
would 
be 
a 
locally 
prominent 
development within a small part of this aspect area. 
Indirect effects would be limited to parts of the aspect 
area in closer proximity to the Project Site. Whilst the ZTV 
suggests extensive theoretical visibility across the 
majority of this aspect area, the extensive tracts of 
woodland, hedgerows and localised variations in landform 
would substantially limit the indirect effects on this 
landscape. Furthermore this aspect area contains a 
number of features which are not dissimilar in nature to 
the Project including the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station, 
Substations 
and 
numerous 
pylons 
and 
associated overhead lines which are prominent vertical 
structures across this aspect area. The overall character, 
scale and pattern of the landscape would remain largely 
unchanged. 
 
Magnitude of change would be Low with little change 
resulting to the overall character of this aspect area. 
Combined with the medium sensitivity, overall, Minor 
Adverse effects would result for this aspect area which 
would not diminish as the reinstatement planting matures

noticeable effect on the more localised landscape

landscape susceptibility to change is 
Medium. 
 
Sensitivity: 
Taking into account value judgements 
and susceptibility to change, overall 
sensitivity of the landscape character is 
considered to be Medium. 
 
 
Construction: 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant would result in temporary adverse 
effects as a result of the construction plant and activities, laydown areas and 
temporary structures on site. During construction there would be a permanent 
loss of landscape features including grazing land, trees and scrub vegetation 
along with extensive earth re-profiling. Construction noise, activities and lighting 
would reduce the relative tranquillity in the vicinity of the Project Site. Construction 
of the Access Road would result in the removal of trees and some woodland 
although the wider woodland structure and its associated strong degree of 
enclosure and shelter it currently provides would remain intact.  
 
Across the Generating Equipment Site, the temporary presence of construction 
plant, activities and lighting would introduce noticeable features uncharacteristic 
of the landscape at present. As a result of these changes and the partial loss and 
alteration of some of the key characteristics, magnitude of change is considered 
to be Medium.   
 
The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the Medium magnitude of 
change would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on landscape character during 
construction.

Once operational the Power Generation Plant would be a prominent feature within

partial loss of landscape features, including grazing land, trees and scrub 
vegetation, which would result in a partial change to some of the landscape 
characteristics although it would not diminish the overall integrity of the 
landscape. 
 
The Access Road would lie substantially within the woodland characteristic of the 
Penllergaer Forest Aspect Area which would retain its qualities providing a strong 
degree of enclosure and shelter.  
 
Overall, across the Generating Equipment Site there would be a partial loss of 
some of the key characteristics of the landscape which would not result in an

term and partially reversible. At year of opening the magnitude of change would 
be Medium which when combined with the Medium sensitivity to change would 
result in a Moderate Adverse effect.

the landscape reflects a mostly intact 
pattern of elements, with features in 
reasonable condition although a number 
of detracting elements exist such as the

landscape susceptibility to change is 
Medium. 
 
Sensitivity: 
Taking into account value judgements 
and susceptibility to change, overall 
sensitivity of the landscape character is 
considered to be Medium. 
Construction: 
Direct effects on this aspect area are covered above in relation to the Generating 
Equipment Site. Construction plant and activity associated with the Power 
Generation Plant would result in temporary and indirect effects across some of 
this aspect area. Tall construction plant such as cranes, lighting, increased vehicle 
movements and noise would result in greater effects in proximity to the 
Generating Equipment Site where the construction of the development would 
have a greater influence on the aesthetic and perceptual aspects of the 
landscape. However for the majority of the aspect area there would be little 
tangible effect upon the aesthetic and perceptual qualities as the tracts of 
woodland planting and intervening hedgerows and localised variations in landform 
limit the effects on the setting of the wider aspect area resulting in minimal change 
to the overall landscape character.  
 
Magnitude of change would be Low which combined with a Medium sensitivity 
would result in a Minor Adverse effect.

Operation: 
Direct effects on this aspect area are covered above as part of the Generating 
Equipment Site. Once operational the Power Generation Plant would be a locally 
prominent development within a small part of this aspect area. Indirect effects 
would be limited to parts of the aspect area in closer proximity to the Generating 
Equipment Site. Whilst the ZTV suggests extensive theoretical visibility across the 
majority of this aspect area, the extensive tracts of woodland, hedgerows and 
localised variations in landform would substantially limit the indirect effects on this 
landscape. Furthermore this aspect area contains a number of features which are 
not dissimilar to the development including the Felindre Gas Compressor Station, 
Substations and numerous pylons and associated overhead lines which are 
prominent vertical structures across this aspect area. The overall character, scale 
and pattern of the landscape would remain largely unchanged. 
 
Magnitude of change would be Low with little change resulting to the overall 
character of this aspect area. Combined with the medium sensitivity, overall, 
Minor Adverse effects would result for this aspect area which would not diminish 
as the reinstatement planting matures as this is considered to have most 
noticeable effect on the more localised landscape structure within the more 
immediate Generating Equipment Site area and not aspect area wide.

Sensitivity: 
Taking into account value judgements and 
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity 
of the landscape character is considered to

Construction: 
The construction of the Gas Connection would result in temporary adverse 
effects as a result of the construction plant and activity involved in constructing 
the AGI along with an Access Road into it off the Rhyd-y-pandy road and the 
Gas Pipeline. The open trench method of constructing the Gas Pipeline 
connection would result in the temporary removal of grazing land and the 
permanent removal of sections of field boundary hedgerow and trees. 
Construction noise, activities and lighting would reduce the relative tranquillity 
in the vicinity of the Gas Connection Site for a temporary and relatively short 
period of time. 
 
Across the Pipeline route and AGI, the temporary presence of construction 
plant, 
activities 
and 
lighting 
would 
introduce 
noticeable 
features 
uncharacteristic of the landscape at present. As a result of these changes and 
the partial loss and alteration of some of the key characteristics, magnitude of

Operation: 
The route of the Gas Connection would be reinstated upon operation with fields 
returned to grazing and field boundaries reinstated with hedgerow and tree 
planting. Structure planting and reinstatement boundary vegetation would be 
planted around the AGI to assist in assimilating it within the immediate 
landscape pattern (Figure 11.10). Planting would extend up to existing field 
boundaries in order to retain the field pattern and avoid land severance.  
 
At year of opening the AGI would remain a new, although not entirely 
uncharacteristic component of the landscape and the magnitude of change 
would be Low.  Once the structure planting around the AGI establishes it would 
assist in providing partial screening and some additional structure to the 
landscape which alongside the reinstatement hedgerow planting and fields 
returned to grazing along the Gas Connection Route would assist in integrating 
elements of the development into the local landscape. Overall there would be 
some small changes to some localised landscape features which would result 
in little change to the overall landscape character. The magnitude of effect is 
considered to be Low which combined with the Medium sensitivity would result 
in a Minor Adverse effect on the landscape character.

The construction of the Electrical Connection would result in temporary 
adverse effects as a result of the construction plant and activity involved. The 
Electrical Connection route would follow the alignment of the new Access Road 
and so disruption associated with its construction would be similar to that of the 
new Access Road as described in the Power Generation Plant section above. 
This would entail the removal of trees and some woodland although the wider 
woodland structure and its associated strong degree of enclosure and shelter it 
currently provides would remain intact. 
 
Construction plant and activity would be very localised and would be within the 
parts of the landscape that are currently heavily influenced by overhead 
transmission lines, pylons, the Gas Compressor Station and Substation. As a 
result the temporary changes and the partial loss of some of landscape 
characteristics would result in a Low magnitude of change. 
 
The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the Low magnitude of change 
would result in a Minor Adverse effect on landscape character during 
construction.

Value:
This is a view containing relatively common

along with some detracting features and is
valued locally.  Value is considered to be
Medium.
Susceptibility:
This viewpoint is representative of views

Susceptibility is High.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity is
considered to be High.
Construction/decommissioning Phase:
Construction activity and plant associated with the
Project Site would be prominent in views from this
location. Whilst some of the construction of the lower
sections of plant would be screened by extensive
intervening woodland and landform the taller plant and
lighting would be prominent in the view.
Whilst the intervening woodland would limit the extent
of construction activity visible in the view in the
summer months, the degree of screening provided by
the woodland would reduce during winter months when
construction plant and activities including lighting,
whilst temporary, would be extensive and prominent
affecting a wide part of the view.
Magnitude of change would be High which when
combined with the High sensitivity would result in a
Major Adverse effect.
Major Adverse
Significant
No cumulative development would be
visible from this viewpoint.
Operational:
The Project Site and in particular the upper part of the
Generating Equipment would appear prominent in the
view, at close range, changing an extensive proportion
of the view, particularly during winter months. The
stack would appear against the skyline and whilst seen
in the context of the adjacent pylons, would be more
apparent due to the solid mass of the stack structure.
This along with the other taller structures in the Project
Site would remain prominent in the view, particularly
during the winter when the intervening vegetation
would offer less screening and cannot be mitigated.

Description of View:
This view is representative of
views 
from 
the 
residential
properties which line the south
side of Clasemont Road. There
are very few publicly accessible
views 
due 
to 
the 
roadside

Construction plant and activity associated with the
Power Generation Plant would be visible from this
elevated location, in the mid-ground of the view, seen
in the immediate context of the Felindre Gas
Compressor Station and Substation. Due to the
elevated views, the construction plant and activity
would not be visible against the skyline but seen
against a backcloth of vegetation, however, the
footprint of works would be more apparent as views
would be looking down on to it. Nonetheless the view
experienced by recreational users is panoramic and
the construction activity associated with the Project

Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity is

Operational:
Once operational the Gas Connection route would be
fully reinstated, although at year of opening the grazing
land and reinstated field boundaries would not have
established and so a corridor cutting across the
landscape would remain visible until the mitigation
planting and seeding establishes. Similarly the screen
planting around the AGI would take time to establish
and whilst it would not be visible from this particular
point on the PRoW it would be a noticeable feature in
views as walkers travel north until the screen planting
becomes mature.
Whilst the reinstatement planting establishes the
magnitude of change would be Low which when
combined with a Medium sensitivity would result in a
Minor Adverse effect at year of opening. Once the
reinstatement planting associated
with the Gas
Connection route becomes fully established (year 15)
there would be no discernible change in the view
resulting in a Negligible magnitude and Negligible

on 
the
boundary of the Gower AONB,
adjacent to the B4271.
Description of View:
This view is representative of
views from recreational users of
Fairwood Common adjacent to
the B4271. Foreground views
extend 
across 
the 
rough
grassland of the Common to the
wooded valley and settlement in
the mid ground of the view
extending to the north western
edge of Swansea. On clear
days, distant views extend to the
higher ground at Cwmcerdinen
Tor Cawdd and the Brecon
Beacons National Park in the far
distance.
Receptor Group:
Recreational
Value:
This is a view which is positioned on the
edge of the AONB, however the majority of
the landscape in the view is not within the
AONB and does not exhibit the special
qualities associated with the Gower. Whilst
encompassing peripheral views of the North
East Gower and Cockett Valley SLA, the
view contains relatively common elements
of the landscape and the value is therefore
considered to be Medium.
Susceptibility:
This 
viewpoint 
is 
representative 
of
recreational users accessing the Common,
whose attention and interest is likely to be
focussed on the landscape.  Susceptibility is
High.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity is
considered to be Medium.

Footpath on the north side of the
A48 Clasemont Road
Description of View:
This view is representative of
views 
from 
the 
residential
properties which line the south
side of Clasemont Road. There
are very few publicly accessible
views due to the roadside
hedgerow and tree planting
which line the north side of the
road and provide an effective
screen even in the winter.
Foreground views extend across
grazing land with pockets of
marshy vegetation. Extensive
tree and woodland cover with
hedgerows 
defining 
field
boundaries extends across the
mid ground of the view. Pylons
and 
transmission 
lines 
are
prominent features in the view
converging on the Substation
which is apparent in the centre
of the middle ground of the view.
The open moorland on the
distant hills provides a backdrop
to the view.

the landscape in the view is not within the
AONB and does not exhibit the special
qualities associated with the Gower. Whilst
encompassing peripheral views of the North
East Gower and Cockett Valley SLA, the
view contains relatively common elements
of the landscape and the value is therefore
considered to be Medium.
