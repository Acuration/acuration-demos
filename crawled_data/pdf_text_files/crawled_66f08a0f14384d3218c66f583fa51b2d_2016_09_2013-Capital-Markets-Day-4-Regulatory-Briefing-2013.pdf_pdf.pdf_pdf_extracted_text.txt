Renewables Obligation (RO)
Drax announced conversion plans and financing
predicated on three units under the RO scheme
Support mechanism for renewables since 2002
•
Well established, functioning market
Closes to new projects in March 2017
•
Replaced by CfDs(1)
2014 to 2017 – new projects eligible to apply for
either RO or CfD
For biomass conversions:
•
Support deemed to start in 2007 – RO ends 2027
•
Each unit conversion a separate project
For Drax:
•
First converted unit will remain in the RO
•
Support grandfathered at 1 ROC(3) until 2027
•
Subsequent conversions before 2017 may be RO or CfD
•
Any units converting after 2017 will be CfD
(1) Feed-in Tariff with Contracts for Difference
(2) Electricity Market Reform

“Conversion (…) to sustainable
biomass offers a quick, cost-
effective way to rapidly
decarbonise electricity generation
in the short to medium term, as
well as contributing to security of
supply”
EMR(2) Delivery Plan (July 2013)
RO – Economics
Strategic objective to contract biomass on
long-term basis
Converted units have an inbuilt (imperfect)
“ROC hedge” of fuel exposures
•
Absent in coal-fired generation
Analysis of biomass generation at 1 ROC
with power price range
•
With minimum gas prices and a value of carbon
– high confidence that prices will be >£30/MWh

Illustrative Spread Analysis
Biomass fuel cost
hedged by:
ROC income
Minimum expected
power price
Comfortable with long-term biomass contracts
without associated power sales
Advantages
Disadvantages
 Well established and functioning market
 Potential to benefit from positive power price
movements (e.g. capacity squeeze)
 ROC support levels for conversion now set and
grandfathered until biomass support expires in 2027
 Easy for suppliers (i.e. Haven) to manage on an
annual basis and generates positive working capital
for suppliers
 ROC price indexed to RPI
 Potential to benefit from higher recycling fees if there
is a shortage of ROCs in any year
× Exposure remains to power price falls, driven by gas
prices or removal / re-profiling of the carbon price floor
× Some political risk remains
× Buying power rests with the major suppliers, who have
a choice to purchase ROCs (at a discount) or pay the
buy-out
× Creates working capital issues for generators, as
payments typically settled in August following the end
of the compliance year
DECC now consulting on measures regarding the transition from RO to CfD
•
RO setting may move to February each year from the previous September – more accurate RO setting
•
Fixed price ROCs may be introduced from 2017
RO – Pros and Cons

CfDs – Background
Future support regime for low carbon
generation
CfD characteristics
•
Private law contract
•
Term of support limited to 2027 for converted units
•
Designed to deliver stable revenue through difference
payments to sales in power market
Draft strike prices published June 2013
•
Set at a discount to RO to reflect lower risk
•
Consultation underway
Payments under CfD funded through a levy on
electricity suppliers
Contract terms under development by DECC in
close consultation with industry

CfDs – Investment Contracts and Enduring
Early CfDs – run under the FID process
•
Known as ‘Investment Contracts’
•
Drax second and third unit conversion being
considered by DECC for investment contracts
•
DECC to publish final strike prices December 2013
•
Award dependent on specific selection criteria, if total
eligible projects exceed budget capacity
•
Effectiveness conditional on approval by Parliament of
Energy Bill and EU approval under state aid provisions

(1) Final Investment Decision
(2) Levy Control Framework
‘Standard’ CfDs – the enduring CfD process
•
Targeted for applications in H2 2014
•
Drax units not operating under RO or
contracted under FID CfD – eligible to apply
•
Initially, CfDs will be allocated with strike prices
that are set administratively by Government
•
Competitive process to be instituted if strong
investor interest relative to budgets
(2)
CfDs – Pros and Cons
Advantages
 Bilateral contract with a Government
owned counterparty
 Reduced political risk
 Provides revenue certainty and therefore
protection against downside power price
scenarios – positive ratings impact
 Working capital benefits – difference
payments payable shortly after generation
Disadvantages
× Caps upside from high power prices
× Still exposed to fuel price volatility,
including foreign exchange movements

Clarity on regulatory position likely to
happen in stages
CfDs could be an attractive option for Drax
•
Reduce political risk
•
Provide more earnings / cash certainty
But subject to outcome of:
•
Price and contractual consultations
•
Competitive process
Other key issues still to be resolved
•
Payment mechanics
•
Change in law provisions
•
Pass through of industry charges
•
Consistency with RO on sustainability issues
•
Termination and suspension rights
•
Allocation process and triggers for auctioning
•
State aid approval
Levy Control Framework (LCF)
Covers RO, CfDs, FiT(1) but not capacity payments
Sets a cap on the impact of renewable support schemes on consumer bills
Flexibility provisions
•
20% headroom to total cap allowed on annual basis
Biomass projections within cap
•
Priority on low cost projects
•
Under National Grid scenarios, deployment of 2.6-4GW of biomass conversions consistent with LCF
assumptions and meeting 2020 targets
Worst case – LCF under pressure and DECC implement constraint management
•
Limit number of FID CfD awards?
•
Force enduring CfD into competitive auction?
•
RO banding review to reduce “ungrandfathered” support?

Capacity Mechanism
Capacity mechanism being developed under EMR
Ensure security of supply in the face of falling reserve margins
Proposed process now published
•
Two auction processes to be held – four years ahead and one year ahead of delivery year
•
All generators mandated to go through pre-qualification process, but are not required to bid
•
New capacity providers bid volume into an auction – four years ahead of the delivery year
-
e.g. 2014 auction for delivery in Winter 2018/19
•
RO or CfD-accredited plant not eligible to participate
•
Existing capacity providers able to bid for one year contracts
Proposals moving in the right direction, but economics not currently compelling
•
High penalty regime means risk / reward balance currently unattractive for Drax coal units
•
Caps on auction bids unlikely to attract the new build capacity envisioned by DECC, particularly CCGTs
We will continue to review proposals but work to do to create value for Drax
Drax Group plc

Implications for Drax
Capacity Mechanism
RO and CfD-accredited units excluded from capacity mechanism
Work to do to create value for Drax
RO
Plans for conversion developed and financed under the RO
Investment case remains strong
CfDs
Potential upside from CfDs if risk / return balance attractive vs. RO

Appendix: RO Mechanics
Obligation on suppliers – set annually by DECC
•
Includes fixed 10% headroom
Suppliers present ROCs to demonstrate
compliance
•
Where insufficient ROCs presented, suppliers pay
a penalty – the buy-out price
•
Buy-out fund is recycled to suppliers who presented
