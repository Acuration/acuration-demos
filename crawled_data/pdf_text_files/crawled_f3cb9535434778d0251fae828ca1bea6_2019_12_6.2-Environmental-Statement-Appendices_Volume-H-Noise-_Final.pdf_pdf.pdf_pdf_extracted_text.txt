7.1 - Noise Terminology 
 
 
 
 
7.1 – Acoustics Terminology  
The acoustic terms used in this report are as follows: 
 
Abbreviation 
Definition 
 
dB                 
Decibel - Used as a measurement of sound 
pressure level. It is the logarithmic ratio of the 
noise being assessed to a standard reference 
level. 
 
dBA             
The human ear is more susceptible to mid-
frequency noise than the high and low 
frequencies.  To take account of this when 
measuring noise, the 'A' weighting scale is used 
so that the measured noise corresponds roughly 
to the overall level of noise that is discerned by 
the average human.  It is also possible to 
calculate the 'A' weighted noise level by applying 
certain 
corrections 
to 
an 
un-weighted 
spectrum.  The measured or calculated 'A' 
weighted noise level is known as the dBA level. 
 
Because of being a logarithmic scale noise levels 
in dBA do not have a linear relationship to each 
other.  For similar noises, a change in noise level 
of 10dBA represents a doubling or halving of 
subjective loudness.  A change of 3dBA is just 
perceptible. 
 
L10 & L90 
If a non-steady noise is to be described it is 
necessary to know both its level and the degree 
of fluctuation.  The Ln indices are used for this 
purpose, and the term refers to the level 
exceeded for n% of the time, hence L10 is the level 
exceeded for 10% of the time and as such can be 
regarded 
as 
the 
'average 
maximum 
level'.  Similarly, L90 is the average minimum level 
and is often used to describe the background 
noise. 
 
It is common practice to use the L10 index to 
describe traffic noise, as being a high average, it 
considers the increased annoyance that results 
from the non-steady nature of traffic noise. 
Leq           
The concept of Leq (equivalent continuous sound 
level) has up to recently been primarily used in 
assessing noise in industry but seems now to be 
finding use in defining many other types of noise, 
Abbreviation 
Definition 
 
such as aircraft noise, environmental noise and 
construction noise. 
 
Leq is defined as a notional steady sound level 
which, over a stated period, would contain the 
same amount of acoustical energy as the actual, 
fluctuating sound measured over that period 
(e.g. 1 hour). 
 
The use of digital technology in sound level 
meters now makes the measurement of Leq very 
straightforward. 
 
Lmax            
Lmax is the maximum sound pressure level 
recorded over the period stated. Lmax is 
sometimes used in assessing environmental 
noise where occasional loud noises occur, which 
may have little effect on the Leq noise level. 
 
LOAEL 
Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels 
 
SOAEL 
Significant Observed Adverse Effect Levels

Introduction 
1.1 
Background 
1.1.1 
A Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) was prepared in May 2017 to support 
the formal consultation stage of the Millbrook Power Project - an up to 299MW Open Cycle Gas 
Turbine Peaking power generating station, together with an associated Gas and Electrical 
Connection. CBC have reviewed and provided comment on the PEIR. Since the submission of 
the PEIR additional acoustic work has been undertaken to assess the potential noise and 
vibration impact associated with the operational phase of the Project.  
1.1.2 
Previous acoustic work can be found in the submitted PEIR (Chapter 7).  
1.1.3 
The purpose of this report is therefore as follows: 
� 
To set out Project proposals relating the potential noise and vibration impact; 
� 
To present the results of the additional environmental sound surveys undertaken at the 
nearest noise sensitive receptor; 
� 
To set out the assessment criteria to be implemented; and 
� 
To present an assessment that incorporates all up to date and relevant information.  
1.1.4 
This report is technical in nature. To assist the reader, an explanation of the terminology used 
in this report is contained in Appendix A.

Project Proposals 
2.1.1 
A full description of the Project is provided in Chapters 1 and 3 of the submitted PEIR.  
2.1.2 
However, in brief, the Project comprises: 
� 
A new Power Generation Plant; 
� 
A new gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the 
National Transmission System (The Gas Connection); and 
� 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System (the Electrical Connection) comprising an 
underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will replace 
an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route 
corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two 
SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would 
then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres in length to a new 
substation (the ‘Substation’). The Power Generation Plant is in the form of an OCGT 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of 
up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, 
measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
� 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
2.1.3 
It is likely that the only components of the Project that have the potential to cause an adverse 
noise and vibration effect during operation are elements associated with the Power Generation 
Plant (e.g. turbine blades and cooling equipment in the form of Fin-Fan Coolers.  Justification 
to scope out the other elements of the development are provided in the submitted PEIR which 
also reports on any impacts from the construction of the Project. 
2.1.4 
Since the submission of the PEIR, further discussions with potential EPC contractors  have 
been undertaken to ascertain feasible reductions in the noise emissions from the Generating 
Equipment to reduce the likely noise impact from the Project using a combination of improved 
enclosures and lower noise generating equipment. The following acoustic attributes and 
dimensions are now being proposed by the Applicant to inform the assessments undertaken.

Assessment Criteria 
3.1.1 
All relevant national policies, local policies and technical guidance are documented in the 
submitted PEIR.  
3.1.2 
The type of noise produced by the Generating Equipment is classified as industrial noise. 
Technical guidance to assess such noise is presented in British Standard 4142:2014 “Methods 
for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. 
3.1.3 
The procedure contained in BS4142 assesses the significance of sound which depends upon 
the margin by which the rating level of the specific sound sources exceeds the background 
sound level and the context in which the sound occurs/will occur. 
3.1.4 
An initial estimate of the impact of the specific sound is obtained by subtracting the measured 
background sound level from the rating level and considering the following: 
� 
Typically, the greater this difference, the greater the magnitude of the impact; 
� 
A difference of around +10 dB or more is likely to be an indication of a significant adverse 
impact, depending on the context; 
� 
A difference of around +5 dB is likely to be an indication of an adverse impact, depending 
on the context; and 
� 
The lower the rating level is relative to the measured background sound level, the less likely 
it is that the specific sound source will have an adverse impact or a significant adverse 
impact. Where the rating level does not exceed the background sound level, this is an 
indication of the specific sound source having a low impact, depending on the context. 
3.1.5 
BS 4142 does not provide specific values for LOAELs and SOAELs for sound from 
commercial/industrial sources however based on the above definitions it would be reasonable 
to consider “a difference of around +5 dB” as corresponding to the LOAEL and “a difference of 
around +10 dB” as corresponding to the SOAEL.  
3.1.6 
With regards to all appropriate policies and guidance, the proposed assessment criteria for the 
Project are therefore set out below in Table 3.1. The following values are as originally set out 
in the PEIR. 
Table 3.1 Proposed LOAEL and SOAELs 
Adverse Effect Level 
Difference Between Rating Level (LAr,Tr) and 
Background Sound Level (LA90,T) 
LOAEL

SOAEL 
+ 10 dB 
3.2 
Context 
3.2.1 
The significance of sound of an industrial nature depends upon both the margin by which the 
rating level of the specific sound source exceeds the background sound level and the context 
in which the sound occurs. A new industrial development is being introduced to the noise climate 
that has the potential to cause an adverse impact on noise sensitive receptors. Where 
background noise levels are relatively low, if the calculated rating levels exceed the background

Environmental Sound Surveys 
4.1 
Methodology 
4.1.1 
Previous noise measurements (as reported in the PEIR) were undertaken in 2014 and 2015. 
Given the time that has elapsed since the original surveys an additional fully automated 
environmental sound survey was undertaken over a period of 1 week from approximately 09:00 
hours on Friday 08 September 2017 to approximately 09:00 hours on Friday 15 September 
2017 in order to determine the current sound climate at the closest noise sensitive receptor. 
4.1.2 
Sound measurements were undertaken at a single position, as agreed with CBC, and are 
indicated in Figure 1 and summarised in Table 4.1.  
 
Figure 1: Approximate Noise Survey Location 
Table 4.1: Measurement Positions 
Position 
Description 
LT1 
The microphone was located on the western boundary of the Project Site 
approximately 10 m to the east of the closest façade of South Pillinge Farm. The 
microphone was located at a height of approximately 1.5 m.   
 
4.1.3 
Due to the nature of the survey (i.e. unattended), it is not possible to accurately comment on 
the weather conditions throughout the entire survey period. However, using historic data from 
the Weather Company LLC, (obtained from www.wunderground.com) heavy rain is likely to 
have occurred between 16:00 – 17:00 hours and 14:00 – 15:00 hours on the 08 September 
2017 and 09 September 2017 respectively. These periods have been excluded from the results.  
In addition, heavy rain occurred for the majority of the night-time period on 12 September 2017 
and has therefore been excluded from the assessment. The temperature ranged between 12°C 
to 18°C over the survey period.

Environmental Sound Climate 
4.3.1 
The dominant noise source at the measurement position was noted to be noise associated with 
farmyard activities. Vehicular movements on the surrounding road network along with train 
movements from the nearby Millbrook station were also audible.  
4.4 
Assumptions/Limitations 
4.4.1 
The site engineer noticed nothing unusual in terms of the noise climate at the time of the survey. 
This report refers, within the limitations stated, to the environment of the site in the context of 
the surrounding area at the time of the inspections. Environmental conditions can vary and no 
warranty is given as to the possibility of changes in the environment of the site and surrounding 
area at differing times. 
4.5 
Environmental Sound Survey Results 
The results of the sound survey have been plotted on Time History Graphs enclosed in 
Appendix B, presenting the 15 minute A-weighted (dB) L10, L90, Leq and Lmax levels at the 
measurement position throughout the duration of the survey.

*Excluding periods of rain as identified in paragraph 4.1.3. 
**It is understood that the measurement location was subject to a sustained thunderstorm during the night time 
measurement period. This period has therefore been excluded from the calculation of the average background sound 
levels.

Background Noise Levels 
4.6.1 
For the purpose of this assessment typical background sound levels have been derived using 
the most recent environmental sound survey results measured during the proposed operational 
periods. Thies are detailed in Table 4.4.

4.6.2 
The typical background sound levels are around 3dB above the background sound levels 
presented in the submitted PEIR from surveys undertaken in 2014 / 2015. There were no 
obvious sources of noise in the vicinity of the survey location that were not present during those 
previous surveys. It is therefore considered that the increase in measured background sound 
levels is as a result of a general increase in sound levels due to increased development in the 
area around the Project Site. The LLRS construction works were not audible at the 
measurement location and are not operational at night, therefore it is unlikely that the 
construction works have influenced the measured noise levels.

Noise Impact Assessment 
5.1 
Acoustic model  
5.1.1 
To undertake detailed noise calculations of the Generating Equipment, the acoustic modelling 
software SoundPLAN version 7.4 has been used. The acoustic model has been used to predict 
the rating levels of the Generating Equipment at the closest noise sensitive receptors.  
5.2 
Operational Noise – Power Generation Plant 
5.2.1 
The worst case situation of the Generating Equipment has been modelled comprising one Gas 
Turbine Generator with dimensions of 50 m (length) x 13 m (width) x 25 m (height). These 
dimensions represent elements of the Gas Turbine Generator which could emit noise. The Gas 
Turbine Generator has a stack height of up to 35 m as per the maximum dimensions stated in 
Chapter 3 of the PEIR. The model also considers the Fin Fan Cooler unit with dimensions of 10 
m (Height) x 28 m (Length) x 14 m (Width). As above, these dimensions represent elements of 
the Fin Fan coolers which could emit noise.  
5.2.2 
Table 5.1 presents the calculated rating level of the Generating Equipment at the closest noise 
sensitive receptor (South Pillinge Farm). They are external free field noise levels predicted 
outside the windows of the property.

Contextual factors 
5.2.5 
In addition to the assessment provided above, it is noted that there are several contextual 
factors which should be taken into consideration as follows: 
� 
The Generating Equipment could run up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in any given year, 
provided that the 5 year rolling average does not exceed 1,500 hours. For the purposes of 
the EIA, a worst case yearly maximum of 2,250 running hours has been assessed); 
� 
The likely operating regime of the Generating Equipment (i.e. likely to be run during hours 
of peak electricity demand which is typically during the daytime (e.g. outside the time when 
the lowest background noise levels will occur).  
� 
The likely non-tonal nature of cumulative noise from the Generating Equipment; 
� 
A single worst affected NSR; 
� 
The location of the nearby Marston Vale Railway Line; 
� 
The location of the nearby Bedford – London Railway Line; 
� 
Minimal levels of operational vibration; 
� 
The location of the nearby proving ground; 
� 
The location of windows on the NSR which do not overlook the Generating Equipment; and 
� 
Potential noise from nearby developments. 
5.2.6 
With reference to BS4142 this is an indication of the specific sound source having a low impact, 
depending on the context. In considering the context of the application as outlined above it is 
not considered necessary to modify the indicative numerical assessment. 
5.2.7 
A comparison of the calculated rating level with the LOAEL and SOAEL identified in Section 3 
indicate that the rating level associated with the operation of the facility falls significantly below 
the proposed LOAEL.

Proposed Noise Requirement 
5.2.13 Based on the assessment presented above, and taking into consideration the contextual factors 
presented, we would suggest that a Requirement is attached to the DCO which states: 
“Control of noise during operation 
  
12.—(1) Prior to the date of final commissioning a written noise scheme providing for the control of 
noise generated during the operation of the authorised development must be submitted to and 
approved by the relevant planning authority. The noise scheme must include the following: 
  
(a) the locations at which noise will be monitored; 
(b) the defined representative background sound level at South Pillinge Farm house; 
(c) the method of noise measurement (which must be in accord with BS 4142:2014, an equivalent 
successor standard or other agreed noise measurement methodology appropriate to the 
circumstances) and when such measurements will be carried out; and 
(d) a complaints procedure. 
  
(2) Except in the case of an emergency, noise (in terms of the BS 4142:2014 rating level) emitted from 
the operation of the authorised development must be no greater than the defined representative 
background sound level as approved in the noise scheme submitted pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) 
  
(3) The noise scheme must be carried out as approved”.

Conclusion  
6.1.1 
A PEIR was submitted in May 2017 for the Millbrook Power Project which included a preliminary 
noise impact assessment. Since the submission of the PEIR additional acoustic work has been 
undertaken to assess the potential noise and vibration impact associated with the operational 
phase of the proposed development based on revised parameters and additional mitigation. 
This report summarises those results.  
6.1.2 
All relevant national policies, local policies and technical guidance are documented in the 
submitted PEIR. Based on the relevant technical guidance suitable assessment criteria have 
been suggested. 
6.1.3 
A fully automated environmental sound survey was undertaken over a period of 1 week from 
approximately 09:00 hours on Friday 08 September 2017 to approximately 09:00 hours on 
Friday 15 September 2017 in order to determine the current sound climate at the closest noise 
sensitive receptor. For the purpose of this assessment typical background sound levels have 
been derived using the results of the most recent environmental sound surveys.  
6.1.4 
Since the submission of the PEIR, further discussions with EPC contractors have been 
undertaken to ascertain feasible reductions in the noise emissions from the Generating 
Equipment to reduce the likely noise impact from the Project. Based on the revised plant 
proposals a revised noise impact assessment has been undertaken. 
6.1.5 
Calculations indicated that the rating level associated with the Generating Equipment is likely to 
fall below the background sound levels at South Pillage Farm by approximately 8dB during the 
daytime and 1dB during the night-time.  With reference to BS4142 this is an indication of the 
specific sound source having a low impact, depending on the context.  
6.1.6 
A comparison of the calculated rating level with the LOAEL and SOAEL identified in Section 3 
indicate that the rating level associated with the operation of the facility falls significantly below 
the proposed LOAEL. 
6.1.7 
Calculations indicated that the cumulative rating level associated with Generating Equipment 
and the Covanta RRF project is likely to be around 1dB above background sound levels at South 
Pillinge Farm during the night-time and -4 dB below the background sound levels during the 
daytime.   
6.1.8 
With reference to BS4142 this is an indication of the specific sound source having a low impact, 
depending on the context. In considering the context of the application it is not considered 
necessary to modify the indicative numerical assessment. 
6.1.9 
A comparison of the calculated rating level with the LOAEL and SOAEL identified in Section 3 
indicate that the cumulative rating levels associated with the operation of the proposed facility 
and the Covanta RRF Project are likely to fall below the proposed LOAEL.

Acoustic Terminology 
 
Parameter 
Description 
Ambient Noise 
Level 
The totally encompassing sound in a given situation at a given time, usually 
composed of a sound from many sources both distant and near (LAeq,T). 
Daytime 
The period 07:00-23:00 hours. 
Decibel (dB) 
A scale for comparing the ratios of two quantities, including sound pressure and 
sound power. The difference in level between two sounds s1 and s2 is given by 
20 log10 (s1/s2). The decibel can also be used to measure absolute quantities by 
specifying a reference value that fixes one point on the scale. For sound 
pressure, the reference value is 20µPa. The threshold of normal hearing is in the 
region of 0 dB and 140 dB is the threshold of pain. A change of 1 dB is only 
perceptible under controlled conditions. 
dB(A), LAx 
 
Decibels measured on a sound level meter incorporating a frequency weighting 
(A weighting) which differentiates between sounds of different frequency (pitch) in 
a similar way to the human ear. Measurements in dB(A) broadly agree with 
people’s assessment of loudness. A change of 3 dB(A) is the minimum 
perceptible under normal conditions, and a change of 10 dB(A) corresponds 
roughly to halving or doubling the loudness of a sound. The background noise in 
a living room may be about 30 dB(A); normal conversation about 60 dB(A) at 1 
metre; heavy road traffic about 80 dB(A) at 10 metres; the level near a pneumatic 
drill about 100 dB(A). 
Fast Time 
Weighting 
Setting on sound level meter, denoted by a subscript F, that determines the 
speed at which the instrument responds to changes in the amplitude of any 
measured signal. The fast time weighting can lead to higher values than the slow 
time weighting when rapidly changing signals are measured. The average time 
constant for the fast response setting is 0.125 (1/8) seconds. 
Free-field 
Sound pressure level measured outside, far away from reflecting surfaces 
(except the ground), usually taken to mean at least 3.5 metres 
Façade 
Sound pressure level measured at a distance of 1 metre in front of a large sound 
reflecting object such as a building façade. 
LAeq,T 
A noise level index called the equivalent continuous noise level over the time 
period T. This is the level of a notional steady sound that would contain the same 
amount of sound energy as the actual, possibly fluctuating, sound that was 
recorded. 
Lmax,T 
A noise level index defined as the maximum noise level recorded during a noise 
event with a period T. Lmax is sometimes used for the assessment of occasional 
loud noises, which may have little effect on the overall Leq noise level but will still 
affect the noise environment. Unless described otherwise, it is measured using 
the 'fast' sound level meter response. 
L10,T 
A noise level index. The noise level exceeded for 10% of the time over the period 
T. L10 can be considered to be the "average maximum" noise level. Generally 
used to describe road traffic noise. LA10,18h is the A –weighted arithmetic 
average of the 18 hourly LA10,1h values from 06:00-24:00. 
L90,T or 
Background 
Noise Level 
A noise level index. The noise level exceeded for 90% of the time over the period 
T. L90 can be considered to be the "average minimum" noise level and is often 
used to describe the background noise.
