1.  Headlines
2020 has got off to a pretty poor start. Britain was 
battered by storms throughout January and February. 
Unprecedented rainfall flooded thousands of homes, but 
the accompanying gales sent wind power to new records.
Then in March, the coronavirus pandemic took hold in  
the UK. Social distancing was followed by a full lockdown. 
Businesses closed and people stayed home, sending 
electricity demand down to levels not seen since the 
1980s, and power prices to a 12-year low. Day-ahead prices 
averaged just £28/MWh during March, a fall of one-third 
over the last year.
The daily average electricity generation mix (top) and day-ahead power price (bottom), illustrating the major events over the last quarter
Britain moved ever closer to a complete phase-out of coal 
power. Two coal plants retired at the end of the quarter 
as they were no longer profitable. Before shutting, they 
burnt through their remaining stockpiles of fuel, running 
continuously for 117 days over winter. National output from 
coal over the quarter was up for the first time in eight years.
With record wind output and depressed demand, electricity 
generation from fossil fuels was down 25% on this quarter 
last year, the largest fall on record. This also gave one of the 
lowest quarterly carbon intensities on record. With an average 
of 173 g/kWh, emissions were down 20% on this time last year.

On March 23rd the UK took an unprecedented move to 
tackle the coronavirus. Most business that had not already 
closed moved online, with millions of people now working 
from home. This had a huge impact on electricity demand: 
consumption on weekdays fell by 13% to its lowest levels 
since 1982 – a time when there were 10 million fewer people 
in the country, and GDP was a third lower than today.
Other regions have seen a similar collapse in electricity 
demand. Spain, Italy and France have all seen electricity 
demand fall by 10–15% according to analysis by Ember. Across 
the Atlantic, New York City has seen similar reductions.
Demand has fallen for a simple reason: with schools and 
workplaces now closed or running with a greatly reduced 
staff – machinery, computers, lights and heaters are not 
Daily average electricity demand in Britain across all working days in March
drawing power. Electric rail, tram and tube systems are 
also running a reduced service. On the contrary, with more 
people at home, household electricity consumption has 
increased. Octopus Energy estimate that during social 
distancing (before the stricter lockdown came into effect) 
homes were consuming up to a third more electricity, 
adding £20 per month to the typical bill.
The impact of lockdown on Britain’s electricity demand is 
much like living through a month of Sundays. The average 
profile for a March weekend day in previous years looks 
very similar to the daily profile for weekdays since lockdown 
begun – both in the amount of electricity consumed and 
the structure. Post-lockdown weekends have even lower 
demand, tracking 11% below weekday demand.

Average daily electricity demand profiles during March and April,

People no longer have to get up at the crack of dawn for 
work. On a typical weekday morning, demand would rise by 
10 GW over two hours from 5:30 to 7:30 AM. Now it takes 
more than twice as long – until midday – for this rise to 
occur. At the other end of the day, there would normally be 
a small peak in demand around 8 PM from people gathering 
in pubs and restaurants up and down the country. Both 
on weekdays and weekends, demand begins falling earlier 
in the evening as the sofa has become the only available 
social venue.
With lower demand comes lower power prices. Wholesale 
electricity prices are typically 7% lower on Sundays than 
on weekdays for this reason. March saw the lowest 
monthly-average power price in 12 years, down one-third 
on this month last year. Prices were already heading 
downwards because of the falling price of gas, but the 
lockdown has amplified this, and negative prices have 
become commonplace during the middle of the day. There 
was not a visible impact on carbon emissions during the 
first quarter of the year, as only the last week of March 
was affected.  
However, as lockdown continued into April and May, 
emissions from power production in Britain have fallen 
by 35% on the same period last year. The effect is slightly 
stronger across Europe, with carbon emissions falling 
almost 40% as dirtier coal and lignite power stations are 
being turned down.
Will some of these effects persist after lockdown 
restrictions are eased? It is too early to tell, as it depends 
on what long-lasting economic and behavioural changes 
occur. Electricity demand is linked with the country’s GDP, 
which is set to face the largest downturn in three centuries. 
Whether the economy bounces back, or is afflicted with 
a lasting depression will be key to future electricity 
demand. It will also depend on behavioural shifts. People 
are of course craving their lost freedoms, but many may 
appreciate not going back to a lengthy daily commute – 
and the rise of video conferencing and collaboration apps 
has shown that remote working may finally have come of 
age. With even a small share of the population continuing 
to work from home on some days, there could be a lasting 
impact on electricity demand for years to come.

The carbon price paid by British power stations averaged £37.60 per tonne of CO2, averaged over the quarter.
3.  A final fling with coal power
Two of Britain’s oldest coal power stations closed on 
March 31st, leaving just three left on the mainland. But 
before shutting down they burnt through their remaining 
stockpiles of fuel, pushing up Britain’s coal consumption 
for the first time since 2012.
Coal phase-out took another huge step this quarter. 3.5 GW  
of capacity was retired, leaving just over 5 GW – a far cry from 
the 28 GW that were operating just 10 years ago. 80% of the 
coal power stations once operating in Britain have now fallen 
silent, with capacity halving over the last twelve months.
Installed coal power station capacity over the last decade
Average coal generation over winter months at times of different power prices
Fiddler’s Ferry in Cheshire and Aberthaw B in south 
Wales were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and 
had operated for nearly 50 years. Both closures were 
announced last summer on financial grounds, as the UK’s 
strong carbon price1 meant they could no longer compete 
with the lower cost of gas and renewables.
Rather than go out with a whimper, these stations increased 
their output over winter. Coal power generation was up 3% 
on the same quarter last year. While absolute output was 
small (4% of electricity consumed over the quarter), this 
was the first year-on-year rise in eight years. For the first 
time since 2017, there was not a single hour with zero coal 
generation over the majority of winter. Coal continued 
generating without pause for 117 days straight, from 
November 12th through to March 8th. The previous winter 
saw almost 400 coal-free hours during the same period.
It appears these plants ran consistently whether or 
not they could make a profit from selling power. During 
the winter (October 2019 to March 2020), coal plants 
continued producing 750 MW all the way down to prices 
of –£75/MWh. The winter before that, coal plants almost 
never ran when power prices fell below £45/MWh. 
Why might they have been willing to pay handsomely to dispose 
of their electricity? Coal stockpiles must be actively managed 
to prevent uncontrolled fires. Coal power stations can sit on 
several months’ worth of fuel, and there are relatively few 
buyers of coal left in the country. Generating power (even at 
times of low or negative power prices) may have proven less 
costly than safe disposal of fuel after the plants had shut.
Going forwards, coal generation is likely to be lower than ever. 
With reduced demand and growing renewable output, Britain 
had already gone 35 days without any coal generation at the 
time of going to press. Of the three remaining coal stations, 
Drax’s coal units will cease operating in March 2021. The 
other stations may well retire before the government’s 
2025 deadline; marking the end of an era.

Britain’s wind farms had a bumper quarter, with output 
up 40% on this time last year. A succession of severe 
winter storms battered the country, giving the wettest and 
windiest February since records began. This helped make 
February the first month on record when more electricity 
was produced by wind farms than gas-fired power stations 
across the country.
The two were neck and neck over the whole quarter: wind 
supplied 30.5% of Britain’s electricity, versus 30.6% from gas. 
This pushed the supply from all renewables to over 40% of 
electricity consumed, overtaking output from fossil fuels for 
the first time. The exceptional output was driven for a large 
part by extreme weather. Storm Ciara hit in early February, 
and was followed just days after by Storm Dennis, one of 
the most intense ever recorded in the UK. Together these 
killed eight people, left half a million without power and 
brought devastating flooding across Wales, the Midlands, 
Cumbria and Yorkshire.
The contribution of wind would have been even higher if the 
Western Link (which connects Scotland, Wales and England) 
had been functioning normally. The £1.3bn subsea cable  
4.  Wind power surges to new records
The share of electricity supplied by renewables and fossil fuels each quarter over the past decade
went fully operational in December, but suffered an 
unplanned outage between 10th January and 8th February 
which impacted around 2.2 GW of wind farms, or 10% the 
UK’s wind capacity. Ofgem is currently investigating the 
performance of the cable, which should help to alleviate 
constraints that force Scottish wind farms to turn off 
when their output cannot be transported down to the 
rest of the country.
Britain’s wind farms ran at all-time high capacity factors, in 
February averaging 50% for onshore and 60% for offshore 
wind farms. This was significantly higher than fossil-fuelled 
power stations (34% for gas and just 17% for coal), and 
higher even than the country’s nuclear reactor fleet (59%).
Looking ahead, wind generation records will continue 
being broken as two major offshore wind farms are due 
to come online later this year. Hornsea One (1,218 MW) 
and East Anglia One (714 MW) will both dwarf the world’s 
largest operating wind farm (Walney Extension, also in 
the UK). Together they will power over 1.5 million homes, 
and bring the UK’s total offshore wind capacity to over 
10 GW – the largest fleet in the world.

Two cold, calm spells punctuated the record wind output 
last quarter. Demand-side response operated full force 
to help during the first event in January. It was much less 
prominent during the second event in March, giving very 
different consequences for the power system. 
The first spell happened in mid-January. Wind output 
fell to a low of 2.6 GW across Wednesday 22nd. One week 
either side of this it was five times higher at over 14 GW. 
Gas and coal output increased to fill the void, but also the 
evening peak in demand disappeared.
At that time of year, demand typically rises 5–6 GW between 
2:30 and 5:30 PM, but on these days the rise was less than 
half of this. Factories, supermarkets and a host of other 
consumers automatically reduced their demand during the 
peak hours. This prevented demand on the transmission 
system (the thick line in the chart below) from going above 
47.5 GW, and meant that day-ahead power prices remained 
normal – peaking at just £86/MWh on the 22nd.
The second event came on Wednesday the 4th of March. 
Again, wind output fell to just 2.2 GW, from highs of 14 
GW a few days either side. And although it was a couple 
of degrees warmer and demand was lower, the system 
became extremely stressed in the late evening.  
The ‘loss of load probability’ rose to 37%, meaning a one-
in-three chance of widespread blackouts as supply and 
demand were cutting close. There was just 0.2 GW of spare 
capacity available on the evening of the 4th, compared to 
over 4 GW the next day. This sent the balancing price to a 
high of £2,234/MWh – numbers not seen for over a decade.
Demand-side response had not activated to such an 
extent on the evening peaks. Between November and 
February, large consumers can save money by avoiding 
power consumption during ‘the triads’ – the three half-
hour periods of the year with the highest system demand. 
Avoiding these triads reduces their network charge for the 
coming year, which can be a significant portion of their 
total bill. As this financial incentive to avoid peaks doesn’t 
exist in March, facilities kept on running – at the risk of 
creating power outages.
The triads will be phased out two years from now, pushing 
up energy costs for large electricity consumers such as 
industry, water treatment and supermarkets. New markets 
for flexibility will be required if we wish for these firms  
to continue contributing towards security at times of  
peak demand.

Electricity which was not consumed due to triad avoidance is not recorded and so must be estimated. We used the typical daily profile for each day of the week from recent years with similar temperatures to 
reconstruct a demand estimate.

6.  Capacity and production statistics
This quarter saw wind come within striking distance of beating gas 
for the first time ever – with just 0.1 TWh separating them. Wind farm 
capacity factors averaged nearly 50% over the quarter, well above their 
long-run average of 30% (26% for onshore and 37% for offshore).
Electricity generation from fossil fuels was down an incredible 25% 
on this quarter last year – the largest single fall on record. Gas- 
fired power stations ran at an average of just 38% of their installed 
capacity over the quarter – a lower utilisation than onshore wind 
farms. However, at their peak, fossil fuel plants needed to run at 
near-full capacity at some point during the quarter (96% for gas, 
83% for coal). This shows there is still a need to keep these assets 
around for times when demand is high and renewable output is 
low, at least until other flexible technologies can take their place.

7.  Power system records
This was a record-breaking quarter for renewables and low-carbon 
power sources. Britain’s wind farms broke all records, most notably 
by supplying an average of 12.3 GW through February, smashing 
previous record of 9.3 GW set back in December 2019.
Biomass supplied more than a tenth of electricity over a day for the 
first time on 27th March. Instantaneous output from all renewables 
exceeded 25 GW for the first time ever for a period on 12th March, up 
11% on the previous record set one year ago.
March saw the lowest monthly-average power prices for more than 
a decade. The impact of the coronavirus lockdown is not yet breaking 
all-time record lows for demand, as these tend to happen in summer 
when people are away on holidays.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2020) and 
report the record output and share of electricity generation, plus 
sustained averages over a day, a month and a calendar year. Cells

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants. 
The operation of battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not publicly available.
