The Project Key Details  
 
●  the construction, operation and maintenance of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (also known
  
as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine) Power Generation Plant
 
●  the Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas
 
●  it is designed to provide fexible back-up generation capacity, which can respond quickly
  
and efciently to short-term variation in electricity demand, intermittent output from
  
renewable power generation and periods of system stress 
 
●  the Power Generation Plant could operate for up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in any  
 
  
given year, provided that the fve-year rolling average does not exceed 1,500 hours per year
 
●  the Power Generation Plant will have one stack of up to 35m in height from the base
  
of Rookery South Pit
 
●  the site for the generating equipment and substation covers an area of approximately
  
8 hectares (20 acres) and is located within Rookery South Pit itself
 
●  the construction, operation and maintenance of a new underground electrical   
 
  
connection together with a new substation to connect the Power Generation Plant 
  
to the existing overhead power line nearby
 
●  the layout of the electrical connection is yet to be fnalised but an area within which
  
the connection will be sited has been identifed; MPL will work with National Grid on
  
the indicative design of the connection over the coming months
 
●  the construction of a new underground pipeline to bring natural gas to the Power  
 
  
Generation Plant from the National Gas Transmission System located nearby
 
●  the Power Generation Plant could become operational in 2022, subject to public   
 
  
consultation, planning and market conditions
Although a preliminary preferred layout of the Power Generation Plant has been identifed,
the fnal location and layout are yet to be determined. 
Proposal for a gas-ﬁred power station at Rookery South Pit
Planning & Public Consultation
The project is classifed as a Nationally Signifcant Infrastructure Project, which means that 
a DCO is required to build, operate and maintain it. 
The DCO application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate and the 
fnal decision on the application will be made by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy 
and Industrial Strategy. 
The associated electrical and gas connections will be considered together with the power 
generation plant under the DCO application.
Consultation with Central Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Council (BBC), local 
people, businesses, and Parish Councils in the area is an essential part of the DCO process 
and will help to infuence the fnal designs of the Project. 
MPL is also liaising closely with organisations such as the Environment Agency, Natural 
England and Historic England to ensure that the plant will be designed, built, operated and 
maintained to the highest safety and environmental standards.
Why Rookery South Pit?
It has three main advantages:
 
1.  Proximity to the national gas and electricity transmission networks
 
2.  National Grid encourages new power generation development in the region 
 
3. Rookery South Pit is classifed as brownfeld land and is allocated by Central  
 
 
 
Bedfordshire Council (CBC) for development.
Development of the Project 
As a result of consultation, feedback, and technical and environmental studies, several 
signifcant changes have occurred since the previous consultation events in 2014:
 
●  undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby avoiding the   
  
need for overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers)
 
●  reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a maximum of fve  
  
units to only one unit with one stack
 
●  reduction in the maximum height of the stack (from 60 m to 35 m)
 
●  re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the impact of noise on  
 
  
nearby homes
 
●  re-location of the gas connection site to reduce impact on agricultural land
 
●  improvement of access arrangements, trafc management measures and routing during  
  
construction to minimise impact on the road network
Preliminary Environmental Assessment
Steps to mitigate the impact of the Project on the local environment during its 
construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning are a major part of the 
consultation and planning process. 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). The EIA considers the potential positive and negative impacts of the 
Project and MPL has published its interim fndings in the PEIR.  The PEIR, along with a 
non-technical summary, is available for inspection today, at the main ofce of Central 
Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Council’s Customer Service Centre, Marston Vale 
Forest Centre, as well as at local libraries. It can also be viewed at 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk.
The Project’s environmental assessments (in 2014 and since) take the Rookery South RRF 
Project into account and provide a clear assessment of the cumulative environmental 
impact of both projects.
Community Benefits 
This £100m Project would be a substantial investment in the area and would deliver 
signifcant economic benefts for a period of at least 25 years, including:  
 
●  creation of around 150 jobs during a 2 year construction period
 
●  creation of up to 15 permanent skilled jobs for on-going operation and maintenance  
  
of the facility 
 
●  potential business opportunities for local suppliers 
MPL will consult CBC and BBC on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefts 
to the surrounding area.
Comment and Feedback 
Your feedback is important to the consultation process. We would like your views on:
 
●  the layout of the Generating Equipment within the Generating Equipment Site
 
●  the Project as a whole, including changes since the 2014 consultation
  ●  the interaction between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project
 
●  the fndings of the preliminary assessment on the likely signifcant environmental
          efects of the Project during construction and operation, as set out in the PEIR
This consultation phase will end on Sunday 2nd July 2017, and we would welcome your 
views on or before this date.

(the Rookery South RRF Project)
Under the new ownership of UK energy company Drax Group plc, MPL is now resuming 
the DCO process, building on the previous consultation and environmental work 
undertaken in 2014/15.
 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) proposes to develop 
a gas-fired power plant with a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 MW at Rookery South Pit. 
Using modern and efficient electricity power 
generation technology, the plant will support the 
country’s transition to a low-carbon economy.
