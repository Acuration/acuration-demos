INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(PEIR) for the Progress Power Project. It has been prepared by 
Parsons Brinckerhoff on behalf of Progress Power Limited (PPL).  
1.1.2 
PPL is promoting a new thermal generating station (hereafter referred 
to as the Power Generation Plant) on land at the former Eye Airfield 
located in Eye, Mid Suffolk, East Anglia, England, (approximate grid 
reference 613239 275109). The proposed Project Site is shown in 
Figure 1.1, being the current project red line boundary and which 
includes all options currently under consideration by PPL as explained 
in further detail in this PEIR.  
1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) plant and will be designed to provide an electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The plant will be fuelled by 
natural gas, supplied to the site by a new gas pipeline connecting the 
Power Generation Plant to the existing National Gas Transmission 
System (NTS).  
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a peaking plant, with 
maximum operational hours not exceeding 1500 hours per year, it will 
operate at times of peak demand when generation from renewable 
sources is reduced, and will be called upon by the National Grid to 
maintain capacity on the system. 
1.1.5 
The Power Generation Plant constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 
(PA 2008) and therefore an application for a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) is proposed to be made to the Secretary of State (SoS) 
(the proposed DCO Application).  
1.1.6 
The four main elements of the proposed Progress Power Project would 
comprise:  
ï¿½ 
A new Power Generation Plant, a SCGT gas fired power 
generating station capable of providing up to 299 MW; 
ï¿½ 
A new electrical connection (referred to as the (âElectrical 
Connectionâ) to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant 
to the substation within the Electrical Connection Compound;  
ï¿½ 
A new electrical connection compound comprised of a new 
substation and sealing end compound (SEC), referred to as the 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report 
 
PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
October 2013 
for Progress Power Limited 
 
- 16 - 
 
âElectrical Connection Compoundâ to export electricity from the 
Power Generation Plant to the National Grid; and 
ï¿½ 
A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the âGas 
Connectionâ) to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the NTS in the vicinity of the Project Site.  
1.1.7 
The proposed Power Generation Plant, Electrical Connection, Electrical 
Connection Compound and Gas Connection together with all access 
requirements are referred to as the âProjectâ and are all integral to the 
generation of electricity and the subsequent export of that electricity to 
the National Grid. The proposed DCO Application will apply for a DCO 
in respect of the proposed Project. 
1.2 
Structure of the PEIR 
1.2.1 
This PEIR has been prepared in distinct sections to allow the reader to 
understand the proposed Project background, the purpose of the 
document, the regulatory framework in which the PEIR has been 
prepared, and the proposed methodology for undertaking the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
1.2.2 
The document is set out as follows:  
ï¿½ 
Section 1 -comprises a description of the developer, a brief 
description of the proposed Project, an introduction to the 
consenting regime, the need for and benefits of the proposed 
Project, and the consultation strategy.  
ï¿½ 
Section 2 -provides a brief description of the planning policy 
background and regulatory framework in which the PEIR has been 
prepared;  
ï¿½ 
Section 3 -provides a description of the proposed Project site and 
the surrounding area and includes a more detailed project 
description of the Power Generation Plant, two options for the Gas 
Connection and two options for the Electrical Connection and 
Electrical Connection Compound. 
ï¿½ 
Section 4 â provides a description of the methodology employed in 
undertaking the EIA for the proposed Project. 
ï¿½ 
Section 5 -provides a description of project alternatives which have 
been considered.  
ï¿½ 
Sections 6 to 15 -provide a description of the environmental 
assessment information which has been gathered to date, as well 
as details of the next steps required to complete the EIA process.

1.3 
Application for an Order granting Development Consent 
1.3.1 
As the generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant will exceed 
50 MW, development consent is required under the PA 2008.  
1.3.2 
Development consent for a NSIP (and associated development) may 
only be granted by a DCO through an application under Section 37 of 
the PA 2008 to the SoS. Section 37 of the PA 2008 also governs the 
content of an application for a DCO, including the requirements for the 
necessary accompanying 
documents. 
These 
requirements 
are 
specified in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms 
and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (âAPFP Regulationsâ).  
1.3.3 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations) require an EIA to be 
undertaken in respect of development that is classed as "EIA 
development". All development in Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations 
(âSchedule 1 developmentâ) requires an EIA. Development in Schedule 
2 to the EIA Regulations (âSchedule 2 developmentâ) requires an EIA if 
it is likely to have significant effects on the environment.  
1.3.4 
The definition of a Schedule 1 development includes thermal 
generating stations with a heat output of 300 MW or more (Schedule 1, 
paragraph 2(a)). 
1.3.5 
The thermal output of the Power Generation Plant will be greater than 
300 MW and therefore an EIA will be required under the EIA 
regulations
1.  
1.3.6 
Section 5(2)(a) of the APFP Regulations, requires that any 
Environmental Statement (ES) required pursuant to the EIA 
Regulations, together with any scoping or screening opinions or 
directions, must accompany the proposed DCO Application. 
1.4 
Need for and Benefits of the Project  
1.4.1 
This section briefly summarises why the proposed Project is needed 
and how it would contribute towards ensuring greater reliability of 
electricity supply in the UK. A fuller need case will be presented within 
the proposed DCO Application.  
                                                   
1 Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of âuseable heatâ which is produced as part of the process 
of the combustion of fuel. Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, which is why this 
is a larger value than electrical output.

1.4.2 
Under Section 31 of the PA 2008 a DCO is required to authorise an 
NSIP. In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station 
is considered to be a NSIP if the generating capacity is greater than 
50 MW. As the generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant will 
exceed this threshold, development consent is required. The 
determination of the DCO Application must have regard to, inter alia, 
any relevant National Policy Statements (NPSs) designated in respect 
of that type of infrastructure. Further explanation of the decision-making 
process under the PA 2008 is set out in Section 2.3 below. 
1.4.3 
The overarching NPS for Energy is NPS EN-1 which is one of the 
relevant NPSs for the proposed Project alongside NPSs EN-2, EN-3, 
and EN-5 (see Chapter 2). EN-1 sets out national policy for energy 
infrastructure and explains the need for such infrastructure. 
1.4.4 
NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, 
confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there is a 
significant need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace 
capacity that will be lost through the closure of existing large plant. 
Indeed it states that the decision-maker âshould start with a 
presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPsâ (paragraph 4.1.2).  
1.4.5 
NPS EN-1 therefore establishes the general need case for energy 
NSIPs, including gas generation. This has been preceded and followed 
by other Government policy and evidence, some of which is 
summarised below to provide further context.  
1.4.6 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 confirms that gas generation will play an 
important role in the UK's energy mix, "Fossil fuel power stations play a 
vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies: they can be operated 
flexibly in response to changes in supply and demand, and provide 
diversity in our energy mix. They will continue to play an important role 
in our energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon 
economy..."  
1.4.7 
Section 3.7 of NPS EN-1 describes the need for new domestic 
electricity network infrastructure. It states that â....there is an urgent 
need for new electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure...to 
be provided. The SoS should consider that the need for any given 
proposed new connection or reinforcement has been demonstrated if it 
represents an efficient and economical means of connecting a new 
generating station to the transmission or distribution network, or 
reinforcing the network to ensure that it is sufficiently resilient and has 
sufficient capacity (in the light of any performance standards set by 
Ofgem) to supply current or anticipated future levels of demandâ 
(Paragraph 3.7.10).

1.4.8 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is Government policy that 
the electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of 
technologies that continuously and reliably produce stable and 
controllable power and that within this scenario, gas-fuelled electricity 
generating technologies can play a significant role. Thus in the second 
Annual Energy Statement (AES) (November, 2011) (the Strategy), the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) directed the need 
to build new power generation infrastructure. In line with this 
requirement, DECC acknowledged the need for gas to continue to 
feature strongly in the energy mix, and also stated that while it is 
important that businesses play their part in the transition to a low-
carbon economy, it is also important to remain competitive. 
1.4.9 
These statements are supported by the more recent Gas Generation 
Strategy, released by DECC in December 2012
2. The Strategy sets out 
the important role that gas generationâas a reliable, flexible source of 
electricityâwill play in any future generation mix, supporting a secure, 
low-carbon and affordable electricity system. It states that âGas 
currently forms an integral part of the UKâs generation mix and is a 
reliable, flexible source of electricity. Using gas as a fuel in our power 
stations currently provides a significant proportion of our electricity 
generation (around 40% in 2011)â. 
1.4.10 
Moreover, the Strategy suggests that there could be as much as 26 
gigawatts (GW) of new gas generation infrastructure required if the 
decarbonisation target is set at 200g/CO2/kWh. The Strategy also 
indicates that in 2030 we could need more overall gas capacity than we 
have today, although operating at lower load factors. The modelling 
shows that gas could play a more extensive role, with higher load 
factors, should the 4th Carbon Budget be revised upwards (Executive 
Summary).  
1.4.11 
The Strategy also presents another scenario which indicates that up to 
41 GW of new gas generation capacity will be needed by 2030 to 
underpin long term electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear 
and wind generation at times of peak demand. 
1.4.12 
In October 2012, Ofgem (the electricity and gas regulatory body) 
prepared a report entitled âElectricity Capacity Assessmentâ which was 
submitted to the SoS. This estimates a set of plausible electricity supply 
and demand forecasts that could exist over the next four years and the 
associated risks to security of supply. 
1.4.13 
One of the key findings of the Ofgem report is that electricity supply will 
decrease significantly from the current historically high levels. This is 
2

PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx

primarily because of a significant reduction in electricity supplies from 
coal and oil plants, which are due to close under European 
environmental legislation. An updated Electricity Capacity Assessment 
report issued by Ofgem in June 2013 has indicted that the risks to 
electricity security of supply over the next six winters have increased 
since the report in October 2012. 
1.4.14 
With the large number of wind turbines that are now providing electricity 
to the National Grid and the increasing number of solar farms being 
proposed, both of which represent an intermittent power supply, there 
is also significant consideration being given to the need for flexible 
power on the network. Parsons Brinckerhoffâs âPowering the Futureâ 
report3 which maps the route to a low carbon economy, has predicted 
that up to 9,000 MW of flexible power would be needed by 2050 to help 
stabilise the National Grid due the intermittent supply, in particular from 
offshore wind.  
1.4.15 
Given the above, there is therefore a clear and significant requirement 
for further capacity to meet the projected need for both base load (i.e. 
continuously operational) and reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated 
gas fired peaking plant at the Power Generation Plant site could allow 
for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid thus 
playing a role in meeting the future energy requirements of the UK.  
1.5 
The Developer 
1.5.1 
The Developer of the proposed Project is PPL.  
1.5.2 
PPL is the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which has been set up to 
develop the proposed Project and has been established by Watt Power 
Limited (WPL). WPL has been established to develop flexible gas fired 
generation assets to support the UK Government's drive to a low 
carbon economy. WPL is resourced through Stag Energy, a company 
founded in 2002. The Stag Energy management team has created and 
delivered 
over 
10,000 MW 
of power generation and 
related 
infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW was 
delivered in the UK.  
1.5.3 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to Gateway Storage 
Company Ltd which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage 
facility in the East Irish Sea. The project has been consented by the UK 
Government and the local planning authority (Barrow-in-Furness 
Borough Council, Cumbria) (for further information on the project visit: 
www.gatewaystorage.co.uk).

WPL and PPL are committed to the development of assets to support 
the UK Governmentâs drive to a low carbon economy. WPL and PPL 
recognise the need to balance commercial benefits with the 
environmental issues and concerns of energy projects and believe this 
can be responsibly delivered at a local level. 
1.5.5 
PPL is also committed to acting in a socially and environmentally 
responsible manner. As part of this policy, PPL will seek the views of 
the local community and have regard to them in preparing the proposed 
DCO Application. The proposed Project and supporting infrastructure 
will be designed and developed to the highest quality, safety and 
environmental standards.

Purpose of this Document 
Preliminary Environmental Information 
1.6.1 
As explained in section 1.3, the proposed Project is an EIA 
development under the EIA Regulations. As a result, PPL is carrying 
out an EIA of the proposed Project. Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA 
Regulations, 
PPL 
must 
consult 
on 
preliminary 
environmental 
information relating to the proposed Project. That information has been 
compiled into this PEIR. The PEIR presents the environmental 
information and assessments which have been completed to date.  
The Consultation Process 
1.6.2 
This PEIR has been compiled to enable PPL to consult upon the 
proposed DCO Application in advance of submitting an application by 
providing up-to-date information about the proposed Project. This pre-
application consultation is a requirement under section 47 of the PA 
2008. This PEIR has been published in the manner described in PPLâs 
Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC), which explains how 
PPL proposes to consult those living in the vicinity about the proposed 
Project. The SoCC explains how feedback can be given about the 
proposed Project and the content of this PEIR.  
1.6.3 
This PEIR is intended to provide an assessment, on a preliminary 
basis, of the likely significant environmental impacts of the proposed 
Project. The proposed DCO Application is still being developed and 
refined. In particular, decisions are still to be made on the two route 
corridor options for the Gas Connection, the two options for the 
Electrical Connection Compound and the Electrical Connection, as well 
as the layout of the Power Generation Plant within that part of the

proposed Project site allocated for the location of the Power Generation 
Plant. The current iteration of the proposed Project is described in 
Section 4 below. Any feedback received during the consultation 
process will help inform the development of the proposed Project and 
the decisions still to be made.  
1.6.4 
This preliminary environmental information will be developed further in 
light of the consultation responses received and the methodologies 
proposed herein as part of the EIA process. The results of the EIA will 
ultimately be presented in an Environmental Statement (ES) that will 
accompany the proposed DCO Application.  
1.6.5 
Before undertaking the EIA for the Project, PPL requested a Scoping 
Opinion from the SoS. This request was made in May 2013, and was 
by a Scoping Report entitled âProgress Power Project Environmental 
Impact Assessment Scoping Reportâ. The Scoping Report described is 
available on the Progress Power web site and describes the key 
anticipated environmental issues that would require detailed evaluation 
as part of the EIA process and the methodologies proposed to assess 
these impacts. 
1.6.6 
A Scoping Opinion was subsequently issued by the SoS, and this is 
available on request or from the Planning Inspectorate web site. The 
EIA process and this PEIR take the Scoping Opinion and other 
consultation responses provided to SoS into account.

REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This section of the PEIR outlines the main regulatory and policy 
framework that is relevant to the proposed Project.  
2.1.2 
Relevant EU directives are considered first, at a high level.  
2.1.3 
This section also gives an overview of the current and emerging 
policies relevant to the proposed Project at the national, regional and 
local levels as they relate to the consideration of the likely scope of EIA.  
2.1.4 
Further description of the planning policy background and its relevance 
to the proposed Project will be provided in the Planning Statement, 
which will be produced as a separate document to support the 
proposed DCO Application. A summary of relevant and important 
planning policy will also be presented more fully within the ES.  
2.2 
European Union (EU) 
2.2.1 
Current EU directives of particular relevance to the proposed Project 
with respect to environmental requirements are as follows: 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain 
public and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive) 
2.2.2 
The EIA Directive ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely 
to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an 
environmental assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation. The 
Directive sets the thresholds for projects that require an EIA (as stated 
in Section 1.3 and also outlines the impacts on the environment to be 
assessed in the EIA process. This Directive is implemented in the 
respect of NSIPs in the UK by the EIA Regulations. 
Directive 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 (the Public Participation 
Directive). 
2.2.3 
The Public Participation Directive implements the obligations arising 
from the Ãrhus Convention and amends the EIA Directive and the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (see 2.2.4 
below) to improve public participation.

Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions 
(integrated pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial 
Emissions Directive (IED)) 
2.2.4 
In December 2010 the EU adopted a Proposal for a Directive on 
industrial emissions (IED). The IED recasts seven existing directives 
related to industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 
January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control 
(the IPPC Directive) and Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on 
the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large 
combustion plants (the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into 
a single legislative instrument to improve the permitting, compliance 
and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States. However, the 
general principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD Directive 
described below are retained and will remain relevant to the proposed 
Project.  
2.2.5 
The purpose of the IPPC Directive was to achieve integrated 
prevention and control of pollution arising from certain potentially 
polluting processes and to ensure a high level of protection for the 
environment taken as a whole. Measures were laid down to prevent or, 
where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and 
land with the introduction of emission limit values (ELV) and best 
available techniques (BAT). With regard to power projects, combustion 
installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW are subject to 
the IPPC Directive. The IPPC Directive is transposed into UK 
legislation via the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) and the IED is to be transposed 
through amendments to the Environmental Permitting (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2010. An Environmental Permit will be required for 
the operation of the Power Generation Plant. 
2.2.6 
The purpose of the LCPD was to limit the emissions of certain 
pollutants into the atmosphere from large combustion processes. The 
LCPD applied to combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to 
or greater than 50 MW. The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulates were subject to the stringent 
ELVs stipulated in the LCPD. The LCPD requirements for new plant are 
implemented in the UK regulations by the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010. 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of 
natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) 
2.2.7 
The aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-
diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora. Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member

States are designed to maintain or restore, at favourable conservation 
status, natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of 
community interest whilst also taking into account economic, social and 
cultural requirements, and regional and local characteristics. The 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the 
Habitats Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of 
wild birds (the Birds Directive) 
2.2.8 
The Birds Directive provides a comprehensive scheme for the 
protection of wild bird species naturally occurring within the EU. The 
Directive places great emphasis on the protection of habitats suitable 
for supporting endangered and migratory species, introducing a system 
of Special Protection Area designation to protect important habitats. 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the requirements of 
the Birds Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and 
cleaner air for Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive) 
2.2.9 
Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and 
management (the Air Quality Framework Directive) described the basic 
principles of how air quality should be assessed and managed in the 
Member States. Subsequent 'Daughter Directives' introduced numerical 
limits, thresholds and monitoring requirements for a variety of pollutants 
including oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide to guarantee that there 
are no adverse effects with regard to human health. The Air Quality 
Standards Regulations 2010 give effect, in England and Wales, to the 
Ambient Air Quality Directive. 
2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 and 
Policy Context  
2.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant is categorised as a NSIP and therefore 
falls to be determined by the SoS under the regime established by the 
PA 2008.  
2.3.2 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on DCO 
Applications, the SoS must have regard to any relevant NPS and must 
decide applications in accordance with it unless the adverse impacts of 
the proposal would outweigh its benefits (or in certain other limited 
circumstances). The SoS must also have regard to any local impact 
report and any other matters which the SoS âthinks are both important 
and relevant to its decisionâ (paragraph 1.1.1). These matters may

include the Development Plan Documents or other documents in the 
Local Development Framework. 
2.3.3 
NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy), states 
âthis NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-specific energy 
NPS, provides the primary basis for decisionsâ (paragraph 1.1.1) and 
the decision-maker âshould start with a presumption in favour of 
granting consent to applications for energy NSIPsâ (paragraph 4.1.2). 
The PA 2008 makes no reference to the Development Plan, in contrast 
to the regime established for non NSIP projects under the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 Indeed, as stated in (NPS EN-1, paragraph 
4.1.5) and referred to in reports by the examination panels to the 
Secretaries of State for recent DCO examinations, in the event of a 
conflict between policies contained in any other documents (including 
development plan documents) and those contained in an NPS, those in 
the NPS prevail for the purposes of decision making on NSIPs. 
2.3.4 
The proposed DCO Application will be examined by SoS, either by a 
single commissioner or a panel, which will submit a report containing a 
recommended decision to the SoS who takes the final decision as to 
whether to grant a DCO for the proposed Project.  
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
The PA 2008 required new policy to inform decisions on NSIPs in 
England and Wales. Policy for such infrastructure is set out in NPSs. 
The NPSs which are relevant to the consideration of this proposed 
DCO Application are: 
ï¿½ 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1); 
ï¿½ 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2);  
ï¿½ 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines; and  
ï¿½ 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure. 
2.4.2 
It is noted that the Gas Connection is below the relevant size 
thresholds to be categorised as a NSIP itself, whilst the Electrical 
Connection, being underground, does not fall within the PA 2008. 
However, given the integral nature of these components, together with 
the Electrical Connection Compound, they will form part of the 
proposed DCO Application. Accordingly, NPSs EN-4 and EN-5 are 
likely to be important and relevant in the determination of the proposed 
DCO Application in respect of these components.

2.4.3 
The main provisions of these NPSs are set out below. Policies and 
assessment criteria pertaining to particular environmental topics are set 
out in the relevant topic sections elsewhere in this PEIR. 
2.4.4 
NPS EN-1 contains Government policy on energy and energy 
infrastructure development, representing the needs case for any 
proposal for an energy NSIP. 
2.4.5 
NPS EN-2 supplements EN-1 in providing specific Government policy 
on fossil fuel generating station NSIPs such as the proposed Project.  
2.4.6 
NPS EN-1 recognises that there is a significant need for new energy 
infrastructure. It states that pending plant closures in the UK will reduce 
available capacity by 22 GW by 2020 as a result of tightening 
environmental legislation and older power stations approaching the end 
of their useful life (paragraphs 3.3.7 to 3.3.9).  
2.4.7 
Paragraph 4.1.9 of EN-1 seeks that the information provided in the 
application demonstrates that the financial viability and technical 
feasibility of the proposal has been properly assessed. Accordingly, 
further information will be provided within the ES and other documents 
submitted with the DCO Application.  
2.4.8 
NPS EN-1 also sets out guidance on the consideration of alternatives 
when developing a new energy generation project (paragraphs 4.4.2-
4.4.3) and guidance relating to criteria for âgood designâ of new 
developments (Section 4.5).  
2.4.9 
Specific guidance on good design is also provided in NPS EN-2, 
including that âapplicants should demonstrate good design particularly 
in respect of landscape and visual amenity (â¦) and in the design of the 
project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, transport 
impacts and air emissionsâ (paragraph 2.3.16) 
2.4.10 
In Section 4.6 of EN-1 the consideration of Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) is denoted as an assessment principle in itself and references to 
other guidance and viability considerations are set out. It is stated that 
applicants should consider CHP from the earliest point and it should be 
a criterion for site selection (paragraph 4.6.7).  
2.4.11 
Section 4.8 of NPS EN-1 also sets out how applicants and the SoS 
should take the effects of climate change into account when developing 
and consenting NSIPs. Paragraph 4.8.11 requires any adaptation 
measures to be based on the latest set of UK Climate Projections, the 
Government's latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (when 
available) and in consultation with the Environment Agency (EA).

2.4.12 
Other assessment principles that are particularly likely to be relevant to 
energy NSIPs are set out as follows in EN-1 (relevant paragraph 
numbers given in brackets): 
ï¿½ 
Pollution control (4.10): describes the relationship with other 
regimes (e.g. Environmental Permitting) which is essentially that 
the decision maker should be satisfied that âpotential releases can 
be adequately regulated under the pollution control frameworkâ 
without unacceptable cumulative impacts arising. 
ï¿½ 
Safety (4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): describes the 
relationship with other regimes and the general requirement that 
the decision maker will need to be satisfied that they are complied 
with.  
ï¿½ 
Health (4.13): requires that an assessment of potential health 
impacts is made in relation to each element of the project, such as 
in relation to air quality, waste or noise and describing the 
relationship with other regimes, stating at 4.13.5 that where 
separate air quality regulations are (or will be) satisfied then the 
decision maker is likely to consider these effective mitigation, 
whereas for noise or other aspects it will take account of health 
concerns when setting requirements.  
ï¿½ 
Nuisance and amenity (4.14): the relationship with common law 
nuisance, statutory nuisance, and the importance to be attached by 
the SoS to their consideration during the determination process, 
are set out.  
ï¿½ 
Security (4.15): Government policy is set out as being âto ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures 
are designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in 
the project developmentâ with documentary requirements and 
relationships to other guidance set out. 
2.4.13 
As well as generic assessment principles, EN-1 also identifies a 
generic list of impacts which could arise from an energy NSIP and the 
criteria by which they should be assessed. These specific topics 
include ecology, landscape, noise and socio-economics. These topics 
are discussed in more detail when describing the preliminary 
assessment of impacts presented in this PEIR.  
2.4.14 
NPS EN-2 outlines considerations and factors relating to site selection 
and design for developers for fossil fuel generating stations, although it 
states that these concerns must be considered by the applicant, and 
that: ââ¦the Government does not seek to direct applicants to particular 
sites for fossil fuel generating stationsâ (paragraph 2.2.1). NPS EN-2 
sets out a number of specific impacts that could arise from a fossil fuel 
generating NSIP and criteria by which they should be assessed. These

specific topics include air quality, landscape and visual, noise and 
vibration, and water quality and resources. These topics are discussed 
in more detail when describing the preliminary assessment of impacts 
in this PEIR.  
2.4.15 
NPS EN-4 sets Government policy on the relevant considerations and 
factors that should be taken into account as to route selection for 
developers for, inter alia, gas pipeline NSIPs. The NPS sets out a 
number of impacts that could arise from such development and criteria 
by which they should be assessed. These specific topics include 
biodiversity, noise and vibration, soil and geology, and water quality 
and resources. These topics have been discussed in more detail when 
describing the preliminary assessment of impacts in this PEIR.  
2.4.16 
NPS EN-5 provides the primary basis for decisions taken by SoS on 
applications it receives for electricity network NSIPs, including the 
relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into account 
related to route selection. The NPS sets out a number of impacts that 
could arise from such development and criteria by which they should be 
assessed. These specific topics include biodiversity and geological 
conservation, landscape and visual, noise and vibration, and Electric 
and Magnetic Fields. These topics have been discussed in more detail 
when describing the preliminary assessment of impacts in this PEIR.  
2.5 
National Planning Policy Framework for England (NPPF) - 2012 
2.5.1 
The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the 
Governmentâs approach to planning in England and how local 
authorities are expected to apply this. The NPPF may, potentially, be 
considered important and relevant by the SoS in determining an 
application for a DCO. 
2.5.2 
The NPPF sets sustainable development at its core, stating that the 
policies set in paragraphs 18-219, taken as a whole, constitute the 
Governmentâs view of what sustainable development in England means 
in practice for the planning system. 
2.5.3 
The NPPF focuses its interpretation of sustainable development into 
three dimensions: economic, social and environmental.  
2.5.4 
A set of 12 âCore planning principlesâ are set out in the NPPF. 
Paragraph 17 states that planning should âsupport the transition to a 
low carbon future in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk 
and coastal change, and encourage the reuse of existing resources, 
including conversion of existing buildings, and encourage the use of 
renewable resources (for example, by the development of renewable 
energy).â

2.5.5 
As part of delivering sustainable development, the NPPF presents 13 
different thematic titles setting out distinct ways in which Government 
expects the operation of planning processes at the local level to 
achieve the 12 core land use planning principles. The most relevant of 
these 13 titles to this development have been listed below:

Local Planning Policy 
Mid Suffolk District Council Local Development Framework (LDF) 
2.6.2 
The LDF is a portfolio created by Mid Suffolk District Council (MSDC) 
that contains the local planning documents for the District. Of the 
documents contained in this portfolio, the most relevant are the 
Development Plan Documents (DPDs) including the Core Strategy 
DPD which provide formal, adopted objectives and policies that will be 
used to guide future development in the District over the plan period. 
Core Strategy DPD

5 
2.6.3 
The Mid Suffolk Core Strategy DPD was adopted in September 2008. 
This document is the key DPD and âsets out the vision, objectives, 
spatial strategy and core policies that will guide development across 
the district until 2025 and beyondâ. The Core Strategy and other LDF 
documents are key components in the delivery of the Community 
Strategy (2004) for the District, particularly those elements that relate to 
the development and use of land. Following a review carried out in late 
2012, the adopted Core Strategy DPD should be read in conjunction 
with the âCore Strategy Focused Reviewâ (December 2012).

2.6.4 
The âOverall Spatial Visionâ of the Core Strategy DPD states: âBy 2021 
the East of England will be realising its economic potential and 
providing a high quality of life for its people, including by meeting their 
housing needs in sustainable inclusive communities. At the same time 
it will reduce its impact on climate change and the environment, 
including through savings in energy and water use and by 
strengthening its stock of environmental assetsâ. 
2.6.5 
The following objectives of the Core Strategy DPD may be of relevance 
and importance to the consideration of impacts of the proposed Project: 
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 1 â To protect, manage, enhance and 
restore the landscape, biodiversity and geodiversity of the District. 
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 2 â To seek to improve water quality 
and reduce pollution to the wider environment. 
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 3 â To respond to the possible harm 
caused by climate change Mid Suffolk will seek to minimise its 
carbon footprint, by encouraging a shift to more sustainable travel 
patterns. In particular the Council will address congestion and 
pollution and ensure that all new development minimises its carbon 
emissions and carbon consumption and is adapted to future climate 
change.  
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 4 â To protect, manage, enhance and 
restore the historic heritage / environment and the unique character 
and identity of the towns and villages by ensuring that new 
developments are appropriate in terms of scale and location in the 
context of settlement form and character. 
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 5 â Reinforce the vitality and viability of 
local shops, schools, services, recreating and community facilities 
in towns and key service centres and primary villages. 
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objectives SO 6 - Provision of housing, employment, 
retail, infrastructure and access to services will be coordinated to 
enable communities to be balanced, inclusive and prosperous. 
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 7 â To support sustainable 
communities by locating development where it will enable people to 
access jobs and key services, such as education, health, recreation 
and other facilities recognising and respecting the diversity in the 
function and character of Mid Suffolkâs towns, key service centres 
and primary and secondary villages and countryside.  
ï¿½ 
Core Strategy Objective SO 11 â To support the growth of the local 
economy and rural regeneration in ways which are compatible with

Discussion of Core Strategy Strategic Policies shall be found in the 
relevant Section of this PEIR. 
Suffolk County Waste Core Strategy Development Plan Document 
(2011) 
2.6.7 
The former Eye Airfield has been identified as one of three areas of 
search for a Strategic Residual Waste Treatment Facility under Policy 
WCS4 of the Waste Core Strategy DPD. The area of search is large, at 
81.35 ha, of which it is stated 5 ha would be needed for the facility, in 
addition to access arrangements. The Waste Core Strategy Policy 
WDM1 âSafeguarding of Waste Management Sitesâ states âThis 
safeguarding is not intended to preclude other forms of development 
within the Area of Search which do not prejudice or would not be 
prejudiced by a strategic residual waste treatment facilityâ (paragraph 
7.2). 
Saved Local Plan policies and emerging Development 
Management Policies 
2.6.8 
The Development Management Policies (DMP) have yet to be 
developed by the Council. Development was put on hold due to other 
LDF commitments and changes in staff resources.  
2.6.9 
In the meantime a number of Saved Policies of the MSDC Local Plan 
(1998) continue to be used for determining planning applications until 
replaced by Development Management / site allocations DPDs. Those 
of potential relevance to the proposed Project include Policies E2 
(Industrial uses on allocated sites) and E3 (Warehousing, storage, 
distribution, and haulage depots). It should be borne in mind that 
paragraphs 214-215 of the NPPF (2012) require that pre-Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 local planning policies possess weight 
only insofar as they accord with the NPPF. 
2.6.10 
It is understood that when finalised and adopted, the DMP will set out 
the 
proposed 
approach 
and 
detailed 
policies 
for 
controlling 
development and delivering the vision, objectives and core policies in 
the Core Strategy. As such, it will play a role in determining planning 
applications at the local level, and in the case of NSIPs may inform 
assessments of potential impacts. Work is ongoing on developing joint 
DMP between Babergh District Council (BDC) and MSDC.  
Eye Airfield Development Framework (February 2013 Approved 
Version) (EADF) 
2.6.11 
The former Eye Airfield is a broad location for growth in Mid Suffolk as 
identified by Mid Suffolkâs Core Strategy (2008) and the Eye Airfield

Development Framework (EADF) provides an assessment of current 
uses and attempts to identify future proposed uses through a master 
planning approach. This framework has no planning status but at the 
Environment Policy Panel in February 2013 elected Members 
unanimously supported the Development Framework as a basis for the 
future development of the site and MSDC is identifying the most 
appropriate planning process to deliver the frameworkâs principles. 
2.6.12 
The EADF has been informed by various stages of consultation with 
local businesses, land owners, stakeholders and residents. A number 
of aspirations were identified during consultation including: 
ï¿½ 
development that is sustainable and landscape led; 
ï¿½ 
the creation of on-site energy generation opportunities for new 
business; 
ï¿½ 
a focus on improving skills for young people, including establishing 
links to local secondary schools. 
2.6.13 
The centre of the site has been proposed for energy producing 
developments, which should be âappropriate provided they meet 
environmental criteria that ensure a good quality of life for all around 
themâ (page 17).  
2.7 
Other Relevant Policy and Guidance 
2.7.1 
The following are considered to be potentially relevant policy and 
guidance in considering the potential impact of the proposed Project:  
ï¿½ 
The Electricity Market Reform (2012);  
ï¿½ 
Natural Environment White Paper (2012); 
ï¿½ 
Biodiversity 2020: A strategy for Englandâs wildlife and ecosystem 
services (2011); 
ï¿½ 
The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) (2012); 
ï¿½ 
Gas Generation Strategy (2012); and 
ï¿½ 
Suffolk Growth Strategy (2013).  
The Electricity Market Reform (2012) 
2.7.2 
The Electricity Market Reform (EMR) has been developed to meet 
three main objectives: 
ï¿½ 
Ensuring the future security of electricity supplies; 
ï¿½ 
Driving the decarbonisation of electricity generation; and

ï¿½ 
Minimising costs to consumers. 
2.7.3 
These measures are designed to provide both technical and economic 
encouragement for an increase in the development of low carbon 
technologies.  
2.7.4 
In terms of the proposed Project, one of the most relevant aims of the 
EMR is to provide â.... a mechanism to support security of supply, if 
needed, in the form of a Capacity Marketâ (paragraph 23).  
2.7.5 
Although the EMR focuses heavily on the need for decarbonisation, 
there is also a strong focus on the need for security of supply and a mix 
of energy generation technologies on line at any one time. The EMR 
also recognises that gas fired power generation will continue to play a 
crucial role in the UK energy mix going forward.  
2.7.6 
The Energy Bill will be the primary piece of legislation to come about as 
a result of the EMR although it is currently at Committee Stage in the 
House of Commons. The Energy Bill seeks to enact the key drivers that 
are necessary to achieve the recommendations set out in the EMR.  
Natural Environment White Paper (2012) 
2.7.7 
This document outlines the Governmentâs vision for the natural 
environment over the next 50 years. The paper makes the case that a 
healthy, properly functioning natural environment is the foundation of 
sustained economic growth, prospering communities and personal 
wellbeing. 
2.7.8 
The paper focuses on protecting and improving the UKâs natural 
environment, encouraging a green economy, the importance of 
reconnecting with people and nature and refers to international and EU 
leadership on these matters. 
Biodiversity 2020: A strategy for Englandâs wildlife and ecosystem 
services 
2.7.9 
This document builds on the Natural Environment White Paper for 
England and provides a comprehensive picture of how England is 
implementing local, international and EU commitments. It sets out the 
strategic direction for biodiversity policy for the next decade on land, 
rivers, lakes and the sea.  
The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (2012) 
2.7.10 
This report sets out the main priorities for adaptation in the UK under a 
number of key themes identified in the Climate Change Risk 
Assessment 2012 (CCRA), including; infrastructure, business, natural

environment and industry. It describes the policy context, and 
measures already in place to tackle some of the risks in each area. It 
highlights the constraints of the CCRA analysis and provides advice on 
how to take account of the uncertainty within the analysis. 
Gas Generation Strategy (2012) 
2.7.11 
The Gas Generation Strategy sets out the Governmentâs view on the 
need for gas energy generation and how the UK will address barriers to 
help build investor confidence and encourage the new capacity that the 
Government will need over the coming years. It sets out the required 
work to maintain gas supply security and ensure that the best use of 
this natural resource is implemented. 
Suffolk Growth Strategy (2013) 
2.7.12 
The Suffolk Growth Strategy seeks to help develop a âcoordinated 
economic strategy which sets out how Suffolk will create more, higher 
value, high skill jobs and increase wealth across the countyâ.  
2.7.13 
The Strategy also analyses strengths and weaknesses of the Suffolk 
economy, places a spotlight on the challenges and opportunities ahead 
and defines how the county, district and borough councils will work 
together with local partners to create the right conditions for business 
growth. 
2.7.14 
The Strategy identifies the Energy Industry as a key area for growth 
and job production.

3.2 
Methodology of the Environmental Impact Assessment 
3.2.1 
In accordance with the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA 
process for the Project includes the following: 
ï¿½ 
Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including 
obtaining a Scoping Opinion from the SoS; 
ï¿½ 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives;  
ï¿½ 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the site and the relevant 
study areas for each topic;  
ï¿½ 
Identifying the potential environmental impacts resulting from the 
Project;  
ï¿½ 
Determining how the potential environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
ï¿½ 
Assessing the significance of the potential environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the Project and those 
from other neighbouring developments and / or sources (in-
combination and cumulative impacts); and 
ï¿½ 
Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored.  
3.2.2 
A brief description of these steps is provided here. 
Establishing the Scope of the Environmental Impact Assessment 
3.2.3 
Under Section 42 (âDuty to Consultâ) of the PA 2008, there is a duty 
placed on developers to consult certain prescribed bodies as well as 
local communities. In this respect, PPL had initial discussions with 
MSDC to discuss the proposed Project in 2012 and held a scoping 
session with consultees including MSDC, SCC, the EA and Natural 
England (NE) in May 2013. PPL has subsequently, supplied documents 
for review / comment by MSDC and SCC in May 2013. PPL is 
continuing to consult with both Councils and other interested parties 
throughout all phases of the proposed Project. 
3.2.4 
Before commencing the EIA, PPL requested a Scoping Opinion from 
the SoS in May 2013. The request was supported by a Scoping Report 
that described the key anticipated environmental issues that would 
require detailed evaluation as part of the EIA process. The formal 
Scoping Opinion was received in June 2013, and has allowed for

agreement on the likely significant environmental impacts of the 
proposed Project and, therefore, the methodology of the EIA.  
Establishment of the Project Scenario for Assessment  
3.2.5 
The proposed Project Scoping Report, submitted to the SoS in May 
2013 set out a number of potential development alternatives to 
generate up to 299 MW at the former Eye Airfield within the Project 
Site. These development alternatives have now been refined since 
issue of the Scoping Report (see Section 5 of this PEIR). As explained 
in Section 5, SCGT has been identified as the preferred and most 
appropriate technology. There are several options of SCGT plant 
available to generate up to 299 MW. These different options mainly 
relate to the number of gas turbine generator (GTG) units used at the 
site. Each gas turbine generator unit consists of one or two gas 
turbines venting to a single flue. As described in Section 4, it is possible 
that only one unit of 299 MW is used. Alternatively, it may be that up to 
five units each of circa 59 MW are used. The proposed DCO 
Application will be flexible enough to allow PPL to achieve a 299 MW 
project by building between one to five gas turbine generators. For the 
reasons explained in section 5, it will not be possible to make a 
decision on this in advance of submitting the proposed DCO 
Application.  
3.2.6 
It should be noted that the other supporting infrastructure at the Power 
Generation Plant site including water tanks, administration building, 
stores, electricity switchyard, gas receiving station, and gatehouse will 
remain constant, no matter how many units are used.  
3.2.7 
Both Gas Connection route corridor options and both Electrical 
Connection Compound options and Electrical Connection route corridor 
options are considered in this PEIR. A decision on the preferred option 
for each will be made before submission of the proposed DCO 
Application and the preferred option will be assessed in the ES.  
3.2.8 
As stated in Section 4 of this PEIR, air quality modelling has indicated 
that a minimum stack height of 20 m would be required for adequate 
dispersion of exhaust gases and to meet legislative air quality targets 
i.e. IED. Taking into consideration potential differences in technology 
available from different Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), the 
requirement to fit constant emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) and 
silencers into the stack(s), it is envisaged that the maximum height of 
stack(s) at the Power Generation Plant will be 30 m. This height applies 
to all technology choices and is not dependent on the number of units 
present at the site. Therefore if one gas turbine generator is used, one 
stack of up to 30 m would be required and if five gas turbine generators 
are used, five stacks of up to 30 m each would be required.

3.2.9 
In accordance with SoS Advice Note 9 (Rochdale Envelope), rather 
than assess every possible iteration for the Power Generation Plant, 
the assessments in this PEIR (and the ES when it is prepared) are 
based on an assessment of the realistic 'worst case' scenario from 
within the proposed Project parameters. 
3.2.10 
Taking the above into consideration, it has been determined that for the 
majority of topic areas to be addressed in the EIA, a realistic âworst 
caseâ scenario from the perspective of environmental impacts in 
respect of the Power Generation Plant would be five gas turbine 
generator units, each with its own 30 m high stack. This is a significant 
reduction in height from the previously published worst case scenario of 
up to 5 stacks at 90 m as set out in the Scoping Report. Each 
assessment topic chapter will contain an assessment of which scenario 
is the worst case to confirm (or otherwise) the assumption that the five 
unit reference scenario is the realistic worst case. 
3.2.11 
Where this reference case is not deemed as âworst case', both the 
reference case and the impact specific worst case will be assessed. 
This will ensure that the reference case is assessed across all 
disciplines to ensure there is one full assessment of a realistic and 
buildable scenario.  
3.2.12 
The assessment is based on the continuous operation of the Power 
Generation Plant. This is an appropriate basis for the assessment 
because the pattern of any intermittent operation cannot be predicted 
with certainty. The actual intermittent operation of a peaking plant could 
give rise to more significant effects than continuous operation for noise. 
as such this affect has been considered in the noise section. 
Measurement and Establishment of Environmental Baseline 
3.2.13 
In undertaking an EIA for any project it is important to identify the 
environmental baseline for the potential receptors in the vicinity of the 
development location. This allows the impacts of the proposed Project 
to be compared and / or combined with the existing quality of the 
environment in order to ensure an informed assessment of the potential 
impacts and to allow the identification of the most appropriate mitigation 
which could be employed to minimise any adverse impacts.  
3.2.14 
To establish the baseline, a study area that is appropriate for each 
assessment topic is identified. Next, a range of environmental data is 
gathered from a combination of sources in respect of the study area. 
This has included: 
ï¿½ 
Documentary information on the Power Generation Plant site, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection route corridors, and their

surroundings within each relevant study area, including information 
available from the previous environmental impact assessment work 
for other projects;  
ï¿½ 
Field survey information, including: Phase 2 ecological surveys; 
landscape character assessments; background noise levels; 
ground conditions / contaminated land assessments, location of 
sensitive receptors and traffic levels on the road network; and 
ï¿½ 
Data held by both statutory and non-statutory consultees.  
3.3 
Description of the Proposed Development and Identification of 
Potential Impacts 
3.3.1 
A full description of the Project, site and surroundings is provided in 
Section 4. The environmental topics to be assessed and reported are: 
ï¿½ 
Air Quality and Emissions â Section 6; 
ï¿½ 
Noise and Vibration â Section 7;  
ï¿½ 
Ecology â Section 8; 
ï¿½ 
Water Quality and Resources â Section 9; 
ï¿½ 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture â Section 10; 
ï¿½ 
Landscape and Visual Impact â Section 11; 
ï¿½ 
Waste Management and Health â Section 12; 
ï¿½ 
Traffic, Transport and Access â Section 13; 
ï¿½ 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology â Section 14; 
ï¿½ 
Socio-Economics â Section 15; and  
ï¿½ 
Cumulative Impacts â Section 16 
Evaluation and Quantification of Potential Impacts 
3.3.2 
To help evaluate and quantify the likely significant environmental 
effects of the proposed Project, environmental significance criteria will 
be employed to ensure that the identified impacts are fully understood. 
Effects may be positive (i.e. beneficial) or negative (i.e. adverse). 
3.3.3 
Environmental significance criteria are important as they will help 
inform the determination by the competent authority of the overall 
acceptability of the proposed Project. An understanding of the 
significance criteria for all assessed impacts will be an important and 
relevant consideration in the determination of the application for a DCO 
in respect of the proposed Project.

3.3.4 
The 
significance of environmental 
effects resulting from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed Project 
will generally be presented in this PEIR and the final ES using a series 
of matrices. These will be developed to describe the sensitivity of 
receptors which have the potential to be impacted by the development 
and the magnitude of any impacts which are likely to arise. The 
magnitude of impact and sensitivity of receptor will be cross referenced 
to give an overall significance of effect for any potential impact. Where 
it is not possible to quantify impacts, a precautionary qualitative 
assessment will be carried out, based on available knowledge and 
professional judgement.  
3.3.5 
The operational life of the proposed Power Generation Plant is 
approximately 25 years, following which the decommissioning phase 
will take place. Given the longevity of the proposed Project, 
assumptions have been made based on current knowledge of 
decommissioning practices of plants of this type. 
3.3.6 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of 
impacts upon different environmental components, the assessments 
generally follow the structure and use the terminology outlined below in 
Table 3.2 - Table 3.4. However, it is noted here that for some impact 
sections, significance criteria may need to differ depending on the 
conditions encountered at the Project Site. The criteria will therefore be 
subject to further discussion with statutory consultees. Each technical 
chapter of the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria 
used. Unless otherwise stated, effects of moderate significance or 
above are considered to be significant for the purposes of the EIA 
Regulations. 
3.3.7 
Two broad types of potential mitigation measures will be described in 
the ES: embedded mitigation namely design / standard control 
measures, which will be used to produce an initial assessment of 
impact; and further specific mitigation which will be required, which may 
be introduced where appropriate and taken into account in the 
assessment of residual impacts.

Mitigation and Monitoring 
3.4.1 
Full consideration has been given to the potential mitigation measures 
which could be used to ensure that any potentially adverse significant 
environmental impact of the development of the proposed Project is 
minimised.  
3.4.2 
In the hierarchy of mitigation likely significant adverse effects should, in 
the first instance, be avoided altogether; where this is not possible such 
effects should then be reduced and, finally, off-set.

- 51 - 
 
3.4.3 
Significant adverse effects are best avoided by incorporating 
appropriate measures during the detailed design process. As such, the 
iterative nature of the EIA can help to inform the development of the 
final design of the proposed Project.  
3.4.4 
The proposed Project has and will continue to be developed in such a 
way that the reduction and, wherever possible, elimination of any 
associated significant adverse environmental impacts are integral to the 
overall design philosophy.  
3.4.5 
Where it is not possible to avoid adverse significant environmental 
effects, potential mitigation and monitoring measures will be discussed 
in each assessment chapter. The full monitoring programme can only 
be established following the completion of the EIA process.  
Indirect / Secondary and Cumulative Impacts 
3.4.6 
Indirect and secondary impacts are those which arise as a result of a 
direct / primary impact. For example, deterioration of water quality in a 
watercourse due to an effluent discharge (which would be a direct 
impact) could have an indirect / secondary impact on aquatic 
biodiversity. Cumulative impacts occur when a receptor is subject to 
multiple impacts. Indirect / secondary impacts are discussed in each of 
the individual technical sections. A preliminary discussion of cumulative 
impacts is provided in Section 16 of this PEIR.  
3.4.7 
The ES that will accompany the proposed DCO Application for the 
Project will include discussions of the potential inter-relationships 
between effects as a result of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project.

PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
4.1 
Overview of the Proposed Project 
4.1.1 
The proposed Project consists of four main elements: the Power 
Generation Plant, the Gas Connection the Electrical Connection and 
the Electrical Connection Compound.  
4.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be situated on land within the 
former Eye Airfield, approximately 1 km north west of Eye Town 
Centre, 1.3 km west of Langdon Green, approximately 1.5 km east of 
Yaxley, in Mid Suffolk, and 4 km south of Diss in South Norfolk. The 
approximate Grid Reference of the Power Generation Plant site is TM 
132 750. The Power Generation Plant would be located on land which 
makes up part of the former World War 2 airfield but has, to the 
applicantâs knowledge, remained in agricultural use. 
4.1.3 
The location of the proposed Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1. The 
Power Generation Plant site, which is within the proposed Project Site, 
covers an area of approximately 10 ha. However, the footprint of the 
Power Generation Plant would be smaller than the full Power 
Generation Plant site. Figure 4.1 contains an indicative position of the 
Power Generator Plant within this part of the proposed Project Site. 
This position of the Power Generation Plant within the Power 
Generation Plant site is subject to consultation and will be refined prior 
to submission of the proposed DCO Application.  
4.1.4 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant and connections would 
require temporary areas for each project element for equipment / 
material laydown which will allow for the storage of construction 
materials and provide an area for the assembly of large plant items 
within a reasonable distance of the construction site. Although the 
exact arrangement of the Power Generation Plant is still to be finalised, 
it is known that there is sufficient space within the identified Power 
Generation Plant site boundary to facilitate the laydown area (Figure 
4.1). 
4.1.5 
The Gas Connection would run from the Power Generation Plant into 
Feeder 5 on the NTS. At present, the route of the gas pipeline has not 
been confirmed, it will either run west into the National Grid 
Compressor Station, or in a southerly direction, for an approximate 
length of 1.5 km. These two options are shown in Figure 1.1 and 
described in detail below. 
4.1.6 
The Electrical Connection would consist of a new underground cable 
which would connect the Power Generation Plant into the existing

400 kV electrical infrastructure via a new substation within the Electrical 
Connection Compound to be located adjacent to the existing line. The 
exact position of the Electrical Connection Compound is still to be 
defined, and two options are presented in Figure 1.1.  
4.1.7 
Figure 4.1 shows a potential plant layout and likely maximum extent of 
the Power Generation Plant, whilst Figure 1.1 shows the two potential 
Gas Connection options, the two Electrical Connection Compound 
options and the two Electrical Connection route corridor options. The 
Electrical Connection Compound, the Electrical Connection and the 
Gas Connection will be refined to a single preferred option prior to 
submission of the proposed DCO Application.  
4.2 
Site and Surroundings 
4.2.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be sited within a 10 ha plot of land 
located within the former Eye Airfield. The former Eye Airfield 
accommodates several industrial parks, including: Brome Industrial 
Estate (to the north), Eye Airfield Industrial Estate (to the north-east), 
Mid Suffolk Business Park (to the east) and Oaksmere Business Park 
(to the west). The site is located within a larger triangular area directly 
to the east of the former âmain runwayâ and north of the former SW-NE 
runway.  
4.2.2 
The proposed Project is entirely within the administrative boundary of 
MSDC, a constituent part of the County of Suffolk. The District Council 
area includes Stowmarket Urban District, Gipping Rural District, 
Hartismere Rural District and Thedwastre Rural District. These areas 
comprise a mixture of urban, semi-urban and rural communities, with 
the nearest population centre being Eye 1 km to the south (population 
1,716: 2001 Census). 
4.2.3 
The Power Generation Plant site and immediate surrounding area is 
characterised by the remnants of the airfield, including the runway and 
the access roads. Buildings that once formed part of the airfield have 
been replaced by units accommodating various industrial activities 
including a power generation facility (the 12.7 MW Eye Chicken Litter 
Power Plant) and a National Grid Gas Compressor Station. 
Additionally, there are two large (130 m high) wind turbines (Roy 
Humphrey Group wind farm) within 200 m to the north west of the 
proposed Power Generation Plant site. Two more wind turbines have 
received planning permission and these will be constructed to the south 
of the site at Baldwin Farm.  
4.2.4 
The proposed Project site is comprised of agricultural land surrounded 
by  a  belt  of  trees  to  the  east,  over  which  lies  the  National  Grid

Compressor Station, and is classed as Previously Developed Land 
within CS11. 
4.2.5 
The Power Generation Plant site is accessed from a private road to the 
south, Potash Lane, which in turn connects to Castleton Way, via the 
former main runway. Castleton Way provides connectivity to either from 
the B1077 to the east and the A140 to the west. The A140 is the main 
road between Norwich and Ipswich (each some 30 km away) and 
provides onward connectivity to the A14, about 20 km to the south. The 
A140 runs approximately 360 m north from the site boundary at its 
closest point. The closest point of the B1077 to the site is 
approximately 460 m east. 
4.2.6 
The road network in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant site can 
be seen in Figure 1.1. 
4.2.7 
The Broads ESA (Environmentally Sensitive Area) is located to the 
north and east of the proposed Project. To the north, the ESA is 
approximately 2.7 km from the perimeter of the Power Generation Plant 
site, while it lies approximately 1.1 km from the siteâs eastern edge. 
Burgate ancient and semi-natural woodland is located approximately 
5.5 km west of the proposed Power Generation Plant site. The 
Pennings Local Nature Reserve is located approximately 2.3 km to the 
south east.  
4.2.8 
The closest residential receptors include;  
ï¿½ 
(R1) Residential properties located to the east, north of Eye and 
adjacent to the B1077 (ï¿½ 480 m from the closest point of the site); 
ï¿½ 
(R2) Residential properties located to the south west of the site 
adjacent to Old Norwich road (ï¿½ 700 m from the closest point of the 
site); 
ï¿½ 
(R3) Farm located to the north west of the site (approximately 810 
m from the closest point of the site); and 
ï¿½ 
(R4) Houses and static holiday homes to the north of the site, 
adjacent to the B1077 (ï¿½ 750 m from the closest point of the site). 
4.2.9 
The land within the former Eye Airfield has been designated as a 
Strategic Site for development by MSDC. As stated earlier in Section 
2.6, a draft Framework for the future Development of Eye Airfield has 
been produced (the EADF). The EADF includes an indicative 
masterplan for the Airfield and has been developed following 
stakeholder engagement at various stages during its production. The 
EADF 
seeks 
to 
encourage 
residential, 
business, 
energy 
production/waste management, âcommonâ/open spaces, recreational, 
allotment and agricultural developments.

4.3 
Relevant Planning History 
4.3.1 
Up until World War 2, the area which makes up the Eye Industrial 
Estate was primarily used for agricultural purposes, before it was 
acquired by the American Air force as a base for B-17 Flying 
Fortresses and B-24 Liberators that flew bombing missions over 
Northern France in 1944. 
4.3.2 
Following the war, the estate was returned to agricultural use, although 
the runways and some other infrastructure remained.  
4.3.3 
Further development was relatively slow, until the construction of a 
number of industrial units to the north of the Airfield in the 1980s. 
4.3.4 
Since that time, the surrounding industrial estate has grown steadily 
with the addition of numerous industrial units and warehouses, the 
chicken litter fired power station and most recently, the erection of the 
two wind turbines.  
4.3.5 
The Power Generation Plant site, Gas Connection route corridor 
options, the two Electrical Connection Compound options and the 
Electrical Connection route corridor options have remained primarily 
agricultural throughout this time and to the present day. This may in 
part be related to constraints imposed on structures and land uses in 
the central part of the airfield due to the Gas Compressor Station and 
NTS gas pipeline, and their associated PADHI (planning advice for 
development near hazardous installations) zones. These planning 
constraints are described further in the EADF. 
4.4 
Detailed Description of Power Generation Plant and Generating 
Technology 
4.4.1 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide a total output 
of up to 299 MW at rated site conditions, and will be fired on natural 
gas. 
4.4.2 
Previous consultation (i.e. the âProgress Power Project Scoping Report 
(issued to SoS in May 2013)) identified four potential technology 
choices for the Power Generation Plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine 
(CCGT); SCGT and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE). The potential 
for utilising CHP opportunities at the site using these technologies was 
also discussed. Since the Scoping Report was issued, a number of 
further studies have been undertaken to refine the technology choice. 
The outcome of these studies has determined that an SCGT plant is 
the most suitable technology choice for a peaking plant generating up 
to 299 MW.

- 61 - 
 
4.4.3 
The results of these studies and the design evolution of the Project are 
presented in more detail in Section 5 of this PEIR.  
4.4.4 
SCGT plants are considered the most appropriate technology choice 
for peaking plants for a number of reasons: 
ï¿½ 
Fast start-up â They can be operational and generating electricity 
within 10 â 15 minutes of being called upon, thus providing a very 
rapid response to changes in electricity demand. 
ï¿½ 
This cold start capability means that the turbines do not need to be 
running unnecessarily (idling) in anticipation of being required and 
as such reduce the amount of gas used. 
4.4.5 
The main generating equipment in a SCGT plant comprises gas turbine 
generators (GTGs). Each GTG consists of an inlet air filter, an air 
compressor, combustion chamber, power turbine, generator and 
exhaust silencer. Air will be compressed in the compressor of the Gas 
Turbine(s) (GT) and gaseous fuel injected into the combustion 
chamber(s) where the fuel will burn producing hot, high-pressure 
gases. These gases will expand across the rotor blades GT(s), which 
will drive both the compressor and the electrical generator(s). The hot 
exhaust gases are then routed directly to the stack and emitted to the 
atmosphere. The stack contains a silencer to reduce noise pollution. 
4.4.6 
SCGT plants usually use aero-derivative GTs (i.e. turbines derived from 
the aeronautical industry), primarily because of their suitability to 
frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability 
maintenance options. To achieve 299 MW, PPL envisages using 3, 4 or 
5 individual aero-derivative GTGs. 
4.4.7 
However, âindustrialâ type units can also be used which are typically 
larger and often more suited to longer operational hours. They offer 
more efficiency but less flexibility. Industrial gas turbines differ from 
aeronautical designs in that the frames, bearings, and blading are of 
heavier construction. To achieve 299 MW, PPL would likely use 1 or 2 
individual industrial GTGs. 
4.4.8 
As stated in Section 1, the Power Generation Plant will be designed to 
operate as a âpeakingâ or flexible plant. This means that the Power 
Generation Plant will operate up to 1500 hours per annum and only be 
used when it is required to even out the electricity grid, e.g. when there 
is a surge in demand for electricity associated with a particular event 
(e.g. where many people across the country boil kettles following the 
end of a popular television programme) or where there is a sudden 
drop in power being generated from plant which are constantly 
operational (e.g. a sudden outage).

Peaking Plant 
4.4.9 
Peaking plants help to âbalance outâ the grid at times of peak electricity 
demand and also help to support the grid at times when other 
technologies (e.g. wind and solar plant) cannot generate electricity due 
to the weather conditions. Typically, peaking plants do not operate for 
long periods of time or very often. However when they do operate, they 
are nevertheless vital in âevening outâ the power in the grid. It is 
estimated that the Power Generation Plant at Eye would operate for a 
maximum of 1500 hours per year (approximately 17% of the time).  
Emissions and Stack 
4.4.10 
The exhaust gasses and waste heat produced as part of the 
combustion process will be discharged to the atmosphere by stacks. 
Typically, each GTG unit would have its own dedicated stack. However, 
if the chosen configuration contains two separate turbines connected to 
one generator, the exhaust stacks from these individual turbines may 
be combined into one.  
4.4.11 
The GTs will be equipped with emissions control abatement, which 
limits the production of NOx to a maximum of 50 mg/Nm3. Whether by 
water injection or dry low emission combustors, these techniques 
represent BAT for limiting emissions of NOx to atmosphere from GTs 
without the addition of chemical solutions, such as selective catalytic 
reduction using ammonia. 
4.4.12 
A stack height sensitivity study examined differing stack heights in 10 m 
intervals from 20 m to 80 m (inclusive). The stack height sensitivity 
considered long term and short term contributions to ground level 
concentrations of NO2. 
4.4.13 
Stack emissions will be continuously recorded to ensure correct and 
efficient operation of the plant. Any significant deviations will be 
alarmed and corrections carried out on occurrence. Records will be 
maintained of performance and deviation. Full facilities for interfacing 
information, control and alarm systems will be installed so that the plant 
can be operated from the central control room via the distributed control 
system (DCS). In the event of a fault in the GT(s) or other major plant 
items the Power Generation Plant will shut down automatically in a 
controlled manner. 
4.4.14 
Natural gas sourced from the NTS (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; 
consequently flue gas cleaning equipment is not required.

4.4.15 
Further discussion of emissions control is provided in Section 6 of this 
PEIR which sets out the environmental assessments undertaken to 
date relating to Air Quality.  
4.4.16 
The maximum dimensions of each stack will be up to 30 m in height 
and up to 10 m in diameter. Each proposed stack would be a minimum 
of 20 m high and 4 m diameter. 
Cooling 
4.4.17 
Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of SCGT plants are significantly lower than, for example, 
CCGT plants. The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, 
etc.) would be met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan coolers.  
Maintenance 
4.4.18 
Sufficient spares will be held on site to ensure reliable operation of the 
plant. Materials and finishes will be selected to meet this objective and 
to ensure that the appearance of the Power Generation Plant does not 
deteriorate with time. Periodic and routine maintenance will take place 
on average once every six months, to ensure optimal operation at all 
times.  
Other Miscellaneous Buildings 
4.4.19 
In addition to the main GTG units at the Power Generation Plant site, 
the following will also be present: 
ï¿½ 
Process Water Tank - In order to supply make up water to the 
plant.  
ï¿½ 
Fire Water Tank - The fire water storage tank will be designed to 
comply with the relevant fire regulations and will be installed 
together with fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable 
extinguishers. 
ï¿½ 
Control Building â Required in order to monitor the plant 
operation and house plant controls. 
ï¿½ 
Workshop and Stores Building - To store certain strategic and 
routine maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out 
minor maintenance of the plant. . 
ï¿½ 
A Gatehouse â Needed to provide security and maintain a log of 
site attendance, deliveries etc;  
ï¿½ 
A Switchyard would be required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Power Generation Plant to transformers 
before export to the National Grid; and

Gas Connection 
4.5.1 
A new gas pipeline will be required to connect the Power Generation 
Plant to the NTS in order to provide a reliable supply of fuel.  
4.5.2 
The UK National Grid Gas system is split into two parts, the NTS and 
the LTS (Local Transmission System).

4.5.3 
The NTS represents the infrastructure designed to transmit gas large 
distances around the country, these are generally large diameter 
pipelines (> 24â/600mm) operating at high pressure (~70barg). The 
NTS is the backbone of the UK gas infrastructure and as such does not 
reach all points of mainland Britain; the load driven extremities are 
covered by the LTS. 
4.5.4 
A Gas Connection Feasibility study was undertaken for the proposed 
Project in July 2013. The purpose of the study was to define and 
evaluate the options available for connecting the Power Generation 
Plant to a suitable source of fuel gas, and provide a recommendation 
on the most appropriate option for this connection. 
4.5.5 
Preliminary pipeline calculations were performed, including Maximum 
Operating Pressure of the system, Maximum Incidental Pressure, Pipe 
Nominal Diameter, Design Factor, Wall Thickness, Minimum Building 
Proximity Distance and Area Classification; 
4.5.6 
A Crossing / Risk Register has been prepared for each potential 
corridor routeing. A Level 1 Route Study has been performed for this 
report, which has analysed a specified relevant area of interest for 
archaeological, natural and built environment issues having regard to 
considerations raised in NPS EN-4. 
4.5.7 
Previous consultation documents (e.g. âProgress Power Project 
Scoping Report (issued to SoS in May 2013)) identified seven possible 
connection points as being potentially suitable locations to connect into 
the NTS infrastructure. All seven options connect to Feeder 5, a 
600 mm high pressure steel pipeline (known as the Yelverton to 
Stowmarket Pipeline) that passes approximately 200 m east of the 
Power Generation Plant site. No suitable connections were identified to 
the LTS.  
4.5.8 
Since the Scoping Report was issued, a number of further studies have 
been undertaken to refine the route corridor choice. The outcome of 
these studies is that there are now two remaining potential options to 
connect into the NTS and two potential suitable route corridors.  
4.5.9 
The refinement studies are outlined in more detail in Section 5 of this 
PEIR.  
4.5.10 
The Location of Feeder 5 and the two possible remaining connection 
options are shown below in Insert 4.2 and 4.3 below.

Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1  
4.5.11 
The 1st route corridor option (Route 1) shown in Insert 4.2 is 
approximately 0.1 km in length including no major crossings of any 
type. 
4.5.12 
The pipeline begins at the Power Generation Plant site heading east 
out of the site directly into the National Grid Gas Compressor Station 
located adjacent to the site.  
4.5.13 
This option provides the shortest possible route and potentially has the 
least impact on the area and surrounding environment, but could have 
further technical complications, due to the potential impact on the 
operation of the National Grid Gas Compressor Station. 
Insert 4.2 - Gas Connection Route Coridor Option 1 
 
 
Gas Connection Corridor Option 2  
4.5.14 
The second route corridor option (Route 2) shown in Insert 4.3 is 
approximately 1.5 km in length and includes 2 minor road crossings.

4.5.15 
The route begins at the south west corner of the Power Generation 
Plant site, immediately crossing Potash Lane. The route would then 
traverse west, along the northern edge of the agricultural field located 
west of Potash Lane, crossing a small track and continuing west until it 
meets the A140. At this point the route turns south to follow the eastern 
edge of the A140 until it meets Castleton Way. From here the route 
heads east, along the southern edge of the agricultural field, crossing 
Potash Lane again before entering the field to the north of Castleton 
Way where a new Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC) or Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) would be situated. 
Insert 4.3 - Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
 
 
4.5.16 
It is noted that the above plans show large buffers or potential areas in 
which each route may be developed. This is due to the fact that 
detailed studies are still ongoing to assess all potential constraints. 
However, following the completion of these detailed studies, the route 
choices will be refined as the Project progresses and the options 
narrowed to a single route corridor option.  
4.5.17 
Connection to the NTS at any high pressure pipeline would require two 
above ground facilities to be installed, an MOC facility, which would be 
owned by National Grid, and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) which would be

owned by PPL. The two facilities would contain the following pieces of 
equipment.  
4.5.18 
The MOC (approximately 30x30 m) would contain: 
ï¿½ 
Remotely Operable Valve (ROV) 
ï¿½ 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk 
ï¿½ 
Electrical supply kiosk 
4.5.19 
PTF (approximately 30x23 m) would contain: 
ï¿½ 
PIG launching facility; 
ï¿½ 
Emergency Control Valve; 
ï¿½ 
Isolation Valve; 
ï¿½ 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk 
ï¿½ 
Electrical Supply Kiosk. 
4.5.20 
Consultation feedback will be considered in determining which corridor 
option is the most appropriate. 
4.5.21 
The gas pipeline would be designed, constructed and tested to comply 
with the Institute of Gas Engineersâ (IGE) Recommendations on 
Transmission and Distribution Practice â IGE/TD/1: Edition 5, 2009 - 
Steel Pipelines and Associated Installations for High Pressure Gas 
Transmission (IGE/TD/1). 
4.5.22 
The standard gas pipeline wall thickness would comply with the 
requirements of IGE/TD/1, which defines the minimum safe separation 
distance between a high pressure gas pipeline and normally inhabited 
buildings / major roads / major railways. This minimum safe separation 
distance is known as the Building Proximity Distance (BPD). If normally 
inhabited buildings / major roads / major railways are closer than 1 BPD 
(i.e. the gas pipeline is in an area where additional protection is 
required), thicker wall steel pipe (known as proximity pipe) would be 
used. The exact locations and lengths of where thicker wall steel pipe 
will be used will be confirmed throughout the assessment and detailed 
design stages. 
4.5.23 
The gas pipeline would be buried to a depth of cover which is in 
accordance with recognised industry standards. For example, depths of 
cover would be: 
ï¿½ 
No less than 1.2 m in agricultural land; 
ï¿½ 
No less than 2 m under road crossings; and 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

- 70 - 
 
ï¿½ 
No less than 1.7 m under water crossing. 
Gas Connection Construction 
4.5.24 
Construction of the gas pipeline is likely to take place within a 
temporary fenced strip of land called the âworking widthâ. The gas 
pipeline working width is required to facilitate safe construction and the 
protection of off-site receptors. 
4.5.25 
It is likely that the working width may be ~ 40 m (where specialist 
crossings are required) along the length of the gas pipeline route, 
although it may be necessary to increase / decrease the working width 
at specific points. For example, adjacent to special crossings it may be 
necessary to increase the working width to provide additional working 
areas and storage for materials or special plant. Alternatively, adjacent 
to areas of conservation or existing services it may be necessary to 
decrease the working width. 
4.5.26 
Access to the working width will be at defined points along the gas 
pipeline route. These points will be carefully controlled and signposted, 
and gates / stiles will be incorporated into the temporary fences 
wherever access must be maintained (e.g. for public rights of way). 
4.5.27 
Where appropriate, access across watercourses will be achieved by 
the installation of temporary pipes (flumes) within the channel which will 
then be ramped over to create a continuous running track for 
construction vehicles, yet still allow a continuous flow of water within 
the channel of the watercourse. Where flumes are not appropriate, 
alternative crossing methods will be discussed with the relevant 
consultees, including the EA and Natural England. 
4.5.28 
Aside from the special crossings, where trenchless techniques may be 
used to reduce impact on sensitive areas, it is expected that the 
pipeline will be constructed using standard open-cut cross-country 
pipeline construction techniques. The main activities will include: topsoil 
stripping; pipe stringing (the process of laying the pipe end to end) and 
welding; trench excavation; pipe laying (positioning of the welded pipe 
into the trench); back filling; pressure testing, drying and pipeline 
pigging operations; and re-instatement of the land.  
4.5.29 
Topsoil will be stripped within the working width along the pipeline route 
and a running track will be established to allow the movement of 
machinery. The pipeline will be constructed from lengths of steel pipe of 
a length of up to approximately 12 m. These are normally off-loaded 
with cranes at road crossings, transported along the working width and 
laid out on timbers adjacent to the trench line in preparation for welding 
and lowering into the trench. The individual lengths of pipe are then

welded together to form the pipeline which is then subjected to 
inspection. Once the welds are accepted, a standard coating is applied 
on site. The pipeline coating is the tested electronically along the whole 
of its length to detect damage or other defects, which if present would 
be repaired and before re-testing. 
4.6 
Electrical Connection 
4.6.1 
A new connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Power Generation Plant to be exported to the electricity 
transmission network. 
4.6.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Power 
Generation Plant site in April 2013. The assessments analysed the 
transmission and distribution grid connection options and determined 
the available thermal and fault level capacity on the electrical network. 
Discussions were also held with the National Grid Company (NGC).  
Location of new Electrical Connection Compound (Substation and 
SEC) 
4.6.3 
In order to establish the most technically, economically, and 
environmentally appropriate location for the new Electrical Connection 
Compound, a Siting Study has been carried out. This study comprised 
a desk based assessment to consider which areas within the vicinity of 
the proposed Power Generation Plant could be suitable for the siting of 
a substation and SEC.  
4.6.4 
To ensure that the potential substation would not introduce unwanted 
visual impacts, it was decided that the search area for the study would 
be limited to an area that could be reached by an underground cable, 
thus ensuring that additional overhead lines could be ruled out at the 
offset. 
4.6.5 
The study considered a number of sites, which were within a radius of 3 
km from the proposed Power Generation Plant site (which is the 
longest economically viable distance for an underground Electrical 
Connection of this type), and assessed their suitability based on the 
potential impacts on Noise, Landscape and Visual Impact, Ecology, 
Water and Flood Risk, Geology and Agriculture, and impacts on 
Cultural Heritage Assets and Archaeology. 
4.6.6 
The Substation Siting Study found that, although some mitigation 
measures would need to be put in place, due to the relatively uniform 
nature of the local environment, there are no constraints to the 
development of a substation that favour one site over another along the 
existing 400 kV power line. As such, it has been decided that the most

suitable location for a new substation would be as close to the Power 
Generation Plant as possible, as this would shorten the underground 
Electrical Connection route and thus reduce the impact that 
construction of the Electrical Connection may have on any potentially 
environmentally sensitive receptors. 
4.6.7 
As such, two potentially suitable locations have been considered within 
this PEIR.  
4.6.8 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 is located to the south of 
the Leys, within agricultural land to the north of Mellis Road (see Insert 
4.4). 
4.6.9 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 2 is located to the north of 
the Leys, within agricultural land off Leys Lane between The Leys and 
Goswold Hall (see Insert 4.5).  
Revised Electrical Connection Route Corridor Options 
4.6.10 
The Electrical Connection route corridor for the Project will be 
dependent upon which of the two Electrical Connection Compound 
options is preferred following the consultation and the final position of 
the compound within that option. At this stage, two potential route 
corridor options have been identified, each identifying a potential 
underground Electrical Connection route for each of the Electrical 
Connection Compound options. Each of these routes is described 
below and presented is Insert 4.3 and 4.4. 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor Option 1 (serving Electrical 
Connection Compound Option 1) 
4.6.11 
As shown on Insert 4.4, the underground Electrical Connection would 
exit the western edge of the Power Generation Plant site and head 
south down Potash Lane (the former Eye Airfield Runway) before 
turning west, to the south of the Speed Deck factory and crossing the

south down Potash Lane (the former Eye Airfield Runway) before 
turning west, to the south of the Speed Deck factory and crossing the

Construction and maintenance access for both of the above options is 
likely to follow the final Electrical Connection route corridor once 
agreed. It is likely, however, that access improvement works will be 
required at the northern end of the preferred access route, Old Norwich 
Road, between White House Farm and the fishing pond. A portion of 
Leys Lane will also likely require improvement works. 
4.6.16 
Further details of alternative options and these access requirements, 
and potential improvement works will be provided and assessed in the 
ES.  
Electrical Connection Construction

Cable installation will follow a similar method to hat for the gas 
connection. It would predominantly be carried out in an excavated

trench with cable directly buried in the trench (open-cut method). The 
cable bedding will be laid (at a typical 1 m below ground level, subject 
to existing conditions and the location of existing buried services) and 
the cable pull set up. Once the cables are pulled in and the rollers 
removed, the cable surround can be installed with cable protection 
cover slabs placed over the cable. Finally, the backfilling and final 
reinstatement will be undertaken. 
4.6.18 
For cable installation on / across narrow roads with small verges, 
installation in pre-installed ducts constructed under the road is 
preferred due to potential impacts to road traffic of the open-cut 
installation method. The installation of ducts and trench re-instatement 
would be completed in stages, given the need for excavations and a 
working area, and progress on a daily basis. Once all ducts were 
installed, cable joint bays would be excavated, ideally in the verges, 
and the cables pulled in. 
4.6.19 
As for the gas connection, trenchless techniques may be used to 
reduce impact on sensitive areas.

SITE SELECTION, ALTERNATIVES AND DESIGN EVOLUTION 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
The EIA Regulations6 require that an ES should include an outline of 
the main alternatives that have been studied by the applicant and an 
indication of the main reasons for the ultimate choice of option, taking 
into account likely significant environmental impacts. Under the EIA 
Regulations there is no requirement to assess alternatives, only a 
requirement to provide information about those alternatives that have 
been considered.  
5.1.2 
The proposed Project has gone through several iterations and 
evolutions in design, and the site selection itself has been an iterative 
process. The following alternatives have been considered for The 
proposed Project as part of the design evolution process:  
ï¿½ Alternative development sites;  
ï¿½ Alternative layouts;  
ï¿½ Alternative technologies for electricity generation; 
ï¿½ Alternative options for the Electrical Connection; and 
ï¿½ Alternative options for the Gas Connection. 
5.1.3 
An account of these alternatives is provided below.  
5.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
5.2.1 
In deciding upon the Power Generation Plant site, WPL has had regard 
to a number of factors, such as those described in NPS EN-2. 
However, in line with paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy 
companies to decide which applications to bring forward and the 
government does not seek to direct applicants to particular sites for 
fossil fuel generating stations" unlike, for example, nuclear generating 
stations. 
5.2.2 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, WPL looked at a range of 
sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this nature. 
The key factors which WPL considered necessary in a site were 
broadly fourfold; technical, environmental, economic, and in line with 
local planning policy.

5.2.3 
In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough 
to support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and integral 
infrastructure) and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and 
electrical connection points were both key considerations.  
5.2.4 
From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to 
close sensitive receptors (to avoid unnecessary impacts from noise and 
visual disturbance), the current make up of the surrounding area (to 
limit impacts on the landscape character of the area), previous site 
uses and land quality (to avoid sterilisation of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land or mineral assets) and proximity to sensitive 
ecological habitats.  
5.2.5 
Based on these factors, the site at Eye was considered suitable for the 
siting of a 299 MW Power Generation Plant for the following reasons:  
ï¿½ 
Close proximity (<1 km) to the gas NTS; 
ï¿½ 
Close proximity (<1.5 km) to a high voltage electrical transmission 
infrastructure; 
ï¿½ 
The site is within an existing industrial estate; 
ï¿½ 
The site is surrounded by similar industrial developments including 
the Eye Chicken Litter Power Station ; 
ï¿½ 
The area is identified in the emerging EADF as an area that MSDC 
has aspirations to develop as an energy park; and 
ï¿½ 
There is more than adequate space on site to develop the Power 
Generation Plant and integral infrastructure.  
5.3 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.1 
Previous consultation documents (e.g. the Scoping Report (PRO-4100-
PB-ENV-RPT-R40) submitted to SoS in May 2013) identified four 
potential technology options which could be developed to generate 
299 MW.  
5.3.2 
The four options under consideration were: CCGT plant, SCGT plant 
and RGE plant. Consideration was also given to the potential utilisation 
of CHP at the site.  
5.3.3 
Since the submission of the Scoping Report, further conceptual design 
studies and financial modelling of the four options above have 
determined that an SCGT plant would be a suitable option for a 299 
MW peaking plant at the Power Generation Plant site. Such plants are 
designed to only operate during periods of peak demand, where they 
can be called upon at short notice to provide additional electricity to the 
grid or when there is a shortfall from other sources of electricity

generation (such as from Wind Farms on calm days when there is no 
wind). This has been determined based on the following environmental, 
business drivers, and technical considerations: 
Environmental 
5.3.4 
In a CCGT plant, the hot exhaust gases are routed through a heat 
recovery steam generator (HRSG), where they are condensed to form 
steam, which then drives a steam turbine. In comparison, the hot 
exhaust gases in a SCGT plant are discharged to the atmosphere via 
the stack, with the flue gases. This means that the flue gases 
discharged from a SCGT plant are significantly hotter than those 
discharged from a CCGT plant, and therefore the gases are much more 
buoyant.  
5.3.5 
This means that a much lower stack is required for a SCGT plant to 
achieve the same âeffective stack heightâ and required dispersion as a 
CCGT plant. The Scoping Report suggested that the stack of a single 
unit CCGT plant could be up to 90 m to achieve adequate dispersion in 
order to meet air quality standards. Subsequent air quality modelling 
screening runs (described in detail in Section 6 of this PEIR) have 
determined that a suitable stack height to achieve adequate dispersion 
of pollutants from a SCGT plant at the Power Generation Plant site is a 
maximum of 30 m.  
5.3.6 
This represents a significant overall reduction in stack height, and the 
associated landscape and visual impacts arising from the tallest 
structures on site in comparison to a CCGT plant. Further description of 
the Landscape and Visual assessment of the proposed Project is 
outlined in Section 11 of this PEIR.  
5.3.7 
When a SCGT plant is compared to a RGE plant, although there is no 
benefit in terms of reduction of stack height (stack height for RGE units 
and SCGT units would be similar) the noise emissions from RGE plant 
are typically louder than for a SCGT plant. This is because RGEs 
operate using ignition of gaseous fuels and air in a specific mix which 
causes motion of a piston to generate electricity.  
5.3.8 
Furthermore, in order to generate steam for the steam cycle of a CCGT 
plant, a sizeable quantity of water would be required. Through 
discussion  with  the  EA  and  MSDC  it  is  clear  that  the  availability  of  
water in the local area is extremely limited. There are no surface 
watercourses that would be suitable for abstractions, and although the 
site is underlain by a principle aquifer, through discussions with the EA 
PPL is aware that this aquifer is already heavily abstracted, putting 
significant pressure on the local water supply, and as such it is unlikely 
that an abstraction licence for the proposed Project would be granted.

- 82 - 
 
As such, SCGT technology is preferable in this area as the water 
requirement is significantly less, and could be met with the occasional 
delivery of water by tanker. 
Economic Drivers 
5.3.9 
Compared to both RGE and CCGT plant, SCGT units typically have a 
much smaller capital cost per MW. This is largely because CCGT plant 
is more complex in their operation (see below for technical 
considerations) and are more efficient. RGE plants are also more 
flexible and allow operation on different fuels. However, as explained in 
Section 4, the nature of the Power Generation Plant at Eye is that of a 
peaking plant which will operate for less than 1500 hours per year. 
Over this timescale, the benefits in efficiencies or flexibility which can 
be achieved by using a CCGT or RGE plant are very minimal and do 
not warrant the additional capital costs of these plant. As SCGT plants 
are less complex in operation than CCGT or RGE plant, they are also 
cheaper to construct and maintain.  
Technical  
5.3.10 
As previously mentioned, technically, CCGT plant is more complex 
than a SCGT plant, primarily because of the presence of an HRSG and 
steam cycle. In turn, this leads to more difficult maintenance 
requirements and a much longer construction timescale because of the 
large number of interconnections.  
5.3.11 
Although CCGT plant are more efficient, due to their use of waste heat 
(around 60% compared to 40% for SCGT) this gain in efficiency is 
unlikely to be warranted given the limited number of operational hours 
which the Power Generation Plant will run (less than 1500 hours per 
annum).  
5.3.12 
Due to the method in which fuel is combusted in RGEs, there is also 
usually a requirement for additional control of NOx emissions in order 
to meet IED guidelines. This additional NOx control would usually be in 
the form of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) which would not only 
require further land take and more maintenance, but may also require 
ammonia or urea injection to operate. This then has impacts in terms of 
environmental disposal of catalysts, as well as ammonia slip which is 
released from the stack.  
CHP 
5.3.13 
Efficient CHP plants are usually designed to meet the demands of an 
identified heat load. Electrical power generation is utilised, where 
applicable for local process plant, and the balance exported to the grid. 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report 
 
PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx

- 83 - 
 
The heat demands of industrial processes are usually continuous, and 
district heating demands are also usually continuous (albeit on a 
seasonal basis).  
5.3.14 
Therefore, this is in direct contrast to the operation of an SCGT peaking 
plant, which is designed to operate intermittently and unpredictably. 
Accordingly, any heat loads would be better served, and met more 
appropriately and efficiently, by dedicated CHP plants, allowing the 
SCGT plant to provide the necessary support to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System.  
5.3.15 
In addition, as SCGT plant do not have any associated HRSG / steam 
turbine plant, the provision of steam from an SCGT plant would not be 
possible without the provision of additional steam raising plant / 
equipment, which would require more equipment to be constructed and 
a larger overall land take.  
5.3.16 
Following consideration of environmental, economic and technical 
drivers, PPL considers that the balance of these considerations clearly 
favours SCGT technology (without CHP) for delivery of a 299 MW 
peaking plant.  
5.4 
Gas Connection 
5.4.1 
The Scoping Report identified seven potential Gas Connection options 
to connect the Power Generation Plant to Feeder 5 on the NTS.  
5.4.2 
Further analysis from additional studies has determined that five of 
these route corridor options are no longer feasible ((options 2, 2a, 2b, 3 
& 5) See Section 3.4 of the Progress Power EIA Scoping Report)).  
5.4.3 
Options 2, 2a and 2b have all been discounted as they would pass 
within close proximity to the recently consented wind turbines located to 
the south of proposed Power Generation Plant site . This would breach 
National Grid safety guidelines for the positioning of gas pipes and wind 
turbines. Options 2 and 2b also cross the centre of the field meaning 
that a large area of the field would be rendered unusable. 
5.4.4 
Option 3 has been discounted as this could produce a barrier between 
the agricultural field to the west and the rest of the Airfield Industrial 
Estate, thus potentially reducing its development value in the future. 
(See Section 3.4 of the Progress Power EIA Scoping Report).  
5.4.5 
Option 5 has been discounted as this would require passing through a 
currently busy and operational part of the business park (See Section 
3.4 of the Progress Power EIA Scoping Report). The construction of

this option could cause significant disruption to these businesses which 
would not be acceptable. 
5.4.6 
Therefore, route corridor options 1 and 4 (as identified in Section 3.5 of 
this PEIR) are still under consideration for the proposed Project and are 
subject to preliminary assessment in this PEIR.  
5.5 
Electrical Connection Compound (Substation and SEC) 
5.5.1 
Preliminary outline designs for the Electrical Connection Compound 
suggest that it would be composed of a new SEC and a new air 
insulated 
switch yard 
(i.e. substation). The 
SEC would 
be 
approximately 45 m X 22 m located on the west side of the existing 
overhead line and the new air insulated switch yard including an array 
of electrical switching gear and other works areas would be 150 m X 
150 m, located on the east side of the overhead line.  
5.5.2 
The exact location for the proposed new Electrical Connection 
Compound is still under review. A recent Substation Siting Study 
identified two potentially suitable areas, both of which have up to 12 ha 
in area. However, the electrical connection compound would only be 
approximately 3 ha in size  
5.5.3 
The first of the two areas is located on open agricultural land south of 
The Leys, and north of Vine Farm, while the second location is located 
further north between The Leys and Goswold Hall (see inserts 4.4 and 
4.5) .  
5.5.4 
These areas have both been subject to environmental studies, some of 
which are ongoing, and the preliminary environmental effects of 
developing an Electrical Connection Compound at either one of the 
sites is presented within the following sections. 
5.6 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor 
5.6.1 
The proposed Project Scoping Report identified a large âopportunity 
areaâ to the west of the A140. Based on the findings of the Scoping 
Report, it was proposed that this large opportunity area would be the 
focus of any studies related to the development of the Electrical 
Connection corridors.  
5.6.2 
Since the publication of the Scoping Report, numerous ecological 
surveys were undertaken which identified a number of ecological 
constraints in the opportunity area.  
5.6.3 
The ecological constraints were considered by the Project team and it 
was decided that the majority (northern area) of the opportunity area

would not be suitable for the development of Electrical Connection 
corridors. As such it is likely that the Electrical Connection point will be 
located in the south of the opportunity area, between Vine Farm and 
Goswold Hall. 
5.6.4 
The exact configuration and route of the Electrical Connection will be 
dependent upon the outcome of the preferred Electrical Connection 
Compound location.  
5.6.5 
At present, two Electrical Connection route corridor options (one for 
each Electrical Connection Compound area) have been identified within 
this PEIR and the preliminary assessment findings of developing an 
underground Electrical Connection along those corridors is presented 
in the following sections.

AIR QUALITY 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
The construction, operation and de-commissioning of the proposed 
Project all have the potential to impact on local air quality. During 
construction and decommissioning, all elements of the proposed 
Project have the potential to generate emissions, such as from 
construction vehicle exhausts and dust, and thus impact on local air 
quality. This Section provides a preliminary assessment of the Air 
Quality impacts of the proposed Project, incorporating the Power 
Generation Plant, the two Gas Connection options and the two 
Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection options.  
6.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
Ambient Air Quality Directive 
6.2.2 
Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and 
management (the Air Quality Framework Directive) described the basic 
principles as to how air quality should be assessed and managed in the 
Member States. Subsequent Daughter Directives introduced numerical 
limits, thresholds and monitoring requirements for a variety of pollutants 
including NOx and SO2 to guarantee that there are no adverse effects 
with regard to human health.  
6.2.3 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and 
cleaner air for Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive) merges the 
Air Quality Framework Directive with the First, Second and Third 
Daughter Directives. The Ambient Air Quality Directive identifies 
desired maximum ground level concentrations and the date by which 
the objectives should be met and introduces new objectives for fine 
particles.  
6.2.4 
The Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 (the AQS Regulations) 
give effect, in England, to the Ambient Air Quality Directive. 
Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 
6.2.5 
The AQS Regulations specify a series of standards and objectives for 
air quality in the UK. The objectives are summarised, as appropriate to 
the proposed Project, in Table 6.1

6.2.6 
The AQS Regulations have also been implemented through the Air 
Quality Strategy for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland 
(2007).  
Local Air Quality Management 
6.2.7 
The Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to review air 
quality within their district or borough in order to determine where 
pollutant levels identified in the Air Quality Framework Directive may be 
in excess of the standards.  
6.2.8 
If pollutant levels in an area are likely to exceed statutory objectives, 
then local authorities must declare an Air Quality Management Area 
(AQMA) and draft an Action Plan to achieve the statutory objectives. 
The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has 
issued technical guidance to local authorities to assist in undertaking 
this task.  
6.2.9 
This gives the local authority a clear picture of the sources which can 
be controlled or influenced, and aid the local authority to target more 
effectively the relative contributions of industry, transport and other 
sectors and ensure that the solutions are cost effective and 
proportionate when producing their Action Plan.  
6.2.10 
As part of the on-going review and assessment process of AQMAs, a 
phased approach has been adopted to ensure that the level of local 
authority assessment is commensurate with the risk of an air quality 
objective being exceeded. Therefore, each local authority is required to 
undertake an Updating and Screening Assessment (USA) of the 
AQMAs within their administrative area in order to identify changes 
which have occurred since the previous review and assessment that 
could potentially lead to a risk of an air quality objective being 
exceeded. Where a risk has been identified the local authority is

- 91 - 
 
required to undertake a more detailed assessment to determine the 
likelihood of an exceedence and revise the AQMA as appropriate.  
Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 
6.2.11 
Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution 
prevention and control) (IED) recast seven directives related to 
industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 January 
2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive) and 
Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions 
of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the Large 
Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into a single legislative instrument 
to improve the permitting, compliance and enforcement regimes 
adopted by Member States. 
6.2.12 
The IPPC Directive laid down measures to prevent or, where that is not 
practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and land introducing 
ELVs and BAT. The LCPD prescribed ELVs for nitrogen oxides, 
sulphur dioxide and particulates. These are the pollutants relevant to 
the EIA of the proposed Project. 
6.2.13 
The IED makes provisions for the continuation of the requirements and 
principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD and introduces new, 
more stringent, ELVs with full compliance required by 1st January 
2016. 
6.2.14 
The LCPD and IPPC Directive are implemented in England and Wales 
by the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 
2010 (the EP Regulations).  
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
6.2.15 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) (EP) Regulations 
2007 sought to introduce a single streamlined environmental permitting 
and compliance regime to apply in England and Wales. They do this by 
integrating the previous regimes covering waste management licensing 
and Pollution Prevention and Control. The EP Regulations increase the 
scope of the 2007 Regulations.  
6.2.16 
The EA will control and regulate the Power Generation Plant with

Permit that will be required for the proposed Project, under the EP 
Regulations. The Environmental Permit will include specific ELVs to 
apply to the Power Generation Plant for the relevant pollutants

The Habitats Directive 
6.2.17 
The European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) sets out the legal 
framework requiring EU member states to protect habitat sites 
supporting vulnerable and protected species, as listed within the 
Directive. This Directive is transposed into UK law by the Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and requires protection of 
ecological sites including Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and 
Special Protection Areas (SPAs). 
6.2.18 
The Habitats Directive is implemented in England and Wales by the 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.  
6.2.19 
Across the UK, site-specific critical levels (which relate to airborne 
pollutant concentrations at ground level) and critical loads (which relate 
to deposition of materials to soils) have been set for a variety of 
protected habitats and species in order to allow the quantitative 
assessment of the condition of ecologically sensitive sites and thus the 
protection of such sites by the relevant competent authorities.  
The Ambient Air Quality Directive 
6.2.20 
The Ambient Air Quality Directive sets ambient air quality guidelines for 
NOx for the protection of ecosystems. This imposes a long-term 
(annual average) limit for NOx of 30 Âµg/m3 (critical level). In terms of 
the limit for the protection of ecosystems, it is important to define the 
areas in which the limit is to be achieved. Directive 2008/50/EC states 
that sampling points to determine concentrations should be:  
ï¿½ 
20 km from an agglomeration (which is defined as an area with a 
population of more than 250 000); or 
ï¿½ 
At least 5 km from other built-up areas, industrial installations or 
motorways or major roads with traffic counts of more than 50 000 
vehicles per day;  
ï¿½ 
Representative of air quality in a surrounding area of at least 
1000 km2.  
6.2.21 
This is mirrored in the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010.

National Policy Statements  
6.2.22 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
air emissions impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
6.2.23 
Paragraph 5.2.4 of EN-1 states that: âEmissions from combustion 
plants are generally released through exhaust stacks. Design of 
exhaust stacks, particularly height, is the primary driver for the delivery 
of optimal dispersion of emissions and is often determined by statutory 
requirements.â 
6.2.24 
EN-2 highlights, in paragraph 2.5.3, that the significant emissions to air 
from fossil fuel generating stations will be oxides of nitrogen and 
sulphur dioxide, whilst noting that the emissions of sulphur dioxide from 
gas-fired generating stations may be negligible. 
6.2.25 
In relation to the assessment of air quality impacts by a developer, 
paragraph 5.2.10 of EN-1 requires that the SoS takes into account any 
relevant statutory air quality limits and that developers should work with 
the relevant authorities to secure appropriate mitigation measures to 
allow the proposal to succeed. 
6.2.26 
Paragraph 5.2.11 states that: âThe [Secretary of State] should consider 
whether mitigation measures are needed both for operational and 
construction emissions over and above any which may form part of the 
project application. A construction management plan may help codify 
mitigation at this stage.â 
Other National and Local Policy 
6.2.27 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy may be considered important and 
relevant by the SoS in the determination of an energy NSIP. 
6.2.28 
The NPPF states (paragraph 7) that the planning system should 
perform a number of roles in delivering sustainable development 
including an environmental role âcontributing to protecting and 
enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; and, as part of 
this, helping to improve biodiversity, use natural resources prudently,

minimise waste and pollution, and mitigate and adapt to climate change 
including moving to a low carbon economy.â 
6.2.29 
Saved Policy E12 of the Mid Suffolk Local Plan (1998) seeks that 
industrial development should not adversely affect neighbouring 
properties in respect of smell, noxious emissions or dust.  
6.2.30 
Policy CS4 of the Core Strategy DPD of the Mid Suffolk Local 
Development Framework (2008, and as updated in the Focused 
Review of 2012) seeks that development that harms the quality of air 
and/or causes dust or odour will be avoided where possible, to protect 
people and the environment. Policy CS5 seeks that development 
proposals maintain and enhance the environment. 
6.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
6.3.1 
In respect of Air Quality, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 4 of 
this PEIR) are set out in Table 6.2.  
6.3.2 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to air 
quality impacts is that the buoyancy of a plume is, principally, a function 
of its temperature and volume. Assuming the thermal efficiency of the 
units for all options of between one and five units is the same, a 
specific plant electrical output will require a specific amount of natural 
gas. The combustion of this gas would thus result in a specific volume 
of flue gas. 
6.3.3 
The temperature of the flue gases will be similar irrespective of the 
number of installed units. However, if the flue gases are split between 
multiple stacks, the volumetric flow rate of each plume will be reduced 
(e.g. the use of five stacks will emit 20 per cent of the total flue gas 
volume) thus reducing the buoyancy of the flue gases proportionately. 
6.3.4 
The reduction in buoyancy will limit the potential for atmospheric 
dispersion of the flue gases. For instance, simple plume rise 
calculations indicate that the potential plume rise for emissions from 
five individual stacks would be around half that which could be 
achieved for emissions for the same total volume of flue gas but from 
two individual stacks. 
6.3.5 
Additional evidence of this is provided in this Section as the 
assessment to date has considered two of the potential options for the 
number of units to be utilised for the proposed Project. Therefore, the 
assumed realistic worst case scenario is considered robust.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria  
6.4.1 
The assessment methodology set out below is applicable to each of the 
construction, operation and decommissioning phases. It addresses the 
way in which the preliminary assessment has been carried out, how the 
different assessment scenarios described in Section 3 are considered 
and the technical approach to assessments. 
Construction 
6.4.2 
Construction impacts will be assessed within the EIA and the results 
and discussions will be presented in the final ES. Preliminary 
assessment work has been carried out to establish the preliminary 
likely significant environmental effects so as to inform this PEIR. The 
methodology for this assessment, which will be carried through into the 
final ES, is discussed below. 
Airborne Particulate Matter 
6.4.3 
The potential impact of construction site dust is being assessed in 
accordance with the Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) 
âGuidance on the Assessment of Construction on Air Quality and the 
Determination of their Significanceâ (October 2011). This guidance 
states: 
6.4.4 
âThe risk of emissions of dust (all types) from a demolition/construction 
site causing a statutory nuisance, loss of amenity and/or health or 
ecological effects will be related to:

ï¿½ 
the activities being undertaken (demolition, number of vehicles and 
plant etc.); 
ï¿½ 
the meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction and rainfall); 
ï¿½ 
the proximity of receptors to the activity; 
ï¿½ 
the duration of the activity; 
ï¿½ 
the adequacy of the mitigation measures applied to reduce or 
eliminate dust; and 
ï¿½ 
the sensitivity of the receptors to dust. 
6.4.5 
Emissions of dust will vary depending on the activities being 
undertaken throughout the day; and mitigation must be designed to 
respond to this.â 
6.4.6 
The assessment incorporates a number of stages in order to:  
ï¿½ 
screen the requirement for a more detailed assessment so that 
activities unlikely to cause significant effects are not considered 
further;  
ï¿½ 
determine the risk of dust effects and hence the need for additional 
mitigation (i.e. above the standard mitigation that may be expected 
to be applied to any construction sites); and 
ï¿½ 
following the definition of the mitigation, the description of the 
residual effects and their significance. 
6.4.7 
Under the above Guidance, activities on-site will be divided into four 
types to reflect their different potential impacts: 
ï¿½ 
Demolition; 
ï¿½ 
Earthworks; 
ï¿½ 
Construction; and 
ï¿½ 
Trackout (of dust from site/vehicles along access/haulage routes). 
6.4.8 
The assessment methodology examines the potential dust effects with 
regards to: 
ï¿½ 
Annoyance / disturbance due to dust deposition / soiling; 
ï¿½ 
Harm to ecological receptors; and 
ï¿½ 
Human health impact due to increase in exposure to fine particulate 
matter (PM10). 
6.4.9 
The IAQM Guidance adopts a risk-based approach to air quality 
associated with construction / demolition and, for each of these 
aspects, the magnitude of any potential impact is assessed as being

within a dust emissions class that is Large, Medium or Small. These 
are defined based on the type of activity as follows: 
ï¿½ 
Demolition: 
i 
Large:  Total  building  volume  >50  000  m3, potentially dusty 
construction material (e.g. concrete), on-site crushing and 
screening, demolition activities >20 m above ground level; 
ii 
Medium: Total building volume 20,000 m3 â 50,000m3, 
potentially dusty construction material, demolition activities 
10-20 m above ground level; and 
iii 
Small: Total building volume <20,000 m3, construction 
material with low potential for dust release (e.g. metal 
cladding or timber), demolition activities <10m above ground, 
demolition during wetter months. 
ï¿½ 
Earthworks: 
i 
Large: Total site area >10 000 m2, potentially dusty soil type 
(e.g. clay, which will be prone to suspension when dry due to 
small particle size), >10 heavy earth moving vehicles active at 
any one time, formation of bunds >8 m in height, total material 
moved >100 000 tonnes; 
ii 
Medium: Total site area 2 500 m2 â 10 000 m2, moderately 
dusty soil type (e.g. silt), 5-10 heavy earth moving vehicles 
active at any one time, formation of bunds 4 m - 8 m in height, 
total material moved 20 000 tonnes â 100 000 tonnes; and 
iii 
Small: Total site area <2 500 m2, soil type with large grain 
size (e.g. sand), <5 heavy earth moving vehicles active at any 
one time, formation of bunds <4 m in height, total material 
moved <10 000 tonnes, earthworks during wetter months. 
ï¿½ 
Construction: 
iv 
Large: Total building volume >100 000 m3, piling, on site 
concrete batching; sandblasting; 
v 
Medium: Total building volume 25 000 m3 â  100  000  m3, 
potentially dusty construction material (e.g. concrete), piling, 
on site concrete batching; and

vii 
Large: >100 Heavy goods vehicles (HGV) (>3.5 t) trips in any 
one day, potentially dusty surface material (e.g. high clay

viii 
Medium: 25-100 HGV (>3.5 t) trips in any one day, 
moderately dusty surface material (e.g. high clay content), 
unpaved road length 50m â 100 m; and 
ix 
Small / Medium: <25 HGV (>3.5 t) trips in any one day, 
surface material with low potential for dust release, unpaved 
road length <50 m. 
6.4.10 
The risk-based approach considers the significance of any potential 
impact with regards to the number / sensitivity of receptors and the 
distances to the receptors. 
6.4.11 
The results of the assessments produce a risk level for the site / area of 
assessment which inform the mitigation and management techniques 
that should be implemented based on the recommendations of âThe 
control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition â Best 
Practice Guidanceâ (Greater London Authority, 2006). 
Construction Vehicles and Traffic 
6.4.12 
The impact of the emissions from construction vehicles (both on- and 
off-site) is being assessed using the methodology prescribed in the 
Department for Transport âDesign Manual for Roads and Bridges 
(DMRB) Volume 11 Section 3, Part 1: Air Qualityâ for the estimation of 
emissions from vehicles. 
Operation 
6.4.13 
For the purposes of assessing operational impacts the air quality 
impact assessment has examined each of: 
ï¿½ 
Operation of five aero-derivative units (each of c.60 MW) 
ï¿½ 
Operation of two industrial units (each of c.150 MW) 
6.4.14 
To assess the air quality impacts that will arise during operation, the 
assessment has focussed on the dispersion of the flue gases from the 
stack(s), being the potentially significant sources of emissions to air. 
6.4.15 
The impacts of the emissions from the stacks has been quantitatively 
assessed using industry standard air dispersion modelling techniques 
in accordance with the latest EA guidance, particularly such guidance 
provided by their Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (AQMAU).

Decommissioning 
6.4.16 
The air quality impacts of decommissioning will be similar to those that 
will be assessed for construction. The assessment of demolition air 
quality impacts is therefore be carried out on the same basis as that for 
those arising from construction activities with the addition of 
âdemolitionâ, as per the IAQM Guidance. 
Ambient Air Quality and the Protection of Human Health  
6.4.17 
The AQS Regulations specify a series of standards and objectives for 
air quality in the UK. The objectives are summarised in Table 6.1 and 
consider pollutants that are the principal products of industrial 
combustion processes. These are the basis for the assessment of 
emissions for the operation phase. 
6.4.18 
NOx are primarily formed by two reaction routes. âThermalâ NOx is 
formed by the reaction of atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen at the high 
combustion temperatures within the GT whilst âpromptâ NOx is formed 
by the reaction of atmospheric nitrogen with free radicals from the fuel 
via a complex series or reactions. Assessment of NOx is important 
because oxides of nitrogen subsequently convert to NO2, in the 
presence of ozone in the atmosphere.  
6.4.19 
CO is formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon in a fuel. 
Combustion in GTs is conducted at high excess air rates, typically 200-
300 per cent excess air. Therefore there will be only very low levels of 
carbon monoxide or unburned hydrocarbons present in the flue gases 
from the Power Generation Plant (as detailed in Table 6.5 and Table 
6.6).  
Protection of Vegetation and Ecosystems 
6.4.20 
As set out at Paragraph 6.2.20 above, the long-term (annual average) 
limit for NOx of 30 Âµg/m3 is the critical level for the protection of 
vegetation and ecosystems. The location of sampling points in order to 
demonstrate compliance with this standard (and therefore areas of 
where this standard should apply) is influenced by the presence of 
other industrial installations nearby.  
6.4.21 
The limitations to the applicability of this standard are noted (as per 
Paragraph 6.2.19). Nevertheless, the impact of the Power Generation 
Plant will be assessed against the above standard in order to 
demonstrate the potential impact. This is considered particularly 
important given the location with respect to the neighbouring areas 
afforded EU protection for their ecological status.

6.4.22 
Ecological receptors such as the Waveney & Little Ouse Valley Fens 
SAC and the Major Farm, Gypsy Camp Meadows and Hoxne Brick Pit 
SSSIs may also be sensitive to the deposition of nutrient nitrogen and 
the deposition of acidity due to nitrogen as a result of the process 
contribution to ground level concentrations of NOx. 
6.4.23 
Atmospheric nitrogen is a source of essential nutrients for vegetation 
and the ambient concentration commonly limit growth in temperate 
ecosystems. Increased availability of nitrogen in the air (such as 
through increases in the ambient concentrations of NOx) can have an 
effect on species composition of an area, that would favour plants / 
vegetation with a high nitrogen demand. The increased availability of 
atmospheric nitrogen can limit the uptake of other essential nutrients 
from soils such that vegetation may be affected by reduced levels of 
potassium and magnesium. 
6.4.24 
The deposition of acidity due to nitrogen (acidification) can lead to the 
loss of alkali nutrients (such as calcium, magnesium and potassium) in 
the soils. Increased ground level concentrations of NOx and the 
associated deposition effects can increase the rate of acidification that 
can affect all aspects of the natural environment (i.e. soils, water, flora 
and fauna). 
6.4.25 
The deposition of nutrient nitrogen and the acidity due to nitrogen as a 
result of operation of the Power Generation Plant under all 
development scenarios will be undertaken in accordance with the EA 
guidance âAQTAG 06 - Technical Guidance on detailed modelling 
approach for an appropriate assessment for emissions to airâ (2010). 
Critical loads (to be used as standards for the assessment of 
significance) will be obtained from the Air Pollution Information Service 
(APIS). 
Air Dispersion Modelling 
6.4.26 
Air dispersion modelling can predict the ground level concentrations 
that occur due to the emissions from an elevated stack point source 
such as the stack(s) to be incorporated as part of the Power Generation 
Plant. This subsection describes the key aspects of the dispersion 
modelling process undertaken for the purposes of the EIA.  
6.4.27 
The flue gases discharged from a stack have two sources of 
momentum. One is related to the velocity of discharge. This is usually 
designed to be in excess of 15 m/s as this value has been found to be 
sufficient to avoid immediate downwash of the plume. Immediate 
downwash of a plume would not allow for adequate dispersion of the 
emissions from the stack(s) and could result in significantly elevated 
ground level concentrations of pollutants in the immediate vicinity of the 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx

- 101 - 
 
stack(s). Whilst contributing to the dispersion of stack emissions, the 
momentum from the velocity of discharge is soon dissipated.  
6.4.28 
The second source of momentum is much more significant and is 
related to the discharge temperature of the flue gases. The flue gases, 
being warmer than the surrounding atmosphere into which they are 
discharged, have buoyancy and thus rise. This process continues until 
the flue gases have cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding 
air.  
6.4.29 
Mathematical  models  are  used  to  calculate  the  effects  of  these  two  
sources of momentum and determine the height to which the flue gases 
will rise. This height plus the height of the stack(s) gives an âeffective 
stack heightâ.  
6.4.30 
The mathematical model then determines the dispersion of the flue 
gases from this effective stack height. Note that the effective height can 
be many times greater than the actual stack(s) height as constructed 
due to the large amount of heat present in the flue gases.  
6.4.31 
Dispersion occurs as a result of turbulence, and turbulence can result 
from both buoyancy effects and wind shear (also called mechanical) 
effects.  
6.4.32 
As an example of buoyancy effects, on a sunny day, solar heating 
creates turbulence by heating the ground and the air near the ground. 
The buoyancy of the heated air causes it to rise, creating turbulence. 
These are the thermals used by small plane and glider pilots on sunny 
days. These can also rapidly disperse a plume in the surrounding air. 
At night, during stable conditions, the buoyancy effect is to suppress 
rather than cause or enhance turbulence.  
6.4.33 
Wind shear as a cause of turbulence is well known to pilots as well. 
Wind shear effects, important to air pollution modelling, result from high 
(several meters per second) wind speeds near the ground. Since the 
wind speed at the ground is zero, any high wind speeds result in 
substantial wind shear. Wind shear dominates over buoyancy effects 
not only under high wind conditions, but also near the ground under 
any conditions.  
6.4.34 
As a result of this, two parameters are used to define the âstabilityâ of 
the atmosphere. The first is the friction velocity which is a measure 
wind shear.  
6.4.35 
The second parameter is a stability term called the Monin-Obukhov 
length. As mentioned above, shear stress always dominates near the 
ground. The height above the ground, where buoyancy effects begin to

dominate 
(generating 
turbulence 
in 
convective 
conditions 
or 
suppressing turbulence in stable conditions) is called the Monin-
Obukhov length. This can be thought of as a depth of the neutral (i.e. 
shear-dominated) flow. 
Dispersion Model and Inputs 
6.4.36 
ADMS 5 was used for the modelling of the dispersion, being a second 
generation model developed in the UK and accepted by the EA for the 
purposes of EIA (in addition to Environmental Permit applications). 
Wind Turbines 
6.4.37 
As per consultation responses from MSDC and SCC, the models have 
incorporated the wind turbines of the Eye Airfield Wind Turbines and 
the proposed Eye Wind Power Ltd wind farm. This exercise was 
undertaken for completeness and is currently considered that the 
presence of such wind turbines have so significant impact on the 
dispersion of the flue gases under either of the assessed scenarios. 
6.4.38 
The details of the turbines have been taken from available information 
with regards to each development and the locations of the turbines 
included in the model are as presented below:

Building Downwash 
6.4.39 
Building downwash is created by structures in the vicinity of an 
emissions source and subjects the plume from the stack(s) to wake 
effects. The effect is generally to pull the plume down to the ground at 
locations closer to the stack(s) thereby restricting the dispersion of the 
plume and increasing the ground level concentration of pollutants and, 
potentially, the environmental impact of the Power Generation Plant.  
6.4.40 
The potential development scenarios, as discussed in Section 3 of this 
document, mean that different combinations of on-site structures could 
be present during operation. The buildings that form part of the

considered to be potentially significant if they are within a distance from 
the stack(s) equivalent to five times the building height and if the 
building height is greater than 40 per cent of the stack height. As such, 
any changes to the layout of the above buildings are not likely to 
significantly alter the results of the model however the buildings are 
included for completeness.  
Receptors and Additional Model Data 
6.4.42 
The 
ADMS 
model 
calculates 
time 
averaged 
ground 
level 
concentrations over any set of distances from the source. The study 
used a 20 km by 20 km Cartesian grid with 200 m spacing to predict 
the process contributions to ground level concentrations in the 
immediate vicinity of the proposed stack location. This grid was centred 
on the proposed centre points of the stacks (in either scenario) at 
approximate grid reference TM 152 751 (as per Figures 6.2 and 6.3).  
6.4.43 
The meteorological data used for this modelling exercise was that from 
the station at Wattisham (approximate National Grid Reference 
TM 89 42); it is considered that this data will be representative of the 
conditions experienced at the site following consultation with the Met 
Office (who supplied the data). The data period considered was 2008-
2012 inclusive as per current EA guidelines for the consideration of

recent meteorological data over five consecutive years. For each year 
the predominant wind direction was from the south west. The wind rose 
for 2009 can be seen in Figure 6.1.  
6.4.44 
Terrain effects generally occur when ground levels within 1 km of the 
stack(s) vary by more than a third of the stack height. Given the range 
of stack heights that have been considered as part of the stack height 
sensitivity study, Ordnance Survey Landform Panorama Digital Terrain 
Mapping (DTM) terrain data has been included in the dispersion 
modelling exercise. 
Fuel-specific Dispersion Model Inputs 
6.4.45 
Modelling will assume that the Power Generation Plant operates at full 
load for 1500 hours per year i.e. the maximum possible operation of the 
proposed Project.  
6.4.46 
All emissions from the combustion of the fuel gases will be discharged 
from the stack(s). Based on the available anticipated emissions data, 
the stack diameter was optimised to ensure that the efflux velocity was 
at least 25 m/s. 
6.4.47 
Different combustion arrangements (i.e. number and type of GTs) may 
be utilised and each such scenario will result in flue gases from the 
differing number of stacks having different properties. The dispersion 
modelling inputs for each scenario are shown in Table 6.5 and Table 
6.6.

Conversion of Oxides of Nitrogen to Nitrogen Dioxide 
6.4.48 
NOx emissions from the Power Generation Plant will consist of the 
gases NO and NO2. It is only NO2 that is of concern in terms of direct 
health effects; however NO is a source of NO2 in the atmosphere. The 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

gases are in equilibrium in the air, with NO predominating at the stack 
exit. The equilibrium changes as the plume disperses and is exposed to 
oxidants, such as atmospheric ozone. The rate of conversion of NO to 
NO2 increases with rising ozone concentration and wind speed 
(turbulence and mixing effects) whilst the level of solar radiation 
controls the rate of the reverse dissociation reaction of NO2 to NO. 
6.4.49 
For assessing the impacts on air quality of emissions to atmosphere 
from sources, such as power stations, it is important that realistic 
estimates are made of how much NO would be oxidised to NO2 at all 
receptors considered. 
6.4.50 
The rate of oxidation of NO to NO2 depends on both the chemical 
reaction rates and the dispersion of the plume in the atmosphere. The 
oxidation rate is dependent on a number of factors that include the 
prevailing concentration of ozone, the wind speed and the atmospheric 
stability. 
6.4.51 
Conversion factors are recommended for a screening / worst case 
approach by the EA AQMAU and their âHorizontal Guidance Note H1 â 
Annex (f)â (April 2010). The guidance states that an initial air quality 
assessment should be undertaken based on 50 per cent conversion of 
the short-term average NOx concentrations and 100 per cent 
conversion of the long-term averages. 
6.4.52 
However, in order to determine the true impact of operation it is 
important that a realistic estimate of the actual process contribution to 
ground level concentrations of NO2 is made. 
6.4.53 
Between 1975 and 1985 about 60 sets of measurements were taken of 
the concentrations of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide in plumes from a 
variety of power stations. These measurements were carried out under 
widely varying weather conditions at altitudes between 200 m and 
700 m. From the data collected, an empirical relationship for the 
percentage oxidation in a power station plume based on downwind 
distance, season of the year, wind speed and ambient ozone 
concentration may be described by the following equation (which is 
sometime referred to as Janssenâs equation): 
ï¿½

where x is the distance downwind (km) of the emission point and ï¿½ and 
A are constants dependent on time of year and derived from the 
measurements of wind speed and ozone concentrations.

6.4.54 
For a typical power station the peak ground level concentration of the 
oxides of nitrogen will occur within a few kilometres. Table 6.7 shows 
the minimum, maximum and annual average estimates of NO2 in the 
plume for selected distances downwind of the plume, the figure takes 
into account the ratio of NO to NO2 in the plume on exit from the stack 
and assumes that there is sufficient ozone present to achieve 
equilibrium of the conversion reaction, as a worst case.

Given the figures in the above table it is considered that the application 
of the 50 per cent / 100 per cent NOx conversion factors represents a 
significant over-estimation of the actual maximum increments to ground 
level concentrations of NO2 as a result of operation of the Power 
Generation Plant. Therefore the conversion factors from the above 
Table have been applied. 
Stack Height 
6.4.56 
The stack height sensitivity study examined differing stack heights in 
10 m intervals from 20 m to 80 m (inclusive). The stack height 
sensitivity considered long term and short term contributions to ground 
level concentrations of NO2.  
6.4.57 
The stack height modelling results have been compared against the UK 
AQS objectives. The modelling results can be considered to be 
âsignificantâ if the ground level concentrations exceed 10 per cent of the 
short term objectives / EAL (up to 24 hour averages) and 1 per cent of 
the long term objectives / EAL (monthly / annual results etc.).  
6.4.58 
It is assumed that the plant is operating at full load for 1500 hours per 
annum therefore the worst case scenario has been considered.

6.4.59 
The stack height study predicted the 19th highest hourly and annual 
NO2 ground level concentrations as a result of the operation of the 
Power Generation Plant. The 19th highest hourly value is obtained with 
regard to the compliance requirements of EU and UK legislation and 
allows for abnormal weather conditions which may only occur for one 
hour during the year to be disregarded as these weather conditions 
cannot be mitigated for in any significant way. 
Significance Criteria 
Construction / Decommissioning 
6.4.60 
Table 6.8 outlines the matrices defined in the IAQM Guidelines for the 
four types of activity identified in Paragraph 6.4.7 (and defined in 
Paragraph 
6.4.9). 
The 
matrices 
are 
used, 
for 
consent/decommissioning, as a proxy for "magnitude" (as per the 
methodology described in Section 3). 
6.4.61 
Table 6.9 provides examples for the determination of the sensitivity of a 
receptor. 
6.4.62 
Table 6.10 outlines the magnitude criteria that have been used to 
assess the significance of potential air quality impacts during 
construction which has been taken from the IAQM Guidance. The 
significance level is then used as a direct link to the mitigation 
requirements outlined in âThe control of dust and emissions from 
construction and demolition Best Practice Guidanceâ (Greater London 
Authority, 2006).

Whilst noting that the stack height sensitivity studies has been 
undertaken in accordance with the significance criteria set out in 
Paragraph 6.4.48, more detailed analysis will be undertaken for the 
resultant impacts as the EIA progresses. 
6.4.64 
In terms of NOx, the significance criteria adopted for the operational air 
quality impacts in this assessment have been derived from the criteria 
suggested by Environmental Protection UK in their document 
âDevelopment Control: Planning for Air Qualityâ (2010).  
6.4.65 
Firstly, the magnitude of potential impact is determined via Table 6.11.

absolute concentration relative to AQS Standard / Objective to 
determine the significance via Table 6.12.

6.4.67 
These significance criteria are applied for the purposes of this impact 
assessment. However, the AQS method does not distinguish between 
processes or the extent of the area of impact. Therefore it is important 
that the results are interpreted qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It 
is noted that this standard industry methodology does not include 
provision for the definition of sensitivity of receptors. However the 
methodology has been prepared in order to assist local planning 
authorities in assessing the significance of air quality impacts and is 
thus an accepted method for the assessment of air quality impacts. 
6.4.68 
For the purposes of the EIA for the proposed Project, the threshold of 
significance is defined as those impacts anticipated to be of moderate 
significance or greater.

6.5 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
6.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection and industry standard methods and procedures 
to ensure impacts from construction, operation and decommissioning 
are minimised.  
6.5.2 
During operations, emissions of NOx will be limited to less than 
50 mg/Nm3 at outputs above 70 per cent load in accordance with the 
IED and the BAT AEL for the firing of natural gas in GTs. This will be 
ensured by the use of Dry Low NOx burners (or better). This is in 
accordance with the current EA Sector Guidance Note for Combustion 
and the EU IPPC Reference Document on Best Available Techniques 
for Large Combustion Plants. 
6.5.3 
During construction, mitigation measures would be covered by the 
Construction Environmental Management Plant (CEMP) that will apply 
to each of the key elements of the proposed Project. The CEMP will 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures (such as covering 
stockpiles or dowsing with water during dry, windy conditions) that will 
be approved by the relevant authorities and adopted, such that it would 
be unlikely (under most weather conditions) that any dust generated at 
the site has the potential to cause nuisance to any sensitive receptors 
in the area. 
6.5.4 
Mitigation for the Gas Connection, Electrical Connection Compound 
and Electrical Connection will be determined following the finalised 
assessment of construction / decommissioning impacts to air quality 
and described in the final ES. Such mitigation will form part of the 
CEMP and be secured by the DCO. 
6.5.5 
The assessment in this Section takes such design mitigation into 
account. Any additional mitigation developed in response to specific 
impacts identified in this assessment is described in paragraph 6.9 
below. 
6.5.6 
The Eye Airfield Industrial Estate and the Mid Suffolk Business Park, as 
well as agricultural holdings, are immediately adjacent to the Project 
Site. PPL will continue to consult with the potentially affected 
neighbours 
and 
will 
require its 
contractors to implement a 
comprehensive 
dust 
suppression 
/ 
mitigation 
and 
monitoring 
programme. This will prevent construction work generating levels of 
atmospheric dust which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to 
local people or industry.

PLANNING INSPECTORATE 
3.15 
The SoS recommends that assessment methodology is 
determined in consultation with EA, Natural England (NE) and 
the relevant local authorities; including the study area and 
sensitive receptors. The SoS notes that the air quality baseline 
will be defined using available existing baseline monitoring data. 
The EIA will adopt EA guidance 
(AQTAG06) for the assessment of 
deposition impacts to sensitive 
ecological receptors. General air 
quality impacts are being 
assessed in accordance with 
relevant guidelines as per the 
methodology presented in this 
section. 
3.16 
It is noted that the air quality modelling and assessment will 
consider impacts at European designated and other ecological 
sites within 10km of the proposed development. There is also a 
need for the ES to consider potential effects due to an increase 
in airborne pollution during construction, including fugitive dust 
emissions, on other important nature conservation and wildlife 
sites. The approach to this assessment should be agreed with 
NE. 
The proposed assessment of 
fugitive dust emissions from 
construction is being undertaken 
in preparation of the final ES and 
will consider the impact on 
ecological receptors within the 
study area, as outlined in the 
methodology presented in this 
section. 
3.17 
The SoS welcomes the approach of using Atmospheric 
Dispersion Modelling to assess the effects of significant 
pollution emissions. All assumptions and limitations to 
assessments, including the number, location and height of flue 
stacks should be clearly specified in all relevant sections of the 
ES. 
The assumptions for / description 
of the anticipated emissions from 
the Project are outlined in the 
methodology presented in this 
section.

3.18 
If details including the number, location and height of the flue 
stacks are not confirmed at the point of application the ES 
should assess operational air quality based on a worst case 
scenario taking into account other nearby pollution sources 
(existing and proposed). The implications of stack height and 
dispersion of the discharge should also be clearly explained. 
Locations of the stack(s) will be 
provided in the final ES however 
the height and number are 
discussed in the methodology 
presented in this section. 
3.19 
Predicted pollutant concentrations should be assessed against 
the applicable standard guideline value (e.g. relevant European 
air quality limit values and National Air Quality Objectives). 
The relevant guideline values are 
presented in the legislative and 
policy context present in this 
section. . 
3.21 
The assessment should take account of the air emissions from 
the proposed development and emissions related to increased 
vehicular movements associated with the proposed 
development. Such information should also inform the 
ecological assessment. 
Emissions from vehicle are being 
assessed in accordance with the 
guidance / methodology from the 
Department for Transport as 
outlined in the methodology 
presented in this section. 
3.22 
Changes in air quality and dust levels should be assessed not 
only on site but also off site, including along access roads, local 
footpaths and other PROW. The SoS welcomes the proposal to 
assess the gas and the electrical connections for construction 
and decommissioning impacts on air quality. 
The proposed assessment of 
fugitive dust emissions from 
construction is being undertaken 
in preparation of the final ES and 
is considering the effects / impacts 
of dust along access roads as 
outlined in the methodology 
presented in this section.

The air quality assessment will need to consider carbon dioxide 
emissions in the terms described in EN-1 (5.2.2). 
The final ES will present an

The overall approach to the assessment of air quality issues is 
acceptable however the Scoping Report makes reference to 
reliance upon local authority data. The applicant needs to be 
made aware that there is a paucity of air quality data which will 
have to be addressed. 
This point is noted, however it is 
considered that there is sufficient 
local authority data (supplemented 
by information held by DEFRA) in 
order to undertake a suitable and 
robust assessment. Full details will 
be provided within the final ES. 
 
The existing and proposed wind turbines within the area will need 
to be taken into account in order to assess their impact upon 
dispersion models. Likewise the existing biomass plant and other 
energy from waste proposals will need to be factored into the 
dispersion modelling in order to assess the cumulative impact of 
the scheme. 
The existing and proposed wind 
turbines have been included in the 
air dispersion models as 
discussed in the methodology 
presented in this section.  
 
In terms of receptor locations the applicant will need to establish 
that there are no unimplemented planning permissions within the 
vicinity that may have an impact upon the modelling. 
This will be determined through 
the on-going consultation process. 
 
It is also requested that the ES outlines how the proposed plant 
will secure a reduction in carbon emissions within the region over 
CO2 emissions will be assessed in 
accordance with the relevant NPS

NATURAL ENGLAND 
 
Air quality in the UK has improved over recent decades but air 
pollution remains a significant issue; for example over 97% of 
sensitive habitat area in England is predicted to exceed the 
critical loads for ecosystem protection from atmospheric nitrogen 
deposition (England Biodiversity Strategy, Defra 2011). A priority 
action in the England Biodiversity Strategy is to reduce air 
pollution impacts on biodiversity. The planning system plays a 
key role in determining the location of developments which may 
give rise to pollution, either directly or from traffic generation, and 
hence planning decisions can have a significant impact on the 
quality of air, water and land. 
Noted  
 
In terms of assessing the impact on air quality, we advise that a 
radius of 10km around the application site is searched for 
international and European designated sites (i.e. SPAs, SACs 
and Ramsar sites) and a radius of 2km for nationally designated 
sites (i.e. SSSIs). Nonstatutory local sites (e.g. County Wildlife 
Sites) near to the application should also be considered. The 
assessment should take account of the risks of air pollution and 
how these can be managed or reduced. Further information on 
air pollution impacts and the sensitivity of different 
habitats/designated sites can be found on the Air Pollution 
Information System (www.apis.ac.uk). Further information on air 
pollution modelling and assessment can be found on the 
Environment Agency website. 
The assessment of operational air 
quality impacts will be in 
accordance with industry standard 
guidance (principally from the EA) 
as per the methodology section. In 
particular, the AQTAG06 
methodology for the assessment 
of deposition impacts is being 
followed and baseline data 
sourced from the APIS records.

The area covered by assessments relating to Noise & Vibration 
should have a minimum radius of 2 kilometres; for Air Quality, 
Ecology, Water Resources a minimum radius of 5 kilometres; 
The air quality assessment is 
considering a study area of 10km 
radius from the proposed stack(s) 
as outline in the methodology 
presented in this section.  
 
Assessments should quantify the likely impact on growing crops, 
open water and its wildlife, herbivorous wildlife and insects, 
especially pollinators. Yaxley Allotment is very close to the 
development and its users will expect any reassurances to be 
backed by reliable evidence. 
The potential air quality and 
deposition impacts to sensitive 
ecological receptors will be 
presented in the final ES. 
 
Although the vulnerability of the local area needs to be assessed, 
will the surveys yield information on the wider dispersal by the 
prevailing winds, for example south-westerlies blowing along the 
Waveney Valley carrying emissions towards the coast? 
As above, the air quality 
assessment is considering a study 
area of 10km radius from the 
proposed stack(s) and terrain 
effects for the entire study area 
have been included in the model, 
as per the methodology presented 
in this section. 
 
Consideration should be given to assessing the particular impact 
on ecologically sensitive areas, including The Marsh at 
Thrandeston and all other land in the area that is managed under 
stewardship agreements with Natural England. 
A full list of potentially sensitive 
ecological receptors will be 
developed through consultation 
with the relevant stakeholders and 
the assessment will be presented 
in the final ES. 
 
The emissions should be evaluated in the context of the areaâs 
committed carbon reduction target. 
CO2 emissions will be assessed in 
accordance with the relevant NPS 
and the results presented in the 
final ES.

MSDC undertook an Updating and Screening Assessment (USA) of 
ambient air quality within its jurisdiction in April 2011. The USA for 
MSDC (2011) states that: 
6.8.2 
âThe Air Quality Objectives have not been exceeded in the Mid Suffolk 
district in 2010. There was however an exceedance of the Annual 
Mean Objective for nitrogen dioxide at one location in 2009 and as a 
consequence, additional monitoring was undertaken in the area. 
However, it has since been established that the diffusion tubes at the 
location of the 2009 exceedance were not located in accordance with 
the guidance in LAQM.TG (09). A review of air quality monitoring in Mid 
Suffolk to ensure that all monitoring locations meet best practice, as 
defined in LAQM.TG (09), is currently being undertaken. 
6.8.3 
It was also proposed that further monitoring should have been 
undertaken in 2011 in the vicinity of the junction at Gipping 
Road/Station Road, Stowmarket, which is in the locality of the potential 
exceedance, to determine the scale of any issues within the area at 
relevant receptors.â

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
POWER GENERATION PLANT 
Construction 
6.9.2 
During all construction works the main potential impact on air quality 
arising from construction activities will be due to: 
ï¿½ 
Airborne particulate matter (or dust) emissions from on-site 
construction activities; and  
ï¿½ 
Emissions of NOx from construction traffic movements. 
Airborne Particulate Matter 
6.9.3 
Dust could be emitted during several activities associated with the 
construction works should preventative measures not be taken. Dust 
could arise from: earth moving operations for site levelling (albeit this is 
expected to be minimal), back filling and foundations; removal of spoil, 
site stripping, blow-off and spillage from vehicles; concreting 
operations, site reinstatement and road construction and during wind 
blow over bare dry construction areas. 
6.9.4 
Only with high wind speeds would long distance transport of dust and 
the potential for soiling of buildings occur. In these conditions more dust 
would also be created at source. The extent of any such emissions of 
dust is very dependent on wind speed, ground conditions, the 
prevalence of hot, dry conditions and the use of preventative measures. 
6.9.5 
As per the study area shown in Figure 6.2, there are understood to be 
no residential properties within the zone of influence of dust emissions 
from the construction site; the nearest housing is 480 m east of the 
Power Generation Plant boundary, to the east of the Mid Suffolk 
Business Park. However local public rights of way pass through the 
areas potentially affected by dust emissions from the site as shown in 
Figure 6.2. 
Construction Traffic Emissions 
6.9.6 
The impacts of atmospheric emissions from road vehicles upon local 
pollution levels is a function of the number and type of vehicles together 
with the vehicle speed as it passes any particular receptor. For

example, local air quality will be degraded more by a vehicle that is 
stationary and idling compared with a vehicle travelling passed a 
receptor at 70 miles per hour (mph). 
6.9.7 
The potential for the significance of atmospheric emissions from 
construction traffic is dependent upon the presence of nearby receptors 
and thus members of the population who may be adversely affected by 
them. The contribution of vehicle emissions diminishes quickly with 
distance such that their influence on local pollutant concentrations is 
considered not significant at distances greater than 200 m (Design 
Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 Section 3, Part 1: 
Air Quality). The number of potential receptors within this 200 m zone 
of influence is limited and it is noted that this is a generic assumption 
with the zone of influence likely to be reduced following a quantitative 
analysis of the emissions from road traffic. 
6.9.8 
On-site emissions levels from construction traffic at any one location 
within the site will vary as different combinations of plant machinery are 
used, and throughout the construction phase of the proposed Project 
as the on-site staffing levels and the construction activities / locations 
change. A worst case scenario would be for any construction traffic to 
be idling at the boundary of the site which, as above, could impact on 
local air quality. 
Operation 
6.9.9 
The following scenarios are relevant to the air quality impact 
assessment of the operation of the Power Generation Plant: 
ï¿½ 
Operation of five aero-derivative units (each of c.60 MW) 
ï¿½ 
Operation of two industrial units (each of c.150 MW) 
6.9.10 
During operation, the Power Generation Plant will produce the principal 
emissions to air from the stack associated with each GT.  
6.9.11 
To determine the pollutants that should be considered as part of the 
more detailed dispersion modelling exercise, calculations have been 
undertaken using existing EA guidance based on the anticipated worst 
case emissions rates during normal operation and additional emissions 
parameters. The results of these calculations showed that the 
emissions  of  most  interest  from  the  new  plant  are  those  of  NOx.  It  
should be noted however, that only a proportion of the NOx released 
will be converted to the more harmful NO2 pollutant.  
6.9.12 
Combustion in GTs is conducted at high excess air rates, typically 200-
300 per cent excess air which provides conditions as close to complete 
combustion as possible. There are, therefore, very low levels of CO or

unburned hydrocarbons present in the products of combustion when 
burning natural gas. 
6.9.13 
The combustion of natural gas therefore results in the emission of flue 
gases containing CO2, H2O, O, N, CO and NOx. 
6.9.14 
The effect of the emissions of carbon monoxide is not anticipated to be 
significant however these will be examined further as part of the on-
going EIA. 
Modelling Results 
6.9.15 
A conservative view of the operation of the Power Generation Plant has 
been adopted in the modelling so that a âworst caseâ is presented. The 
purpose of using this approach is to ensure that the absolute maximum 
predicted impact within the potential operating regime of the proposed 
Power Generation Plant is considered.

The above Tables indicate that, based on the screening level 
assessment recommended by the EA, the process contribution to 
annual average ground level concentrations will be less than the EA 
threshold of significance of: 
ï¿½ 
1 per cent of the long-term AQS objective (40 Âµg/m3); or 
ï¿½ 
10 per cent of the short-term AQS objective of (200 Âµg/Nm3), 
 
for any stack height considered within the sensitivity study.  
6.9.17 
Therefore, the potential impact on local air quality can be considered to 
be not significant. 
6.9.18 
It is considered that a stack height of 20 m will provide adequate 
dispersion of the flue gases (irrespective of the type, and associated 
number, of GTs / stacks) though 30 m is considered within the Project 
Description for the purposes of this PEIR.  
Decommissioning 
6.9.19 
During decommissioning, temporary air quality impacts are likely to 
arise. These will be similar to those described above for construction.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
Construction 
6.9.20 
As discussed in relation to construction of the Power Generating Plant, 
the assessment of air quality relating to construction of the Gas 
Connection will be in accordance with the IAQM Guidelines with 
mitigation measures defined through the appropriate use of risk

assessments for the works required and the associated definition of 
mitigation measures for the control of emissions of airborne particulate 
matter. 
6.9.21 
As per the IAQM Guidelines, the study area for construction works is 
(for human receptors) all land within a distance of 350m of the 
boundary of the route corridor (100 m for trackout, and up to 500 m 
from a âconstruction siteâ access / egress). For ecological receptors, this 
distance is 100m. 
6.9.22 
The IAQM Guidelines state: 
6.9.23 
âHaving determined the risk categories for each of the four activities it is 
possible to determine the site-specific measures to be adopted. These 
measures will be related to whether the site is a low, medium or high 
risk site. Mitigation measures for London are set out in The Control of 
Dust and Emissions from Construction and Demolition: Best Practice 
Guidance [GLA Guidance], published in 2006... Most of these 
measures are likely to be suitable for demolition / construction projects 
outside the capital.  
6.9.24 
For those cases where the risk is assigned as ânegligibleâ, no mitigation 
measures beyond those required by legislation are required.â 
6.9.25 
The mitigation measures are yet to be determined but will be defined 
based on the appropriate requirements of the GLA Guidance and 
included in an Outline CEMP that will accompany the proposed DCO 
Application. This mitigation will thus be âembeddedâ into the 
construction methods to be used. 
6.9.26 
The IAQM Guidance presents a matrix for the assessment of post-
mitigation significance for the potential impacts. The maximum 
mitigated impact will therefore be âslight adverseâ which is equivalent to 
âMinor Significanceâ in accordance with the terminology used in the ES. 
Therefore the maximum potential impact of the construction of the Gas 
Connection will be of Minor Significance. 
Operation 
6.9.27 
Emissions during the operational phase of the Gas Connection, which 
may potentially include infrequent emissions of natural gas, are 
expected to be minimal and limited to infrequent venting of gas from the 
AGI under, non-normal, maintenance or emergency conditions. The 
potential air quality impacts of operation of the Gas Connection are 
thus considered to be Not Significant.

Decommissioning 
6.9.28 
During decommissioning, it is possible that the AGI would be 
dismantled and removed. Under current proposals, no major civil works 
would be required and therefore dust migration and emissions from on-
site equipment and associated vehicles would be no greater than the 
predicted impacts during construction. Therefore, the assessment for 
impacts related to earthworks and trackout are considered to be as for 
construction and, thus, will be of no more than Minor Significance using 
embedded mitigation as defined by the GLA Guidance.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 2 
Construction 
6.9.29 
The methods of the construction will be similar to those described 
above (for Gas Connection Route Corridor One). 
6.9.30 
As per the IAQM Guidelines, the study area for construction works is 
(for human receptors) is all land within a distance of 350m of the 
boundary of the route corridor (100 m for trackout, and up to 500 m 
from a âconstruction siteâ access / egress). For ecological receptors, this 
distance is 100m. 
6.9.31 
The mitigation measures are yet to be determined but will be defined 
based on the appropriate requirements of the GLA Guidance and 
included in an Outline CEMP that will accompany the proposed DCO 
Application. This mitigation will thus be âembeddedâ into the 
construction methods to be used. 
6.9.32 
The IAQM Guidance presents a matrix for the assessment of post-
mitigation significance for the potential impacts. The maximum 
mitigated impact will therefore be âslight adverseâ which is equivalent to 
âMinor Significanceâ in accordance with the terminology used in the ES. 
Therefore the maximum potential impact of the construction of the Gas 
Connection will be of Minor Significance.

ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND OPTION 1 AND 
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
Construction 
6.9.35 
The excavation of trenches has the potential to generate small amounts 
of airborne particulate matter that are being assessed in accordance 
with the IAQM Guidelines in order to determine suitable mitigation 
measures such that any potential impacts will be of Minor Significance 
or less. 
6.9.36 
The construction of the Electrical Connection Compound, the main 
potential impact on air quality arising will be due to, airborne particulate 
matter (or dust) emissions from on-site construction activities; and 
emissions of NOx from construction traffic movements as described for 
the Power Generation Plant. 
Operation 
6.9.37 
There is a very limited scope for potential impacts on air quality relating 
to the operation of the Electrical Connection Compound and the 
Electrical Connection. Should there be a need for excavation of the 
buried cables, this will have the potential for the generation of airborne 
particulate matter and, as per the impacts for construction, will be of no 
more than Minor Significance following the implementation of 
appropriate mitigation measures as per the GLA Guidelines. 
Decommissioning 
6.9.38 
The decommissioning of the proposed Project, and specifically the 
Electrical Connection, will likely see the buried cables disconnected 
and grounded and left in-situ. 
6.9.39 
The Electrical Connection Compound may be retained in order to 
maintain the potential for future electrical connections to the NETS in 
the area. Should the Electrical Connection Compound be dismantled,

the area. Should the Electrical Connection Compound be dismantled, 
the impacts would be similar to the construction phase and will be 
assessed accordingly in order to define the âembeddedâ mitigation that 
will form part of an appropriate Environmental Management Plan for the 
decommissioning/demolition works.

Based on the above assessment methodology, significance criteria, 
and the initial modelling results presented in Section 5.5, a full air 
quality impact assessment will be undertaken to determine the likely

environmental impacts of operation of the Project, both in isolation and 
in conjunction with other significant emissions sources identified 
through consultation with the relevant authorities.  
6.11.2 
The dispersion modelling will consider a study area of up to 20 km by 
20 km centred upon the central point of the proposed stacks (i.e. 10 km 
radius) and will also model all potentially sensitive receptors 
(ecologically designated sites, etc.) discretely in order to accurately 
determine the maximum, worst case impact to air quality due to 
operation of the Power Generation Plant. The receptors to be 
considered will be supplemented, as appropriate, with any additional 
receptors highlighted through the consultation process. 
6.11.3 
When considering the impacts on ecologically sensitive sites within the 
study area an assessment will also be made of the process 
contributions to nutrient and acid deposition which have the potential to 
degrade the quality of an ecological site. 
6.11.4 
The impact of road traffic generated throughout all scenarios for the 
development of the proposed Project will be assessed using the 
methodology prescribed in the Department for Transport âDesign 
Manual for Roads and Bridgesâ for the estimation of emissions from 
vehicles. 
6.11.5 
The information presented in this section will be supplemented to allow 
for preparation and finalisation of the ES.

NOISE AND VIBRATION 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project all have the potential to impact on local ambient noise levels 
and have the potential to generate vibration which may impact on 
sensitive receptors. All phases of the proposed Project and their 
potential impacts from noise and vibration will therefore be assessed 
within the EIA.  
7.1.2 
This Section presents the preliminary noise and vibration assessment 
for the proposed Project and includes: 
ï¿½ 
The existing baseline conditions against which the assessment is 
being made; 
ï¿½ 
The assessment methodology proposed for the EIA including the 
identification of specific sensitive receptors; 
ï¿½ 
Significance criteria; 
ï¿½ 
The potential impacts of the proposed Project; and 
ï¿½ 
Proposals for the mitigation of any anticipated significant 
environmental impacts, as appropriate. 
7.2 
Legislative and Policy Context  
National Policy Statements 
7.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
noise and vibration impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. 
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
7.2.3 
NPS EN-1 sets out the requirements for a noise assessment of an 
energy NSIP and also outlines the approach that the Secretary of State 
should adopt when considering noise assessments. Paragraph 5.11.9 
requires the SoS to be satisfied that the proposals will: 
ï¿½ 
Avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
noise;

ï¿½ 
Mitigate and minimise other adverse impacts on health and quality 
of life from noise; and 
ï¿½ 
Where possible, contribute to improvements to health and quality of 
life through the effective management and control of noise. 
7.2.4 
NPS EN-2 sets out assessment principles in respect of fossil fuel 
energy generation NSIPs. It states that the SoS must be satisfied that 
the principles set out at paragraph 5.11.9 of NPS EN-1 have been 
satisfied and notes that mitigation for noise for such proposals is likely 
to be primarily through good design (i.e. enclosures, exhaust 
attenuation to turbines) and refers to the use of requirements attached 
to the DCO to secure relevant mitigation.  
Other National and Local Policy 
7.2.5 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
7.2.6 
The DEFRA Noise Policy Statement for England (2010) sets as it aims 
the above three points. It also notes in the explanatory notes: âIn reality, 
although it has not always been stated, the aim has tended to be to 
minimise noise, as far as reasonably practicalâ 
7.2.7 
The NPPF (DCLG, 2012) states that planning policies and decisions 
should aim to: 
ï¿½ 
Avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on 
health and quality of life as a result of new development; 
ï¿½ 
Mitigate and reduce to a minimum other adverse impacts on health 
and quality of life arising from noise from new development, 
including through the use of conditions;  
ï¿½ 
Recognise that development will often create some noise and 
existing businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their 
business should not have unreasonable restrictions put on them 
because of changes in nearby land uses since they were 
established; and 
ï¿½ 
Identify and protect areas of tranquillity which have remained 
relatively undisturbed by noise and are prized for their recreational 
and amenity value for this reason. 
7.2.8 
In order to deliver sustainable development, the NPPF states âto help 
economic growth, local planning authorities should plan proactively to 
meet the development needs of business and support an economy fit 
for the 21st centuryâ.

Standards and Guidance 
7.2.9 
BS 7445 'Description and Measurement of Environmental Noise' 
defines and prescribes best practice during recording and reporting of 
environmental noise. This standard should be applied in all instances 
when making environmental noise measurements. 
7.2.10 
BS 4142 âMethod for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential 
and industrial areas' offers guidance on the assessment of industrial 
and commercial noise affecting residential and industrial areas. It 
describes a method for assessing whether industrial noise is likely to 
result in complaints from nearby residents. 
7.2.11 
EA Horizontal Guidance H3 Part 2: Noise assessment and control. This 
document provides the principles of noise measurement and prediction 
and control of noise by design, by operational management techniques 
and abatement technologies. Horizontal guidance provides information 
relevant to all sectors regulated under the environmental permitting 
regulations (EPR).  
7.2.12 
World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for Community Noise - 
 This document provides advice and guideline values for noise in 
specific environments.  
7.2.13 
BS 5228 'Noise and vibration control on construction and open sites' 
gives recommendations for basic methods of noise and vibration 
control relating to construction sites and other open sites where 
construction activities are carried out. It offers a methodology for 
predicting noise levels from construction sites and assessing its impact 
on those exposed to it. BS5228 is the industry approved code of 
practise and should be used in all cases when assessing noise from 
construction sites. 
7.2.14 
BS 6472 (2008) âGuide to Evaluation of Human Exposure to Vibration 
in Buildings (1 Hertz (Hz) to 80 Hz)â presents recommended frequency 
weighted vibration spectra (for continuous vibration) and Vibration Dose 
Values (VDV) (for intermittent vibration), above which adverse 
comment is likely to occur in residential properties. 
7.2.15 
BS 7385 (1993) âEvaluation and Measurement for Vibration in 
Buildingsâ presents guide values or limits for transient vibration, above 
which there is a likelihood of cosmetic damage.

7.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
7.3.1 
In respect of noise and vibration, the realistic worst case scenario from 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 3 of 
the PEIR) is set out in Table 7.1 below.  
7.3.2 
The reason the parameters, identified in Table 7.1, represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to noise and vibration impacts are that, 
an increasing number of separate SCGT units, each with their own 
dedicated stack, will produce increasingly more noise. Noise from the 
GT turbine assembly is attenuated by the turbine casing, and so varies 
little between low and higher power output turbines. The main variable 
noise producing element is exhaust noise through the top of the stack. 
The stack sound power level for a typical c60MW SCGT unit is 
110dB(A), compared to a single 100MW unit, which can have a typical 
sound power level of 113dB(A) through the stack. Therefore, the noise 
output from five separate low power SCGT units will be higher than that 
produced by one or two high power units. Similarly, the construction of 
five separate SCGT units will result in a longer construction lead time, 
which will increase the noise impact at sensitive receptors. This applies 
regardless of whether we are assessing aero-derivative or industrial 
units.

7.3.3 
The computer noise modelling software CadnaA (Version 4.1), which 
uses the ISO 9613 propagation algorithms has been used to undertake 
a provisional noise calculation. The model estimates the contribution to 
noise levels at each NSR location, and has been created using 
representative sound power level information for typical plant items. 
7.3.4 
The model is intended to provide a preliminary assessment only for the 
operational phase of the Power Generation Plant. A noise contour plot 
to show the predicted spread of noise from the proposed Project in 5 
dB bands is included in Figure 7.1 for reference. The detailed 
operational noise modelling will be undertaken as part of the EIA, when 
full details of all plant items will be available.

7.3.5 
All imbedded mitigation included in the noise model is identified in the 
Design Mitigation section. 
7.3.6 
Both Gas Connection route corridor options and both Electrical 
Connection Compound options and Electrical Connection route corridor 
options are considered in this preliminary assessment.  
7.4 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
Methodology 
7.4.2 
The following noise and vibration impact assessment focuses on six 
noise sensitive receptor (NSR) locations, which are identified in 
Section 7.7 and on Figure 7.1. 
7.4.3 
The existing baseline conditions at each location have been determined 
by way of an attended noise survey. Discussions were held with 
MSDC, SCC and the EA to agree a study area, a noise survey 
methodology, and suitable locations for the NSR measurement 
positions. 
7.4.4 
A prediction of the impact during construction is undertaken following 
the methodology of BS 5228, and information regarding the noise 
output of specific items of plant contained therein.  
7.4.5 
The noise impacts during operation are predicted using CadnaA noise 
propagation modelling software, using typical values for the proposed 
plant items, and considering directional and screening effects.  
7.4.6 
The significance of the predicted operational impact is assessed 
against the semantics of BS 4142. The significance criteria for the 
construction phase are discussed in Section 6.4. 
Significance Criteria 
7.4.7 
The following sections provide the assessment methodology and 
significance criteria associated with noise and vibration from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the proposed 
Project. 
Construction / Decommissioning  
7.4.8 
The noise impacts of decommissioning will be similar to those that will 
be assessed for construction. The assessment will therefore be carried 
out on the same basis as that for those arising from construction 
activities.

The levels are faÃ§ade value LAeqs (and include noise from other 
sources). There are various indices for expressing the noise levels 
produced by working sites. However, the LAeq index is regarded as 
standard and has been used in this assessment. LAeq is the equivalent 
continuous sound level expressed in âA weightedâ decibel terms and is, 
in general, used as a description of environmental noise. It represents 
the steady sound level, which would produce the same energy as a 
fluctuating sound, over the same period of time.  
7.4.11 
Vibration from construction activities may impact on adjacent buildings. 
The criteria used in this assessment relate to the potential for cosmetic 
damage, not structural damage. The principal concern is generally 
transient vibration due to impact piling. Cosmetic damage is most likely 
to occur within the first 20 m of piling activities; damage is less likely to 
occur at greater distance. Likely levels of vibration at given distances 
can be predicted from existing piling vibration data. 
7.4.12 
BS7385 establishes the basic principles for carrying out vibration 
measurements and processing the data with regard to evaluating 
vibration impacts on buildings. Table 7.3 provides recommended peak 
particle velocity (PPV) vibration limits for transient excitation for 
different types of buildings (as set out in BS7385: Part 2, 1993).

BS 4142 provides a methodology for the assessment of industrial noise 
in mixed residential and industrial areas. In this case, the standard 
suggests obtaining an assessment level by comparing the existing 
background noise levels with the 'rating level', which is the predicted 
noise output of the Power Generation Plant, corrected to account for 
any acoustic features such as tonal or impulsive noises. The semantics 
used for assessing the likelihood of complaints due to the introduction 
of a new industrial noise source are as follows: 
ï¿½  
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints. 
ï¿½ 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints 
are likely. 
ï¿½ 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance. 
ï¿½ 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely.

Embedded Design Mitigation 
7.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection and industry standard methods and procedures 
to ensure impacts from construction, operation and decommissioning 
are minimised. In respect of noise and vibration this mitigation includes: 
ï¿½ The GT(s), and major compressors are to be housed in 
individual acoustic enclosures, of heavy construction, specified 
at 85 dB (A) Sound Pressure Level at 1 m.

ï¿½ Turbine filter and ventilation apertures are to be fitted with high 
performance silencers, and designed such that all sensitive 
receptors benefit from screening and/or directivity corrections. 
ï¿½ High performance silencers will be installed in the outlet duct(s) 
between the GT(s). Due to the impracticality of screening stack 
noise, discharge noise will be controlled using these silencers 
that will be tuned to attenuate low frequencies from the GT 
exhausts. 
ï¿½ Unit transformers and generator transformers will be housed in 
an appropriate enclosure or three sided pen, to provide full 
screening to NSRs. 
7.5.2 
The assessment in this Section takes such design mitigation into 
account. Any additional mitigation developed in response to specific 
impacts identified in this assessment is described in paragraph 7.9 
below.

PLANNING INSPECTORATE 
3.7 
The SoS notes the comments regarding the assessment of 
noise during operation for the gas and the electricity 
connections. Based on the assumption that the connections will 
be below ground, the SoS agrees to this. However, this is 
subject to the connections being below ground, the noise of 
substations and all above ground installations will require 
assessment within the ES. 
Assessment of noise and vibration 
from all above ground installations 
(AGIâs), including the substation 
will be included in the ES. 
3.24 
The SoS recommends that the methodology and choice of noise 
receptors should be agreed with the relevant local authorities 
and with the Environment Agency (EA). 
The ambient noise survey 
methodology was agreed with 
MSDC, SCC and the EA before 
any survey works were 
undertaken.   
3.25 
The noise and vibration assessments should take account of the 
increased traffic movements along access routes, especially 
during the construction phase. The results from the noise and 
vibration assessments will also provide information to inform the 
ecological assessments, exceptional but essential operations 
such as venting (as applicable to the technology) should be 
included in the assessment. 
The ES will include the noise and 
vibration impact of increased road 
traffic for the construction, 
operation, and decommissioning 
phases.  
The ES will also include the 
assessment of noise from steam 
venting.  
3.26 
Noise impacts on sensitive receptors should be specifically 
addressed. Particularly effects on people from any potential 
noise disturbance at night and other unsocial hours such as 
weekends and public holidays. 
Noise impacts from the proposed 
Project are being assessed at 
sensitive receptors for the 
construction, operational and

3.27 
Where appropriate, effective measures should be provided to 
mitigate against noise nuisance. Negative effects of any 
proposed mitigation on other areas of assessment in the EIA 
should also be assessed â such as the implementation of sound 
screens on wildlife or on visual impact. The ES must make a 
clear distinction between the assessment of effects with and 
without mitigation. 
Following the detailed assessment 
any noise and vibration mitigation 
measures, as required, will be 
identified in the ES.  
3.28 
Consideration should be given to monitoring noise complaints 
during construction and when the development is operational. 
The option for continuous noise 
monitoring will be discussed in the

It will be important to recognise the linkages across the different 
topic areas, particularly when developing mitigation to ensure 
that initiatives being undertaken are complementary. Measures 
to minimise noise intrusion for example should also consider 
overlap with design and landscaping considerations.

and operational phases.

The area is well served by such links (Public Rights of Way) and 
they are highly valued by local people. Consequently we would 
expect the ES to describe the local network, its extent (including 
the unofficial diversions and permissive paths) and usage. It 
should then evaluate the potential impact of the development on 
this network, both directly by construction activity and indirectly 
by diminishment of amenity value (due to for example visual or 
noise impacts of the development). 
The noise and vibration impacts 
from the proposed Project is being 
assessed at sensitive receptors for 
both the construction and 
operational phases â sensitive 
receptors such as Public Rights of 
way will be included in the 
assessment.  
76 
As well as showing a contour map from the noise modelling, a 
list of the major noise sources (relating to the plant, electricity 
and gas infrastructure) should also be included in the ES to aid 
assessment. 
A cumulative assessment will be 
completed as part of the ES, this 
will include noise from all major 
sources, gas and electricity 
infrastructure. A preliminary 
cumulative impact assessment is 
included in the PEIR.  
77 
The construction noise assessment should include reference to 
noise from construction vehicles accessing the site. 
On site traffic is included as part of 
the construction assessment.

Furthermore, the occurrence of any âsteam releasesâ from the 
GTs (if relevant) should also be described in the ES (this is 
described as a nuisance associated with existing plant on 
neighbouring land). 
SCGT peaking plants do not need 
to release steam as part of their 
operation.

makes provision for possible residential development within the 
vicinity of the proposed Power Generation Plant. It will therefore 
be necessary for the environmental impact assessment to take 
this factor into account, especially in relation to noise and air 
quality issues. 
As part of the ES an operational 
noise contour plot will be produced 
to show the spread of noise from 
the plant. The noise contour plot 
will identify the predicted noise 
level in the areas identified for 
potential residential development, 
discussions can then be held as to 
the appropriateness of these 
locations with regard noise.

It should be noted that the site is located within a predominantly 
rural area where the ambient background noise levels are low, 
especially at night. The overall approach to the assessment of 
noise and vibration issues is acceptable however the Council 
would request that the applicant agrees the baseline line 
monitoring positions before commencing the background noise 
surveys. The Scoping Report suggests four locations for 
monitoring purposes but a fifth position on the outskirts of Eye 
should be considered near to the residential properties in

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
7.7.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site comprises land on the former Eye 
Airfield. The surrounding area is mainly open agricultural land with 
scattered residential dwellings. The small town of Eye approximately 1 
km to the south east of the site, and the village of Yaxley 800 m to the 
south west. The baseline noise climate in the area is largely dominated 
by road traffic during the daytime. During the night time when road 
traffic levels reduce a continuous low level noise is audible from the 
existing power plant.   
7.7.2 
The Electrical Connection route is proposed to run east over open 
agricultural land for a distance of approximately 1.2km to the existing 
overhead power cables north east of the village of Yaxley. It is 
proposed to construct an electrical connection compound at this 
location. The surrounding area is mainly open agricultural land with 
scattered residential dwellings and the village of Yaxley to the south at 
a distance of approximately 500m. 
7.7.3 
Options for the Gas Connection routes are proposed to either run east 
and terminate at the existing Chicken Litter Power Plant, or south for a 
distance of approximately 800m and terminate adjacent to Castleton 
Way 500m to the east of the village of Yaxley. 
Baseline Noise Survey 
Monitoring Positions 
7.7.4 
Discussions were held with MSDC, SCC and the EA to agree a study 
area, a noise survey methodology, and suitable locations for the NSR 
measurement positions.  
7.7.5 
An attended noise survey was then undertaken to determine the spread 
of noise in the area, a number of attended short term sampling 
measurements were taken at pre-determined NSRâs within the agreed 
study area. The baseline noise survey was completed over a period of 
24 hours.

Baseline noise measurements were taken at each of the NSRâs 
between 21st and 22nd July 2013. Weather conditions were conducive 
to successful monitoring with wind speeds less than 5 m/s. Roads were 
dry, and there was no precipitation at the time of measurement. The 
measurement microphones were positioned in free field at 1.4 m above 
ground level and well away from any vertical reflective facades. A wind-
shield was used to minimise the effects of wind noise. The ambient 
temperature was between 16Â°C and 29Â°C during the monitoring period.  
7.7.8 
Each measurement recorded the same five statistical parameters (L90, 
Leq, Lmax, L10, Lmin.) in unweighted third octave bands, with the 
overall figure reported using the A-weighed frequency network. 
7.7.9 
All monitoring was conducted using Class 1 Sound Level Meters. A 
field calibrator was used to calibrate and check the meter before and 
after the measurement period with no change in level recorded. 
Specific details of the equipment used, including serial numbers and 
calibration dates is available on request.

There are a number of heavy industrial facilities in the area surrounding 
the Project Site, including the existing Eye Chicken Litter Power Plant, 
and the National Grid Gas Compressor Station. To ensure that 
creeping background noise levels do not occur, the EIA will include a 
cumulative noise assessment. This assessment will be cross checked 
against the historical background noise levels measured as part of the 
Environmental Permit application for the Chicken Litter Power Plant, 
undertaken in 2007. 
7.8 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
POWER GENERATION PLANT 
Construction 
7.8.2 
Construction activity inevitably leads to some degree of noise 
disturbance at locations in close proximity to the construction activities. 
It is however a temporary source of noise. The noise levels generated 
by construction activities would have the potential to impact upon 
nearby noise sensitive receptors. Noise levels at any one location will 
vary as different combinations of plant machinery are used and 
throughout the construction of the proposed Project as the construction 
activities and locations change.  
7.8.3 
The likely construction noise levels have been predicted using the 
methodology set out in BS 5228 in conjunction with general information 
regarding proposed activities. 
7.8.4 
The construction noise assessment procedure, as set out in BS5228 is 
described below: 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report 
 
PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx

- 156 - 
 
Stage 1. Obtain an activity LAeq by direct measurement of similar plant 
in the same mode of operation, or use the indicative plant noise sound 
pressure values provided in Annexes C and D of BS 5228, these 
values have been measured at a distance of 10m. 
Stage 2. If the distance R, in metres (m) from the point of interest to the 
geometric centre of the plant or activity is other than 10m subtract from 
the LAeq obtained in stage 1 using the following equation:  
ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ 20ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½
10 
Where:  
L1 = Measured plant noise level at 10m distance 
L2 = Predicted plant noise level at assessment location (NSR) 
R = Distance between geometrical centre of noise source and 
assessment location (NSR) 
7.8.5 
The equation identified in stage 2 of the BS5228 construction noise 
assessment method has been used to calculate each separate 
identified plant noise source. This method predicts the total potential 
sound pressure level at each NSR as a result of construction activities. 
Each plant noise source has been calculated as being the shortest 
distance between the site boundary and each NSR. 
7.8.6 
Table 7.9 presents the noise levels associated with typical construction 
activities, and predicts the likely noise level contributed by each item of 
plant at each NSR. The estimated sound pressure levels shown are 
worst-case estimates based on distance attenuation only.  
Distance Attenuation - Discussion 
7.8.7 
Distance attenuation is the term used to describe the reduction of 
sound energy in a sound wave as it travels through a medium. When a 
sound wave travels through air its intensity diminishes due to air 
pressure (absorption) and scattering. Absorption is the conversion of 
the sound energy to other forms of energy. Scattering is the reflection 
of the sound in directions other than its original direction of propagation. 
The combined effect of absorption and scattering over distance is 
referred to as distance attenuation.  
7.8.8 
To address the changing nature of construction noise sources, such as 
different plant items being used at different times, a detailed 
construction program is needed to identify each construction phase. In 
the absence of a detailed construction program this assessment has

been based upon all identified plant items being used simultaneously. It 
is noted that in reality this scenario is extremely unlikely to occur and 
hence predicted noise levels are considered worst case. A more 
detailed construction programme will be available by the time of the 
submission of the full ES.

Operation  
7.8.10 
The computer noise modelling software CadnaA (Version 4.1), which 
uses the ISO 9613 propagation algorithms has been used to undertake 
a provisional noise calculation. The model estimates the contribution to 
noise levels at each NSR location, and has been created using a 
representative sound power level for the whole plant. 
7.8.11 
The model is intended to provide an indicative assessment only for the 
operational phase of the Power Generation Plant. The detailed 
operational noise modelling will be undertaken as part of the EIA, when 
full details of all plant items will be available.  
7.8.12 
As part of the detailed modelling to follow in the full EIA, a number of 
assumptions with regards to the noise control will be included on major 
plant items, these are stated below. 
7.8.13 
All plant items shall be controlled to minimise noise of an impulsive or 
tonal nature, such that the rating level as defined in BS 4142 is equal to 
the specific noise level. 
7.8.14 
The model considers normal operational noise. As such, noise due to 
non-normal operation plant items have not been considered. 
7.8.15 
Table 7.11 presents a summary of the predicted noise levels, from the 
Power Generation Plant, at each of the NSR locations. The measured 
background noise levels (LA90) are also shown and compared to the 
BS 4142 rating level. 
7.8.16 
As part of the operational noise assessment any noise sources that are 
considered to contain acoustic features, such as being tonal, impulsive 
or intermittent in nature should carry a 5 point penalty. If considered 
appropriate the 5 point penalty is added to the predicted plant noise 
LAeq to give the ârating levelâ, (as defined is BS 4142). All plant and 
equipment items shall be controlled to minimise noise of an impulsive 
or tonal nature. However, the Power Generation Plant is intended to be

Figure 7.1 includes a noise contour that shows the predicted spread of 
noise levels surrounding the proposed Power Generation Plant. It is 
noted these results should be considered as preliminary only, and are 
subject to change during the detailed acoustic modelling for the EIA. 
However, it is considered that any change will not be significant.  
7.8.18 
Table 7.11 shows that at all locations the rating level is above the 
lowest measured background noise level. Based on this preliminary 
assessment the impact of operational noise from the proposed Project 
is considered to be minor adverse at NSR locations 2, 5 and 6, and 
moderate adverse at NSR locations 1, 3 and 4. 
Operational Vibration 
7.8.19 
It is predicted that on site vibration sources will include the following: 
ï¿½ 
Balanced rotating equipment, such as turbines; 
ï¿½ 
Wind induced vibrations in the stacks to be transmitted to the 
foundations. 
7.8.20 
With the distances involved between Power Generation Plant site and 
the NSRs, it is anticipated that the level of induced vibration will be 
imperceptible at the nearest sensitive receptor. Operational vibration 
impacts are thus not assessed further.

GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
7.8.21 
The construction and operation of the Gas Connection route corridor 
option 1 has the potential to create a noise and vibration impact at 
NSR locations.  
Construction 
7.8.22 
During the construction phase the following activities are likely to be 
included: 
ï¿½ 
Ground works 
ï¿½ 
Laying of pipes  
7.8.23 
Surface plant such as cranes, excavators, compressors and 
generators are not recognised as sources of high levels of vibration. 
Even at a close distance of 10m, Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) levels 
significantly less than 5mms-1 are generated by such plant. For 
example, a bulldozer would generate a PPV of approximately 
0.6mms-1 and a âheavy lorry on poor road surface' would generate a 
PPV of less than 0.1mms-1. These values are well below limits at 
which cosmetic building damage becomes likely (15mms-1) as 
identified in BS7385: Part 2, 1993. It follows that the vibration impact 
at sensitive receptors from the identified construction activities for the 
Gas Connection route corridor options 1 and 2 is predicted to be not 
significant.  
7.8.24 
The noise impact at sensitive receptors from the identified 
construction activities is anticipated to be minor adverse. It is noted 
that the nature of construction activities is temporary, and as such 
any noise impact related to construction will be limited by the short 
term duration.  
Operation  
7.8.25 
During the operation of this Gas Connection, the following elements 
have the potential to generate noise: 
ï¿½ 
Gas venting â pressure valves 
7.8.26 
Gas venting has the potential to create moderate annoyance at NSRâs. 
Detailed noise mitigation will be required to control the noise from 
pressure release valves.  
Decommissioning 
7.8.27 
At this stage it is envisaged that upon decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant, the Gas Connection would remain in-situ, as

The noise impact at sensitive receptors from the identified construction 
activities is anticipated to be moderate adverse. It is noted that the 
nature of construction activities is temporary, and as such any noise 
impact related to construction will be limited by the short term duration.   
Operation  
7.8.32 
During the operation of this, the following elements have the potential 
to generate noise: 
ï¿½ 
Gas venting â pressure valves 
7.8.33 
Gas venting has the potential to create moderate annoyance at NSRâs. 
Detailed noise mitigation will be required to control the noise from 
pressure release valves.  
Decommissioning 
7.8.34 
At this stage it is envisaged that upon decommissioning of the plant, 
the Gas Connection would remain in-situ, as removing the pipe would 
likely be more environmentally damaging. As such, it is anticipated that 
there would be no noise impacts during the decommissioning of this 
Gas Route.

The noise impact at sensitive receptors from decommissioning 
activities is anticipated to be moderate adverse.   
7.9 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
Construction 
7.9.2 
In order to keep noise impacts from the construction phase to a 
minimum, all construction activities relating to the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection 
Compound 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
recommendations of BS 5228. In addition, PPL will require its 
appointed contractor(s) to minimise the impact of construction activities 
through successful implementation of an agreed CEMP and proper 
communication with local residents. 
7.9.3 
Core site working hours will be agreed with MSDC and SCC and are 
specific to the construction site. For power station construction sites, 
these are generally Monday to Saturday between the hours of 0700 â 
1900. Should it be necessary to work outside these core hours for 
certain activities, this would be with the prior written agreement of 
MSDC. 
7.9.4 
Specific method statements and risk assessments would be required 
for work undertaken during day, evening and night time hours. In order 
to minimise the likelihood of noise complaints in such eventualities, the 
contractor would be required to inform and agree the works in advance 
with MSDC whilst advising potentially affected residents of the works to 
be carried out outside normal hours. Furthermore, the residents would 
be provided with a point of contact for any queries or complaints. 
7.9.5 
All vehicles and mechanical plant used for construction would be fitted 
with effective exhaust silencers, and regularly maintained. 
7.9.6 
Inherently quiet plant would be used where appropriate. All major 
compressors would be sound-reduced models fitted with properly lined 
and sealed acoustic covers which would be kept closed whenever the 
machines are in use and all ancillary pneumatic percussive tools would 
be fitted with mufflers or silencers of the type recommended by the 
manufacturers. 
7.9.7 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps would 
be positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance. If necessary, 
temporary acoustic barriers or enclosures would be provided.

Operation 
7.9.8 
Noise limits will be agreed with MSDC and the following measures 
would serve to monitor and minimise the impact of noise from the 
proposed Project. 
ï¿½ 
A computer-based model of the proposed plant items will be 
produced at the EIA stage, to calculate the predicted noise levels at 
the NSR locations, and ensure that planning limits are adhered to. 
Detailed design will ensure that site noise is mitigated as far as 
possible, through site layout and consideration of the orientation of 
plant items associated with higher sound power levels. 
ï¿½ 
Since tonal or impulsive noises are considered more annoying than 
continuous noise sources, plant items will be silenced or otherwise 
controlled through regular maintenance.  
ï¿½ 
A programme of noise monitoring, including a noise survey shortly 
following the commissioning of the new plant, shall be agreed with 
MSDC and implemented at regular intervals. The aim of these 
surveys shall be to ensure that plant noise levels as measured at 
the agreed NSR locations do not exceed the planning noise limits; 
noise monitoring shall be undertaken in accordance with BS 4142. 
ï¿½ 
Inherently quiet plant items will be selected wherever practicable. In 
addition to the noise control measures mentioned above high 
performance silencers will be fitted to achieve maximum noise 
attenuation on plant including GT inlets and ductwork. Acoustic 
lagging and low noise trims will be fitted in necessary to all pipe-
work and noise generating valves. 
ï¿½ 
High performance acoustic enclosures will be considered for all 
plant items where practicable, not overlooking smaller plant items 
such as compressors and pumps. 
ï¿½ 
Internal surfaces within plant buildings, if the choice of technology 
requires them, will be treated to control internal reverberant noise 
levels. An appropriate treatment would consist of dense mineral 
wool panel behind perforated sheet steel, or possibly a spray-on 
cellulose fibre treatment. 
ï¿½ 
When non-normal and emergency operations lead to noise levels in 
excess of the agreed planning limits, the operator will inform the 
local authority and residents of the reasons for these operations, 
and the anticipated emergency period. 
7.9.9 
During decommissioning, similar mitigation measures to those 
described above for construction will be implemented.

ECOLOGY  
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the 
proposed Project all have the potential to impact on the local ecology of 
the former Eye Airfield and its environs and have the potential to disturb 
various sensitive species. These potential impacts will therefore be 
assessed within the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  
8.1.2 
This section summarises the findings of the further Phase 1 habitat 
surveys that have been undertaken since publication of the Progress 
Power Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report and provides 
up to date information relating to the species specific Phase 2 surveys 
that are ongoing. 
8.1.3 
The Phase 1 Habitat Surveys and Phase 2 Species Surveys have been 
carried out across an area that covers the Power Generation Plant, as 
well as the two Gas Connection options, the two Electrical Connection 
Compound options and the two Electrical Connection route options.  
8.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
8.2.1 
Relevant wildlife and countryside legislation has been used along with 
planning policy guidance and local and national Biodiversity Action 
Plans (BAP) to inform this assessment. Their context and applicability 
is explained as appropriate in the relevant sections of this PEIR. 
Legislation 
8.2.2 
The key legislation of relevance is: 
ï¿½ 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, as 
amended (Habitats Regulations); 
ï¿½ 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended (WCA); 
ï¿½ 
The Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000; 
ï¿½ 
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 
2006; 
ï¿½ 
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992; 
ï¿½ 
The Hedgerow Regulations 1997; 
Bern Convention 
8.2.3 
The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural 
Habitats (the Bern Convention) came into force in 1982. The principal

- 174 - 
 
aims of the Convention are to ensure conservation and protection of 
wild plant and animal species and their natural habitats (listed in 
Appendices I and II of the Convention), to increase cooperation 
between contracting parties, and to regulate the exploitation of species 
(including migratory species). 
Habitats Directive 
8.2.4 
In 1992 the then European Community adopted Council Directive 
92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora, known as the Habitats Directive. The main aim of the EC 
Habitats Directive is to promote the maintenance of biodiversity by 
requiring member states to introduce protection for these habitats and 
species of European importance. The mechanism for protection is 
through designation of SACs, both for habitats and for certain species 
listed within Annex II. 
Birds Directive 
8.2.5 
EC Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds 
(the Birds Directive) provides a framework for the conservation and 
management of wild birds in Europe. In this regard, Annex I of the 
Directive lists habitat types to be protected, and Annex II specifies 
conditions under which hunting can be undertaken. The Directive 
additionally provides for the identification and classification of Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) for rare or vulnerable species listed in Annex I, 
and for regularly occurring migratory species.  
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
8.2.6 
In the UK, the Habitats Directive was transposed into law by means of 
the Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) Regulations 1994 (as 
amended). The Regulations came into force on 30 October 1994, and 
have been amended several times. Subsequently the Conservation of 
Habitats 
and 
Species 
Regulations 
2010 
was 
created 
which 
consolidates all the various amendments made to the 1994 Regulations 
in respect of England and Wales and is commonly known as the 'the 
Habitats Regulations'. The Regulations contain five Parts and four 
Schedules, and provide for the designation and protection of 'European 
sites', the protection of 'European protected species', and the 
adaptation of planning and other controls for the protection of European 
Sites. This legislation is the principle means by which the European 
Union Directives on the Conservation of Wild Birds (2009/147/EC) and 
Habitats Directive are implemented in the UK.

Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
8.2.7 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the principle 
mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in Great Britain. 
However it does not extend to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or 
the Isle of Man.  
Policy 
ï¿½ 
The National Policy Statements for Energy (NPS EN-1, EN-2, EN-4 
and EN-5); 
ï¿½ 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2012; and 
ï¿½ 
Relevant local planning policy; 
ï¿½ 
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP); and  
ï¿½ 
Suffolk Biodiversity Action Plan (Suffolk BAP);  
National Policy Statements 
8.2.8 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
biodiversity impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
8.2.9 
Section 4.3 of EN-1 refers to the Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2010 and the requirement to consider whether a project is 
likely to have a significant effect on a European site either alone or in 
combination with other plans or Projects. 
8.2.10 
Paragraph 5.3.7 states âAs a general principle, and subject to the 
specific policies below, development should aim to avoid significant 
harm to biodiversity and geological conservation interests, including 
through mitigation and consideration of reasonable alternatives (as set 
out in Section 4.4 above); where significant harm cannot be avoided, 
then appropriate compensation measures should be sought.â 
Paragraph 5.3.8 continues âIn taking decisions, the IPC should ensure 
that appropriate weight is attached to designated sites of international, 
national and local importance; protected species; habitats and other 
species of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity; and 
to biodiversity and geological interests within the wider environment.â

8.2.11 
NPS EN-1 goes on to explain the weight to be attached to particular 
designations and notes for example that (paragraph 5.3.13) âThe IPC 
[Secretary of State] should give due consideration to such regional or 
local designations. However, given the need for new infrastructure, 
these designations should not be used in themselves to refuse 
development consent.â 
8.2.12 
Paragraph 5.3.15 encourages the provision of biodiversity opportunities 
within developments. 
8.2.13 
Paragraph 5.3.18 seeks that the applicant demonstrates that 
appropriate and practicable mitigation measures are incorporated into 
the proposed Project. Where this is not demonstrated, the examining 
authority and the SoS âshould consider what appropriate requirements 
should be attached to any consent and/or planning obligations entered 
intoâ.  
8.2.14 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) does not set out specific assessment principles in 
respect of biodiversity for fossil fuel generating stations, except for the 
potential for aquatic ecology effects in respect of cooling water intake 
and exhaust, which is not relevant to the proposed Project due to the 
proposed use of SCGT technology with a low cooling water 
requirement which is likely to be supplied by tankering.  
8.2.15 
The National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas 
and Oil Pipelines (NPS EN-4) notes the relevance of biodiversity in 
respect of the route of gas pipelines in respect of construction phase 
impacts and the potential constraint to planting near the route in future, 
and refers back to the assessment principles contained in NPS EN-1.  
8.2.16 
The National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(NPS EN-5) refers back to the assessment principles contained in NPS 
EN-1 and notes the potential impacts on birds from overhead lines. 
However as the Electricity Connection is to be an underground cable 
this is not of relevance to the proposed Project.  
Other National and Local Policy 
8.2.17 
The NPPF (2012) sets out objectives for protecting biodiversity through 
the planning system. In summary, its objectives (paragraph 109) are:  
ï¿½ 
protecting 
and 
enhancing 
valued 
landscapes, 
geological 
conservation interests and soils; 
ï¿½ 
recognising the wider benefits of ecosystem services;

ï¿½ 
minimising impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in 
biodiversity where possible, contributing to the Governmentâs 
commitment to halt the overall decline in biodiversity, including by 
establishing coherent ecological networks that are more resilient to 
current and future pressures;

8.2.18 
The NPPF at paragraph 118 sets out considerations which local 
authorities are expected to have when determining applications for 
planning permission. The proposed Project is a NSIP and so falls to be 
determined in accordance with the NPS and any other matters 
considered important and relevant, nonetheless it is recognised that the 
NPPF contains broad principles as to the types of land that are less 
suitable, in respect of biodiversity, for development and the importance 
of appropriate mitigation and identification of opportunities for 
biodiversity in new developments. 
8.2.19 
Policy CS5 of the Mid Suffolk Core Strategy 2008 (as updated by the 
Focused Review of 2012) seeks that development manages and 
enhances Mid Suffolkâs biodiversity and geodiversity based on a 
network of designated and identified wildlife sites and corridors, and 
seeks that developments increase opportunities for public access and 
appreciation of biodiversity.  
8.2.20 
Saved Policy CL8 of the Mid Suffolk Local Plan (1998) seeks to avoid 
development that is likely to bring about the loss or significant alteration 
of important habitats or which threatens rare, vulnerable or legally 
protected species.

Project Scenario for Assessment 
8.3.1 
In respect of ecology, the realistic worst case scenario from within the 
proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 3 of the 
PEIR) are set out in Table 8.1 below.  
8.3.2 
As set out in the Air Quality Section (Section 6) the reason that the 
parameters identified in Table 8.1 represent the realistic worst case in 
relation to ecological impacts are primarily because 5 stacks will have a 
potentially greater impact on air quality (and therefore sensitive 
ecological receptors). Further discussion is provided in Section 6.3 of 
this PEIR.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
8.4.1 
Two extended Phase 1 Habitat Surveys have been undertaken as part 
of the EIA. The first report was completed in May 2013 and formed an 
appendix to the Scoping Report. This first report considered the area of 
the Former Eye Airfield that included the Power Generation Plant site 
and the Gas Connection options to the south, located north of 
Castleton Way.  
8.4.2 
The second Phase 1 Habitat Survey report was completed in July 
2013, and considered the ecology within a large area, referred to in this 
PEIR as the Electrical Opportunity Area (EOA) to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant on the far side of the A140 Road. The EOA 
incorporated a large area so that a number of potential Electrical 
Connection route corridor options and Electrical Connection Compound 
options could be considered, thereby providing greater scope to 
circumnavigate any ecological constraints present. This approach was 
favoured over a pre-determined corridor route in order to provide 
greater flexibility in the design and final location of the respective 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound.  .  
8.4.3 
The two Electrical Connection Compound options and the two Electrical 
Connection options, as described in Section 4 and shown on inserts 4.4 
and 4.5, are within the EOA. Accordingly, Phase 1 Habitat Survey of 
July 2013 covers the options for the Electrical Connection Compound 
and the Electrical Connection.  
8.4.4 
The desk studies undertaken as part of the Phase 1 Habitat Surveys 
were undertaken to collect records of protected and notable species, 
and habitats within the vicinity of the Project Site. The search radius 
was 10 km from the site boundary for all statutory designated sites and

bat records, 2 km for non-statutory designated sites, and 1 km for all 
other protected / notable species. 
8.4.5 
As part of the first Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey completed in May 
2013, separate desk studies were carried out for the proposed Power 
Generation Plant site and the Gas Connections as the indicative routes 
proposed for the Gas Connection were likely to be later refined. 
However, within the second Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
completed in July 2013, the updated desk study reflected the entire 
Project Site, incorporating the Power Generation Plant, the two Gas 
Connection options and the EOA. 
8.4.6 
Site walkover surveys were also undertaken to accompany the desk 
based assessments. The surveys followed standard methodology 
published by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), which 
was extended for use in Environmental Assessment by the Institute of 
Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM); with habitat types 
present recorded on a Phase 1 habitat map. Dominant plant species 
observed within each habitat type were recorded in accordance with 
plant species nomenclature in Stace (1997). 
8.4.7 
Badger surveys and Great Crested Newt (GCN) Habitat Suitability 
Index (HSI) assessments were also undertaken alongside the two 
respective Phase 1 Habitat surveys. The badger survey footprint 
extended 30 m beyond the proposed Power Generation Plant site, the 
two Gas Connection options and the EOA where access and visibility 
allowed. The methodology was based on the standard approach 
detailed in Surveying Badgers (Harris et al., 1989). Particular emphasis 
was placed on locating badger setts and signs of territorial activity. 
8.4.8 
GCN HSI assessments were carried out to determine the likelihood of 
presence within the immediate surrounds of the Power Generation 
Plant. the Gas Connection options, the Electrical Connection route 
corridor options and the Electrical Connection Compound options. 
Twenty-six ponds within 500 m of the combined footprint of the Power 
Generation Plant and the two Gas Connection options were surveyed 
alongside the first Phase 1 Habitat Survey, with a further 35 ponds 
within 250 m of the EOA surveyed alongside the second Phase 1 
Habitat Survey. 
8.4.9 
The Habitat Suitability Index assessment (HSI) is a tool which enables 
an assessment of the likelihood of a water body to support GCN. It 
incorporates 10 suitability indices (SI), all of which are factors thought 
to affect GCN.  
8.4.10 
The ecological features of the site have been evaluated in accordance 
with guidelines provided within the IEEM âGuidelines for Ecological 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report 
 
PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx

Impact Assessmentâ (2006). The guidance provides a framework for 
the evaluation of ecological features. It takes into account the direct 
biodiversity value of habitats / species, the indirect value of features 
which help support the ecological integrity of key features, legal 
protection for sites / species and evaluation against national and local 
planning guidance and objectives. 
8.4.11 
It should be noted that whilst the evaluation considers the presence of 
protected species that receive both legal and non-statutory protection, 
the simple presence of the species does not necessarily infer value at 
the level of protection it receives. Therefore, the value of a site for 
protected species is dealt with on a species by species basis, taking 
into account the recorded level of activity, the level of protection it 
receives and the overall value of habitat on that site for that species.  
8.4.12 
Based on the results of the Phase 1 surveys, Phase 2 protected 
species surveys were then undertaken. Each survey was undertaken 
using standard methodologies as recommended by Natural England 
(NE).  
8.4.13 
The assessment methodology employed for the ecological impact 
assessment (ECIA) follows the IEEM âGuidelines for Ecological Impact 
Assessmentâ (2006) and involves five key stages: 
ï¿½ 
Stage 1: Consultations; - as described above, consultations so far 
have concentrated on the scoping responses received to date; 
ï¿½ 
Stage 2: Baseline Studies and Evaluation of Ecological Receptors; 
As described above, desk studies, Phase 1 Habitat surveys and 
Phase 2 protected species surveys have been undertaken for the 
proposed Project;  
ï¿½ 
Stage 3: Identification of Valued Ecological Receptors (VER). This 
has been undertaken during the above steps; 
ï¿½ 
Stage 4: Identification and Characterisation of Potential Impacts. 
Initial impacts are outlined in this PEIR and a further 
characterisation of impacts will be provided in the final ES; and  
ï¿½ 
Stage 5: Assessment of Significant Effects. This stage will be 
completed as part of the final ES.  
8.4.14 
For the purposes of the ECIA, sites, species populations, species 
assemblages and habitats will be valued using the geographical scale 
detailed in Table 8.2. The valuation of sites makes use of any 
established systems, with examples provided in the Table. However, 
professional ecological judgement has been used to attribute value to 
receptors considered to be of district value or below. The potential likely 
ecological impacts from the Project during construction, operation and

decommissioning will be identified and characterised. In identifying 
these impacts, a number of parameters are taken into account. 
Methodology to Determine Magnitude of Effects 
8.4.15 
The parameters used to determine the nature and magnitude of the 
impact are centred upon the: size or intensity of the effect, which is 
measured in relevant terms. For example, the number of individuals 
lost or gained; area of habitat lost or created; or, the degree of change 
to existing conditions such as noise or lighting levels. The magnitude of 
effects also considered the following: 
ï¿½ 
Negative or Positive Effect - Whether the effect of the impact would 
result in net loss or degradation of a VER or whether it would 
enhance or improve it. 
ï¿½ 
Extent - The spatial scope of the effect; for example: the physical 
area affected or the geographical pattern of the effect. 
ï¿½ 
Duration - The length of time over which the effect will occur. 
ï¿½ 
Reversibility - The extent to which effects are reversible, either 
spontaneously or through active mitigation. 
ï¿½ 
Timing and Frequency - Consideration of the timing of events in 
relation to ecological change. Some effects may be of greater 
significance if they take place at certain times of year such as 
during the breeding bird season. The extent to which an effect is 
repeated may also be of importance. 
8.4.16 
Furthermore, impacts can be permanent or temporary, direct, 
secondary or indirect and can be cumulative. 
8.4.17 
These factors are brought together to assess the magnitude of the 
impact on particular VERs and, wherever possible, the magnitude of 
the impact is quantified. 
8.4.18 
Professional judgment is then used to assign the effects on the 
receptors to one of four classes of magnitude, defined in Table 8.2.

Table 8.2 - Definition of Magnitude 
Magnitude 
Definition 
Severe 
A permanent or long-term impact on the 
extent, size or integrity of a site, habitat, 
species assemblage or community, population 
or group. If adverse, this is likely to threaten 
its sustainability; if beneficial, this is likely to 
enhance its conservation status. 
Major 
A permanent or long-term impact on the 
extent or size or integrity of a site, habitat, 
species assemblage or community, population 
or group. If adverse, this is unlikely to threaten 
its sustainability; if beneficial; this is likely to 
be sustainable but is unlikely to enhance its 
conservation status. 
Moderate 
A permanent or long-term reversible impact 
on a site, habitat, species assemblage or 
community, population or group whose 
magnitude is detectable but would not 
threaten its integrity. 
Minor 
A short-term, reversible impact on the extent 
or size or integrity of a site, habitat, species 
assemblage or community, population or 
group that is within the normal range. 
Not significant 
No impact or an impact which is beneath the 
level of perception, within normal bounds of 
variation or within the margin of error of the 
ecological assessments. 
 
Methodology to Determine Value 
8.4.19 
The value of sites, habitats, species assemblages and populations of 
species is evaluated with reference to both their importance in terms of 
âbiodiversity conservationâ value (which relates to the need to conserve 
representative areas of different habitats and the genetic diversity of 
species populations) and their legal status.  
8.4.20 
A review of the legislation, policy and sensitivity of the ecological 
receptor is undertaken and the value of the receptor was determined 
within a geographical context on the following basis: 
ï¿½ 
International;

8.4.21 
Accordingly, Table 8.3 (adapted from Ratcliffe8) outlines the criteria 
taken into consideration for evaluating the value of both habitats and 
species.  
8.4.22 
It should be noted that the description and valuation of ecological 
receptors takes account of any likely changes, including (for example): 
trends in the population size or distribution of species; likely changes to 
the extent of habitats; and, the effects of other proposed developments 
or land-use changes.

Methodology for Assessing Significance 
8.4.23 
The significance of the predicted effects on VERs arising from the 
identified impacts of the proposed Project, including designed-in and 
additional mitigation measures are assessed. 
8.4.24 
Significance is assessed as being Negative, Positive or Not Significant. 
Negative 
8.4.25 
For habitat and species, a negative effect is considered to be significant 
if the favourable conservation status of a VER is compromised by the 
final design of the Project. Conservation status is defined by IEEM 
(2006) as being, for Habitats: 
8.4.26 
âConservation status is determined by the sum of the influences acting 
on the habitat and its typical species that may affect its long-term 
distribution, structure and functions as well as the long-term survival of 
its typical species within a given geographical area.â 
8.4.27 
The IEEM (2006) definition of conservation status, for species, is: 
âConservation status is determined by the sum of the influences acting 
on the species concerned that may affect the long-term distribution and 
abundance of its populations within a given geographical area.â 
8.4.28 
The decision as to whether the favourable conservation status of a 
VER is likely to be compromised is made using professional judgement 
based on an analysis of the predicted effects of the proposed Project 
(including consideration of the specific parameters outlined above). 
8.4.29 
A similar procedure is used for statutory ecological designated sites 
that could be affected, except that the focus is on the effects on the 
integrity of each site, defined by IEEM as: 
âthe coherence of ecological structure and function, across a siteâs 
whole area, that enable it to sustain the habitat, complex of habitats 
and / or levels of populations of species for which it was classified.â  
8.4.30 
This assessment is made with reference to the features for which a site 
has been classified / notified and involves combining assessments of 
the effects on the conservation status of each of these features. 
8.4.31 
For non-statutory ecological designated sites, such features may not 
have been formally defined and in these cases a description of the site 
(and where possible the reason for designation) is used to assess the 
likely habitats and species within these sites. This information is gained 
primarily from the desk studies.

for Progress Power Limited 
 
- 186 - 
 
Positive 
8.4.32 
A positive effect is considered to be significant if development activities 
cause: 
ï¿½ 
A non-valued ecological receptor to become valued; 
ï¿½ 
Restoration of favourable conservation status for a habitat / species 
population; 
ï¿½ 
and / or 
ï¿½ 
Restoration of the integrity of a site (where this has been 
undermined). 
8.4.33 
The complete significance assessment will be undertaken following the 
full analysis of data and will be presented in the forthcoming ES. The 
assessment will consider the potential impacts from all aspects of the 
development on each individually identified VER. However, this PEIR 
sets out a preliminary assessment, including of significance, of the 
likely significant environmental effects of the proposed Project on 
ecology.  
8.4.34 
An assessment of the residual impacts, post-mitigation, will also be 
made. 
8.5 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
8.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection Compound and Electrical Connection, including industry 
standard methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction, 
operation and decommissioning are minimised.  
8.5.2 
Embedded mitigation measures to limit impacts on ecology and 
biodiversity could include ensuring that no construction or vegetation 
clearance takes place within breeding bird season or during other 
sensitive ecological seasons. If necessary, further, specific mitigation 
measures will include the consideration for provision of new habitat to 
suitably replace any habitat areas which are permanently lost through 
development of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection.  
8.5.3 
The assessment in this section takes such design mitigation into 
account.

PLANNING INSPECTORATE 
3.29 
The SoS draws the applicantâs attention to the comments of NE 
(see Appendix 2) regarding the approach to the ecological 
assessment.  
Will be addressed in ES through 
use of standard methodology  
3.30 
The SoS recommends that surveys should be thorough, up to 
date and take account of other development proposed in the 
vicinity. 
Protected species surveys are 
currently underway in accordance 
with relevant best practice and 
guidance and neighbouring 
developments will be addressed in 
ES 
3.31 
The SoS recommends that the proposals should address fully 
the needs of protecting and enhancing biodiversity. The 
assessment should cover habitats, species and processes 
within the site and its surroundings. The SoS draws attention in 
particular, but not exclusively, to the effects on bats, breeding 
birds, wintering birds and great crested newts. The SoS notes 
the submission of the 2013 Extended Habitat Survey and 
welcomes the inclusion of non-statutory designated sites. 
Protected species surveys are 
currently underway addressing 
these species (and others) and ES 
will address potential ecological 
impacts and mitigation 
requirements. 
3.32  
The potential impacts on international and nationally designated 
sites should be assessed as well as county level habitats. The 
SoS notes the possible need for an Appropriate Assessment in 
view of the development siteâs location in relation to Redgrave 
and South Lopham Fens Ramsar site and Waveney and Little 
Ouse Valley Fens SAC. Further information is provided in 
Section 4 of this Scoping Opinion. 
ES will address this. An HRA 
Screening Assessment will 
additionally be undertaken to 
determine the need for an 
Appropriate Assessment.

3.33  
The assessment should take account of impacts on noise, 
vibration, water management and air quality (including dust), 
and cross reference should be made to these specialist reports. 
ES will address this. 
3.34  
The operational and decommissioning phases of the works 
should be addressed. The SoS recommends the need to 
consider cumulative impacts and advises this is particularly 
relevant in terms of assessing the impacts on ecology. 
ES will address this. 
3.46  
The Applicantâs attention is drawn to the comments of NE 
regarding the need to consider the potential impacts on 
biodiversity resulting from the loss of existing vegetation; 
appropriate cross reference should be made to the ecology 
section. 
Protected species survey 
underway and ES will address 
this. 
4.12 
The SoS considers that there is potential for the presence of 
EPS within the study area for the proposed development. 
Where a potential risk to an EPS is identified and before making 
a decision to grant development consent the CA must, amongst 
other things, address the derogation tests in Regulation 53 of 
the Habitats Regulations. Therefore the Applicant may wish to 
provide information which will assist the decision maker to meet 
this duty. Where required the Applicant should, in consultation 
with NE, agree appropriate requirements to secure necessary 
mitigation. 
Protected species survey 
underway and ES will address 
this. 
4.13 
If the Applicant has concluded (in consultation with NE) that an 
EPS licence is required the ExA will need to understand 
whether there is any impediment to the licence being granted. It 
would assist the examination if the Applicant could provide with 
the application confirmation from NE whether they intend to 
issue the licence in due course. 
Protected species survey 
underway and ES will address 
this. Further consultation with NE 
may be required and will be 
undertaken as necessary subject 
to the results of the surveys and 
impact assessment.

MID SUFFOLK DISTRICT COUNCIL 
p.2  
The Council would draw the applicantâs attention to the 
comments made by Suffolk County Council, particularly in 
relation to the linkages between the landscape visual and 
ecological implications of the proposal. As indicated in the 
County Councilâs response the ES should not only give 
consideration to the mitigation of the proposal but also the 
opportunities that exist to enhance local biodiversity. In this 
regard there is extensive knowledge within the local community.  
This will be addressed within the 
ES. 
NATURAL ENGLAND 
2.1 
Ecological Aspects of an Environmental Statement  
Natural England advises that the potential impact of the 
proposal upon features of nature conservation interest and 
opportunities for habitat creation/enhancement should be 
included within this assessment in accordance with appropriate 
guidance on such matters. Guidelines for Ecological Impact 
Assessment (EcIA) have been developed by the Institute of 
Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM) and are 
available on their website. EcIA is the process of identifying, 
quantifying and evaluating the potential impacts of defined 
actions on ecosystems or their components. EcIA may be 
carried out as part of the EIA process or to support other forms 
of environmental assessment or appraisal. The National 
Planning Policy Framework sets out guidance in S.118 on how 
to take account of biodiversity interests in planning decisions 
and the framework that local authorities should provide to assist 
developers. 
The EcIA will be undertaken in 
accordance with the IEEM 
Guidelines for EcIA and with 
reference to relevant documents 
and policies such as NPPF, and 
will be presented in the ES. 
2.2 
Internationally and Nationally Designated Sites

The ES should therefore thoroughly assess the potential for the 
proposal to affect designated sites. European sites, e.g. 
designated Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs), fall within the scope of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as

Policy Framework requires that potential SPAs, possible SACs, 
listed or proposed Ramsar sites, and any site identified as being 
necessary to compensate for adverse impacts on classified, 
potential or possible SPAs, SACs and Ramsar sites be treated 
in the same way as classified sites. Under Regulation 61 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 an 
Appropriate Assessment needs to be undertaken in respect of 
any plan or project which is (a) likely to have a significant effect 
on a European site (either alone or in combination with other 
plans or projects) and (b) not directly connected with or 
necessary to the management of the site. Should a Likely 
Significant Effect on a European/Internationally designated site 
be identified or be uncertain, the competent authority (in this 
case the Secretary of State for Department of Energy and 
Climate Change) may need to prepare an Appropriate 
Assessment, in addition to consideration of impacts through the

Statement to address impacts upon European and Ramsar sites 
entitled âInformation for Habitats Regulations Assessmentï¿½. The 
list of issues that the âInformation for Habitats Regulations 
Assessmentï¿½ should cover are, but not exclusively limited to, the 
following assessments on the internationally designated site 
features:  
the likely impacts of the gaseous emissions to air from the 
operation of the proposed power generation plant  
the likely impacts of any increased water abstraction and waste 
water discharge, both during construction and operation, of the 
proposed Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection.  
Air quality in the UK has improved over recent decades but air 
pollution remains a significant issue; for example over 97% of 
sensitive habitat area in England is predicted to exceed the 
critical loads for ecosystem protection from atmospheric 
nitrogen deposition (England Biodiversity Strategy, Defra 2011). 
A priority action in the England Biodiversity Strategy is to reduce 
air pollution impacts on biodiversity. The planning system plays 
a key role in determining the location of developments which 
may give rise to pollution, either directly or from traffic 
generation, and hence planning decisions can have a significant 
impact on the quality of air, water and land. In terms of 
assessing the impact on air quality, we advise that a radius of 
10km around the application site is searched for international 
and European designated sites (i.e. SPAs, SACs and Ramsar 
sites) and a radius of 2km for nationally designated sites (i.e. 
SSSIs). Non-statutory local sites (e.g. County Wildlife Sites) 
near to the application should also be considered. The 
assessment should take account of the risks of air pollution and 
how these can be managed or reduced. Further information on

air pollution impacts and the sensitivity of different 
habitats/designated sites can be found on the Air Pollution 
Information System (www.apis.ac.uk). Further information on air 
pollution modelling and assessment can be found on the 
Environment Agency website. 
2.4 
Regionally and Locally Important Sites  
The EIA will need to consider any impacts upon local wildlife 
and geological sites. Local sites are identified by the local 
Wildlife Trust, geoconservation group or a local forum 
established for the purposes of identifying and selecting local 
sites. They are of county importance for wildlife or geodiversity. 
The Environmental Statement should therefore include an 
assessment of the likely impacts on the wildlife and geodiversity 
interests of such sites. The assessment should include 
proposals for mitigation of any impacts and if appropriate, 
compensation measures. Contact the Suffolk Biological Records 
Centre and Norfolk Biodiversity Information Service for further 
information.  
ES will address this.

p.4 
Protected Species  
Protected species are species protected by the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and by the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. The ES should assess 
the impact of all phases of the proposal on protected species 
(including, for example, great crested newts, reptiles, birds, 
water voles, badgers and bats). Natural England does not hold 
comprehensive information regarding the locations of species 
protected by law, but advises on the procedures and legislation 
relevant to such species.  
Records of protected species should be sought from appropriate 
Relevant protected species 
surveys are underway in 
accordance with applicable best 
practice and standard 
methodologies. The EcIA will 
cover the assessment of impacts 
on protected species, the relevant 
mitigation requirements, and any 
licensing requirements, which will 
be presented in the Ecology 
Section of the ES.

local biological record centres, nature conservation 
organisations, groups and individuals; and consideration should 
be given to the wider context of the site for example in terms of 
habitat linkages and protected species populations in the wider 
area, to assist in the impact assessment. The conservation of 
species protected by law is explained in Part IV and Annex A of 
Government Circular 06/2005 Biodiversity and Geological 
Conservation: Statutory Obligations and their Impact within the 
Planning System. The area likely to be affected by the proposal 
should be thoroughly surveyed by competent ecologists at 
appropriate times of year for relevant species and the survey 
results, impact assessments and appropriate accompanying 
mitigation strategies included as part of the ES. In order to 
provide this information there may be a requirement for a survey 
at a particular time of year. Surveys should always be carried 
out in optimal survey time periods and to current guidance by 
suitably qualified and where necessary, licensed, consultants. 
Natural England has adopted standing advice for protected 
species which includes links to guidance on survey and 
mitigation.

Habitats and Species of Principal Importance  
The ES should thoroughly assess the impact of the proposals 
on habitats and/or species listed as as âHabitats and Species of 
Principal Importanceï¿½ within the England Biodiversity List, 
published under the requirements of S41 of the Natural 
Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006. Section 
40 of the NERC Act 2006 places a general duty on all public 
authorities, including local planning authorities, to conserve and 
enhance biodiversity. Further information on this duty is 
available in the Defra publication âGuidance for Local Authorities 
Relevant species surveys are 
underway. Impacts on, and 
mitigation requirements in respect 
of Habitats and Species of 
Principle Importance, will be 
covered within the EcIA / ES 
where applicable. Where possible

on Implementing the Biodiversity Dutyï¿½. Government Circular 
06/2005 states that Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species and 
habitats, âare capable of being a material considerationâ¦in the 
making of planning decisionsï¿½. Natural England therefore 
advises that survey, impact assessment and mitigation 
proposals for Habitats and Species of Principal Importance 
should be included in the ES. Consideration should also be 
given to those species and habitats included in the relevant 
Local BAP. Natural England advises that a habitat survey is 
carried out on the site, in order to identify any important habitats 
present. In addition, ornithological, botanical and invertebrate 
surveys should be carried out at appropriate times in the year, 
to establish whether any scarce or priority species are present. 
The Environmental Statement should include details of:  
Any historical data for the site affected by the proposal (e.g. 
from previous surveys);  
Additional surveys carried out as part of this proposal;  
The habitats and species present;  
The status of these habitats and species (e.g. whether BAP 
priority habitat);  
The direct and indirect effects of the development upon those 
habitats and species;  
Full details of any mitigation or compensation that might be 
required.  
The development should seek if possible to avoid adverse 
impact on sensitive areas for wildlife within the site, and if 
possible provide opportunities for overall wildlife gain. The 
record centre for the relevant Local Authorities should be able to 
provide the relevant information on the location and type of BAP 
order to minimise adverse 
impacts.

Contacts for Local Records  
 Natural England does not hold local information on local sites, 
local landscape character and local or national biodiversity 
priority habitats and species. We recommend that you seek 
further information from the appropriate bodies (which may 
include the local records centre, the local wildlife trust or other 
recording society and a local landscape characterisation 
document). 
The Extended Phase 1 Habitat 
Assessments of the Power 
Generation Plant site and Gas 
Connection options and the 
Electrical Connection and 
Electrical Connection Compound 
options undertaken in 2013 have 
addressed this through the 
inclusion of a detailed desk study.  
NORFOLK COUNTY COUNCIL 
5.3 
The ES/EIA will need to address the potential impact on 
Ecology, including in particular, impact on the following 
interests:  
designated sites e.g. Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), 
National Nature Reserves, Special Protection Areas (SPA), 
Special Area for Conservation (SAC), County Wildlife Sites 
(CWS) etc; and  
Birds.  
The need to consider cumulative impact is a requirement of the 
EIA process. This is of particular importance when considering 
ecological impacts. Projects to be incorporated in such an 
assessment must include those in the past, present and 
foreseeable future. Projects to be incorporated in such an 
assessment must include not only other potential wind farms but 
also other types of project taking place in the marine 
environment or onshore so that all elements of the infrastructure 
are assessed. For further information on landscape and ecology 
matters please call Heidi Thompson on 01603 222773. 
ES will address these issues / 
items.

The scoping surveys appear to be based on current and local 
Suffolk Biological Records Centre (SBRC) data which should 
enable robust assessment of potential impacts on ecology from 
the construction of the power station and associated utility 
connections. SCC does request that all additional data collected 
is made available to the Suffolk Biological Records Centre. 
 
All data collected through the 
ecological surveys currently 
underway will be submitted to the 
local record centre.  
34 
Regarding surveys of habitats and species, SCC has not 
reviewed the ecological scoping report carried out by MSDC in 
2011 (5.5.4). Nevertheless, while we accept that the hedgerows, 
scrub and trees are the main habitats which require assessment 
for protected species, it should be noted that arable field 
margins are a BAP habitat and this should be added to the 
scoping surveys so that the impacts of the power generation 
plant and connection options on any arable plants as well as 
farmland birds are adequately assessed. 
A preliminary assessment is 
provided in this PEIR and will be 
further investigated in the final ES. 
35 
 
While the undergrounding of the Electrical Connection would 
have landscape and visual benefits, burial is likely to require a 
significant wayleave which can lead to the severance of 
ecological corridors such as any crossing of Ley Lane for 
example. Therefore proposals for the use of trenchless methods 
and other mitigation methods are likely to be required when 
considering the results of surveys identified in paragraph 5. 
5.16. 
A preliminary assessment of these 
impacts is provided in this PEIR 
and will be further investigated in 
the final ES.

hedgerows and hedgerow trees. From an ecological perspective 
it is particularly important that all veteran trees (see EN-1

to inform the design options. ES 
will also address this. 
37 
Clarification regarding the identified Site of Importance for 
Nature Conservation (SINC) on Progress Industrial Estate 
(5.5.25) is required. There is no County Wildlife Site (CWS) on 
the airfield in the CWS register for Mid Suffolk and we therefore 
need additional information regarding the ecological value of 
this site before assessing the survey and assessment needs for 
it. 
This was an error in the Scoping 
Report. No such SINC exists 
within the former Eye Airfield. 
38 
Notwithstanding the comments at paragraph 34 above, we are 
content that the proposed species surveys for protected and 
BAP species are reasonable. Mitigation measures will need to 
be identified for European Protected Species (bats and Great 
Crested Newts) and for Brown hare. 
Protected species surveys are 
underway and ES will address 
this. 
39 
We welcome the intention to undertake a Habitats Regulation 
Assessment (HRA) Screening Exercise (5.5.35) and suggest 
that reference to a shadow HRA screening report for PINS is 
included in the ES. 
Work on this is ongoing and will be 
included in the ES as requested. 
40 
In addition to embedded mitigation (5.5.36), we would welcome 
early discussion of the potential requirements regarding specific 
measures to minimise any impacts on protected species.  
Production of an ecological 
constraints plan to inform design 
and ES will address this. 
41 
In accordance with EN-1, paragraph 5.3.4, the applicant should 
seek to take advantage of opportunities to conserve and 
enhance biodiversity â for example through discussion of 
opportunities to enhance the local ecological network. 
Opportunities for enhancement will 
be considered once the

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Power Generation Plant and Gas Connections  
8.7.2 
During the Phase 1 Habitat Surveys and associated desk studies, 
twenty nine statutory designated sites were identified within the 10 km 
search radius, although only two of these are of international 
importance and seven of national importance. The remainder of the 
statutory designated sites are ancient woodland. Two non-statutory 
designated sites were noted within the 2 km search radius. Records 
were received for a number of protected and notable species within the 
search area including bats, birds, amphibians, invertebrates and plants.  
8.7.3 
The Phase 1 Habitat survey area comprises an arable landscape, with 
hedgerows, dense scrub, scattered trees and hardstanding along the 
respective arable boundaries, with a small linear plantation to the east. 
Industrial areas are located on the far side of these features to the 
north, east and west, with further arable land around the remaining 
aspects. The A140 road is located to the west of both sites. 
8.7.4 
The Power Generation Plant and the two Gas Connection options did 
not support any semi-mature or mature trees which would otherwise 
warrant a bat tree inspection. No further survey work was therefore 
deemed necessary in respect of roosting bats.  
8.7.5 
No badger setts or signs of badger activity were noted during the 
survey of the proposed Power Generation Plant or the Gas Connection 
options to the south (those to the north and east were later added 
within the second Phase 1 Habitat Survey). No evidence of latrines, 
pathways or snuffle holes was found along the arable margins or 
accessible grassland areas beyond the site boundary during either 
survey. No badger pathways were similarly discovered although the 
presence of a nearby roadkill indicates badgers are active in the wider 
area. Occasional through passage cannot therefore be entirely 
discounted from either site. 
8.7.6 
The results of the pond HSI indicate that the proposed Power 
Generation Plant site and the two Gas Connection options hold limited 
terrestrial potential for GCN (there are no ponds on-site within the 
Power Generation Plant for GCN to breed). The terrestrial habitat is 
considered sub-optimal for GCN although the surrounding pond 
density, particularly to the west of the A140, is considered to be 
conversely strong. The occurrence of this species could not therefore 
be discounted entirely from within the Power Generation Plant and the 
two Gas Connection options, although the A140 Road is likely to serve 
as a major dispersal barrier.

8.7.7 
Seven ponds / ditches (ponds 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and ditch 14 as shown 
on Figure 8.1) were considered to score sufficiently high to warrant 
further survey. Four GCN surveys were therefore recommended to 
determine presence / likely absence from those suitable ponds within 
250 m of the Power Generation Plant and the Gas Connection options 
to the south. 
8.7.8 
In addition, Phase 2 species surveys were also recommended for 
breeding birds, wintering birds and bats in order to determine presence 
/ absence, levels of activity and species diversity. The results of these 
Phase 2 surveys will later inform a full assessment of potential impacts 
resulting from these two elements of the proposed Project, which will 
be presented in the Ecology Section of the ES.  
Electrical Connection Compound Areas and Connection Corridors 
8.7.9 
The desk study identified the presence of 36 statutory designated sites 
(including ancient woodland) within 10 km of the proposed Project Site, 
although only two of these are of international importance and eight of 
national importance. The remainder of the statutory designated sites 
which are of regional / local importance include two Local Nature 
Reserves and 24 ancient woodland sites. Seven non-statutory 
designated sites were noted within the 2 km search radius. Records 
were received for a number of protected and notable species within the 
search area including bats, birds, brown hares, GCN, hedgehogs, 
invertebrates, plants, reptiles and water voles. 
8.7.10 
A Phase 1 Habitat Survey of the EOA was first undertaken on 3rd May 
2013 using permissive pathways, with the remainder of the site 
surveyed on 12th and 13th June 2013 after access was obtained.  
8.7.11 
The survey area comprises a largely arable landscape which is 
intersected by hedgerows, dense scrub, scattered trees and small 
woodland plantations. Smaller areas of buildings and hardstanding, and 
semi-improved grassland also occur in the northern, eastern and 
western areas of the site. The proposed Project site is bounded by 
industrial areas to the north-east (forming Eye Industrial Airfield Estate) 
with further arable land across all remaining aspects. 
8.7.12 
A badger survey was also undertaken alongside the Phase 1 Habitat 
Survey on 12th and 13th June 2013. The survey footprint extended 30 
m beyond the proposed Project site (excluding those areas which were 
surveyed in the preceding Phase 1 Habitat Survey) where access and 
visibility allowed.  
8.7.13 
No badger setts or signs of badger activity were noted during the 
survey of the proposed Project site. No evidence of latrines, pathways

or snuffle holes was found along the arable margins or accessible 
habitats beyond the site boundary. No badger pathways were similarly 
discovered although a previous roadkill detailed within the preceding 
report confirmed badger activity in the wider area. Occasional through 
passage cannot therefore be entirely discounted from the collective 
proposed Project site. 
8.7.14 
A GCN HSI assessment was also carried out at the same time as the 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey to determine the likelihood of presence within 
water bodies within the immediate surrounds of the Electrical 
Connection route corridor options and the Electrical Connection 
Compound options (the remainder of the proposed Project was covered 
in the preceding Phase 1 Habitat Survey report). Thirty-five water 
bodies within 250 m of the EOA were surveyed on 12th and 13th June 
2013. 
8.7.15 
Thirteen water bodies were considered to score sufficiently high to 
warrant further survey, although access was not granted for six of 
these. Three ditches were also considered unsuitable for means of 
survey despite a favourable HSI score due to shallow water levels. 
Only four water bodies, alongside those specified within the preceding 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey report, were therefore included within further 
GCN presence / absence surveys. 
8.7.16 
Four GCN surveys were required to determine presence / likely 
absence from those suitable ponds within 250 m of the proposed 
Project.  
8.7.17 
A bat tree inspection was also undertaken alongside the Phase 1 
Habitat Survey on 12th and 13th June 2013. The aim of the bat tree 
inspection was to collate information relating to the location of 
confirmed bat roosts and / or suitable trees with structural potential to 
support bat roosts to inform the respective ecological constraints plan 
in relation to bat tree roosts which is provided within Figure 8.2. 
8.7.18 
Sixty-five trees were inspected for signs of bats / bat roosting potential, 
55 of which were considered to have varying levels of potential to 
support roosting bats.  
8.7.19 
Twelve trees in total were noted for their potential to support bat roosts 
(of varying categories) within the broad areas identified for Electrical 
Connection Options 1 and 2 and Electrical Connection Compound 
Options 1 and 2. No confirmed roosts were identified during the on the 
ground surveys within these areas and none have been identified to 
date during the activity surveys May to August.

8.7.20 
No further surveys (i.e. aerial inspections and / or emergence and re-
entry surveys) are required unless there remains no reasonable 
alternative in terms of the positioning of the works footprint to otherwise 
avoid and circumnavigate those trees with bat roosting potential. 
8.7.21 
Breeding bird and reptile surveys were already commissioned prior to 
the Phase 1 Habitat Survey . The Phase 2 species survey results will 
later be used to inform the detailed design in order to minimise potential 
impacts on the ecological receptors. 
Phase 2 Species Specific Surveys 
8.7.22 
As part of the Phase 2 survey effort for the proposed Project the 
following protected species surveys were commissioned: badger, bat 
(activity), breeding bird, great crested newt and reptile. In line with the 
desk study and field results from the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, further 
Phase 2 survey work for dormouse, invertebrate, plant (National 
Vegetation Classification (NVC)), otter and water vole was scoped out 
due to either likely absence or low corresponding biological interest; 
these surveys were not therefore considered necessary. 
8.7.23 
Although Phase 2 wintering bird surveys were originally recommended 
within the initial Phase 1 Habitat Survey, due to a number of factors this 
survey requirement was subsequently considered unnecessary and as 
such its omission is not considered to affect the robustness of baseline 
information available to inform the ecological impact of the proposed 
Project. This decision was also subsequently deemed applicable to the 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and was 
therefore omitted from the respective Phase 1 Habitat Survey report. 
8.7.24 
The omission of the winter bird surveys is based on the following 
factors: 
ï¿½ 
the small Power Generation Plant footprint on arable land; 
ï¿½ 
the widespread availability of arable farmland in the wider environs; 
ï¿½ 
the availability of wintering bird survey data completed for an 
adjacent wind turbine development; and 
ï¿½ 
the careful design of precautionary mitigation in terms of works 
location (with respect to the Gas Connection, Electrical Connection 
and Electrical Connection Compound) and methods which can be 
employed to minimise disturbance and therefore impacts. 
 
8.7.25 
With respect to the Phase 2 surveys that have already been 
commissioned and are either complete or underway, a summary of the 
final results / results to-date are provided in Table 8.5 below.

Requirement 
and Timing 
Survey Results 
Badger survey 
One survey visit 
(depending on 
the site size and 
complexity) 
carried out at 
anytime of the 
year. Autumn 
and early spring 
however 
represent the 
optimal times of 
survey. 
No signs of badger were noted within the Project Site although the 
discovery of a nearby road kill confirms presence within the wider 
surrounds.  Updated badger surveys may be required closer to the 
time of the proposed construction of the proposed Project to establish 
any changes in the badger status. Timings will be allowed to address 
any need for badger licence/s (July to November). Mitigation would 
be employed accordingly as required.  
 
Bats (tree inspection) 
One survey visit 
(depending on 
the site size and 
complexity) 
carried out at 
anytime of the 
year. Autumn 
and winter 
however 
represent the 
optimal times of 
survey. 
Sixty-five trees (some of which are groups of trees) were inspected 
from the ground for signs of bats / bat roosting potential, 55 of which 
were considered to have varying levels of potential to support 
roosting bats. No confirmed roosts were however recorded during the 
ground based surveys. Staining was noted beneath a woodpecker 
hole on one tree and therefore further investigative survey work (i.e. a 
tree climbing survey by a licensed bat ecologist) will need to be 
undertaken if the preferred Electrical Connection cannot be designed 
to reasonably avoid this tree. 
Fourteen trees (all of which are located within the EOA) were 
recorded as Category 1* (having multiple, highly suitable features 
capable of supporting larger roosts), 12 trees as Category 1 (with 
definite bat potential, supporting fewer suitable features than

Category 1* trees or potential for use by single bats), 29 as Category 
2 (trees with no obvious potential, although of size and age that 
features higher up may have otherwise been concealed or 
overlooked; or trees which support some features which may have 
limited potential to bats), and 10 Category 3 (trees with no bat 
potential). 
There are no trees with any bat roosting potential within the Power 
Generation Plant Site or the two Gas Connection options. Twelve 
trees with varying degrees of bat potential have been identified within 
the two Electrical Connection Compound options and the two 
Electrical Connection options. 
No ecological constraints however are envisaged to roosting bats 
within the broad areas identified for the two Electrical Connection 
options and the two Electrical Connection Compounds unless the 
proposed routes and siting of the compounds cannot otherwise be 
designed to purposefully circumnavigate those trees with potential, 
particularly any trees which are of the highest potential (Category 1 or 
above) for roosting bats.  
There are no ecological constraints in respect of Category 2 and 
Category 3 trees, although precautionary mitigation measures may 
be necessary in respect of any Category 2 trees that may be affected 
by the proposed works. Such measures may include soft felling, 
segmental removal of limbs and ecological supervision during works.  
Bats (activity survey) 
Monthly surveys 
carried out 
between spring 
and autumn, one 
of which 
comprises a dusk 
and dawn 
Three monthly surveys (May, June and July) carried out, the last of 
which incorporated a dusk and dawn survey effort. Low levels of bat 
activity have so far been recorded across the proposed Project site 
with only three common bat species recorded (common pipistrelle 
[Pipistrellus pipistrellus], noctule [Nyctalus noctula] and soprano 
pipistrelle [P.pygmaeus]). No bat roosts have been identified during 
the activity surveys.

survey. 
No ecological constraints are therefore envisaged with regards to bat 
activity to date. 
Breeding bird survey 
Three surveys 
undertaken 
spring - early 
summer. 
All three surveys have been completed between the beginning of 
June and end of July 2013, with hobby (Falco subbuteo) and barn 
owl (Tyto alba) nests identified within the central area of the EOA. 
Both species are listed as Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as 
amended, Schedule 1 species, and as such it is an offence to 
intentionally or recklessly disturb this species at, on, or near an active 
nest site. However, neither nest is likely to form an ecological 
constraint to the Power Generation Plant, the two Gas Connections 
and the two Electrical Connection route options and Electrical 
Connection Compound options based on the existing proposed 
locations and routes.  
. 
The survey results also highlighted the presence of 10 species that 
are Red Listed within the Birds of Conservation Concern, BoCC, and 
nine that are Amber Listed, 12 BAP Priority Species / Section 41 
NERC, and eight Suffolk BAP Priority Species. However, most of 
these species (excluding ground nesting birds) do not provide an 
ecological constraint to the proposed Project based on the proposed 
location for the Power Generation Plant and the options for the Gas 
Connection, 
Electrical 
Connection 
and 
Electrical 
Connection 
Compound providing that the Gas Connection and the Electrical 
Connection and the Electrical Connection Compound are carefully 
designed and sited within one of the proposed options to minimise 
the impact on hedgerows and field margins, as these habitats in 
particular is likely to be of significant value to breeding birds. 
The corresponding potential for adverse impacts on ground nesting 
birds, such as Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis) and grey partridge

(Perdix perdix), could be offset with the provision of compensatory 
habitat. 
Great crested newt 
survey 
Four surveys to 
determine 
presence, two 
additional 
surveys to 
complete 
population 
assessment if 
GCN are found. 
Surveys carried 
out in spring / 
early summer, 
with half 
completed 
between mid-
April and mid-
May. 
The great crested newt (GCN) (Triturus cristatus) presence / absence 
surveys were completed in May and June 2013. The results of the 
surveys indicate that GCN are present in one water body 
approximately 500m north-west of the footprint of the Electrical 
Connection and Compound option 1. Additional surveys to determine 
population size were not carried out at this pond as the distance is 
such that the additional information would not have altered the 
corresponding impact assessment of the works in relation to GCN. 
Given the 500m distance, any impacts arising are considered to be 
low-negligible. With the inclusion of basic mitigation measures, 
including the timing and method of works, effects on GCN are 
considered likely to be not significant. The inclusion of such 
measures may negate the need for a European Protected Species 
(EPS) derogation licence.  
One pond was found to be located within 250m of the Power 
Generation Plant where connectivity to the site was not severed by 
areas of hardstanding and roads. Survey in this location was not 
possible as a result of health and safety. In order to compensate for 
the lack of survey in this location, presence is assumed as a 
precaution. Limited suitable terrestrial habitat was available for GCN 
and it is considered that corresponding effects will not be significant 
with the addition of basic mitigation, including the timing and method 
of works.  
In all other locations relating to the two Gas Connection options and 
the two Electrical Connection route options and Electrical Connection 
Compounds, a 250 m buffer has been provided around each 
unsurveyed pond to highlight the potential risk of presence in these

areas. Where appropriate, as a result of barriers to dispersal (such as 
roads), the 250m buffer has been reduced. The final positioning of 
the Gas Connection, the Electrical Connection and the Electrical 
Connection Compound will avoid these buffers to remove the 
potential for impacts.  
If avoidance is not possible (either wholly or partially), then further 
survey may be required to inform the impact assessment and 
mitigation required. 
 
Reptiles 
Seven survey 
visits carried out 
over the course 
of spring â early 
summer and 
early autumn. 
All reptile surveys have been completed and no reptiles have been 
discovered during these targeted reptile surveys. It should be noted 
that an incidental sighting of a grass snake was made during a GCN 
survey near Home Farm to the north, well outside of the application 
area. The habitats within the application site are considered to be of 
low quality to support grass snake but it is not possible to rule out 
their presence or passage across certain areas within the application 
area as described below.   
The fragmented habitat within the Power Generation Plant is not 
considered to be suitable to support grass snake or its passage.  
The habitat proposed for the Gas Connection Route 1 is not 
considered large enough to support grass snake in its own right.  
The habitat proposed for the Gas Connection Route 2 has been 
cleared in the past and there are barriers to grass snake dispersal.  
The habitat within the areas proposed for the Electrical Connections 
and Compounds 1 and 2 have potential to support grass snake in 
those areas that support water bodies.  
It is assumed that the final design will take account of hedgerows and 
field margins around water bodies with potential to support grass 
snake and these areas will be avoided. If this is not possible

8.8 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
POWER GENERATION PLANT  
8.8.2 
A Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening will be conducted 
to identify any potential impacts on internationally designated sites. 
This exercise will determine the requirement for an Appropriate 
Assessment in view of the Power Generation Plantâs location in relation 
to Redgrave and South Lopham Fens Ramsar site and Waveney and 
Little Ouse Valley Fens SAC. 
8.8.3 
The internationally designated sites are located greater than 7 km from 
the Power Generation Plant and direct impacts are considered 
negligible. It is considered that indirect impacts associated with air 
quality issues during the operation phase may give rise to likely 
significant environmental effects.  
8.8.4 
No direct impacts on sites of National, Regional or Local importance 
are envisaged as a result of the Power Generation Plant. Indirect 
impacts 
resulting 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant may give rise to likely 
significant environmental effects. 
8.8.5 
It should be noted that only those species for which potential impacts 
are present have been referenced and addressed below.  
8.8.6 
No impacts on badgers are envisaged as a result of the proposed 
Power Generation Plant. However passage across this area cannot be 
discounted and thus updated badger surveys would be required prior to 
construction of the Power Generation Plant to ascertain that the status 
of badgers in this area has not changed.  
8.8.7 
No semi-mature or mature trees, and thus roosting bats, are present 
within the area proposed for the Power Generation Plant. Impacts on 
roosting bats within trees are therefore negligible.  
8.8.8 
A full assessment, following completion of the bat activity surveys, will 
be made in the ES.  
8.8.9 
One pond (Pond 4) was found situated approximately 150m to the 
north of the Power Generation Plant footprint. Further ponds were 
present in the wider landscape, however; the presence of roads would 
provide effective barriers for dispersal of GCN in to the Power 
Generation Plant footprint from these locations.  
8.8.10 
Pond 4 is used by the chicken little fired Power Station as a fire hydrant 
and as such, is subject to varying water levels and/or drainage. It was

located within an area of amenity grassland with limited suitable 
terrestrial habitat available in the surrounding area.  
8.8.11 
Given its isolated nature, it was considered unlikely that GCN would be 
found present. However, as a result of an average HSI, it was not 
considered possible to entirely discount this pond without further 
survey. Further survey was not possible due to Health and safety 
constraints preventing access to the water along with a lack of visibility 
due to a covering of blanket weed. Taking into consideration its 
proximity to the Power Generation Plant footprint, it has been 
necessary to adopt a precautionary approach in this assessment under 
the assumption that GCN are present in Pond 4. 
8.8.12 
The positioning of the Power Generation Plant within an area of largely 
unsuitable habitat comprising arable land more than 100m distant from 
pond 4 is considered likely to result in low-negligible impacts upon 
GCN. With appropriate mitigation, including the exclusion of GCN from 
the construction footprint and the enhancement of habitat surrounding 
the pond any impacts are likely to be rendered as insignificant. 
8.8.13 
No impacts to Schedule 1 bird species are envisaged as a result of the 
proposed for the Power Generation Plant. No impacts to breeding birds 
are envisaged through careful design and avoidance of key areas and 
timing of the works however a full assessment will be required within 
the ES.  
8.8.14 
No impacts on reptiles within the area proposed for the Power 
Generation Plant are envisaged.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
8.8.15 
Impacts on internationally designated sites resulting from the 
construction of this Gas Connection Route Corridor Option are 
considered negligible.  
8.8.16 
No impacts on sites of national, regional or local importance are 
envisaged as a result of this Gas Connection Route Corridor Option. 
8.8.17 
Should Gas Connection Route Option 1 be taken forward following 
consultation, a full assessment would be made in the ES.  
8.8.18 
It should be noted that only those species for which potential impacts 
are present have been referenced are addressed below.  
8.8.19 
No impacts on badgers are envisaged as a result of the proposed Gas 
Connection Route. However, passage across the site, encompassing 
the proposed Gas Connection option cannot be discounted and thus

updated badger surveys would be required prior to construction of the 
Gas Connection, once the specific route and work footprint is known, to 
ascertain that the status of badgers in this area has not changed.  
8.8.20 
No semi-mature or mature trees, and thus roosting bats, are present 
within the area proposed for this Gas Connection option. Impacts on 
roosting bats therefore are negligible.  
8.8.21 
Should Gas Connection Route Option 1 be taken forward following 
consultation, full assessment, following completion of the bat activity 
surveys, will be made in the ES.  
8.8.22 
No ponds were found within 250m of Gas Connection Route Option 1, 
where there was connectivity to the works footprint, which were 
considered suitable for GCN. As such, impacts on GCN are not 
considered likely.  
8.8.23 
250m between pond locations and the working footprint is considered 
an appropriate distance for consideration due to the localised and 
temporary nature of works during construction and operation.  
8.8.24 
Assessment of pond suitability for GCN was based on a number of 
criteria, including the use of HSI. Ponds discounted from survey as a 
result of poor or below-average HSI scoring, will require reassessment 
prior to works commencing.  
8.8.25 
No impacts to Schedule 1 bird species are envisaged as a result of the 
proposed Gas Connection Route Option 1. No impacts to breeding 
birds are envisaged through careful design and avoidance of key areas 
and timing of the works However, a full assessment will be required 
within the ES should Gas Connection Route Option 1 be taken forward 
following consultation.  
8.8.26 
The impacts to grass snake are considered to be very low to negligible 
in the area proposed for the Gas Connection Route Option 1.  
8.8.27 
Should Gas Connection Route Option 1 be taken forward following 
consultation, a full assessment of potential impacts on grass snake will 
be made in the ES of this option.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 2 
8.8.28 
As for Gas Connection Route Option 1, no impacts on statutory and 
non-statutory designated sites are envisaged for Gas Connection 
Route Option 2.  
8.8.29 
Should Gas Connection Route Option 2 be taken forward following 
consultation, a full assessment would be made in the ES.

It should be noted that only those species for which potential impacts 
are present have been referenced and addressed below.  
8.8.31 
No impacts on badgers are envisaged as a result of the proposed Gas 
Connection Route Option 2. However, passage across the site, 
encompassing the proposed Gas Connection option cannot be 
discounted and thus updated badger surveys would be required prior to 
construction of the Gas Connection, once the specific route and work 
footprint is known, to ascertain that the status of badgers in this area 
has not changed.  
8.8.32 
No semi-mature or mature trees, and thus roosting bats, are present 
within the area proposed for the Gas Connection Route Option 2. 
Impacts on roosting bats therefore are negligible.  
8.8.33 
Should Gas Connection Route Option 2 be taken forward following 
consultation, a full assessment, following completion of the bat activity 
surveys, will be made in the ES.   
8.8.34 
Four ponds considered suitable for GCN were found within 250m of 
Gas Connection Route 2 (Ponds 6, 7, 8 and 9). However, the presence 
of roads and significant areas of hardstanding provide barriers that 
would preclude dispersal of GCN to the footprint of Gas Connection 
Route Option 2. 
8.8.35 
No other ponds considered suitable for GCN were found within 250m of 
the footprint of Gas Connection Route 2 and as such, impacts on GCN 
are not considered likely. 
8.8.36 
250m between pond locations and the working footprint is considered 
an appropriate distance for consideration due to the localised and 
temporary nature of works during construction and operation. 
Assessment of pond suitability for GCN was based on a number of 
criteria, including the use of HSI. Ponds discounted from survey as a 
result of poor or below-average HSI scoring, will require reassessment 
prior to works commencing.  
8.8.37 
No impacts to Schedule 1 bird species are envisaged as a result of the 
proposed Gas Connection Route Option 2. No impacts to breeding 
birds are envisaged through careful design and avoidance of key areas 
and timing of the works. However, a full assessment will be required 
within the ES should Gas Connection Route Option 2 be taken forward 
following consultation.  
8.8.38 
The impacts to grass snake are considered to be very low to negligible 
in the area proposed for the Gas Connection Route Option 2.

ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND ELECTRICAL 
CONNECTION OPTION 1 
8.8.40 
Impacts on internationally designated sites resulting from the 
construction of the Electrical Connection and Compound 1 are 
considered negligible.  
8.8.41 
No direct impacts on sites of national, regional or local importance are 
envisaged as a result of the Electrical Connection and Compound 1.

8.8.45 
Impacts to roosting bats are not envisaged within the area proposed for 
Electrical Connection and Compound 1 unless the six trees noted with 
potential for bat roosts cannot be purposefully avoided, particularly any 
trees which are of the highest potential (Category 1 or above) for 
roosting bats.  
8.8.46 
Should Electrical Connection and Compound 1 be taken forward 
following consultation, a full assessment will be made in the ES. 
Further surveys would be required if avoidance is not possible and if 
any bat roosts were present, appropriate mitigation devised.  
8.8.47 
It should be noted that as bats are transient there may be a 
requirement to conduct additional inspections of those trees with bat 
potential, depending on the time that passes between now and the 
construction of the Electrical Connection and Compound 1 to ensure no 
indirect impacts. For example indirect impacts on bats may arise from 
lighting associated with the sub-station.

the activity surveys have been completed.  
8.8.49 
Three ponds (Ponds 12, 13 and 14) considered suitable for GCN were 
found within the footprint of Electrical Connection and Compound 1. 
GCN were found likely to be absent from these ponds during 
presence/absence surveys carried out in May and June 2013. 
8.8.50 
In addition, one ditch (15) and a number of ponds (ELF, A140, M2, 
30M, M3 and 32M) considered suitable for GCN were found within 
250m of the footprint. These were not surveyed as part of the 
assessment as a result of access restrictions and/or health and safety 
concerns. Should the footprint of the Electrical Connection and 
Compound 1 be sited to avoid the 250m area surrounding these 
waterbodies, impacts on GCN are not considered likely. Further 
consideration of these waterbodies through survey would be necessary 
should it not be possible to avoid the 250m radii around the above-
mentioned ponds.  
8.8.51 
250m is considered an appropriate distance for consideration in this 
assessment due to the localised and temporary nature of works during

One pond (Pond 11) considered suitable for GCN was found within the 
footprint of Electrical Connection and Compound 2. GCN were found 
likely to be absent from this pond during presence/absence surveys 
carried out in May and June 2013. 
8.8.63 
In addition, one ditch (M2) and one pond (20M) considered suitable for 
GCN were found within 250m of the footprint of Electrical Connection 
and Compound 2. These were not surveyed as part of this assessment 
as a result of access restrictions and/or health and safety concerns. 
Should the footprint of the Electrical Connection and Compound 2 be 
sited to avoid the 250m area surrounding these waterbodies, impacts 
on GCN are not considered likely. Further consideration of these 
waterbodies through survey would be necessary should it not be 
possible to avoid the 250m radii around the above-mentioned pond and 
ditch.

WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES  
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
During construction, operation and decommissioning there is some 
potential for elements of the proposed Project to impact on local water 
quality. However, this potential is relatively limited as there will be 
minimal water usage requirements on site by the Power Generation 
Plant, particularly during operation as the Power Generation Plant will 
operate as a SCGT with air cooling. Neither the Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection nor the Electrical Connection Compound will 
require any water. Both water quality and water usage will be assessed 
in this section, with the full assessment being carried out within the EIA 
and reported on in the ES to be submitted with the proposed DCO 
Application. 
9.1.2 
This section will also provide a brief summary of the main issues and 
risks posed to and from flooding. However, these will be assessed in 
detail through a separate Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) submitted as a 
separate document as part of the proposed DCO Application.  
9.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
Water Framework Directive 
9.2.2 
EU Directive 2000/60/EC established a framework for Community 
action in the field of water policy (the Water Framework Directive 
(WFD)). The overarching goal of the WFD is for relevant waters to 
reach "good" chemical and ecological status by 2015. Member states 
then have to maintain this standard. Provided that certain conditions 
are satisfied, in some cases the achievement of good status may be 
delayed until 2021 or 2027.  
9.2.3 
The WFD also sets goals for the progressive reduction of emissions, 
discharges and losses of Priority Substances and the cessation of 
Priority Hazardous Substances. As part of the WFD's aim to improve 
water quality by reducing specific Priority Substances, the first priority 
substances list (Decision 2455/2001/EC) was issued by the European 
Commission identifying 33 priority substances.  
9.2.4 
The Priority Substances Directive, a daughter directive of the WFD was 
introduced in 2008 and it replaced the first priority substances list. In 
2012, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a directive 
amending the WFD and the Priority Substances Directive regarding 
Priority Substances. In July 2013, the European Parliament adopted a 
legislative resolution on the proposal. As such, a new Directive may 
emerge but is not currently in force.

9.2.5 
In the UK, a technical advisory group (WFDTAG) consisting of the UK 
environment and conservation agencies has been established to 
support the implementation of the WFD. The WFDTAG has established 
standards for certain substances that they consider are concentrations 
of a pollutant below which no harmful effects on aquatic organisms 
would be expected. 
National Policy Statements 
9.2.6 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
water quality and resources impacts with regard to energy 
infrastructure. Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations 
are provided in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-
2). The NPSs for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure (EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant 
to the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and 
Electrical Connection respectively. 
9.2.7 
NPS EN-1 states, in Section 5.15, that âInfrastructure development can 
have adverse effects on the water environment including groundwater, 
inland surface water, transitional waters and coastal waters.â An 
assessment of the existing conditions regarding water quality, water 
resources and physical characteristics of the water environment and 
the impacts of a proposed Project is required by paragraph 5.15.2. 
9.2.8 
EN-1 notes that activities that discharge to the water environment are 
subject to additional pollution controls and recommends that the 
Secretary of State (SoS) gives increased weight to impacts on the 
water environment that would have an adverse affect on the 
achievement of the objectives of the WFD in its decision making. 
Paragraph 5.15.7 states that: âThe [Secretary of State] should consider 
whether appropriate requirements should be attached to any 
development consent ... to mitigate adverse effects on the water 
environment.â 
9.2.9 
EN-2 Part 2 Section 2.10 states that âWater quality and resourceâ 
recognises that some fossil fuel generating stations such as coal-fired 
stations and CCGTs have very high water demands, whilst others such 
as open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs) have very little water demand, 
Paragraph 2.2.9 therefore states the following: âThe applicant should 
have investigated the availability of such supply at an early stage.â 
9.2.10 
EN-4 Part 2 Section 2.22 recognises that âconstructing pipelines 
creates corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can 
potentially affect watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and

discharge points, areas prone to flooding and ecological receptors. 
Pipeline impacts could include inadequate or excessive drainage, 
interference 
with 
groundwater 
flow 
pathways, 
mobilisation 
of 
contaminants already in the ground, the introduction of new pollutants, 
flooding, disturbance to water ecology, pollution due to silt from 
construction and disturbance to species and their habitatsâ. 
9.2.11 
EN-4 states that where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality an assessment of the impacts should be 
provided in line with Section 5.15 as part of the ES. The SoS should be 
satisfied that the impacts on water quality and resources are 
acceptable in accordance with Section 5.15 of EN-1.  
Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 
9.2.12 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 
sought to establish an integrated approach to Waste Management 
Licensing and Pollution Prevention and Control. In April 2010, the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
increased the scope of the Environmental Permit to include water 
discharges and groundwater activities. The EA will control and regulate 
the proposed Project with respect to the discharge of any effluent from 
the site via an Environmental Permit. The permit will include specific 
limits for a range of pollutants that could be present in any effluent 
proposed to be discharged to surface waters. These limits will be set to 
ensure that the process contribution of any pollutant within the scope of 
the WFD and the EQS Directive does not detrimentally affect the 
potential for the receiving water body to achieve good status.  
Other National and Local Policy 
9.2.13 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the SoS in the determination of an energy NSIP. 
9.2.14 
At paragraph 109, the NPPF that the planning system should contribute 
to and enhance the natural environment by: âpreventing new 
development from contributing to or being put at unacceptable risk 
from, 
or 
being 
adversely 
affected 
by 
unacceptable 
levels 
of...water...pollution.â 
9.2.15 
The NPPF states (paragraph 7) that the planning system should 
perform a number of roles in delivering sustainable development 
including an environmental role âcontributing to protecting and 
enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; and, as part of 
this, helping to improve biodiversity, use natural resources prudently,

minimise waste and pollution and mitigate and adapt to climate change 
including moving to a low carbon economy.â 
9.2.16 
The Core Strategy of the Mid Suffolk Local Development Framework 
(LDF) aims to set out the vision, objectives, spatial strategy and core 
policies that will guide development across the district until 2025 and 
beyond. The Core Strategy has 15 Core Objectives; the most relevant 
to this chapter is as follows: Core Strategy Objective 2 âto seek to 
improve water quality and reduce pollution to the wider environment.â 
9.2.17 
Policy aims relating to water quality and water resources within the 
Core Strategy and the saved policies of the Mid Suffolk Local Plan will 
be discussed in the final ES chapter and the separate Planning 
Statement that will be prepared to accompany the proposed DCO 
Application.  
9.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
9.3.1 
In respect of potential impacts on water quality and resources, the 
realistic worst case scenario from within the proposed Project 
parameters (described in Section 3 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 
Table 9.1

5 (~ 59 MW) 
Number of stacks

9.3.2 
A larger number of smaller Gas Turbine Generator units is considered 
to be the worst case scenario for water resources at the Project Site. 
To generate the same power output as a larger 299 MW unit at the 
Project Site the water requirement will be marginally higher for five 
separate units as there are five separate plant items for NOx 
abatement. There is also the requirement for marginally more water to 
wash turbine blades of five separate units rather than washing blades 
of a lower number of units.  
9.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound is 
presented in this section.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
Water Resources 
9.4.2 
The preliminary assessment of water resources covers all major water 
use activities for the proposed Project. The sources of raw water will be 
identified and the appropriate processing and storage methods are 
defined, based on the intended uses. The reason for use and the 
amounts of water required will be specified and, where appropriate, the 
anticipated effluent compositions established. The fate and impact of all 
effluents will be assessed. 
Water Quality

Embedded Design Mitigation 
9.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and industry 
standard methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction, 
operation and decommissioning are minimised. In respect of Water this 
mitigation includes: 
ï¿½ 
Choice of SCGT technology which does not require a large amount 
of water for its operation; and 
ï¿½ 
Use of industry best practices in design and construction of water 
course crossings (e.g. Horizontal Directional Drilling) to reduce 
interaction with watercourses.

PLANNING INSPECTORATE 
3.36 
The SoS welcomes the assessment of the potential impacts 
resulting from the development of the Power Generation Plant on 
local water quality and flooding. The ES should identify and clearly 
map any surface water resources (including springs and private 
water supplies both internal and external to the site boundary) that 
could potentially affect or be affected by the proposal. 
Surface water resources are recorded 
on Figure 9.1. 
3.37 
Potential sources of pollution should be identified, as well as 
pathways to potential hydrological and surface water receptors, 
this includes the aquifer below the site. 
These are identified in Section 9.7 
Baseline and presented in the site 
Conceptual Site Model. 
3.38 
Full details on the rates of potable use at each stage should be 
assessed. 
Potable water will dominate water 
demand on-site during operation. 
Exact quantities will be provided in the 
ES. 
3.39 
Potential impacts on the public sewer network should be 
assessed, including easements and any potential impacts arising 
from vibration during the construction works. The SoS 
recommends consultation with relevant organisations (including 
water and sewerage companies) to agree the approach. 
Based on maps provided, there is 
currently no local sewage network on-
site, and sewage will be sent to an 
onsite septic tank. Therefore we donât 
expect there to be any impact on the 
public sewer network. 
3.40 
Mitigation measures should be addressed and the SoS advises 
that reference should be made to other regimes (such as pollution 
prevention from the EA). On-going monitoring should also be 
addressed and agreed with the relevant authorities to ensure that 
any mitigation measures are effective. 
The need for mitigation measures will 
be established through the 
assessment process. At this stage it is 
not envisaged that the proposed 
Project will have any significant

impact on water quality, water 
courses or local aquifers. 
3.41 
The SoS welcomes the commitment to provide a Flood Risk 
Assessment (FRA) in accordance with the Applications Prescribed 
Forms and Procedures Regulations (APFP). The FRA should 
cover ground water, surface water and fluvial impacts. The SoS 
recommends that a Surface Water Management Plan should be 
prepared which may include a review of existing drainage facilities 
and the provision of interceptors on site. 
A separate FRA is being conducted 
as part of the proposed Project, the 
scope of which is currently being 
finalised with the Environment 
Agency.  
3.42 
The FRA should form an appendix to the ES. The SoS 
recommends that the sections considering the water environment 
should be cross referenced. 
A separate FRA will form an Appendix 
to the ES. The ES section will 
reference the FRA and vice versa, as 
appropriate.  
SCC 
Water 
Resources

The Scoping Report does not reflect that the site is located in an 
extremely water stressed area. Essex and Suffolk Waterâs draft 
Water Resource Management Plan states â[T]he Essex and 
Suffolk supply areas are located within some of the driest areas of 
the country and as such face particular challenges including a 
general lack of new intrinsic water resources, growing demand, 
and uncertainty for climate changeâ. 
Noted â the Power Generation Plant 
will be designed in a manner that 
limits water requirements during 
operation. Water requirements during 
constriction are detailed in section 9.8 
potential impacts. Water that is 
required will be delivered to the Power 
Generation Site by tanker to eliminate 
the need for abstraction from 
groundwater or watercourses. It is 
likely that water will be tankered to 
site during construction, operation and 
decommissioning. An alternative 
option of using potable water from the 
town supply will be assessed in the

Eye is located within Essex and Suffolk Waterâs Suffolk 
Hartismere Water Resource Zone, which histroically has been the 
most affected by drought of all the WRZz (page 252) 
Noted â see above 
70 
It is recognised that water companies are under no obligation to 
suply new industrial users, but there is localised concern over the 
implications of the water requirements of the Project (which are 
not set out in the Scoping Report, though it is assumed the plant 
will utilise air cooling (5.6.3)) for existing particularly agricultral 
users. 
Water use at the Power Generation 
Plant will be limited to mainly 
domestic/sanitation purposes only 
during operation and to sanitation and 
wheel washing during construction / 
decommissioning. Therefore water 
use will be minimal.  
71 
Consequently the ES should set out more clearly the water 
requirements of the plant in operation (but also construction), 
where it proposes to source water from and in what quantities and 
how it will make it available on site and also, similarly, how waste 
water will be disposed of (for example via tankering). 
Noted. Some of this information has 
been presented in the PEIR and the 
remainder will be set out in the ES.  
72 
The ES should also set out the opportunities for rainwater 
harvesting of the plant in operation (but also construction), where 
it proposes to source water from and in what quantities and how it 
will make it available on site and also, similarly, how waste water 
will be disposed of (for example via tankering). 
All water required on-site for the 
Power Generation Plant during 
operation is anticipated to be tankered 
to site and stored in water storage 
tanks adjacent to the administration 
buildings. It is possible that rainwater 
harvesting could be used for admin 
facilities (e.g. toilets). Quantities of 
water usage and disposal during 
construction, operation and 
decommissioning will be clearly stated 
in the ES.

Sustainable Drainage Systems (5.6.19) should be deployed to 
maintain a greenfield runoff rate for the site and designed to be 
integrated in to a wider network in due course to ensure efficient 
use of space on the airfield. If well-designed, SUDS can have 
ancillary environmental benefits, for example through creation of 
new habitat. 
At present it is still being investigated 
whether sustainable drainage 
systems (SUDS) are a suitable 
drainage method for the Power 
Generation Site.  
74 
The applicant should be aware that Schedule 3 of the Flood and 
Water Management Act 2010 is proposed to commence by April 
2014. This will require the applicant to obtain drainage approval 
for any works affecting surface water and is in addition to planning 
consent. It will be an offence to construct without drainage 
approval. If, however development consent is granted before this 
time, them no drainage approval would be required. 
Noted â It has been agreed with the 
EA that the EIA will provide enough 
detail to illustrate that excess surface 
water can be effectively dealt with on 
site, and that a detailed drainage 
system design will be provided to the 
Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) for 
approval prior to construction.  
MSDC 
Water 
Resources 
As indicated in the response provided by SCC the site is located 
within an extremely water stressed area. The ES should 
therefore clearly set out the possible water requirements during 
the construction and operational phases of the development. 
A provisional assessment of water 
requirements is provided in this 
chapter and further details will be 
provided in the ES. 
The Scoping report identifies five surface water bodies within the 
vicinity of the proposed plant however there are known to be 
more. The applicant should therefore be encouraged to 
undertake a more extensive survey. 
Noted. All waterbodies in the vicinity 
of the Project Site are shown in Figure 
9.1 
The ES should set out the opportunities available to manage 
surface water drainage as a means of mitigation, including the 
use of Sustainable Drainage Systems.  
The methods for managing surface 
water have been discussed with the 
Environment Agency and will be 
presented in the FRA that 
accompanies the ES.

... from a fire service view point the proposal looks okay my 
concern lies in the fact it does not seem to have made provisions 
for any private hydrants or EWS. I know that the airfield itself is 
now heavily commercialised both next to the A140 and from the 
Langton Green side (Mid Suffolk Business Park) and the water of 
some description must reach all of the units.  
An attenuation pond will be on-site 
and this could be dual purpose as an 
Emergency Water Supply if needed. 
 
The proposal is next to the existing power station run by EBR they 
have both EWS and suppression systems within the building. I 
would make an assumption that some sort of suppression system 
will be included in the design and run off will be held on site as part 
of the environmental impact assessment but no sign of any 
dedicated water supply for fire fighting. There may be a supply 
through the Humphreyâs development next to the A140 which 
could be connected too, or a dedicated one put in from either 
Castleton Road end or from Mid Suffolk Business park however a 
site of this size I suggest would need to have its own dedicated 
EWS. 
There will be fire water tanks present 
on-site during operation. We have 
discussed with the Environment 
Agency and they have stated that we 
do not need to take into account 
increase in surface water runoff as a 
result of the actions of the fire 
service. Although a Fire Water plan 
will need to be submitted to prevent 
pollution from Fire Water. 
 
16 ditches and ponds have been identified within 500 m of the 
proposed site 8 within 250 m which are either average or below, 
the construction of a new EWS could be used for our purpose and 
decrease the environmental impact by providing a habitat for 
wildlife if built sympathetically, with access for Fire Service. The 
proposed site is in Suffolk so they ultimately will have their say but 
just my observations. 
Outline plans include provisions for 
an attenuation pond which will be 
used to control the increase in 
surface water runoff from the Power 
Generation Plant site during 
operation resulting from the increase 
in hard standing. This could have a 
dual purpose and could be used 
during emergencies if required. 
Consultation is ongoing regarding

We have no objection to the proposed development. We give our 
consent to the development on the condition that new water 
connection is made onto our company network for the power 
station, for revenue purposes. 
The exact design is not finalised and 
the decision of whether to tanker in 
water or have a mains water supply 
has not yet been made. 
We assume that the existing water mains in the vicinity will be 
sufficient to supply the proposed power station with an adequate 
water supply. We note that in the Parsons Brinckerhoff Report 
Paragraph 3.3.28 is states that, â...the total plant water 
requirement is negligible.â If the water network requires 
reinforcement to enable Essex & Suffolk to supply sufficient 
quantity of water for the operation of the power station, then the 
cost of these works will be charged to the Client. 
Based on maps provided by Essex 
and Suffolk Water the closest mains 
water supply is provided to the 
Chicken Litter Power Station to the 
north of the Power Generation Plant. 
Please note, Essex & Suffolk Water are the enforcement agents 
for The Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 within our 
area of supply, on behalf of the Department for the Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs. On completion of the power station, and 
before a water supply is provided, Essex & Suffolk Water should 
be contacted as the premises are Modifiable under Regulation 5 
of the Water Supply (Water Fittings) regulations 1999. Please see

Our most recent modelled data indicates that the site lies within 
Flood Zone 1, and is therefore at low risk of flooding from fluvial or 
tidal sources (i.e. a less than 0.1% annual probability of flooding). 
A separate FRA is being conducted

Drainage 
The modelled flood outlines show areas of potential flooding as a 
direct result of floodwater coming from a watercourse and no 
direct effects of surface runoff or surface flooding are included. As 
such, any planning application for a site greater than 1 hectare in 
area will need to be supported by an appropriate site specific 
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA). 
working with the EA to agree a 
scope. 
The FRA will need to assess the flood risks to the development 
site, and demonstrate how the building and any occupants will be 
kept safe from flooding, now, and over the lifetime of the 
development and not increase flood risk elsewhere as a result of 
any additional impermeable surfaces. 
Noted 
Within the FRA, allowances for climate change should be 
considered within the design of the surface water drainage 
scheme. The allowance should be applied as detailed in the 
Technical Guidance to the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF), for the lifetime of the proposed development, including 
allowances for climate change. 
Noted 
The development of this site should look to incorporate 
sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) to manage surface water in 
accordance with paragraph 103 of the NPPF and MSDCâs 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA). There is the opportunity 
to incorporate a range of SUDS features due to the scale of the 
development site. 
An assessment of whether SUDs is 
suitable for the site will be included in 
the FRA, but the detailed design of 
any such system will be carried out 
during the detailed design stage of 
the project following submission of 
the proposed DCO application.

Site 
should demonstrate that an adequate surface water management 
strategy will be adopted. With regards to surface water 
management, the FRA should provide: 
confirmation that any runoff from the developed site shall not 
exceed the existing Greenfield runoff rates for a range of 
equivalent return period rainfall events over the lifetime of the 
development. 
A surface water drainage system will 
be implemented and this will prevent 
runoff rates exceeding the existing 
Greenfield rates. 
Calculations to demonstrate that the proposed surface water 
management scheme has been adequately sized to 
accommodate the critical duration 1 in 100 year rainfall event 
including allowances for climate change without causing nuisance 
or damage. The management strategy should consider both 
storage and conveyance f surface water. 
This will be included within the 
standalone FRA. 
Plans and drawings showing the locations and dimensions of all 
aspects of the proposed surface water management scheme. The 
submitted plans should demonstrate that the proposed drainage 
layout will perform as intended based on the topography of the 
site and the location of the proposed surface water management 
features. In addition, full design details, including cross-sections of 
any proposed infiltration or design features will be required. 
More detailed plans will be included 
within the final ES chapter. However, 
the drainage system will only be 
finalised during detailed design of the 
plant and when a suitable plant 
supplier has been selected.  
Confirmation that in the event of exceedance flows that surpass 
the critical duration rainfall event or a blockage/failure occurs 
within the drainage network any proposed features should 
incorporate an emergency spillway as part of their design. We 
suggest that the emergency spillway directs any exceedance flow 
away from the development. 
This will be included within the 
standalone FRA. 
Sufficient information to demonstrate that people and property will 
be kept safe from flooding, with consideration given to overland

Details of the future adoption and maintenance of all aspects of 
the surface water drainage strategy. The local planning authority 
should be satisfied that arrangements are in place for the long

management scheme. 
This will be included within the 
standalone FRA. 
Information to demonstrate that priority is given to the use of 
sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) for the disposal of surface 
water from all elements of the development proposal. Therefore, 
the scheme shall incorporate the SUDS âManagement Trainâ and 
ensure all features are designed in accordance with CIRIA (C697) 
The SUDS Manual so ecological, water quality and aesthetic 
benefits can be achieved in addition to the flood risk management 
benefits. In surface water drainage system should be formulated 
as per the recommendations within the CIRIA SUDS Manual 
(C697). 
This will be included within the 
standalone FRA. 
Evidence to establish if the principles of any infiltration based 
surface water drainage strategy are achievable on site based on 
the ground conditions. The FRA should provide evidence that the 
ground conditions are suitable for the proposed methods, such as 
infiltration or soakaway tests which adhere to BRE365 guidance. 
This will be included within the 
standalone FRA. 
Reason 
To prevent the increased risk of flooding, to improve and protect 
water quality, improve habitat and amenity, and ensure future 
maintenance of the surface water drainage system.

Additional 
advice to the 
applicant 
Erection or replacement of flow control structures or any culverting 
of an ordinary watercourse requires consent from the relevant 
Lead Local Flood Authority (SCC). It is best to discuss proposals 
for any works with them at an early stage. 
It is not envisaged at this stage that 
these measures will be required. 
However, if crossings are required

Connection Compound , further 
consultations will be carried out. 
We would suggest that, given the mapped presence of an aquifer 
at the site further groundwater investigation takes place in order to 
clarify any potential risk. In the event a high groundwater table 
occurs, the cumulative effect of surface water that is impeded 
from draining and an elevated groundwater table could pose an 
unacceptable flood risk to the development or impact the design 
of attenuation or infiltration features. 
The underlying aquifer is located at a 
significant depth below the overlying, 
hydraulically passive, superficial 
deposits, so the risk of any 
interaction is considered very low. 
However, this risk of groundwater 
flooding will be fully investigated in 
the FRA which will accompany the 
ES. 
There are a number of valley features within the red line boundary 
which may act as surface water flow routes. The layout of the 
proposed development should follow the âsequential approachâ 
detailed in paragraph 6.7 of the PPS25 Practise Guide so as to 
ensure that sensitive parts of the development avoid any potential 
flood risk. 
This will be covered in detail in the 
FRA. 
Water 
Quality 
Paragraph 5.6.4 of the Scoping Report refers to small quantities of 
water (blowdown) from the Power Generation Plant being 
discharged to avoid the build-up of impurities in the HRSG 
steam/water cycle. It is not clear from this description whether this 
discharge will be to the existing sewerage system or to local 
watercourses. 
The design of the Power Generation 
Plant has been refined since the 
scoping stage. The plant will be an 
SCGT and therefore will not require 
a HRSG. Therefore very little 
process water will be required and it 
is not intended to discharge any 
process water from the Power 
Generation Site. 
The Environmental Statement (ES) should clarify the nature and 
location of the discharge, and if it is proposed that the discharge 
would be to a local watercourse the ES should:

Consideration of the potential for a Water Framework Directive 
(WFD) Report/Assessment is discussed â see paragraph 5.6.21 â 
under the heading of water resources. There is also the potential 
for a WFD Report to be required in relation to water quality. We 
can advise the developer further on this area once the impact

Consideration of the potential for a Water Framework Directive 
Report/Assessment in paragraph 5.6.21 is very much welcomed. 
We can advise the developer further on this area once the impact 
assessment work is underway and there is certainty on the degree 
of impacts on water resource receptors. 
Further consultation will be held with 
the EA to determine whether a WFD 
Report is required for the Project 
Site.  
Paragraph 5.6.3: It should be noted that there is no water 
available in this catchment for abstraction should air cooling 
become unviable. From attendance by us at the meeting held with 
the developer and the local and county planning authorities on 16 
May 2013 and the Scoping Report, it is evident that water will be 
tankered in from an external source which would be acceptable. 
Noted. Air cooling is the preferred 
cooling method for the Power 
Generation Plant and at present 
there is nothing which suggests that 
this is not a feasible method of 
cooling the plant.

How many tanker movements are involved? What effect will they 
have on existing A140 traffic volumes? What investigations for on-
site water extraction are planned, particularly in view of the 
scarcity of groundwater in the area? There is also a need for a 
careful planning of surface water treatment/run off particularly with 
the existing run-off problems effecting Eye.  
It is not known at this stage how 
many tanker movements will be 
involved, this will be confirmed upon 
completion of the full EIA. 
The effects on traffic volumes on the

Some surface water drainage from the proposed site runs 
westwards under the A140 and eventually feeds into a watercourse 
west of the Yaxley Allotment. There is a risk of flooding the field at 
times of high run-off. The capacity of this system to take any more

POWER GENERATION PLANT  
Surface Water Bodies 
9.7.2 
Surface water bodies in the vicinity of the proposed Project will be 
identified and described in this section along with their importance. 
Based on an initial, high level assessment, the main water bodies are 
considered to be: 
ï¿½ 
Three ponds located next to Parkeâs Farm approximately 1.5 km 
north east of the Power Generation Plant site boundary; 
ï¿½ 
Two ponds located north at approximately 2.5 km north of the 
Power Generation Plant site boundary;  
ï¿½ 
One reservoir located at approximately 770 m east of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary;  
ï¿½ 
One pond located at approximately 525 m west of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary; and 
ï¿½ 
One small drain or watercourse approximately 750 m south west of 
the Power Generation Plant site boundary. 
9.7.3 
A more detailed assessment of surface water bodies will be carried out 
in the EIA, where a site visit will be conducted to each of the identified 
waterbodies. 
9.7.4 
The proposed Project falls within a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) and 
a Groundwater Source Protection Zone (GSPZ) III. The EA describes 
GSPZs as zones that "show the risk of contamination from any 
activities that might cause pollution in the area. The closer the activity, 
the greater the risk" and notes that it uses GSPZs "in conjunction with 
our Groundwater Protection Policy to set up pollution prevention 
measures in areas which are at a higher risk, and to monitor the 
activities of potential polluters nearby"." 
9.7.5 
GSPZ IIIs are defined as âthe area around a source within which all 
groundwater recharge is presumed to be discharged at the source. In 
confined aquifers, the source catchment may be displaced some 
distance from the source. For heavily exploited aquifers, the final 
Source Catchment Protection Zone can be defined as the whole aquifer 
recharge area where the ratio of groundwater abstraction to aquifer 
recharge (average recharge multiplied by outcrop area) is >0.75. There 
is still the need to define individual source protection areas to assist 
operators in catchment management. â

Site: RJB Starke and RWB Starke & Sons. The Envirocheck report 
details that water abstractions from these operators occur at 286 m, 
376 m, 380 m, 418 m, 421 m and 422 m from the boundary. In all 
cases the permitted end date of the water abstraction licence is not 
provided therefore it is not known whether these abstractions are still 
operational. Water has been abstracted from these points for general 
agricultural use along with other industrial/commercial/public services.

The consents are listed as discharging sewage discharges final/treated 
effluent and trade effluent into surface water bodies. The receiving 
bodies include: ditch tributaries of the River Waveney, Thrandeston 
Water Course, tributaries of the River Dove and the River Dove. 
9.7.11 
Discharge consents will be explored in more detail within the full ES 
chapter.  
9.7.12 
Historical Ordnance survey maps contained within the Envirocheck 
report dated 27th June 2013 have been assessed. These are dated 
between the late 1800s to the present day. These maps do not identify 
any former watercourses in the area. A more detailed assessment of 
these historical maps is provided in Sections 10 (Ground Conditions) 
and Section 14 (Cultural Heritage) of this PEIR. 
Hydrogeology 
9.7.13 
The bedrock of the proposed Project area is classified as a Principal 
Aquifer. The aquifer has a very low vulnerability to pollutants given the 
low permeability / leaching potential of the superficial deposits and soils 
overlying the site. Please see Section 10 Geology, Land Contamination 
and Agriculture for more information regarding the soils and geology 
underlying the proposed Project.  
9.7.14 
Although the bedrock principal aquifer is of high sensitivity, given its 
depth and protection afforded by overlying low permeability deposits, 
there are not anticipated to be any impacts arising from the 
development of the proposed Project. The hydrogeology of the site is 
explored in more detail in Section 10 Geology, Land Contamination and 
Agriculture. 
Flood Risk 
9.7.15 
The whole Project site is located with Flood Zone 1 and thus is not 
considered to be at risk from fluvial flooding.

9.7.16 
The River Dove runs to the south of the Power Generation Plant site 
(and is outside the Project Site). The channel and banks of this river 
are classified as a Flood Zone 3 i.e. without defences this area has a 
1% (1 in 100) or greater chance of flooding each year. This will be 
assessed further by a standalone FRA which will form an Appendix to 
the final ES and accompany the proposed DCO Application. 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1  
9.7.17 
This route which passes directly from the Power Generation Plant site, 
into the Diss Gas Compression Station, will not need to cross any 
surface water bodies. The route passes solely through Flood Zone 1 
and thus not considered to be at risk of flooding. The route falls within 
the nitrate vulnerable zone which encompasses the Power Generation 
Plant site, although it is just outside the GSPZ III.  
9.7.18 
The bedrock of the Gas Connection option 1 is classified as a Principal 
Aquifer. The aquifer has a very low vulnerability to pollutants given the 
low permeability / leaching potential of the superficial deposits and soils 
overlying the site. Please see Section 10 Geology, Ground Conditions 
and Agriculture for more information regarding the soils and geology 
underlying the route corridor.  
9.7.19 
Although the bedrock principal aquifer is of high sensitivity, given its 
depth and protection afforded by overlying low permeability deposits, 
there are not anticipated to be any impacts on the aquifer arising from 
the development of the proposed route corridor. Furthermore there will 
be no impacts on surface water in the area. 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
9.7.20 
Although this route is longer than Option 1 described above, there is 
are no significant differences between the baseline conditions for Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 2 and Gas Connection Route 
Corridor Option 1. 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 and Electrical 
Connection Option 1 
9.7.21 
The proposed site area of the Electrical Connection Compound Option 
1 and the route of Electrical Connection Option 1 contain a number of 
surface water courses, but the Electrical Connection and the Electrical 
Connection Compound will be designed and located so as to avoid 
these water courses. As with the Gas Connection, the Electrical 
Connection routes are not anticipated to cross any areas that are at risk 
of flooding. However, the electrical cables are designed such that even

Construction and operational access to the Electrical Connection 
Compound would be via a new access road, which would likley follow 
the route of the preferred electrical connection option. 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 2 and Electrical 
Connection Option 2 
9.7.23 
Although there are slightly fewer surface water bodies within the area 
outlined within Electrical Connection Compound Option 2 and Electrical 
Connection Option 2, there is are no material differences between the 
baseline conditions for Electrical Connection Compound Option 2 and 
Electrical Connection Option 2 and Electrical Connection Compound 
Option 1 and Electrical Connection Option 1. 
Conceptual Site Model 
9.7.24 
Table 9.6 provides a tabular representation of a conceptual site model 
(CSM). The CSM is a representation of the potential pollutant linkages 
arising from water usage for the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project. The CSM identifies a source 
(of pollution) a pathway and a potential receptor. A potential impact can 
only occur if all three components are present. 
9.7.25 
The table shows that potential contaminants within the Project site 
include unknown contaminants which are already present within the soil 
and the accidental spillage of liquids including diesel and oil. Potential 
pathways of these pollutants from the source to the receptor include 
drilling / piling into the principal aquifer and surface water runoff and the 
potential receptors at the site include local surface water courses, the 
principal aquifer and site workers.

The CSM is useful to show the potential pollutant linkages however it 
does not predict the likelihood of their occurrence. It is anticipated that 
there is a very minimal risk that any of the pathways listed in the table 
above will be created. Due to the depth of the overlying unproductive 
strata, potential piling for foundations (if required) would not reach the 
principal aquifer and therefore no pathway would be created. 
Additionally any on-site surface water runoff will be captured by the 
surface water drainage system thus no contaminated runoff will be 
created.

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
POWER GENERATION PLANT 
Construction 
9.8.2 
A small amount of water will be required each day for the general 
construction works (e.g. wheel washing and dust suppression) and 
hygiene. This water will likely be brought in by bowser or and therefore 
no surface water or groundwater abstraction will be required. The

impact of construction on water use from local sources with therefore 
be minimal. An alternative option of using potable water from the town 
supply will be assessed in the ES. 
9.8.3 
Construction activities could require the disposal of water from the site. 
Therefore all construction contractors will be required, in conjunction 
with PPL, to reach an agreement with the EA with regard to detailed 
methods of disposal. 
9.8.4 
During construction, if it is necessary to install a temporary diesel 
storage tank for onsite construction machinery, generators etc. on-site 
this will be double-skinned and/or contained with an impermeable bund 
sized to hold 110 per cent of the total tank contents for the prevention 
of releases to the environment. Maintenance of construction machinery, 
on-site, will be forbidden outside suitably kerbed or bunded areas to 
prevent the accidental leakage of lubricating and hydraulic fluids. 
Therefore the impact of accidental spillages during construction will be 
negligible.  
9.8.5 
Construction activities, if uncontrolled, could potentially cause leaching 
to surface waters due to the creation of soil piles formed during 
excavation, levelling and other such on-site works. Impacts could 
include the potential eutrophication of surrounding watercourses. 
However, there are not anticipated to be any impacts on the water 
bodies listed above as the majority are a significant distance from the 
site and therefore will not be directly impacted during construction. 
Furthermore, as this is the case it is considered that at this site a WFD 
Report is not required to assess the surrounding water bodies. Further 
consultation will be undertaken with the EA to confirm this.  
9.8.6 
Given the above, and the lack of any surface waterbodies within the 
vicinity of the proposed Power Generation Plant, the preliminary 
findings are that the impacts on Water Resources from the construction 
of the Power Generation Plant would be negligible.  
Operation 
9.8.7 
The largest operational demand for water in the majority of UK power 
stations is cooling. However the Power Generation Plant will be air 
cooled therefore no water will be required to cool this plant and only 
minimal qualities will be required for operational purposes. Therefore 
the impacts on water requirements will be negligible.  
9.8.8 
Water use on-site will be limited to NOx control, potable water for 
drinking and sanitation purposes and plant washing. Domestic/sanitary 
water use will be approximately 200 litres per person per day (c. 30 
m3/day). For NOx control it is anticipated that the plant will require a

- 251 - 
 
worst case scenario of 69 m3 per hour. Assuming a water tank on site 
capable of storing 6000 m3, there is enough capacity for up to 3.6 days 
continuously running the plant, 24 hrs per day. However, as the plant 
will operate in âpeaking modeâ (anticipated at <1500 hrs per year) the 
maximum potential water use required for NOx control will be 
approximately 103,000m3 per year.  
9.8.9 
The water used for NOx control will all be used up during the process, 
and therefore no residual water will be discharged.  
9.8.10 
Due to the intermittent water demand of the plant, it is likely that all 
water will be tankered to site and stored in water storage tanks 
adjacent to the administration buildings. An alternative option of using 
potable water from the town supply will also be assessed in the ES. 
9.8.11 
The Power Generation Site will be equipped with a surface water 
drainage system and a sewerage system. The intricacies of these 
systems will be confirmed within the detailed design stage. It is 
anticipated at this stage that the on-site sewerage system will connect 
to a new onsite septic tank that will be maintained and emptied by 
suitable contractors. The surface water drainage system will discharge 
into an attenuation pond in the north of the Power Generation Site. It is 
not anticipated that surface water drainage will require specialist 
treatment for oils. Surface water drainage will be uncontaminated and 
typical of surface water runoff from areas of hardstanding and roads. 
Before reaching the main sewerage network the runoff will pass 
through oil interceptors / filters. Therefore impacts on water courses of 
accidental spillages and leaks will be negligible. 
9.8.12 
The proposed Project will lead to a slight increase in the amount of 
runoff from within the Power Generation Plant site boundary due to the 
increase in hardstanding. However this additional runoff will be 
captured by the surface water drainage system so that existing 
greenfield runoff rates are not exceeded.  
9.8.13 
An assessment of the potential for the application of SUDS at the 
proposed Project will be undertaken at a more detailed scale during the 
final EIA and then at a more detailed design stage once an appropriate 
plant supplier has been selected. The SUDS would, if feasible, be used 
to retain non-contaminated surface water on-site for release at a 
controlled and sustainable rate to the existing local drainage ditches or 
soakaways. The feasibility and design will be agreed in advance with 
the EA as stated in the scoping responses.  
9.8.14 
Occasionally it will be necessary to wash the blades of the air 
compressor section of the gas turbine to remove debris that has 
penetrated the air inlet filters and become lodged on the compressor

blades. This will be done at times when the performance of the GT has 
degraded and will depend on the air quality in the vicinity of the Project 
site.  
9.8.15 
Washing can be done in two ways, either: 
ï¿½ On-line washing where a fine spray of water is allowed to 
pass through the gas turbine; or, 
ï¿½ Off-line washing where the compressor blades are rotated 
slowly through a detergent solution. 
9.8.16 
Any water generated during washing will be retained on-site in an 
attenuation pond and will be subsequently tankered off-site by a 
licensed contractor for disposal at an appropriately licensed disposal 
facility.  
9.8.17 
The anticipated water requirement for washing will be of the order of 
11.5 m3 per wash.  
Decommissioning 
9.8.18 
During decommissioning, it is not anticipated that there will be any 
material differences in the impacts on Water Resources from those 
described for the construction phase.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1  
Construction 
9.8.19 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 does not pass in close 
proximity to any water bodies. The closest water body to Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1 is located approximately 400 m to 
the north east of the corridor boundary. Additionally, the same 
embedded mitigation measures will be used during construction as will 
be used during construction of the Power Generation Plant (e.g. 
working to best practice and in line with a detailed CEMP). It is 
therefore considered likely that any construction activities for this Gas 
Connection will have a negligible effect on the water resources in the 
area.  
9.8.20 
Although the bedrock principal aquifer underlying this route corridor 
option is highly sensitivity, given its depth and protection afforded by 
overlying low permeability deposits, there are not anticipated to be any 
construction activities that could impact on the aquifer.

9.8.21 
Prior to operation the gas pipeline will be hydrostatically tested by 
closing off the ends, filling it with water and increasing the pressure to a 
pre-determined level higher than the pressure at which it is designed to 
operate.  
9.8.22 
The water used during hydrostatic testing would likely be tankered to 
and from site, from where it will be disposed as a suitable disposal 
facility.  
Operation 
9.8.23 
As the Gas Connection would be a buried pipeline, once operational, 
the pipeline will have no impacts on any surrounding waterbodies or 
ground water. Furthermore, there is no operational water requirement 
for this element of the proposed Project.  
9.8.24 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1 would have negligible impacts on 
the Water Resources of the area. 
Decommissioning 
9.8.25 
Following the decommissioning of the plant, it is anticipated that the 
Gas Connection pipe would be left in-situ, as removal of the pipe would 
cause more environmental disruption than leaving it in place.  
9.8.26 
As such, there are no decommissioning activities for this element of the 
Project which would require water and as such the impacts on Water 
Resources are negligible. 
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 2  
Construction, Operation & Decommissioning 
9.8.27 
Although Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 is longer than 
Option 1, this option also does not cross or pass within close proximity 
to any surface waterbodies, with the closest water body located to the 
south side of Castleton Way, thus producing a barrier between the pipe 
and the watercourse. As such, at this preliminary stage, there are not 
considered to be any material differences between the impact of this 
option and those of Option 1 described above, during the construction, 
operation or decommissioning phases.

ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND ELECTRICAL 
CONNECTION OPTION 1 
Construction 
9.8.28 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 is located in an area that 
contains several unnamed surface water features. As such, it is likely 
that these features may need to be crossed, or culverted to facilitate 
the construction of the Electrical Connection Compound. Such works, if 
required, would be carried out to industry best practices to ensure that 
the potential impacts of such works are minimised as much as possible. 
In addition, all relevant permits to work within close proximity to these 
water bodies will be obtained prior to commencement, once the final 
design of the Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection has been decided. 
9.8.29 
It is considered likely that a Water Framework Directive report will be 
required for this element of the proposed Project and the scope of that 
report will be agreed with the Environment Agency during the 
consultation process. 
9.8.30 
Furthermore, this Option is located above a Principal Aquifer. However, 
the aquifer has a very low vulnerability to pollutants along the 
connection route given the low permeability / leaching potential of the 
superficial deposits and soils overlying the aquifer. Part of Electrical 
Connection Compound Option 1 falls with an area of groundwater 
vulnerability designated as intermediate 1 (as stated within an 
Envirocheck report). This means that it is possible for the soils at this 
location to transmit a wide range of pollutants.  
9.8.31 
Although the bedrock principal aquifer is of high sensitivity, given its 
depth and protection afforded by overlying low permeability deposits 
along the majority of the route, there are not anticipated to be any 
impacts on the aquifer arising from the development of the proposed 
route corridor. It is unknown at this stage the exact Electrical 
Connection route within the width of the option, however there is the 
potential for the requirement of water crossings.   
9.8.32 
The construction of the Electrical Connection Compound will require a 
number of activities similar to those described for the construction of 
the Power Generation Plant, including large excavations. As such, it is 
likely that the construction of the Compound and the Electrical 
Connection in this location may have a number of significant and 
permanent impacts on these watercourses.

Operation 
9.8.33 
During Operation, the Electrical Connection itself will be buried and will 
therefore have no impact on Water Resources while water usage at the 
Electrical Connection Compound is expected to be minimal. 
9.8.34 
Construction of a permanent access route along the connection route 
will result in the generation of additional surface water runoff. However, 
this is likely to be minimal and would be controlled with an appropriately 
designed drainage system. 
9.8.35 
As such, the impact on water resources arising from the Operation of 
Electrical Connection Compound 1 and Electrical Connection 1 is 
considered to be negligible.  
Decommissioning 
9.8.36 
During decommissioning, it is not anticipated that there will be any 
material differences in the impacts on Water Resources from those 
described for the construction phase.  
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND ELECTRICAL 
CONNECTION OPTION 2 
Construction 
9.8.37 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 2 is also located in an area 
that contains a number of surface water features, although the number 
and density of these features is lower than those described for 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1.  
9.8.38 
Furthermore, Electrical Connection Route Option 2 would follow much 
of the same course as that of Option 1 on the east side of the A140. On 
the west if the A140, the current route corridor contains fewer surface 
water features than Electrical Connection Route Option 2. 
9.8.39 
Based on the preliminary assessment to date, it is anticipated that the 
impacts of Electrical Connection Route Option 2 will be similar to those 
described for Electrical Connection Route Option 1, but to a lesser 
extent due to the reduced number of water bodies. As such, it is 
anticipated that the same permits to work within close proximity to 
these water bodies will be obtained prior to commencement and that a 
WFD report will be required to be submitted with the proposed DCO 
application. 
9.8.40 
The impact on the underlying aquifer is expected to be similarly 
negligible, due to the same unproductive overlying strata.

There are not expected to be any material differences in the impacts on 
Water Resources during operation from those described for Electrical

Option 1.

Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
Power Generation Plant 
9.9.2 
During construction, mitigation measures would be covered by a 
CEMP. A draft of this document will be submitted as part of the 
proposed DCO Application.  
9.9.3 
Mitigation 
measures 
during 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning will include, as appropriate: 
ï¿½ 
Any surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons to be passed 
through oil/grit interceptors prior to discharge;  
ï¿½ 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any surface 
water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be allowed to 
enter directly or indirectly any water course, underground strata or 
adjoining land; 
ï¿½ 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water. Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with 
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts; 
ï¿½ 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted 
to a designated area with properly designed fuel tanks and bunds 
and suitable operating procedures.  
ï¿½ 
Siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to avoid 
pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working guidelines to 
avoid spillages near watercourses;

ï¿½ 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are 
stored will be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single tanks 
will be within bunds sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity and 
multiple tanks or drums will be within bunds sized to contain the 
greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the largest tank or 
25 per cent of the total tanks contents; and 
ï¿½ 
During operation, the EA will set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the site under the Environmental Permit. The need 
for any further, specific mitigation measures will be determined 
through the EIA process. 
9.9.4 
The British Standard Code of Practice for Earthworks BS 6031:2009 
contains detailed methods that should be considered for the general 
control of drainage on construction sites. Further advice is also 
available in the British Standard Code of Practice for Foundations 
BS 8004: 1986. These will be taken into account.  
Gas Connection Options 1 and 2 
9.9.5 
All proposed mitigation measures identified for the proposed Project will 
be considered for the construction and decommissioning periods of the 
Gas Connection depending on the findings of the final impact 
assessment to be completed for the full ES accompanying the 
proposed DCO Application. 
Electrical Connection Compound and Connections 1 & 2 
9.9.6 
All proposed mitigation measures identified for the proposed Project will

GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND AGRICULTURE 
10.1 
Introduction 
10.1.1 
This section of the PEIR provides a preliminary assessment of the likely 
significant effects on geology, ground conditions and agriculture that 
could result from the development of the proposed Project. It will also 
assess the likely significant effects of contamination (existing or 
created) on human health and sensitive ecological receptors. 
10.1.2 
This preliminary assessment considers the impacts of each element on 
the proposed Project, namely the Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1, Gas Connection Route Corridor 
Option 2, Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 and Electrical 
Connection Option 1 and Electrical Connection Compound Option 2 
and Electrical Connection Option 2.  
10.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements  
10.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. Specific considerations for 
fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the NPS for Fossil Fuel 
Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for Gas and Oil Pipelines 
(EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) provide specific 
considerations potentially relevant to the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound and Electrical Connection respectively. 
10.2.3 
The relevant assessment principles in terms of generic impacts 
(âBiodiversity and Geological Conservationâ and âLand Use including 
Open Space, Green Infrastructure and Green Beltâ and âWaste 
Managementâ) from Part 5 of NPS EN-1 (Generic Impacts) are set out 
below:

Under Applicantâs Assessment (Paragraphs 5.10.5 to 5.10.12): 
10.2.8 
âThe ES should identify existing and proposed land uses near the 
project, any effects of replacing an existing development or use of the 
site with the proposed project or preventing a development or use on a 
neighbouring site from continuing. Applicants should also assess any 
effects of precluding a new development or use proposed in the 
development plan.  
10.2.9 
Applicants will need to consult the local community on their proposals 
to building on open space, sports or recreational buildings and land. 
Taking account of the consultations, applicants should consider 
providing new or additional open space including green infrastructure, 
sport or recreation facilities to substitute for any losses as a result of 
their proposal. Applicants should use any up-to-date Local Authority 
assessment or, if there is none, provide an independent assessment to 
show whether the existing open space, sport and recreational buildings 
and land is surplus to requirements.  
10.2.10 
During any pre-application discussions with the applicant, the Local 
Planning Authority should identify any concerns it has about the 
impacts of the application on land use, having regard to the 
Development Plan and relevant applications and including, where 
relevant, whether it agrees with any independent assessment that the 
land is surplus to requirements.  
10.2.11 
Applicants should seek to minimise impacts on the best and most 
versatile agricultural land (defined as Grades 1, 2 and 3a of the 
Agricultural Land Classification) and preferably use land in area of 
poorer quality (Grades 3b, 4 and 5) except where this would be 
inconsistent with other sustainability considerations. Applicants should 
also identify any effects and seek to minimise impacts on soil quality 
taking 
into 
account 
any 
mitigation 
measures 
propose. 
For 
developments on previously developed land, applicants should ensure 
that they have considered the risk posed by land contamination.

10.2.12 
Applicants should safeguard any mineral resources on the proposed 
site as far as possible; taking into account the long-term potential of the 
land use after any future decommissioning has taken place.  
NPS EN-4: Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines 
10.2.13 
Section 2.23 of EN-4 discusses the potential impacts on soil and 
geology and recognises the importance of understanding the 
underlying soil conditions and geology. This section states that 
applicants should assess the stability of ground conditions via a 
desktop study and if necessary new borehole data. It also states that 
the assessment should cover options considered for installing pipelines 
and weigh up impacts of means of installation.  
Environmental Protection Act 1990 
10.2.14 
Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) 1990 deals with 
contaminated land. The contaminated land regime within Part 2A was 
first introduced in Wales on the 15th September 2001 and was inserted 
into the EPA 1990 by Section 57 of the Environment Act 1995. 
10.2.15 
The EPA 1990 defines contaminated land as âany land which appears 
to the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in such a 
condition, by reason of substance in, on or under the land, that â  
a) Significant harm is being caused or there is a significant possibility 
of such harm being caused; or  
b) B) Pollution of controlled waters is being or is likely to be caused.â 
10.2.16 
The contaminated land scheme provides guidance on what is 
considered to be contaminated land. Furthermore it requires the local 
enforcing authority to require remediation of this land and to identify the 
appropriate person to bear the responsibility for this.  
Other National and Local Policy 
10.2.17 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State (SoS) in the determination of energy 
NSIP. 
10.2.18 
The NPPF states (paragraph 120) that âto prevent unacceptable risks 
from pollution and land instability, planning policies and decisions 
should ensure that new development is appropriate for its location. The 
effects (including cumulative effects) of pollution on health, the natural 
environment or general amenity, and the potential sensitivity of the area 
or proposed development to adverse effects from pollution, should be

taken into account. Where a site is affected by contamination or land 
stability issues, responsibility for securing a safe development rests 
with the developer and/or landowner.â 
10.2.19 
Both local planning policies and decisions, under the direction of the 
NPPF, should ensure that the ground conditions of a proposed site are 
suitable for the proposed new use of that site. The NPPF states 
(paragraph 122) âlocal planning authorities should focus on whether the 
development itself is an acceptable use of the land, and the impact of 
the use, rather than the control of processes or emissions themselves 
where these are subject to approval under pollution control regimes. 
Local planning authorities should assume that these regimes will 
operate effectively.â 
10.2.20 
Remediation of contaminated land is required (paragraph 121), as a 
minimum, to be such that âland should not be capable of being 
determined as contaminated land under Part IIA of the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990.â  
10.2.21 
The Core Strategy of the Mid Suffolk LDF aims to set out the vision, 
objectives, spatial strategy and core policies that will guide 
development across the district until 2025 and beyond. The Core 
Strategy has 15 Core Objectives, the most relevant to this chapter is as 
follows: Core Strategy Objective 1 âto protect, manage, enhance and 
restore the landscape biodiversity and geodiversity of the district.â 
10.2.22 
The specific provisions relating to geology, ground contamination and 
agriculture within the Core Strategy and the saved policies of the Mid 
Suffolk Local Plan will be discussed in the final ES chapter and the 
separate Planning Statement that will be prepared to accompany the 
proposed DCO Application.  
10.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
10.3.1 
In respect of geology, ground conditions and agriculture, the project 
scenario that is considered the realistic worst case from within the 
proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 3 of the 
PEIR) are set out in Table 10.1 below.

The different options for the configuration of the Power Generation 
Plant outlined in Sections 3 and 4 of this PEIR have little bearing on the 
impact to geology, ground conditions and agriculture. Five separate 
units will have marginally more land take than a smaller number of 
units. However, as the Power Generation Site will need to be covered 
in hard standing regardless of the number of units, the impacts arising 
from the Power Generation Plant on geology, ground conditions and 
agriculture are similar for each potential configuration.  
10.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound is 
presented in this section. 
10.4 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
10.4.1 
Table 10.2 to Table 10.4 have been used to assess and attribute the 
importance of receptors and the significance criteria against which the 
magnitude of potential impacts from the proposed Project may have on 
soils, geology, hydrogeology and human health. In addition, a 
Conceptual Site Model (CSM) approach has been used to assess the 
risks posed by contaminants to human health using a source, pathway 
receptor model, based on the following: 
ï¿½ 
Source â potential source of contamination. 
ï¿½ 
Pathway â means by which contamination can reach and impact 
upon a receptor. 
ï¿½ 
Receptor â that which may be adversely affected by the presence 
of contamination.  
10.4.2 
The baseline geological, hydrological and hydrogeological conditions of 
the proposed site have been assessed with reference to the following: 
ï¿½ 
Landmark Envirocheck Report â which includes the following:  
ï¿½ Groundwater Vulnerability Map;  
ï¿½ Historical plans; 
ï¿½ Details of discharge and waste consents, contaminated land 
sites and areas of sensitive land use etc.; and 
ï¿½ Geological and mining hazards.

Standards and Guidance  
10.4.3 
The following standards and guidance have been consulted to provide 
advice on best practice mitigation measures which will be employed 
during the construction phase of the proposed Project and the correct 
methods of assessment of potentially contaminated sites.  
10.4.4 
BS 6031 (2009) provides best practice guidance on geotechnical 
aspects of earthworks and on working practices. The standard also 
includes recommendations and guidance for un-reinforced earthworks 
forming part of general civil engineering construction, together with 
provisions for temporary excavations such as trenches and pits.  
10.4.5 
Technical guidance relating to land contamination is presented in a 
series of documents known as the Contaminated Land Report (CLRs 1 
to 6 and 11) published by the EA. The guidance promotes a tiered 
approach to the assessment of contamination and associated risks. 
The baseline conditions of the Project Site have been assessed with 
specific reference to CLR 11: Model Procedures for the Management of 
Land Contamination (2004).

Embedded Design Mitigation 
10.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and industry 
standard methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction, 
operation and decommissioning are minimised. In respect of geology, 
ground conditions and agriculture, such mitigation could include: 
ï¿½ 
Minimising land take where possible;  
ï¿½ 
Avoiding the need for piled foundations where possible; and 
ï¿½ 
Design the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection to follow field 
boundaries as much as possible to reduce the loss of agricultural 
land. 
10.5.2 
The assessment in this section takes such design mitigation into 
account. Any additional mitigation developed in response to specific 
impacts identified in this assessment is described in Section 10.9 
below.

detail the extent of the study area, ensuring that the impacts are 
considered over a sufficiently wide area and provide the reasons 
to justify this. 
The details of this assessment will

The SoS refers the applicant to the comments raised by the EA 
and the need for early engagement with them. The SoS notes that 
the ES will need to address ground conditions and contaminated 
land fully and the approach to the assessment should be agreed in 
consultation with the EA. 
Engagement with the EA was 
established prior to the issue of the

The section recognises the potential for sterilisation of agricultural 
ground in the connection corridors. This also applies of course to 
the main site and in both locations the quality of the land lost 
should be described. 
A preliminary assessment of the 
impact on agricultural land has been 
provided in this chapter and further 
details will be provided in the ES. 
81 
The ES should clarify the depth of soil that will remain above any 
buried cables and pipes and so available for agricultural operations. 
The depths of both the underground 
pipeline and cabling will be clarified

Although it is stated that the pipe depth will be âat least 1.1 mâ for 
the gas pipe (3.4.10) (not described for underground cables), it is 
important to understand the depth of soil that will be available for 
cultivation and if this will be sufficient to facilitate all normal arable 
operations such as sub-soiling. 
in the final ES chapter once the 
routes have been refined. 
82 
If the soil above cables/pipes is not available for these deeper 
arable operations, this may impact on arable farming operations 
(including through land sterilisation), and consequently result in 
landscape change. The impacts of undergrounding on soil 
conditions (soil structure and field drainage) more generally should 
also be considered. 
There is a possibility that a small 
amount of agricultural land may be 
sterilised. The actual amount will be 
quantified and mitigation measures 
proposed in the ES when the 
preferred route has been defined. 
83 
As EN-1 notes (5.10.23), where a Project has a sterilising effect on 
land use there may be scope for this to be mitigated through, for 
example, using or incorporating the land for nature conservation or 
wildlife corridors or uses ancillary to the development, for example 
access (vehicular or non-motorised users). 
Such opportunities will be 
considered in full in the ES once the 
routes have been defined.

The ES should be clear about the possible implications of buried 
pipes and cables on future agricultural activities available to mitigate 
any potential loss of productive land. 
There is a possibility that a small 
amount of agricultural land may be 
sterilised. The actual amount will be 
quantified and mitigation measures

In view of the former WW2 use of the site the investigation for 
potential contaminants should be extended to include munitions. 
This has not been included within 
the PEIR section however the full 
ES investigation will include 
munitions and potential for un 
exploded ordinance.

HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE (HSE) 
Major 
Hazard 
Installations 
This application falls within the Consultation Distance of a Major 
Hazard Site and two Major Accident Hazard Pipelines. In line with 
PADHI+ guidance we would advise against features that are more 
than 3 occupied storeys or allowed occupation by 100 or more 
workers. Based on the information contained in the EIA scoping 
report, it seems likely that the occupied buildings forming part of the 
proposal would not meet the above criteria, so would not meet the 
criteria for HSE to advise against. 
It can be confirmed, in line with the 
scoping report, that the 
development will not meet the 
criteria of the HSE for the HSE to 
advise against. 
Hazardous 
Substances 
Consent 
The presence on, over or above land of certain hazardous 
substances, at or above set threshold quantities (Controlled 
Quantities), may require Hazardous Substances Consent (HSC) 
under the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990 as 
amended. The substances, alone or when aggregated with others, 
for which HSC is required, and the associated Controlled 
Quantities, are set out in The Planning (Hazardous Substances) 
regulations 1992 as amended particularly by The Planning 
(Hazardous Substances) (Amendment) (England) regulations 2009 
and 2010, as well as Planning (Control of Major Accident Hazards) 
Regulations 1999. 
It is not anticipated that Hazardous 
Substances Consent will be 
required as no substances listed in 
Schedule 1 of these Regulations will 
be used or stored on-site. 
 
 
Hazardous Substances consent would be required if the site is 
intending to store or use any of the Named Hazardous Substances 
or Categories of Substances and Preparations at or above the

Soil and 
agricultural 
land quality 
Impacts from the development should be considered in light of the 
Governmentâs policy for the protection of the best and most versatile 
(MWV) agricultural land as set out in paragraph 112 of the NPPF. 
We also recommend that soils should be considered under a more 
general heading of sustainable use of land and the ecosystem 
services they provide as a natural resource in line with parapgraph 
109 of the NPPF. 
An overall consideration of soils is 
provided within this preliminary 
information and a more detailed 
discussion will be provided within 
the ES. 
 
Soil is a finite resource that fulfils manyimportant functions and 
services (ecosystem services) for society, for example as a growing 
medium for food, timber and other crops, as a store for carbon and 
water, as a reservoir of biodiversity and as a buffer against pollution. 
It is therefore important that the soil resources are protected and 
used sustainably. 
Details of how impacts on soil will 
be mitigated will be provided in full 
in the ES. 
 
The applicant should consider the following issues as part of the 
Environmental Statement: 
The degree to which soils are going to be disturbed/harmed as part 
of this development and whether âbest and most versatileâ 
agricultural land is involved. This may require a detailed survey if 
one is not already available. For further information on the

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
10.7.1 
This section comprises the results of a desk-based assessment (DBA) 
of information pertinent to geology, ground contamination and 
agriculture. As part of the full EIA process a more detailed DBA will be 
carried out, along with further assessments including but not limited to 
a site walkover.  
Site History 
10.7.2 
A review of Ordnance Survey historical mapping data contained within 
the Envirocheck report dated from the late 1890s to the present day 
has been undertaken. The results are as follows. 
10.7.3 
In the late 1880s to early 1900s the Power Generation Plant site and its 
immediate surrounds were undeveloped agricultural land divided by 
field boundaries comprising of scrub and belts of trees. An area of 
isolated woodland, the Yaxley Plantation, also appeared. The area 
remained unchanged throughout the 1920s until the late 1930s and 
early 1940s. In this period clusters of cottages appear in the 
surrounding area: the Kilncommon Cottages and the Potash Cottages. 
10.7.4 
In the 1950s a development appears to the north of Potash Lane which 
borders the north of the Power Generation Plant site. A disused airfield 
is also labelled on the historical maps, suggesting that an airfield was in 
use at this location during the 1940s. This airfield is known to be the 
Eye Airfield, which was used by the United States Army Air Force Eight 
Air Force 490th Bombardment Group.  
10.7.5 
In the 1970s a building appears to the north west of the site boundary, 
this is labelled as Mill Mushroom Farm. In the 1980s developments had 
appeared to the north, east and south and by the 2000s all boundaries 
of the Power Generation Plant site were defined and no further 
changes have occurred since that time other than the erection of two 
130 m wind turbines located to the west of the Power Generation Plant 
site.  The Power Generation Plant site itself remains agricultural land 
forming part of the Airfield, which is noted in the Core Strategy as 
previously developed land. 
Landscape and Topography 
10.7.6 
The whole of the proposed Project Site is comprised of relatively flat 
low lying land at approximately 45 m AOD (Above Ordnance Datum). 
The land is mainly covered by agricultural land, and that on which the 
proposed Power Generation Plant would be situated is classified as 
Grade 3 under the Agricultural Land Classification (ALC). This land is 
classified as being of âgood to moderate qualityâ.

10.7.7 
The remainder of the agricultural land within the Project Site is 
unclassified by the ALC. However, a site visit has shown that this land 
is currently used for agricultural purposes and therefore has an intrinsic 
value and fertility. Additionally, a portion of land to the west of the 
Power Generation Plant area outside of the Project Site is classified as 
ALC Grade 3 i.e. good to moderate quality agricultural land. It can 
therefore be inferred that the land over which the Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound will cross is 
of a similar quality.  
Geology and Soils 
10.7.8 
The soils in the area are classified as being slowly permeable 
seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils. They 
have impeded drainage (i.e. a low leaching potential) and have a 
moderate fertility.  
10.7.9 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial 
geology underlying the proposed Project Site is composed of Diamicton 
(Lowestoft Formation), while the underlying hard rock geology is 
characteristic of peat, sand and gravel and calcerous tufa. The 
Envirocheck report states that the bedrock geology is made up of 
Norwich Crag (previously Chillesford Clay), and Red Crag.  
10.7.10 
Norwich Crag is mainly unfossiliferous pale grey silty clay, with rare 
sand laminae. The deposit is bioturbated and burrowed. It locally 
contains shell debris. The deposit is thought to have formed on 
intertidal mudflats and is around 6 m thick. The formation 
unconformably overlies the Red Crag Formation. This is coarse-
grained, poorly sorted, cross-bedded abundantly shelly sand. It is dark 
green and glauconitic when unoxidised, but typically oxidised to yellow 
or reddish brown with ferruginous concretions. Basal bed of rounded 
flint pebbles. Onshore it is commonly 20 m thick.  
10.7.11 
According to the BGS Lexicon the Lowestoft Formation is an extensive 
sheet of chalky till, together with outwash sands and gravels, silts and 
clays. The till is characterised by chalk and flint content. The thickness 
of the till is extremely variable and is at its thickest in buried valleys it 
can be up to 60 m.  
10.7.12 
The bedrock of the proposed Project Site is classified as a Principal 
Aquifer. The aquifer has a very low vulnerability to pollutants given the 
low leaching potential of the soils overlying the Project Site. The 
superficial deposits at the Project Site are also unproductive strata with 
low permeability.

10.7.13 
BGS maps indicate that the superficial and hard rock geology 
underlying the two Gas Connection options and the two Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound options is the same 
as that underlying the Power Generation Plant. 
Contamination

Historical landfill sites, licensed waste management facilities, local 
authority recorded landfill sites, registered waste transfer sites, 
registered treatment or disposal sites, control of major accident hazards 
sites, notifications of installations handling hazardous substances and 
planning hazardous substance consents are noted within the 
Envirocheck report.

Key past and present developments in the vicinity of the proposed 
Project that could have had an impact on geology and ground 
contamination include: 
ï¿½ 
Former Eye Airfield runways and fuel storage facilities within the 
disused airfield; 
ï¿½ 
The existing 12.7 MW Eye Chicken Litter Power Plant located 
immediately to the north of the proposed Power Generation Plant 
site. 
10.7.17 
Due to the presence of the former Eye Airfield it is possible that 
unknown unexploded ordnances / munitions may be present. The 
likelihood of this occurrence is not known at this stage however this will 
be assessed further in the full ES.

Table 10.7 below, is a tabular representation of a CSM. The CSM is a 
representation of the potential pollutant linkages for the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the proposed Project. 
10.8.2 
The table details that the potential sources of contamination on site 
include historical sources, off-site sources which could leach onto the 
site and existing contaminants of unknown composition which are 
already present.  
10.8.3 
 Potential receptors include the soil and construction workers and 
potential pathways to these receptors include leaching in surface water, 
dermal contact and inhalation of airborne contaminants.

The table above is useful to show the potential pollutant linkages. 
However, it does not predict the likelihood of their occurrence. It is 
anticipated that there is a very minimal risk that any of the pathways 
listed in the table above will be created. This is explored in further detail 
below. The existing installations and the proposed Project are 
anticipated to incorporate best available techniques (BAT) with regards 
to contaminant containment therefore potential contaminants are 
unlikely to be leached into the soil. Existing unknown contaminants are 
unlikely to reach the principal aquifer via a preferential pathway 
provided by piled foundations as overlying the aquifer is unproductive 
strata of approximately 17 m in depth. The depths of any onsite piling 
will not reach 17 m. With regards to historic contamination due to the 
former Eye Airfield, it is anticipated that since the Airfield was 
decommissioned in the 1960s all unexploded ordnances will have been 
discovered and appropriately disposed of by this date, but this will be 
checked with the use on an unexploded ordinance survey to be 
included in the ES.

10.9 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
POWER GENERATION PLANT 
Construction  
10.9.2 
During construction works, the main impact on ground conditions and 
from contamination arising from construction activities will be due to: 
ï¿½ 
Disturbance of existing contamination and the creation of pathways 
to receptors; 
ï¿½ 
Creation of pollution incidents through e.g. improperly maintained 
equipment;  
ï¿½ 
Loss of usable agricultural land; and 
ï¿½ 
Disturbance to or loss of important deposits of geology and soils.  
10.9.3 
When assessing the potential impacts relating to the construction of the 
Power Generation Plant, it has been assumed that several confirmed 
mitigation measures will be applied. These include: working in 
accordance with best practices, maintaining safe working practices and 
the use of correct and appropriate Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE). The confirmed mitigation measures are assumed to be 
implemented at all times throughout the construction phase.  
10.9.4 
Accordingly, the confirmed mitigation measures will adhere to the 
following documents: 
ï¿½ 
Protection of Workers and the General Public during the 
Development of Contaminated Land (HSE, 1991); and 
ï¿½ 
A Guide to Safe Working on Contaminated Sites, R132 (CIRIA, 
1996). 
10.9.5 
During construction, the existing soil conditions are not anticipated to 
negatively impact upon construction workers. Potential impacts to 
health (arising from oral, inhalation or dermal contact with potential 
contaminants in the soil) are negated by the implementation of the 
confirmed mitigation measures at all times.  
10.9.6 
Assuming the implementation of the above mitigation measures 
construction is considered to represent an impact of minor significance 
to human health. 
10.9.7 
The agricultural land is classed as provisional grade 3 i.e. 
good/moderate, therefore the Power Generation Plant will result in the 
sterilisation of up to 10 Ha of agricultural land within the Power 
Generation Plant site. It is important to note that ALCs are sweeping

classifications given to large areas therefore they may not necessarily 
accurate on a site-scale.  
10.9.8 
The construction of deep foundations (e.g. piled foundations on to 
bedrock) could offer a preferential pathway for contaminants to impact 
upon groundwater bodies beneath the Power Generation Plant Site. 
However, the depth of the bedrock which is classified as a principal 
aquifer is approximately 17 m based on BGS borehole logs from 
around the area of the Power Generation Plant site. As such, this is 
well below the depth of any foundations that will be required for the 
construction of the Power Generation Plant and thus the potential to 
create a pathway to the underlying Aquifer is considered negligible. As 
such, the impact on this aquifer is also considered negligible. 
Operation 
10.9.9 
During operation there will be no further disruption to the underlying 
geology and soils of the Power Generation Site, although there will be 
permanent sterilisation of the agricultural land for the duration of the 
proposed Project's operational life. 
Decommissioning 
10.9.10 
The impacts during decommissioning will be temporary and in line with 
those described above for construction. 
10.9.11 
The concrete foundations will likely be left in the ground after 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant and it is common for 
concrete foundations to remain in-situ for many years following 
decommissioning of sites. The environmental impact of this is predicted 
to be negligible as the foundations will be constructed of an appropriate 
grade of concrete to resist degradation from the soils and groundwater. 
The remaining ground will be reinstated back to its original condition 
(before the proposed Project was commissioned) with suitably clean 
topsoil and vegetation cover, where appropriate, and no significant 
residual impacts are anticipated.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
Construction 
10.9.12 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 crosses developed land 
immediately south of the Diss Compressor Station. The land along 
which the connection will travel is typically flat and around 45 m AOD.  
10.9.13 
Potential sources of contamination arise from the presence of the Diss 
Compressor Station, where integrated pollution controls and integrated

pollution prevention controls are identified on Envirocheck mapping 
data at this location. The main activity listed within these controls is 
combustion. It is anticipated that the onsite combustion activities 
provide energy for the compression of natural gas for transport. It is 
anticipated that combustion at the Diss Compressor Station would have 
no impacts on the geology and soils in this area. Minimal impacts on 
soil may arise from the deposition of any airborne pollutants released 
by the combustion process.  
10.9.14 
The soils and underlying geology along this route corridor are the same 
as those identified below the Power Generation Plant site. However, 
this land is not used for agricultural purposes and thus there would be 
no loss of agricultural land as a result of this proposed Gas Connection 
option.  
10.9.15 
Furthermore, the depth of excavations for the construction of the Gas 
Connection is likely to be to a depth of approximately 1.5 m, well above 
the underlying groundwater aquifer. As such, with the use to best 
practice construction techniques, the risk of creating a pathway to this 
receptor is considered to be low and the impact is considered 
negligible.  
10.9.16 
There are not anticipated to be any impacts related to the geology 
along this Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1. There will be 
temporary soil disturbance due to construction, however as the land is 
not used for agricultural purposes this will not result in any sterilisation.  
Operation 
10.9.17 
As the Gas Connection would be a buried pipeline, once operational, 
the pipeline will have no impacts on the surrounding geology, ground 
conditions or agriculture.  
10.9.18 
There will be a permanent easement around the pipeline which would 
be expected to be approximately 10m wide, resulting in the permanent 
sterilisation of a narrow corridor around the field boundary.  
10.9.19 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1 would have negligible impacts on 
the geology and ground conditions.  
Decommissioning 
10.9.20 
Following the decommissioning of the plant, it is anticipated that the 
Gas Connection pipe will be left in-situ, as removal of the pipe would 
cause more environmental disruption than leaving it in place

10.9.21 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1 would have negligible impacts on 
the geology, ground conditions and agriculture of the area during 
decommissioning.  
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 2 
Construction 
10.9.22 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 would follow the edges of 
agricultural fields around the industrial estate and along the A140. This 
land is classified as grade 3 agricultural land which means it is of âgood 
to moderate qualityâ. The land along which the connection will travel is 
typically flat and around 45 m AOD.  
10.9.23 
There are no known potential sources of contamination at this location 
including for example hazardous substance discharge consents, 
authorised landfill or historic landfill sites.  
10.9.24 
The soils in the area are classified as being slowly permeable 
seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils. They 
have impeded drainage (i.e. a low leaching potential) and have a 
moderate fertility.  
10.9.25 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the geology 
underlying the route is the same as that underlying the Power 
Generation Plant and Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 as 
described above. 
10.9.26 
As such, there are not anticipated to be any impacts related to the 
geology in respect of this option. However, there will be temporary soil 
disturbance due to construction of the Gas Connection leading to the 
temporary sterilisation of good to medium quality agricultural land 
across an approximately 30 â 50m wide corridor around the edge of the 
fields.  
Operation 
10.9.27 
As the Gas Connection would be a buried pipeline, once operational, 
the pipeline will have no impacts on the surrounding geology or ground 
conditions.  
10.9.28 
There will be a permanent easement around the pipeline which would 
be expected to be approximately 10m wide, resulting in the permanent 
sterilisation of a narrow corridor around the field boundary.  
10.9.29 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 2 would have negligible impacts on

the geology and ground conditions and moderate impacts on 
agriculture through the sterilisation of agricultural land during operation. 
Decommissioning 
10.9.30 
Following the decommissioning of the plant, it is anticipated that the 
Gas Connection pipe will be left in-situ, as removal of the pipe would 
cause more environmental disruption than leaving it in place.  
10.9.31 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 2 would have negligible impacts on 
the 
geology 
and 
ground 
conditions. 
Once 
the 
pipeline 
is 
decommissioned, the permanent easement is likely to be removed, 
meaning that the land sterilised during operation may be reinstated. As 
such, the decommissioning of Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
would have a negligible impact in agriculture. 
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND ELECTRICAL 
CONNECTION OPTION 1 
Construction 
10.9.32 
The land along which the connection would lie and the Electrical 
Connection Compound would be located is typically flat agricultural 
land that is classified as grade 3 which means it is of âgood to moderate 
qualityâ.  
10.9.33 
Historical ordnance survey maps from the late 1800s onwards show 
that this area has been arable agricultural since this time, therefore 
there is little potential for ground contamination.  
10.9.34 
There are no known potential sources of contamination at this location 
including for example hazardous substance discharge consents, 
authorised landfill and historic landfill sites etc.  
10.9.35 
The soils in the area are classified as being slowly permeable 
seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils. They 
have impeded drainage (i.e. a low leaching potential) and have a 
moderate fertility.  
10.9.36 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the geology 
underlying the route is the same as that underlying the Power 
Generation Plant and Gas Connection Route Corridors described 
above. 
10.9.37 
There are not anticipated to be any impacts related to the geology in 
respect of this option.. However, there will be temporary soil 
disturbance due to construction leading to the temporary sterilisation of

good to medium quality agricultural land along the length of the 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor and the area of the Electrical 
Connection Compound.  
Operation 
10.9.38 
During operation there will be no further disruption to the underlying 
geology and soils of the site along the Electrical Connection Route 
Corridor, although there will be permanent sterilisation of the 
agricultural land upon which the Electrical Connection Compound is 
constructed, and along the access route which will likely follow the path 
of the connection for the duration of the projects operational life. 
10.9.39 
There will also be a permanent easement along the Electrical 
Connection which would be expected to be approximately 10m wide, 
resulting in the sterilisation of a narrow corridor around field boundaries 
(the exact route and impact to be confirmed and quantified in the ES).  
10.9.40 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Electrical 
Connection Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1 would have 
negligible impacts on geology and ground conditions and moderate 
impacts on agriculture through the temporary sterilisation of agricultural 
land during operation. 
Decommissioning 
10.9.41 
The impacts during decommissioning would likely be temporary and in 
line with those described above for construction. 
10.9.42 
The concrete foundations of the Electrical Connection Compound 
would likely be left in the ground after decommissioning and it is 
common for concrete foundations to remain in-situ for many years 
following decommissioning of sites. The environmental impact of this is 
predicted to be negligible as the foundations will be constructed of an 
appropriate grade of concrete to resist degradation from the soils and 
groundwater. The remaining ground will be reinstated back to its 
original condition (before the proposed Project was commissioned) with 
suitably clean topsoil and vegetation cover, where appropriate and no 
significant residual impacts are anticipated.  
10.9.43 
It is anticipated that the electrical cable would be left in-situ, as its 
removal would likely cause more environmental disruption than leaving 
it in place.  
10.9.44 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that 
decommissioning of Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection Option 1 would have negligible impacts on the geology and

ground conditions of the area. Once the electrical cable was 
decommissioned, the permanent easement would likely to be removed, 
meaning that the land sterilised during operation may be reinstated. As 
such, its dimensioning would have a negligible impact in agriculture. 
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND ELECTRICAL 
CONNECTION OPTION 2 
Construction, Operation and Decommissioning 
10.9.45 
Given the similar site conditions and similar length of the potential 
connection route, there are not anticipated to be any material 
differences between the impacts on geology, ground conditions and 
agriculture between Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection Option 2 and those described above for Electrical 
Connection Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1. 
10.10 
Potential Mitigation / Measures Techniques 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction 
10.10.2 
The construction of the Power Generation Plant has the potential to 
create impacts relating to human health and groundwater quality. 
However, providing that the confirmed mitigation measures are 
adhered to, as well as more specific measures, as set out below, no 
significant impacts is anticipated. 
10.10.3 
During construction, mitigation measures would be covered by the 
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) which will apply 
to each of the key elements of the proposed Project. The CEMP will 
incorporate appropriate mitigation measures that will be approved by 
the relevant authorities and adopted, such that it would be unlikely that 
any impacts would arise during construction. The CEMP will be 
secured by a requirement attached to the DCO.  
10.10.4 
Embedded mitigation measures will include adherence to good practice 
guidelines and could involve, for example, 
ï¿½ 
Dust suppression measures; 
ï¿½ 
Any additional soil materials that are to be imported to the sites will 
be required to have certification of their chemical concentrations to 
ensure that contaminative materials are not being introduced to the 
area;  
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

- 291 - 
 
ï¿½ 
In order to further limit disturbance, the site access tracks will be 
constructed first to allow movement of vehicles around the site on 
areas of soft-standing;  
ï¿½ 
Any vegetation, topsoil and subsoil will be removed to expose a 
suitable sub-grade. Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for 
reuse will be stockpiled on impermeable liners.  
ï¿½ 
Soils which are to be reused onsite will be tested for contamination 
and geotechnical suitability. This will form part of a site waste 
management plan (SWMP) which will be drafted prior to 
construction and will focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of 
waste spoil.  
ï¿½ 
Surface water, perched waters or groundwater from dewatering 
operations will not be discharged to surface water or foul or surface 
water drains without the appropriate consents from the local water 
or sewage company and / or the EA.  
ï¿½ 
The disposal of this effluent will be the responsibility of the 
contractor. If necessary, this water will be tankered off-site for 
disposal at a suitable facility;  
ï¿½ 
All foundations will be appropriately specified to resist chemical 
attack from soils or groundwater; and 
ï¿½ 
Foundations will also be designed so as not to present a 
preferential pathway for contaminant migration, if present at the 
Power Generation Plant site.  
10.10.5 
Further, specific mitigation measures could include, for example, 
remediation of the site, removal of contamination hotspots or further 
site characterisation and will be determined during the EIA and set out 
in the ES to be submitted with the proposed DCO Application for the 
proposed Project.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
10.10.6 
Embedded mitigation measures for the Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connections, and Electrical Connection Compound are likely to be the 
same as for the Power Generation Plant. 
Operation 
10.10.7 
As there will be no likely significant effects on the geology or soils at the 
site no mitigation measures are anticipated to be necessary during the 
operation of the proposed Project.

Decommissioning 
10.10.8 
A decommissioning plan will be prepared in compliance with best 
practice, 12 months prior to decommissioning, or as agreed with MSDC 
and the EA.  
10.10.9 
Mitigation measures implemented during decommissioning will be 
similar to those implemented during construction. 
10.10.10 
Dust suppression measures will be put in place to minimise dust 
generation on the site and surrounding environment.  
10.10.11 
Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for reuse will be stockpiled on 
impermeable liners. Any additional materials that are to be exported 
from the Project Site will be required to have certification of their 
chemical concentrations to ensure that contaminative materials are not 
being introduced to the area.  
10.10.12 
The Project Site will be reinstated (as far as is reasonably possible) to 
its former use. Clean topsoil and turf will be imported where necessary 
and the site will be re graded. 
10.11 
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Impacts 
10.11.1 
On the basis of the preliminary environmental information available to 
date and assessment described above, taking into account potential 
mitigation measures, there are not predicted to be likely significant 
effects on geology, ground conditions and agriculture as a result of the 
proposed Project. This position will be further assessed and confirmed 
in the ES.

LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL IMPACT  
11.1 
Introduction 
11.1.1 
This section of the PEIR presents the baseline and methodology for the 
preliminary assessment of potential landscape and visual impacts 
arising from the development of the proposed Project. 
11.1.2 
Some key features of the proposed Project have the potential to 
produce direct and indirect impacts on the landscape resource and on 
visual receptors during construction, operation and decommissioning. 
Effects on the landscape include physical changes to the landscape as 
well as changes to landscape character. Effects on the landscape may 
also include effects on areas designated for their scenic or landscape 
qualities at a national, regional or local policy level. Effects on visual 
amenity relate to changes to views, and the appearance and 
prominence of the development in those views. 
11.1.3 
The preliminary assessment has been prepared after a preliminary site 
visit covering the immediate 
surroundings and 
extending 
to 
approximately 10 km from the Project Site. Further site surveys for the 
full landscape and visual impact assessment (LVIA) for the ES to be 
submitted with the proposed DCO Application are being undertaken 
and will cover the study area as defined below. 
11.1.4 
The location of the Project Site and the LVIA study area is shown on 
Figure 11.1, Site Location and Study Area. Areas within the 15 km 
radius study area with minimum predicted visibility, i.e. where there is 
no likelihood of significant effects, including effects on landscape 
character types, designations, viewpoints, settlements or routes have 
been âscoped outâ of the assessment. 
11.1.5

11.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
11.2.1 
The following legislation, planning policy and planning guidance are 
relevant to landscape aspects of the Project:  
Legislation  
11.2.2 
The European Landscape Convention became binding in 2007 and is 
the first international convention to focus specifically on landscape 
issues in order to protect, manage and plan landscapes in Europe. This 
has not resulted in any new UK legislation.  
11.2.3 
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a statutory 
framework for statutorily protected landscapes and introduced an 
additional right of access requiring the identification of Open Access 
Land 
National Policy Statements 
11.2.4 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
landscape and visual impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. 
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
11.2.5 
National policy seeks to protect and enhance environmental quality 
specifically for new energy infrastructure through NPS EN-1 and 
through EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5. EN-1 recognises that Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Projects will have effects on the landscape 
and that the scale of such Projects means they will be visible within 
many miles of the site of the proposed infrastructure.  
11.2.6 
Section 5.9 of NPS EN-1, Landscape and Visual, requires, âThe 
applicantâs assessment to include effects during construction of the 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

Project and the effects of the completed development and its operation 
on landscape components and character. The assessment should 
include the visibility and conspicuousness of the Project during 
construction and of the presence and operation of the Project and 
potential impacts on views and visual amenity. This should include light 
pollution effects, including on local amenity and nature conservationâ. 
11.2.7 
With regard to landscape impacts NPS EN-1 states, âLandscape effects 
depend on the existing character of the local landscape, its current 
quality, how highly it is valued and its capacity to accommodate 
change. All of these factors need to be considered in judging the impact 
of a Project on landscape. Virtually all Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Projects will have effects on landscape. Projects need to 
be designed carefully, taking account of the potential impact on the 
landscape. Having regard to siting, operational and other relevant 
constraints the aim should be to minimise harm to the landscape, 
providing reasonable mitigation where possible and appropriate.â 
11.2.8 
With reference to visual impact NPS EN-1 states, âAll proposed energy 
infrastructure is likely to have visual effects for many receptors around 
proposed sites. The [Secretary of State] will have to judge whether the 
visual effects on sensitive receptors â¦.. outweigh the benefits of the 
Project. The [Secretary of State] should ensure applicants have taken 
into account the landscape and visual impacts of visible plumes from 
chimney stacks and / or cooling assemblyâ. 
11.2.9 
Guidance is given in relation to mitigation, such as at paragraph 5.9.22 
of NPS EN-1: âwithin a defined site, adverse landscape and visual 
effects may be minimised through appropriate siting of infrastructure 
within that site, design including colours and materials, and landscaping 
schemes, depending on the size and type of proposed Project. 
Materials and designs of buildings should always be given careful 
consideration.â  
11.2.10 
At section 4.5 of NPS EN-1, and paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2, the 
importance of good design is set out in respect of landscape and visual 
(as well as other) considerations.  
Other National and Local Policy 
11.2.11 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPSs, 
other national and local planning policy can be considered important 
and relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
11.2.12 
Paragraph 56 of the NPPF states that, âThe Government attaches great 
importance to the design of the built environment. Good design is a key

aspect of sustainable development, is indivisible from good planning, 
and should contribute positively to making places better for people.â  
11.2.13 
The integration of new development into the existing landscape is 
noted in paragraph 61 of the NPPF which states, âAlthough visual 
appearance and the architecture of individual buildings are very 
important factors, securing high quality and inclusive design goes 
beyond aesthetic considerations. Therefore, planning policies and 
decisions should address the connections between people and places 
and the integration of new development into the natural, built and 
historic environment.â 
11.2.14 
NPPF paragraph 109 requires the planning system to enhance the 
natural and local environment by, âprotecting and enhancing valued 
landscapes, geological conservation interests and soils.â 
Local Plan Policies 
11.2.15 
As to local policy, the proposed Project site lies within the area covered 
by the MSDC LDF. Local planning documents contained in the LDF 
most relevant to the LVIA are the Core Strategy DPD (adopted 
September 2008) and the EADF. Core Strategy Objective SO 1, 
requires proposed development should protect, manage, enhance and 
restore landscape, biodiversity and geodiversity of the District. Core 
Strategy 
Policy 
CS5 
Mid 
Suffolkâs 
Environment, 
states, 
âAll 
development will maintain and enhance the environment, including the 
historic environment, and retain the local distinctiveness of the areaâ. 
Specifically in respect of landscape the policy states, âThe Council will 
protect and conserve landscape qualities taking into account the 
natural environment and the historical dimension of the landscape as a 
whole rather than concentrating solely on selected areas, protecting the 
Districtâs most important components and encourage development that 
is consistent with conserving its overall characterâ. 
Local Guidance Documents 
11.2.16 
The MSDC emerging EADF (February 2013), whilst not formally 
adopted as a LDF document, comprises several documents that 
provide detailed guidance and up to date contextual information for 
many aspects of the design and siting of development. With reference 
to landscape character assessment (at paragraph 3.8) it states, âthe 
SCC (SCC) landscape character assessment has informed our initial 
site analysis and the development brief recommendation that the 
development should be landscape-led for this particular environment, 
so that the wider areaâs character integrity can be maintained and 
enhanced in new developmentâ. (bold in original document).

11.2.17 
The EADF Landscape Appraisal and Strategy Document (2162-D10_C) 
provides several recommendations that should be taken into 
consideration in new development. Specifically, it advises developers, 
âAdvance planting of the structural belts is part of the strategy so that 
the mitigation of development is effective at an earlier time, and in 
certain areas there would also be a restriction on building heightsâ.  
11.2.18 
Drawing number 2162/D10, titled Landscape Strategy, illustrates where 
structure planting would be required throughout Eye Airfield. With 
regard to the proposed site (Development Area 8), linear woodland and 
shelter belt planting is proposed to reinforce landscape character and 
provide new wildlife habitats along the northern, southern and western 
boundaries.  
11.2.19 
EADF document, Draft Baseline Landscape Appraisal, Lloydbore Ltd 
(December 2011), provides further guidance to protect the landscape 
and visual qualities of the airfield in the context of potential future 
development through design codes. The following design codes are 
relevant to the proposed development: 
ï¿½ 
Paragraph 6.17 notes the former airstrips are unique and significant 
historical features that should be retained and emphasised by 
green structure including hedgerows, tree belts and surface water 
attenuation. This guidance would apply to the southern and 
western boundaries of the development site, which adjoin two 
former airstrips. 
ï¿½ 
Paragraphs 6.20 - 6.21 note the potential prominence of chimneys, 
flues and other tall vertical elements on the skyline, and the need 
for sensitive planning, siting and design to reduce adverse impact 
on the landscape and its visual qualities. Design issues concerning 
the colour, finishes, orientation and scale of new industrial 
structures should be designed to minimise landscape impact. 
Consideration should be given to the use of recessive colours and 
matt finishes that would be less eye catching and less prominent in 
the landscape. 
ï¿½ 
Paragraph 6.22 notes the planning authorityâs requirement for a 
landscape and visual assessment to be undertaken in accordance 
with current best practice to support proposed development of this 
type. 
11.2.20 
SCCâs advice note âPlanting New Woodlands Protecting Archaeology & 
Landscape Characterâ provides guidance for the design of woodland 
planting in order to protect landscape character, historic landscape 
features and archaeological sites.

11.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
11.3.1 
In respect of landscape and visual effects, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed project parameters (which are 
described in Section 3 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 11.1 below.  
11.3.2 
The reason that the parameters identified in Table 11.1 represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to landscape and visual effects are: 
ï¿½ 
Larger stack heights increase the likelihood of visual impact; and 
ï¿½ 
Greater number of stacks increases the likelihood of visual impact. 
11.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound is 
presented in this section.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
The Scope of the Assessment 
11.4.2 
The purpose of the LVIA is to describe and evaluate separately 
potential landscape and visual effects that would arise from the 
proposed Project. It is an iterative process; and for the purpose of this 
assessment, impacts that are assessed as being either moderately 
adverse or beneficial or above are considered significant in terms of the 
EIA Regulations. Although slight adverse or beneficial and neutral 
impacts would not be considered significant, they remain worthy of 
consideration throughout both the design and the decision making 
process. 
11.4.3 
This assessment describes and evaluates the existing landscape and 
visual amenity, identifying future changes without the proposed Project, 
and assessing potential impacts arising during the construction,

operation and decommissioning stages. It considers impacts in relation 
to: 
ï¿½ 
Landscape character and resources, including effects on the 
aesthetic values of the landscape caused by changes in the 
elements, characteristics, character and qualities of the landscape;  
ï¿½ 
Designated landscapes, registered parks and gardens, and 
recreational interests;  
ï¿½ 
Visual amenity, including effects upon potential viewers and 
viewing groups caused by changes in the appearance of the 
landscape as a result of the proposed Project; and 
ï¿½ 
Cumulative effects arising in combination with those developments 
with planning permission but not yet constructed and those 
developments submitted for planning permission but which have 
not been granted planning permission.  
11.4.4 
Landscape character and associated resources are considered to be of 
importance in their own right and are valued for their intrinsic qualities 
irrespective of whether they are seen by people. Impacts on visual 
amenity as perceived by people, are therefore clearly distinguished 
from, although closely linked to, impacts on landscape character. 
Landscape and visual assessments are therefore separate although 
linked processes.

Conclusions 
Spatial Scope 
11.4.6 
The spatial scope of the preliminary assessment extends 15 km in 
radius from the centre of the proposed Power Generation Plant site 
where the tallest structures will be located. It is shown on Figure 11.1, 
Site Location and Study Area. A separate ZTV will be produced for the 
Electrical Connection Compound after the location has been finalised. 
The study area will be extended if theoretical views of the Electrical 
Connection Compound are available beyond the 15 km study area.  
11.4.7 
The study area is broken down and impacts addressed as follows: 
ï¿½ 
0 to 5 km radius area (inner study area) selected for assessment of 
impacts on landscape character at a local level, designated 
landscapes, landscape features and visual amenity. 
ï¿½ 
5 to 15 km study area (outer study area) selected for broader 
assessment of impacts on landscape character with reference to 
National Character Areas (NCAs). Impacts on visual amenity will 
also be addressed. 
Temporal Scope 
11.4.8 
Detailed site studies are being undertaken between June 2013 and 
January 2014 to establish the landscape and visual baseline. The 
results of those studies already undertaken have fed into this PEIR. 
Landscape and visual impacts will be assessed for the construction 
phase, at operation, and at decommissioning. Visual impacts will be

assessed for the winter situation when the screening effect of 
vegetation will be least effective.  
Guidance 
11.4.9 
The methodology for the assessment is based on current best practice 
and guidance from the following sources: 
11.4.10 
Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (GLVIA), third 
edition, published by the Landscape Institute & Institute of 
Environmental Management and Assessment (2013);  
11.4.11 
Landscape Character Assessment Guidance for England and Scotland 
(LCAG), published by Scottish Natural Heritage (2002) and the 
Countryside Agency; and 
11.4.12 
Advice Note 01/11: Photography and Photomontage in Landscape and 
Visual Impact Assessment, Landscape Institute (2011).  
11.4.13 
Whilst this assessment methodology follows best practice outlined in 
the guidance above, the assessment also takes account of some 
limited definition of the height, size and positioning of proposed 
buildings and structures. As explained in section 3, the âRochdale 
approachâ is used, and this considers the worst or maximum case 
scenario in terms of the size and scale of the proposed Project subject 
to landscape and visual impact assessment. 
Baseline Studies 
11.4.14 
Baseline information is being collected from the following sources: 
11.4.15 
Published landscape character assessments at national, regional and 
local scale; 
11.4.16 
Ordnance survey maps to identify public rights of way as well as 
landform, drainage, field settlement and transport patterns; 
ï¿½ 
Aerial photographs (where available); 
ï¿½ 
Site survey; and  
ï¿½ 
Statutory and non-statutory websites 
Methodology to Establish Landscape Baseline 
11.4.17 
The baseline study provides an understanding of the landscape in the 
area that may be affected. It includes a description of landscape's 
constituent elements, its character and the way this varies spatially, its 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

geographical extent, its condition and the way the landscape is 
experienced, and the value attached to it. 
11.4.18 
Landscape character is what makes an area unique. It is defined by 
Natural England, âLandscape is more than just âthe viewâ. It is about the 
complex, interacting natural and cultural systems that make up each 
landscape and it is also about the relationship between people, place 
and natureâ (www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape).  
11.4.19 
The essential components of landscape character are:  
ï¿½ A distinct and recognisable pattern of elements. Landscape 
elements are the dominant features which characterise, contribute 
to or detract from the overall landscape impression, i.e. the built 
form, the landform, land use, vegetation, water, field patterns, 
walls etc. They are quantifiable and can be described; and 
ï¿½ Landscape Type: These are identifiable at the broader scale and 
are understood in terms of areas with a homogeneous character 
based on geology, topography, geomorphology, vegetation and / 
or land use or dominant elements, e.g. moorland, rolling upland, 
historic parkland, urban. These are elements or groups of 
elements, which can be classified as a landscape type of a 
particular quality and value. Sensory experiences, e.g. tranquillity 
and wildness, are also considered as part of the overall make up 
of the character type. 
11.4.20 
The quality and sensitivity of the baseline landscape is being assessed 
and categorised in accordance with the criteria shown in Table 11.2. 
The capacity of the landscape to accept development is reflected in the 
degree to which it is able to accommodate change (due to a particular 
development or land use change) without adverse effects on its 
character. Landscapes that have the highest sensitivity to change 
usually have the lowest capacity to accept change. Sensitivity is not 
absolute; it will vary according to the character of the existing 
landscape and the extent and nature of the proposed Project.  
11.4.21 
Quality relates to the physical state of the landscape and its intactness 
from visual, functional and ecological perspectives. It also reflects the 
state of repair of individual features and elements that make up the 
character in any one place.  
11.4.22 
The sensitivity of a landscape to change varies according to the nature 
of the existing resource and the nature of the proposed change.  
Considerations of value, integrity and capacity are all relevant when 
assessing sensitivity.

11.4.23 
Value relates to the value or importance attached to a landscape for its 
scenic or aesthetic qualities or cultural associations. It may be 
recognised through national, regional or local designations.  
11.4.24 
Integrity is the degree to which the value and condition has been 
retained.  
Methodology to Establish Visual Baseline 
11.4.25 
The visual baseline establishes the extent of the area in which the 
development would be visible, the different groups of people who would 
experience views of it (receptors), the places where they would be 
affected, and the nature of the views and visual amenity at those 
points. 
11.4.26 
A Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) map will be prepared for a 15 km 
radius from the centre of the Power Generation Plant where the tallest, 
most visible structures would be located. They will indicate the areas 
where views of the proposed buildings or stacks would theoretically be 
available. A separate ZTV will be produced for the Electrical 
Connection Compound after its location has been finalised, and the 
study area will be extended if it indicates theoretical views of the 
Electrical Connection Compound beyond the 15km study area.  
11.4.27 
The ZTVs will be computer-generated using intervisibility software with 
Ordnance Survey DTM and models of the proposed buildings up to 20 
m high and stacks up to 30 m high. The ZTVs indicate where views of 
the structures are available theoretically. They do not take account of 
the screening effect of surface features, including minor landform, 
woodlands, and hedgerows and built development, and as such 
present the âworst caseâ scenario.  
11.4.28 
The visual assessment considers viewpoints from locations throughout 
the study area that are representative of potential views from residential 
properties, public rights of way, recreational resources and heritage 
assets. They will be selected in consultation with MSDC, Babergh 
District Council (BDC) and South Norfolk Council (SNC).  
11.4.29 
Visual receptors, such as users of buildings, recreational spaces, 
footpaths and transport routes, have differing sensitivities to their visual 
environment. Generally, this is dependent upon their interest in the 
visual environment, their viewing opportunity and duration, and the 
context of the views. These factors may be expressed in terms of: 
11.4.30 
The value of the view / viewpoint reflects the intrinsic character and 
scenic qualities of its location and context. Where recognised through 
the designation of an area, such as a National Park or Area of

Outstanding Natural Beauty, value is increased, while the presence of 
detracting features in a view will generally reduce value. Higher value 
views/viewpoints are likely to be more sensitive to change 
11.4.31 
The importance of the viewpoint â as indicated by some form of 
recognition, e.g. as noted in a guidebook, marked on a map or 
indicated on the ground by a sign or other visible feature. The provision 
of facilities e.g. seating, parking, footpath may also indicate a location 
of higher importance. Views gained from locations where people gather 
outdoors may also be of higher importance 
11.4.32 
Viewersâ expectations, occupations and activities when experiencing 
the view.  
11.4.33 
The sensitivity of visual receptors is set out in Table 11.2 Sensitivity of 
Receptors.

Methodology to Determine Magnitude of Effects 
11.4.34 
Consideration is given to the potential effects of the proposed Project, 
with mitigation, on landscape character and resources, and on visual 
amenity during the construction, operation and decommissioning 
phases. The assessment will distinguish between impacts on 
landscape character and those associated with visual amenity and 
views across the Project Site. Effects can be direct, indirect, 
cumulative, permanent (i.e. operational) or temporary (often associated 
with the construction phase) and are defined below.  
ï¿½ 
Direct impacts are those imposed on landscape elements on the 
site as a direct result of development, such as the loss of existing 
trees or other vegetation; 
ï¿½ 
Indirect and secondary impacts may occur some distance from 
the site, e.g. removal of screen vegetation on the site would allow 
views in from surrounding areas; 
ï¿½ 
Cumulative impacts occur when additional developments of 
similar type appear in an area or when a development might 
impose several different impacts on the same resource or receptor; 
ï¿½ 
Short Medium or Long Term describes the duration of an impact; 
and 
ï¿½ 
Permanent or Temporary relates for example to additional 
impacts during construction compared to the permanent change 
caused by the new Development. 
11.4.35 
The assessment considers whether effects would be adverse, 
beneficial or neutral. Generally, proposals that fit with the scale and 
character of the receiving landscape are more likely to be beneficial. In 
some situations effects may be adverse initially until mitigation planting 
achieves its design objectives, after which the effects become 
beneficial. 
11.4.36 
The magnitude of effect on landscape receptors is assessed in relation 
to the size or scale of effect, the geographical location of the area 
influenced and its duration and reversibility.  
11.4.37 
The assessment considers the magnitude of change the proposed 
Project would exert on the landscape because of:  
ï¿½ The proximity of the proposed Project to the landscape receptor â 
generally the magnitude of effect reduces with increasing distance 
as it exerts progressively less influence on the landscape; 
ï¿½ The extent to which the structures can be seen, and the extent to 
which landform, woodland, buildings etc. intervene; and

ï¿½ The extent to which a landscape receptor would experience 
visibility of the structures and their resulting effects on character. 
11.4.38 
Criteria used to assess the magnitude of predicted landscape effects 
range from high through to negligible / no change and are set out below 
in Table 11.3 Magnitude of Change.

Methodology to Assess Significance of Landscape and Visual 
Effects 
11.4.39 
The GLVIA identifies a higher level of significance is generally attached 
to large scale effects and effects on sensitive or high-value receptors; 
thus small effects on highly sensitive sites can be more important than 
large effects on less sensitive sites. 
11.4.40 
The GLVIA provides the following general guidance when judging the 
significance of effects on the landscape: 
ï¿½ Loss of mature or diverse landscape elements, or features; 
ï¿½ Effects on character areas, which are distinctive or representative; 
ï¿½ Greater weight should be given to those elements, features and 
areas if they are identified as being of high value or importance, 
i.e. effects on those recognised as being of national importance 
are likely to be of more significance than effects on those of local 
importance; 
ï¿½ Landscapes of high value and sensitivity to the type of change 
proposed are likely to be more seriously affected by development 
than those with a lower sensitivity; and 
ï¿½ A test of significance is not directly related to planning policy.  
11.4.41 
The significance of an effect may be beneficial but more usually it will 
be adverse, at least initially. Significance has been determined using 
informed and well-reasoned professional judgment. The two principal 
criteria determining significance are the sensitivity of the receptor to 
change of the nature proposed by the development, and the magnitude 
of the effect. By combining the sensitivity of the receptor with the 
predicted magnitude of change, the level of significance is established 
as shown in the matrix in Table 11.4 Significance of Landscape and 
Visual Effect below. The matrix is not intended to be a prescriptive tool 
and judgements are made based on professional evaluation. Table 
11.5 Significance of Effects describes the extent potential changes that 
would arise. 
11.4.42 
Generic Significance Criteria have not been applied to this assessment, 
and criteria derived from the GLVIA and other landscape guidance has

been used instead. The criteria in Table 11.4 have been applied 
because they describe the types of landscape or visual impact that 
would occur at each level of significance. For the purpose of this 
assessment, impacts that are assessed as being either moderately 
adverse or above are considered significant. Although slight adverse or 
beneficial and neutral impacts are not considered significant, they 
remain worthy of consideration throughout both the design and the 
decision making process. Significance of effect also needs to be 
qualified with respect to the scale or extent over which it is 
experienced. An effect may be locally significant, or significant with 
respect to a small number of receptors, but not significant when judged 
within a wider context.

Visual Assessment Methodology 
11.4.43 
The magnitude of change upon visual amenity resulting from a 
development varies according to the following factors: 
ï¿½ The scale of change in the view with respect to the loss and/or 
addition of new features; 
ï¿½ The degree of contrast, or integration of / compatibility with any 
new features with existing features in the view; 
ï¿½ The duration of the effect (temporary or permanent, intermittent or 
continuous) (temporary effects are considered to be less 
significant than longer term or permanent effects); 
ï¿½ The distance of the receptor from the source of the effect; 
ï¿½ The angle of view and presence of intervening vegetation or 
features; 
ï¿½ The dominance of the impact feature in the view, and 
ï¿½ Seasonal variation.  
11.4.44 
This assessment assumes that the change would be seen in clear 
visibility and under appropriate lighting conditions and considers: 
ï¿½ The attributes of the landscape where the development would be 
sited. i.e. the scale and character of the landscape in which they 
would be viewed; the presence or absence of landscape features; 
and the scale / enclosure of the landscape within the field of view; 
ï¿½ The design and siting of structures within the development; and 
ï¿½ The atmospheric conditions prevalent at the time of viewing. 
11.4.45 
The magnitude of visual effects at any given distance will vary 
according to a range of factors, including:  
ï¿½ 
the number and proportion of stack(s) / plant buildings visible and 
their arrangement in the view 
ï¿½ 
the presence of other features in the view that draw the eye; and

ï¿½ 
the extent to which views of the turbines from the viewpoint in 
question are obstructed or filtered by intervening landform, 
vegetation, or built structures. 
11.4.46 
It is assumed that the visual effects of the proposed Project will reduce 
as viewing distance increases. The magnitude of visual effects at any 
given distance will vary according to the range of factors described. 
Table 11.3 Magnitude of Change describes differing degrees of effect 
on visual amenity.  
11.4.47 
The significance of potential effects on visual amenity will be 
determined through the same process as landscape effects. The matrix 
set out in Table 11.4 considers both the magnitude of change and the 
sensitivity of the receptor to the proposed change (Table 11.2 & Table 
11.3) and the significance of effect is defined in Table 11.5). 
Illustrative Tools 
11.4.48 
The graphic information described below will be provided in the ES to 
illustrate visual aspects of the development. To date, a number of 
photomontages have been produced to accompany the PEIR, 
presented in Figures 11.6 â 11.9, and are described later in this 
section. 
Zone of Theoretical Visibility Maps (ZTV) 
11.4.49 
Separate computer generated ZTV maps will be produced for the main 
structures and the stacks to assist in viewpoint selection and to 
appreciate the potential influence of the proposed Project in the wider 
landscape. For the purposes of this report an initial assessment of the 
areas from which the proposals are likely to be available are outlined. 
11.4.50 
The ZTVs will indicate areas from which it might be possible to secure 
views to part or parts of the proposed Project. However, use of ZTV 
mapping needs to be qualified on the following basis: 
11.4.51 
There are a number of areas within the ZTV maps from where there is 
potential to view parts of the proposal, but which comprise land where 
the general public do not have access; 
11.4.52 
A ZTV map does not account for the effects of screening and filtering of 
views as a result of intervening features, such as buildings, trees and 
hedgerows; and 
11.4.53 
A ZTV map does not account for the likely orientation of a viewer â for 
example when travelling in a vehicle.

- 316 - 
 
11.4.54 
The combined effect of these limitations means that ZTV mapping 
tends to over-estimate the extent of visibility â both in terms of the land 
area from which the proposed Project is visible and the extent of 
visibility of the structures from a particular viewpoint. 
11.4.55 
The use of this type of ZTV map is considered good practice and 
should be considered as a tool to assist in assessing the visibility of the 
proposed Project. A ZTV map does not present an absolute measure of 
visibility and does not represent the âvisual impactâ of the proposed 
development. 
11.4.56 
The ZTVs will be compiled using Ordnance Survey Landform Profile 
data comprising spot heights and contours (within a 10 m resolution) to 
produce a Digital Terrain Model. The DTM will be overlaid on a 
1:50,000 Ordnance Survey base map to provide details of locations 
and landmark features, which may affect the extent of visibility or 
provide screening in the landscape. It will be produced using 
appropriate modelling software. 
11.4.57 
The ZTVs will be calculated using landform data, the proposed layout 
of the development, height options (buildings or stack), the centre of 
the ZTV, the radius from the proposed site centre, the resolution of the 
final output, the view height of the receptor, and the resolution of the 
landform data. For greater accuracy a calculation was built into the 
model to make corrections for the curvature of the earth. 
Photographs and Panoramas 
11.4.58 
Photograph and panorama images have been produced to illustrate an 
observerâs view of the existing site and proposed Project from each of 
the viewpoint locations agreed with SCC and other regulatory 
authorities. The images will be produced in accordance with best 
practice guidance described in the Advice Note 01/11, âPhotography 
and Photomontage in Landscape and Visual Impact Assessmentâ 
published by the Landscape Institute.  
11.4.59 
All photographs are taken with a Digital SLR camera, with 50 mm 
equivalent focal length lens (when compared to 35 mm film camera), 
mounted on a level panoramic head tripod. They record a 90 degree 
angle of view to illustrate the full extent of the proposed Project within 
the local landscape that would be experienced at each viewpoint. The 
photographs are then merged to create a panorama using photo-
stitching software (Canon Photo Stitch) and the resulting digital 
photographic data will be used to produce the photomontages using 
appropriate software.

Cumulative Assessment  
11.4.61 
The assessment will consider the cumulative impacts arising in 
combination with those developments with planning permission but not 
yet constructed and those developments submitted for planning 
permission but which have not been granted planning permission. 
Schemes will be identified in consultation with MSDC and SCC.   
11.4.62 
Preliminary cumulative impacts are described in Section 16 of this 
PEIR. 
11.5 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
11.5.1 
The proposed Project would be designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and industry 
standard methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction, 
operation and decommissioning are minimised. In respect of landscape 
and visual effects this mitigation includes: 
ï¿½ 
The utilisation of a technology (SCGT) that allows a significant 
reduction in stack height in comparison to other technology types. 
ï¿½ 
Locating the Electrical Connection Compound within an area that 
can economically be reached by underground cable, thus removing 
the need to introduce overhead cables into the landscape. 
11.5.2 
The assessment in this Section considers such design mitigation. Any 
additional mitigation developed in response to specific impacts 
identified in this assessment is described in section 11.9 below.

1990s when the walled garden was redesigned by Peter Thoday as 
a walled orchard for training people with disabilities. The wider 
estate extends over 830 ha and includes extensive woodlands with 
approximately 12 mi of way marked footpaths.  
ï¿½ 
Chandos Lodge, Eye: 1.5 km south east. The garden to Chandos 
Lodge was first created at the beginning of the 19th century and 
modified in the mid-20th century by others and specifically by Sir 
Frederick Ashton. The gardens now include remnants of an 
orangery, a pond, a small 20th century folly, and a serpentine 
boundary wall leading to Lambseth Street. 
ï¿½ 
The Abbey, Eye: 2.4 km south east. The gardens formed part of the 
grounds surrounding the Priory of St Peter, founded in 1080. The 
Abbey now includes a landscaped garden with herbaceous borders 
and beds around the remains of the Priory, two glasshouses and a 
short length of âcrinkle crankleâ wall. The archaeological remains 
comprise mounds and some standing structures conserved within 
the garden; the original monastic walk around the church is still 
visible as a sunken path. 
11.7.16 
Conservation areas lying in close proximity to the Project Site include: 
ï¿½ 
The centre of Eye; 2 km south east. A large urban conservation 
area focused on the historic core of the medieval town and centred 
on the parish church and castle. Views of the former Eye Airfield 
are constrained by the densely packed townscape and abundant 
mature trees. Views into and out of the conservation area are 
restricted by dense mature planting that fringes much of the town, 
especially on the north and west side.  
ï¿½ 
Scole; 4.5 km north east. A small rural conservation area centred 
on the historic core of the village, which comprises a linear 
settlement along the old Norwich Road. Views into and out of the 
conservation area to the south and west are limited by mature tree 
planting on the edge of the village. 
ï¿½ 
Mellis; 4 km west. A large rural conservation area focused on the 
extensive linear open green space of Mellis Green and Common. 
The conservation area is bisected towards the eastern end by the 
railway line. Mellis Common is visually contained on the north and 
south side by a combination of loose grained development and 
extensive belts of mature trees. Views into and out of the 
conservation area are limited by extensive groups of mature trees. 
The conservation area boundary follows the widening of the 
common at its eastern end, with some more open views towards 
the east.

ï¿½ 
Thrandeston; 3 km north west. A small rural conservation area 
centred on the historic core of the village and containing several 
listed buildings and other historic properties on the eastern edge of 
the conservation area. It is fringed by several mature trees that limit 
views into and out of the area. 
ï¿½ 
Hoxne Low Street; 5 km north east. A small rural conservation area 
centred on the historic core of the village. It is characterised by the 
elongated triangular village green that runs north to south, rising 
towards its northern end and is visually enclosed on the east and 
west sides by tightly packed historic buildings. Views into and out of 
the conservation area are limited by dense tree planting, especially 
on the south and west sides. 
ï¿½ 
Hoxne Cross Street; 5 km north east. A small rural conservation 
area covering the small loose grained settlement to the south of the 
main village of Hoxne. It is characterised by its linear form focused 
on Abbey Hill and Cross Street, which run roughly north to south. 
Views into and out of the conservation area are limited by mature 
trees. 
ï¿½ 
Diss; 5 km north west. A large urban conservation area covering 
the core of the historic town and centred on âThe Mereâ, a lake of 
over 2 ha. It also includes large enclosed public and private open 
spaces that are a characteristic feature of the town. 
ï¿½ 
Palgrave; 4 km north west. A small rural conservation area centred 
on the historic core of the village with the village green and parish 
church of St Peter at its centre. The core of the conservation area 
is characterised by The Green, which is aligned north to south and 
visually enclosed by buildings on the east and west sides. Views 
into and out of the conservation area are restricted by mature 
planting that surrounds much of the village. 
11.7.17 
SCCâs Historic Environment Record describes Eye Airfield as a 2nd 
World War airfield, originally part of an American families Cornwall 
estate. It was constructed in 1942 for use as a military airfield until 1945 
and remained in civilian use until 1962. Features of historic interest 
include the runways, a lych gate and 2 T2 type hangars. 
11.7.18 
The EADF, section 2.9 notes that although the airfield has not been the 
subject of systematic archaeological investigation, metal detected finds 
to the south in the vicinity of the application site indicate Roman and 
Anglo-Saxon and medieval occupation (HER no. YAX 032). 
Public Rights of Way

boundary of the airfield at the time of its construction and operation. 
They include a public footpath between the A140 and Mid Suffolk 
Business Park that follows the southern end of the western boundary 
and the southern boundary of the proposed Project site. The A140 
road, which lies close to the western boundary of the airfield, presents 
a hazard to pedestrians crossing it. 
11.7.20 
The Mid Suffolk Footpath is a long distance recreational trail extending 
over 32 km between Hoxne in the north and Stowmarket in the south. 
Several short circular walks exist within the overall route, including Eye. 
The route lies within 2 km at its closest point to the Project Site.  
11.7.21 
Other long distance recreational trails within the 15 km study area 
include: 
ï¿½ 
Angles Way Footpath, which runs west to east in the northern part 
of the study area and within 4.2 km at its closest point to the Project 
Site 
ï¿½ 
Boudicaâs Way Footpath, which runs west to north-east in the 
northern part of the study area and lies within 4.3 km at its closest 
point to the Project Site 
ï¿½ 
Middy Railway Footpath, which runs south-west to north east in the 
southern part of the study area and lies within 9.5 km at its closest 
point to the Project Site 
11.7.22 
Two Sustrans Regional Cycle Routes (RCR) lie within the 15 km study 
area: 
ï¿½ 
RCR 30: 2 Rivers Lowestoft to Kings Lynn via Diss follows 
Castleton Way, which forms the southern boundary of the Eye 
Airfield site.  
ï¿½ 
RCR 40: Cycling in the Heart of Suffolk lies to the east of the 
Project Site. 
Land of outstanding scenic, historic and scientific interest

former airfield (Eye Airfield Industrial Estate and Mid Suffolk Business 
Park), and is surrounded by semi-rural landscape that includes arable 
farmland, the A140 major transport route, prominent pylons and an 
overhead transmission line from Sizewell nuclear power station, and 
small villages / farmsteads.  
11.7.25 
The airfield occupies an area of approximately 250 ha. Several parts of 
the industrial estate are fully developed with e.g. wind turbines, various 
industrial units, a chicken litter biomass power station with 40 m high 
stack, 
and 
a 
National 
Grid 
Gas 
Compressor 
Station 
with 
communications mast, which are sited in the northern part of the 
industrial estate. Generally taller development has been located 
centrally in the northern part of the airfield with lower development on 
the more visible outer areas in the north east and north west. Much of 
the southern part of the area proposed for industrial development is in 
agricultural use  
11.7.26 
Suffolk HER (EYE 072) lists remnant features of the former airfield, 
which includes wide concrete runways, a lych gate, two T2-type 
hangars and a Nissan hut. The runways and undeveloped site are used 
for various recreational activities including walking, flying model aircraft 
and taxiways for informal car club meetings. 
11.7.27 
The site and wider industrial estate are relatively flat and ground levels 
vary between approximately 45 m AOD (metres above Ordnance 
Datum) in the centre of the site to 40 m AOD at the lowest point in the 
south east. The highest point of the site is 49 m AOD, west of the 
national grid compression station. Changes in level throughout the Eye 
Airfield Industrial Estate are barely perceptible.

development; the degree of screening provided by predominantly 
deciduous vegetation is reduced following leaf fall.  
11.7.29 
The small medieval town of Eye lies approximately 1.8 km south east of 
the Project Site. The topography of Eye has kept the shape of the 
medieval form of the old town quite distinct. Its name translates to 
âislandâ, all around are water meadows on the River Dove and 
tributaries, which have prevented concentric or radial growth of the 
town. Modern residential development is concentrated on the northern 
and western edges of the town.

Landscape Character 
11.7.30 
The baseline landscape character is described with reference to the 
following landscape character assessment data available at national, 
regional and local level:  
ï¿½ 
Countryside Character Volume 6: East of England, National 
Character Area 83: South Norfolk and High Suffolk Claylands and 
National Character Area 85: Breckland, by Countryside Agency 
(now Natural England), 1998; 
ï¿½ 
Suffolk Landscape Character Assessment, by SCC (in partnership 
with Living Landscapes Project and all District and Borough 
Councils in Suffolk), 2008; 
ï¿½ 
South Norfolk Landscape Character Assessment, by Land Use 
Consultants, published by South Norfolk District Council, 2006; and 
ï¿½ 
Eye Airfield Draft Baseline Landscape Appraisal, by Lloydbore Ltd, 
2011. 
11.7.31 
National, regional and local landscape character areas are illustrated in 
Figure 11.3 Landscape Character. 
National Character Area 83 South Norfolk and High Suffolk 
Claylands 
11.7.32 
National Character Area 83: South Norfolk and High Suffolk Claylands 
is described as, âabove all, farming country with strong utilitarian and 
traditional character, evoked best in its churches, moated farmhouses 
and irregular field patterns and hedgerow oaks. It is a controlled and 
balanced landscape for the most part although there are some areas in 
which the loss of hedgerows and the amalgamation of fields into 
prairies give a bleak and denuded character to the landscapeâ.  
11.7.33 
Key characteristics include: 
ï¿½ 
Large area of chalky boulder clay plateau with little relief, except 
where incised by small rivers and streams and the river Waveney; 
ï¿½ 
Slightly undulating topography; 
ï¿½ 
Area of relatively small, individual landholdings, with scattered 
small parkland estates. Mix of remnant medieval Ancient 
Countryside (irregular small fields with pollard hedgerow oaks), 
early co-axial field patterns (east of Scole) and large modern fields 
devoid of hedges and trees; 
ï¿½ 
Large number of isolated, moated timber-framed farmhouses, 
mainly 1400 â 1730, with steeply pitched pantile or pegtile roofs.

Little flint, some brick (especially in towns). Small villages and 
nucleated market towns with architectural variety and colour; 
ï¿½ 
Almost entirely arable, except for pasture in river valleys, remnant 
parkland, common and greens. Intensive livestock housing (pig / 
poultry); 
ï¿½ 
Boundaries formed by deep ditches, with or without hedges / 
hedgerow trees. Ponds are few. Large areas of woodland are 
scarce, especially on plateau. Small copses are frequent in some 
areas; and 
ï¿½ 
Few major transport routes but an extensive network of narrow 
lanes and byroads. 
11.7.34 
Under âThe Changing Countrysideâ the NCA notes the following 
changes that have altered the landscape within the study area: 
ï¿½  âContinuing but now isolated loss of hedgerows and hedgerow 
trees due to amalgamation of small fields and over-zealous 
mechanical hedgerow management; 
ï¿½ 
Loss of ditches, ponds and pasture (especially in High Suffolk) due 
to field amalgamation and improved drainage techniques; 
ï¿½ 
In recent years, two Sizewell nuclear power stations have been 
constructed and deliver electricity via huge pylons which still 
dominate the landscape and are impossible to ignore in the flattish 
terrain; and 
ï¿½ 
Development pressure is focused almost entirely on towns well-
served by transport systems, as in the A14 corridor and along 
railway routes, which often have modern housing estates grafted 
on to small market towns. This has the additional effects of 
gentrification 
of 
houses, 
barn 
conversions 
and 
creeping 
suburbanization.â 
11.7.35 
Under âShaping the Futureâ the NCA suggests the following measures 
to protect its distinctive landscape character: 
ï¿½ 
âThe historic and visual value of hedgerow oaks (including pollards) 
and remnant hedgerows in maintaining historic field patterns should 
be recognised and their retention or replanting should be 
addressed; 
ï¿½ 
The creation and management of small to medium-sized woods 
should be considered on the plateaux edges and in areas adjacent 
to existing woods; and

ï¿½ 
The retention of commons, greens, roadside verges, trees on 
perimeter banks and hedge lines, and ponds would help to 
conserve the character of the area.â 
National Character Area 85 Breckland 
11.7.36 
A small area on the north western edge of the study area lies within 
NCA 85: Breckland. Key characteristics of this area include: 
ï¿½ 
âDistinctive large-scale landscape of pale coloured arable fields or 
open heath contrasting with vertical elements of pine lines, belts or 
forestry; 
ï¿½ 
Unique combination of underlying rocks and soils with slightly 
undulating dry terrain contrasting with shallow, wooded river 
valleys; 
ï¿½ 
Long history of settlement but now very sparsely populated, with 
nucleated villages within river valleys; and 
ï¿½ 
Open arable landscape with long views interrupted by belts and 
plantations of Scots and Corsican Pine.â 
11.7.37 
With reference to the Suffolk Landscape Character Assessment, the 
following landscape character areas exist within the study area. 
Suffolk Character Area - Ancient Plateau Claylands  
11.7.38 
The Project Site is located within the Ancient Plateau Claylands. Its key 
characteristics are: 
ï¿½ 
Flat or gently rolling arable landscape of clay soils dissected by 
small river valleys; 
ï¿½ 
Field pattern of ancient enclosure â random patterns in the south 
but often co-axial in the north. Small patches of straight-edged field 
associated with the late enclosure of woods and greens; 
ï¿½ 
Dispersed settlement pattern of loosely clustered villages, hamlets 
and isolated farmsteads of medieval origin; 
ï¿½ 
Villages often associated with medieval greens or tyes; 
ï¿½ 
Farmstead buildings are predominantly timber-framed, the houses 
colour-washed and the barns blackened with tar. Roofs are 
frequently tiles, though thatched houses can be locally significant; 
ï¿½ 
Scattered ancient woodland parcels containing a mix of oak, lime, 
cherry, hazel, hornbeam, ash and holly; 
ï¿½ 
Hedges of hawthorn and elm with oak, ash and field maple as 
hedgerow trees;

ï¿½ 
Substantial open areas created for WWII airfields and by 20th 
century agricultural changes; and 
ï¿½ 
Network of winding lanes and paths often associated with hedges 
create visual intimacy.â 
11.7.39 
Under âLandscape Sensitivity & Changeâ it notes: 
ï¿½ 
âThe characteristic land cover is arable farmland divided by an 
irregular sinuous field pattern, and scattered woodland. There are 
important areas of regular fields, created by the enclosure of 
commons greens and tyes, as well as a distinctive pattern of co-
axial fields in the north western portion of this landscape type, âthe 
Saintsâ area. All these historic field patterns are degraded in many 
places by boundary rationalisation. There are also occasional 
landscape parks, for example at Thornham Magna, Ringsfield and 
Flixton. However, parklands in this landscape are not as ubiquitous 
and extensive as in the Ancient estate Claylands; and 
ï¿½ 
Former WWII airfields are a recurring feature of this landscape. 
They are often the focus of industrial and transport orientated 
development, as well as the construction of large-scale wind 
turbines, all of which can have considerable local visual impact.â 
11.7.40 
Under âDevelopment Managementâ it notes the following with respect to 
the development of former airfield sites: 
ï¿½ 
âIn most cases a specific master-plan approach is the most 
effective way to deal with the development of these sites. It is then 
possible to implement strategic planting schemes to mitigate visual 
impact of long-term growth on the site, rather than dealing with 
proposals and mitigation on a piecemeal basis; and 
ï¿½ 
Specific issues relating to airfield development also include the 
preservation of cultural and historic features, such as bunkers and 
control towers, and the need for a design that retains them in an 
appropriate setting. Also, the alignment of runways etc can be 
echoed in the layout of buildings and the arrangement of planting.â 
11.7.41 
Under âVisual Experienceâ it states, âOn the more extensive plateau 
areas to the north of the Gipping the views are frequently open, though 
with some woodland present in the views. Occasionally there can even 
be a feeling of exposure. To the south there is a stronger feeling of 
enclosure with big hedges supplementing the ancient woods to give the 
landscape distinctly âwoodlandâ feel.â 
11.7.42 
Under âConditionâ it notes localised impacts of development occur in 
association with former airfield sites such as Eye. Although agricultural 
intensification in the 20th century has led to the removal of hedgerows, 
and a thinning out of the historical field pattern the distinctive character

of this landscape remains. Overall, the qualities for which this 
landscape is valued are in good condition, with a clearly apparent and 
distinctive character. This distinctive character is relatively susceptible 
to relatively small changes and is assessed to be of High sensitivity. 
Suffolk Character Area - Rolling Valley Claylands  
11.7.43 
The key characteristics of this area are: 
ï¿½ 
âGently sloping valleys on medium clay soils; 
ï¿½ 
Occasional notable steeper slopes; 
ï¿½ 
Fields often smaller than on surrounding plateau; 
ï¿½ 
Localised influence of landscape parks; 
ï¿½ 
Focus of settlement; 
ï¿½ 
Few large greens or commons; and 
ï¿½ 
Ancient woodland on the upper fringes of the valley sides.â 
11.7.44 
Intrusive development on valley sides has caused adverse change 
within some areas of this relatively tranquil landscape. Much of the 
landscape is in good condition, it is relatively intact and has a distinctive 
character, and therefore is assessed to be of Medium / High sensitivity.  
Suffolk Character Area - Plateau Claylands  
11.7.45 
The key characteristics of this area, which extends over much of the 
southern part of the study area include: 
ï¿½ 
Plateau of heavy clay soil very gently undulating or flat dissected by 
small streams; 
ï¿½ 
Ancient organic pattern of fields, some co-axial in the north east; 
ï¿½ 
Substantial hedges of hawthorn, blackthorn and elm with oak and 
ash predominant hedgerow trees; 
ï¿½ 
Extensive areas of hedgerow loss creating âarable prairiesâ; 
ï¿½ 
Large modern agricultural buildings a recurrent feature; 
ï¿½ 
Redundant WWII airfields; and 
ï¿½ 
Almost no woodland. 
ï¿½ 
A working landscape on which suburbanisation is only beginning to 
make an impact compared with other parts of the country. 
11.7.46 
Although much of the landscape is in good condition, the pattern has 
been degraded in areas with consequent loss of distinctive character, 
and it is assessed to be of Medium sensitivity.

Mixed hedgerows of hawthorn, dogwood and blackthorn with oak, 
ash and field maple; 
ï¿½ 
Fragmentary cover of woodland; 
ï¿½ 
Sand and gravel extraction; 
ï¿½ 
Golf courses; and 
ï¿½ 
Focus for larger settlements. 
11.7.48 
This landscape is relatively intact with a distinctive character and is 
assessed to be of Medium sensitivity.  
11.7.49 
With reference to the South Norfolk Landscape Character Assessment, 
the following landscape character areas exist within the study area. 
South Norfolk Character Area - Rural River Valley  
11.7.50 
The key characteristics of this area, which lies in a narrow band to the 
north of the study area, include: 
ï¿½ 
Distinct valley landform with wide long flat valley floodplains; 
ï¿½ 
Semi-enclosed landscape with long internal and restricted external 
views; 
ï¿½ 
Presence of watercourse clearly visible as a river, although often 
invisible within the wider landscape; 
ï¿½ 
Areas of unenclosed âwildâ fenland; 
ï¿½ 
Pasture and wet woodland within valley base; 
ï¿½ 
Predominantly wooded valley slopes; 
ï¿½ 
Sparse settlement within the valley bases; and  
ï¿½ 
Strong sense of tranquillity and rural isolation 
11.7.51

South Norfolk Character Area - Tributary Farmland  
11.7.52 
The key characteristics of this area, which lies to the north of the study 
area, include: 
ï¿½ 
Shelving and gently undulating landform created by small tributary 
valleys; 
ï¿½ 
Transitional landscape between the upland plateaux and the river 
valleys; 
ï¿½ 
Occasional long views; 
ï¿½ 
Dispersed but evenly distributed settlement pattern; 
ï¿½ 
Network of winding rural lanes bound by banks or ditches; and 
ï¿½ 
Medium to large scale arable farmland with remnants of parkland. 
11.7.53 
The landscape is relatively intact with a distinctive character. It is 
assessed to be of Medium sensitivity. 
South Norfolk Character Area - Plateau Farmland  
11.7.54 
The key characteristics of this area, which lies on the northern edge of 
the study area, include: 
ï¿½ 
Distinctive flat and elevated landform; 
ï¿½ 
Large arable fields of monoculture; 
ï¿½ 
Strong sense of openness and exposure due to lack of enclosing 
elements; 
ï¿½ 
Wooded horizons; 
ï¿½ 
Presence of tall structures which interrupt the sense of openness; 
and 
ï¿½ 
Sparsely settled landscape mostly comprising small nucleated and 
long linear settlements. 
11.7.55 
The landscape character and pattern has been degraded by arable 
monoculture and it is assessed to be of Low sensitivity. 
11.7.56 
Landscape Character Assessment provided in the Eye Airfield Draft 
Baseline Landscape Appraisal provides a detailed analysis of 
landscape character variations throughout the airfield. Figure 11.4 is an 
extract from this report; the application site lies in landscape character 
area C Industrial / Agricultural.  
11.7.57 
It notes the following key features which are considered worthy of 
retention and / or enhancement:

ï¿½ 
âRemnant field boundary hedgerows, trees and ditches; 
ï¿½ 
âHeroicâ scale structures along the western site boundary redolent 
of aircraft hangar architecture; 
ï¿½ 
Long views to the south; 
ï¿½ 
Dramatic broad, flat runways of some historic / cultural significance; 
ï¿½ 
Attractive tree-lined approach to Eye from the north, along the 
B1077; and 
ï¿½ 
Broad open grass verge along the A140 providing a setting for the 
large scale industrial units beyond.â 
11.7.58 
It notes key elements that detract from the character of the site are: 
ï¿½ 
âEroded / discontinuous boundary hedgerows and degraded 
landscape structure; 
ï¿½ 
Industrial units / sheds of poorer visual quality; and 
ï¿½ 
Lack of consistent branding / signage.â 
11.7.59 
The proposed Project site lies within landscape character area C â 
Industrial / Agricultural, and the key characteristics of this area are: 
ï¿½ 
âContained arable fields, bounded by industrial plots and (northern 
part) residential development; 
ï¿½ 
In general, views are restricted by large buildings such as the 
industrial and freight buildings within Eye Airfield; 
ï¿½ 
Remnant concrete runway strips alongside the arable fields; 
ï¿½ 
Sparse boundary vegetation, opportunity for improvement; and 
ï¿½ 
Little topographical variation.â 
11.7.60 
It assesses the overall sensitivity of this landscape to be Low due to a 
lack of local distinctiveness and the presence of incongruous landscape 
elements, and notes there is great potential for enhancement. 
11.7.61 
Landscape character areas to the south of and adjoining area C â 
Industrial / Agricultural include areas A â Agricultural, Fâ Rural land and 
G â Eye setting and all three areas are of the highest sensitivity. 
Landscape adjoining the western boundary of the site is of Low â 
Negligible sensitivity and to the north and east is of Negligible 
sensitivity. 
Baseline Visual Amenity

ZTVs will be produced for the proposed Project which will inform the 
landscape and visual impact assessment. They will show the extent of

theoretical visibility of the structures and stacks within the study area, 
and will extend over a 15 km radius from the centre of the Project Site.  
11.7.63 
For the purposes of this report an initial assessment of the areas from 
which the proposals are likely to be available are outlined. In 
preparation for the ES, viewpoints will be selected for visual impact 
assessment from Table 11.7 below, and which are shown in Figure 
11.5. This preliminary list was informed by the Eye Airfield 
Development Framework and developed in consultation with MSDC in 
June 2013. Further consultation regarding the location of viewpoints 
and presentation of illustrative materials (photographs, wireframes and 
photomontages) will be undertaken with Place Directorate (MSDC and 
BDC) and SNC.  
11.7.64 
A preliminary site survey was undertaken in June 2013 where it was 
found that views were not available from other locations that were 
suggested by MSDC. They included Palgrave, Billingford, Thornham 
Magna, Thornham Park, Wortham, Snape Hill and Gislingham. As the 
screening was partly attributable to woodland and hedgerows, a winter 
visual survey will be undertaken to revisit these locations and establish 
the full extent of views available when screening from vegetation is 
least effective. 
11.7.65 
Figure 11.5, Viewpoint Locations, shows the location of proposed 
viewpoints detailed in Table 11.7. Their selection was based on the 
criteria that viewpoints should: 
ï¿½ 
Be representative of the likely impacts; 
ï¿½ 
Show a range of different types of views; 
ï¿½ 
Represent selected heritage assets referred to in this ES chapter; 
ï¿½ 
Be representative of different receptor groups ; 
ï¿½ 
Be representative of the varying image of the proposed 
development in the landscape; and 
ï¿½ 
Be accessible from public vantage points. 
11.7.66 
However, it should be noted that this is a preliminary list and may be 
amended following consultation with MSDC, NSC and BDC

The EADF notes the visual sensitivities of the airfield, as it states that 
âEye Airfield is a complex site, in which areas of intensively developed 
employment land contrast with open agricultural land; rural lanes 
contrast with busy trunk roads; there is an array of land uses and 
architectural styles; an unique historical connection largely expressed 
by concrete runways; and a network of public rights of way crossing the 
site.â It identifies several viewpoints with the highest visual sensitivity to 
future development within the application site, which is represented by 
viewpoints VP1 â VP4 and VP 12 to VP15 in Table 11.7.  
11.7.68 
Potential visibility of the proposed Project from the north would be 
experienced by highly sensitive receptors occupying properties in parts 
of Brome, Trees, Thrandeston, Palgrave, Stuston and Scole, and by 
walkers using PRoWs including Angles Way and Mid Suffolk Footpath 
long distance trails. It is likely that views would be available from the 
edges of these settlements nearest to the proposed Project. Views from 
within these settlements in this predominantly flat landscape would be 
substantially limited by buildings, garden vegetation and field boundary 
hedges/ hedgerow trees and small woodlands. From these locations 
existing views of industrial development at Eye Airfield are extensively 
screened by vegetation in the vicinity of the airfield except for views of 
industrial units adjacent to the B1077. Views of taller structures 
including the chicken litter power plant stack and wind turbine rotor 
blades are visible over intervening vegetation.

11.7.69 
Further north, between the B1118 road and Scole, the landform falls 
gently within the broad, shallow Waveney Valley and views of Eye 
Airfield from the SLA are limited by the nature of the valley landform 
and intervening woodland. 
11.7.70 
Potential visibility of the proposed Project from the east would be 
experienced by highly sensitive residential receptors at Langton Green, 
South Green, scattered farmsteads, and by walkers using PRoWs 
including Mid Suffolk Footpath along Brome Avenue. Views of the Mid 
Suffolk Business Park are substantially screened by woodland leaving 
the chicken litter factory chimney, National Grid Gas Compressor 
Station mast, and wind turbines prominent on the skyline. 
11.7.71 
Further east land falls away to the shallow Dove Valley SLA between 
Eye and Oakley Park. Views of Eye Airfield are substantially screened 
by the valley landform and intervening woodland. 
11.7.72 
Several highly sensitive visual receptors exist in close proximity to the 
southern edge of Eye Airfield which includes residents on the north 
western edge of Eye, Eye Parish Church tower (landmark), Eye Castle 
(SAM), Castleton Way, residents at Yaxley and Thornham Hall and 
Thornham Parva, allotments at Eye, and an extensive network of local 
PRoWs. Land slopes southwards from Castleton Way and falls away to 
the south east towards the Dove valley giving long distance viewing 
opportunities into the airfield site. Most of the land allocated for 
industrial development to the south of the planted tree belt around the 
compressor site is currently in agricultural use. Tall structures including 
the mast at the Gas Compressor Station, wind turbines and the Eye 
Chicken Litter Power Plant stack are visible on the skyline over 
intervening vegetation. 
11.7.73 
To the west of Eye Airfield between the A140 road and Great Eastern 
mainline railway highly sensitive visual receptors include residents at 
Dukeâs Bridge, Mellis, Mellis Green, Wortham and Gislingham, Open 
Access land, village greens and local PRoWs. Visual detractors within 
this area are the railway line and tower pylons carrying overhead 
transmission lines from Sizewell nuclear power station. Views of Eye 
Airfield across this predominantly flat landscape are restricted by 
abundant hedgerows/hedgerow trees leaving only the upper part of the 
wind turbines, and Chicken Litter Power Plant stack visible. There are 
open views from the A140 road between Castleton Way and Brome 
over extensive industrial development on the western side of Eye 
Airfield.

Trends for changes to the landscape baseline 
11.7.74 
The EADF sets out an aspirational plan for significant change that will 
arise near the proposed Project site from planned industrial 
development on the site of agricultural land within Eye Airfield, which is 
broadly centred on the main north-south runway. Likely future 
development includes wind turbines, IT centres, data centres, R&D, 
green products, high value engineering manufacture, insurance etc. 
with the more prestigious buildings located on the outer, more visible 
areas of the Airfield. New development would be set within extensive 
structure planting that would be designed for landscape integration, 
visual amenity, and to reinforce the historic runways. The Eye Airfield 
Development Framework also includes land allocated for new housing 
in areas adjoining existing modern residential development on the 
northern and western edges of Eye. 
11.7.75 
Within the wider landscape surrounding the site, trends are for larger 
agricultural buildings in open countryside that can conflict with the small 
scale field pattern of ancient enclosure. Hedgerow removal to facilitate 
agricultural intensification is likely to continue within areas used for 
arable crops. 
11.7.76 
The Core Strategy notes demand for business, space and housing is 
greatest in the vicinity of major roads, primarily the A14 and A140, and 
residential growth will be focussed in three towns, one of which is Eye. 
Away from the main transport corridors the landscape has a distinctive 
character with small, idyllic villages and attractive countryside, including 
the valleys of the River Waveney and River Dove, which each have 
their own unique characteristics and all are highly sensitivity to change.

Security fencing 2.0 m high is required around the perimeter of the 
Power Generation Plant. 
Sources of impact during construction 
11.8.4 
The construction and commissioning of the Power Generation Plant will 
last for approximately 24 months and will include all areas required for 
the permanent works as well as a temporary construction area 
adjoining the southern boundary of the Power Generation Plant. During 
this time, potential adverse temporary landscape and visual impacts will 
arise from the following activities: 
ï¿½ 
Site clearance, removal of vegetation and topsoil stripping from the 
Power Generation Plant site;  
ï¿½ 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
ï¿½ 
Construction of an internal road for access to the buildings and 
storage area; 
ï¿½ 
Movement of construction related traffic including delivery and 
removal of materials to and from site, off-site road traffic including 
workers travelling to and from the Power Generation Plant site; 
ï¿½ 
General construction activities including the movement of large 
scale construction equipment, i.e. tower cranes, smaller cranes, 
batching plants drilling rigs etc; site compounds and temporary 
buildings required for construction, parking on site, and materials 
stockpiles;  
ï¿½ 
Temporary hoardings and/or protective fencing and signage;  
ï¿½ 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months;  
ï¿½ 
Construction of the SCGT and any other ancillary buildings; and

ï¿½ 
Construction of the permanent perimeter security fence. 
Sources of impact during operation 
11.8.5 
The following long term actions will contribute to the landscape and 
visual impact from the Power Generation Plant:  
ï¿½ 
The introduction of the SCGT plant and permanent structures 
associated with the gas and electricity grid connection on the 
Power Generation Plant site of former agricultural land. The final 
layout proposal will incorporate a degree of flexibility with respect to 
the actual sizing and siting of buildings / structures; 
ï¿½ 
The creation of new hard and soft landscape elements associated 
with the Power Generation Plant; 
ï¿½ 
Increased vegetation cover following tree and shrub mitigation 
planting subject to approval by MSDC; 
ï¿½

Sources of impact during decommissioning 
11.8.6 
Temporary landscape and visual impacts similar to those described for 
construction are likely to arise during decommissioning.  
Preliminary assessment of impacts on landscape and landscape 
character 
11.8.7 
The introduction of the proposed structures, namely buildings and hard-
surfaced areas associated with the Power Generation Plant, will add 
man-made elements to the landscape. Some would be of a significant 
scale, thereby establishing new landmark features and a point of 
reference in views from the wider area. 
11.8.8 
The direct effects in terms of landscape losses or change on the Power 
Generation Plant site are outlined as follows: 
ï¿½ 
Permanent displacement of an area of farmland over the extent of 
the proposed Power Generation Plant site; and 
ï¿½ 
Temporary displacement of an area of farmland south of the 
proposed Power Generation Plant for the construction works. 
11.8.9 
The Ancient Plateau Claylands landscape character area defined in the 
Suffolk Landscape Character assessment will be directly affected by

the Power Generation Plant. The landscape in the immediate vicinity of 
the Power Generation Plant site has been described in the baseline 
above. There are a number of existing industrial structures and 
facilities, the largest of these being the two wind turbines, National Grid 
Gas Compressor Station mast and Chicken Litter Power Plant stack, 
adjacent to the Power Generation Plant site. Woodland planting 
associated with the National Grid Gas Compressor Station and other 
existing structures will largely screen the Power Generation Plant from 
the north, north-east and north-west. From the further south, south-east 
and south-west the upper portions of the tallest elements of the Power 
Generation Plant are likely to be partly visible. 
11.8.10 
Some limited areas immediately to the south and south-east of the site 
boundary will be affected by visibility of the proposed Power Generation 
Plant. They include sections of public footpaths and residential 
development on the north western edge of Eye in particular. 
11.8.11 
The impact of the proposed Power Generation Plant on the adjacent 
local and national landscape character areas will be addressed in the 
final landscape and visual impact assessment produced as part of the 
final EIA. 
11.8.12 
Based on the information available the preliminary assessment 
considers the Power Generation Plant will form a visible and 
recognisable feature within an area of landscape that has the capacity 
to accommodate development of the nature proposed. Agricultural land 
will be lost permanently from the Power Generation Plant site and will 
be replaced by built elements and hard surfacing. The scale of the 
development would fit in with existing structures nearby. Localised 
effects arising from the Power Generation Plant would be of moderate 
significance and would reduce gradually as the perimeter landscape 
screen planting matures. 
Preliminary assessment of impacts on visual amenity 
11.8.13 
The visual impact of the Power Generation Plant over the 15 km study 
area will be addressed in the final landscape and visual impact 
assessment produced as part of the final EIA. For the purposes of this 
report, visual impact has been considered on the basis of the 
preliminary site visit and covers part of the study area and some of the 
locations described below.  
11.8.14 
Photomontages of the Power Generation Plant from viewpoints VP3, 
VP11 and VP12 to the south east and south west of the site are shown 
at Figures 11.6 to 11.8. respectively They include wireframe and 
rendered images of the proposed structures. The ES will include a 
comprehensive range of photomontages from all viewpoints shown in

Table 1.7 and other locations in agreement with the relevant planning 
authorities.   
11.8.15 
The Power Generation Plant will be visible from the wider landscape to 
the south, south-east and south-west of the application site. In general, 
the upper portions of the stack(s) (up to 30 m high) will be visible . 
Smaller structures and buildings will be substantially screened by 
adjacent woodland and existing industrial buildings adjacent to the 
northern, eastern and part of the western boundaries of the Power 
Generation Plant site. 
11.8.16 
The stack(s) on the western side of the Power Generation Plant will be 
the main elements of the which will be visible from the south and west, 
and would cause a change to the skyline where they are visible over 
intervening woodland and industrial buildings. In this relatively flat 
landscape tall vertical elements such as the stack(s) may be visible 
over a long distance. The stack(s) would be seen in the context of other 
tall industrial structures within Eye Airfield. 
11.8.17 
Viewers located to the south of the Power Generation Plant site will be 
affected which will appear visually prominent on the site of land 
currently in agricultural use. 
11.8.18 
The main receptors with potential views of the proposed Power 
Generation Plant include: 
ï¿½ 
Residents at the edges of settlements located south, south-east 
and south-west of the application site such as at Eye, Yaxley, and 
the eastern edge of Mellis; 
ï¿½ 
Public footpath users between the application site and Castleton 
Way; 
ï¿½ 
Road users on the A140 road travelling in both directions; 
ï¿½ 
Road users and pedestrians using Castleton Way; 
ï¿½ 
Walkers using public footpaths contiguous with the airfield runways 
and the western and southern boundaries of the Power Generation 
Plant site (heritage site); 
ï¿½ 
Walkers along sections of the Mid Suffolk Footpath; and  
ï¿½ 
Recreational users at the viewing platform at Eye Castle (SAM). 
11.8.19 
Long term visual effects will change when future development is 
undertaken to the south of the Power Generation Plant site within 
Areas 10, 11 and 12 of the former Eye Airfield. Development in these 
locations would either screen or reduce the extent of views of the 
Power Generation Plant and associated infrastructure from locations to

the south. However, mitigation planting adjacent to the east â west 
runway within the application site is necessary to screen the Power 
Generation Plant and to emphasise the runway. 
GAS CONNECTION  
11.8.20 
Two Gas Connection Options are under consideration for the Gas 
Connection varying between 0.1 km and 1.6 km in length depending on 
which option is developed. Connection to the National Transmission 
System would require the installation of a MOC facility of around 30 m x 
30 m and a PTF of around 30 m x 23 m, which would be located within 
the Power Generation Plant site.  
11.8.21 
It should be noted that the plans in Section 4, Project and Site 
Description, show both route corridor options with large buffers or 
potential areas in which each route may be developed. 
11.8.22 
Where possible the pipeline would be constructed using âtrenchlessâ 
engineering techniques to avoid removing sections of hedgerows that 
cross its route. It would be buried to a depth of cover in accordance 
with industry standards, which is no less than 1.2 m in agricultural land. 
Technical advice would be sought from National Grid to establish 
planting restrictions near all above and below ground structures prior to 
developing the landscape strategy.  
11.8.23 
From National Gridâs website it appears likely that hedge planting could 
be undertaken directly across the pipeline where visual screening is 
required and where it is necessary to gap up a field boundary hedge. 
National Grid requires planting in these locations is undertaken using 
shallow rooting species including hawthorn, blackthorn, elder, hazel 
and privet. Dense mass planting cannot be undertaken within 10 m of a 
pipeline, although individual specimens or a row of trees could be 
planted between 6 m and 10 m from it. Plant species should be 
selected from their list of suitable species. 
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
11.8.24 
Gas Connection Option 1 would be approximately 0.1km in length and 
would lie to the east of the Power Generation Plant and connect directly 
into the adjacent National Grid Compressor Station. 
11.8.25 
Construction of the underground pipeline would necessitate the 
removal of mature tree planting on the western and/or southern 
boundary of the National Grid Compressor Station. National Grid 
planting constraints would not allow the planting to be reinstated within 
10 m on either side of the pipeline.

Construction 
11.8.26 
Potential adverse temporary landscape and visual impacts will arise 
from the following activities: 
ï¿½ 
Site clearance and removal of vegetation from the site of the Gas 
Connection Option 1 and part of the mature tree screen along the 
western and/or southern boundary of the National Grid Compressor 
Station;  
ï¿½ 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
ï¿½ 
Movement of construction related traffic including delivery and 
removal of materials to and from the construction site, off-site road 
traffic including workers travelling to and from the construction site; 
ï¿½ 
General construction activities including the movement of 
construction equipment, a site compound, temporary buildings, 
parking on site, materials stockpiles, protective fencing, and 
signage;  
ï¿½ 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months. 
Operation 
11.8.27 
The following long term actions will contribute to the landscape and 
visual impact from the proposed gas connection:  
ï¿½ 
Loss of mature trees in the immediate vicinity of the underground 
pipeline; 
ï¿½ 
Perimeter hedge or woodland planting to screen the compound; 
and 
ï¿½ 
New access road and operational traffic.  
Decommissioning 
11.8.28 
Temporary landscape and visual impacts similar to those described for 
construction are likely to arise during decommissioning.  
Preliminary assessment of impacts on landscape and landscape 
character 
11.8.29 
The introduction of the proposed industrial structures, security fencing 
and hard surfacing will add man-made elements to a landscape where 
similar structures already exist. The structures will be visible over a 
wide area to the south of the Gas Connection Option 1 area until the 
intervening area at the former Eye Airfield is developed, which will 
screen views from PRoWs and settlements at Eye.

11.8.30 
The direct effects in terms of landscape losses or change on the Gas 
Connection Option 1 area are as follows: 
ï¿½ 
Permanent displacement of a small area of farmland for the access 
road;  
ï¿½ 
Temporary displacement of an area of farmland south of the 
proposed Project for the construction works; and 
ï¿½ 
Permanent loss of tree cover within the National Grid Compressor 
Station. 
11.8.31 
The Gas Connection Option 1 area lies adjacent to the A â Agricultural 
landscape character area in the EADF which is described in the 
baseline study, and has high sensitivity to change. Landscape 
character in the immediate vicinity of the Gas Connection Option 1 area 
will be altered by the introduction of industrial development. However, 
the proposed gas connection would be sited adjacent to similar 
structures within the Project and National Grid Compressor Station. 
Mitigation screen planting will be undertaken along the perimeter of the 
site, subject to National Grid constraints. 
11.8.32 
The impact of the proposed gas connection on the adjacent local and 
national landscape character areas will be addressed in the final 
landscape and visual impact assessment produced as part of the final 
ES. However, based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that 
the impacts identified above arising as a result of Gas Connection 
Option 1, will have a [slight to moderate significance depending on the 
extent of screen planting removed from the southern boundary of the 
National Grid Compressor Station. This preliminary assessment is 
based on PPL's current understanding of the landscape impacts, which 
may change following further assessment work (albeit it is not 
considered that any change in assessment conclusion will be 
significant).  
Preliminary assessment of impacts on visual amenity 
11.8.33 
The visual impact of the gas connection compound will be addressed in 
the landscape and visual impact assessment produced for the ES. The 
extent of visibility of the proposal will be assessed through site work 
undertaken during the winter months when screening from existing 
hedgerows/woodland is least effective. For the purposes of this report, 
visual impact has been considered on the basis of the preliminary site 
visit from the locations described below.  
11.8.34 
The proposed gas connection compound will be visible from the wider 
landscape to the south. Mitigation planting would screen views of 
ground level structures and activities.

11.8.35 
The main receptors with potential views of the Gas Connection Option 
1 include: 
ï¿½ 
Residents at the edges of settlements located south and south-
west of the application site at Eye and Langton Grove; 
ï¿½ 
People using the network of PRoWs between Eye and Castleton 
Way; 
ï¿½ 
Road users and pedestrians using Castleton Way; and 
ï¿½ 
Walkers using public footpaths contiguous with the airfield runways 
and the western and southern boundaries of the application site 
(heritage site). 
11.8.36 
Based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that the impacts 
identified above arising as a result of Gas Connection Option 1, will 
have a [slight significance providing there is minimal loss of screen 
planting along the southern boundary of the National Grid Compressor 
Station. This preliminary assessment is based on PPL's current 
understanding of the visual impacts, which may change following 
further assessment work albeit it is not considered that any change in 
assessment conclusion will be significant). 
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 2 
11.8.37 
Gas Connection Option 2 would be approximately 1.5km in length and 
would be sited within agricultural land. The MOC or Above Ground 
Installation would be sited close to Castleton Way. 
Construction 
11.8.38 
Construction impacts would be similar to those described for Gas 
Connection option 1 above with the addition of the MOC facility and 
perimeter security fence. 
Operation 
11.8.39 
Operational impacts would be similar to those described for Gas 
Connection option 1 above with the addition of the permanent MOC 
industrial structures enclosed by security fencing 2m high. 
Decommissioning 
11.8.40 
Decommissioning impacts would be similar to those described for Gas 
Connection option 1 above.

Preliminary assessment of impacts on landscape and landscape 
character 
11.8.41 
The introduction of the proposed industrial structures, security fencing 
and hard surfacing will add man-made elements to an area of rural 
landscape. Although the gas connection would be seen in the context 
of similar structures within the airfield they would be sited at a distance 
of >0.6km within agricultural land where they would appear 
incongruous until future development is undertaken in adjacent areas at 
former Eye Airfield.  
11.8.42 
The direct effects in terms of landscape losses or change to the Gas 
Connection Option 2 area are as follows: 
ï¿½ 
Permanent displacement of a small area of farmland for the MOC 
and access road; 
ï¿½ 
Temporary displacement of an area of farmland for the construction 
works; and 
ï¿½ 
Mitigation tree and shrub screen planting surrounding the MOC. 
11.8.43 
The Gas Connection Option 2 area lies within the F â Rural lane 
landscape character area in the EADF, and has high sensitivity to 
change. Landscape character in the immediate vicinity of the site will 
be changed by the introduction of the gas connection and other 
planned industrial development. Mitigation screen planting will be 
undertaken along the perimeter of the subject to National Grid 
constraints. 
11.8.44 
The impact of the proposed gas connection on the adjacent local and 
national landscape character areas will be addressed in the final 
landscape and visual impact assessment produced as part of the final 
EIA. However, based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that 
the impacts identified above arising as a result of Gas Connection 
Option 2, will have a slight significance]. This preliminary assessment is 
based on PPL's current understanding of the landscape impacts, which 
may change following further assessment work (albeit it is not 
considered that any change in assessment conclusion will be 
significant).  
Preliminary assessment of impacts on visual amenity 
11.8.45 
The visual impact of the gas connection compound will be similar to 
Gas Connection option 1, and site survey will verify the extent of 
potential visibility.

11.8.46 
The proposed gas connection compound will be visible from the wider 
landscape to the south. Mitigation planting will screen views of the 
lower level structures and ground level activities.  
11.8.47 
The main receptors with potential views of the Gas Connection Option 
2 are. 
ï¿½ 
People using the network of public footpaths between Eye Airfield 
and Castleton Way; 
ï¿½ 
Road users and pedestrians using Castleton Way; and

Walkers using public footpaths contiguous with the airfield runways 
and the western and southern boundaries of the Project site 
(heritage site).

Based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that the impacts 
identified above arising as a result of Gas Connection Option 2, will 
have a slight significance]. This preliminary assessment is based on 
PPL's current understanding of the visual impacts, which may change 
following further assessment work (albeit it is not considered that any 
change in assessment conclusion will be significant).  
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND CONNECTION  
11.8.49 
The assessment considers two options for the location of the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound to the west of the 
Power Generation Plant site adjacent to the existing 400 kV 
transmission system. In order to avoid adverse visual impact the cables 
would be buried underground. The Electrical Connection Compound 
would be sited close to the existing overhead transmission line due 
west of the Power Generation Plant and A140.  
11.8.50 
The Electrical Connection Compound and surrounding mitigation 
planting will be designed to fit in with the rectangular field pattern. 
Existing hedgerows will form the boundaries to the compound on one 
or two sides to assimilate it into the landscape. Mitigation screen 
planting will contain the same species of trees and shrubs as 
hedgerows nearby and include a high proportion of hedgerow trees. 
Tree and shrub planting will be constrained near the underground 
cable. 
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND CONNECTION 
OPTION 1 
11.8.51 
Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1 is 
located within agricultural land to the south of The Leys and north of 
Mellis Road. It would be sited within arable land characterised by small 
to medium scale rectangular fields enclosed by tall hedges. The route

would be designed to avoid loss of hedgerows and disruption to 
agriculture. 
Construction 
11.8.52 
Potential adverse temporary landscape and visual impacts will arise 
from the following activities: 
ï¿½ 
Site clearance and removal of vegetation from the Electrical 
Connection Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1 area;  
ï¿½ 
Topsoil and subsoil stripping from agricultural land and temporary 
stockpiles; 
ï¿½ 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
ï¿½ 
Construction of an internal road for access to the electrical 
connection compound; 
ï¿½ 
Movement of construction related traffic including delivery and 
removal of materials to and from the Electrical Connection 
Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1, off-site road traffic 
including workers travelling to and from Electrical Connection 
Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1; 
ï¿½ 
General construction activities including the movement of 
construction equipment, a site compound, temporary buildings, 
parking, materials stockpiles, protective fencing, and signage;  
ï¿½ 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months; 
and 
ï¿½ 
Construction of the electrical connection structures and perimeter 
security fence. 
Sources of impact during operation 
11.8.53 
The following long term actions will contribute to the landscape and 
visual impact from the Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection Option 1:  
ï¿½ 
The introduction of permanent industrial structures up to 12 m high 
enclosed by security fencing 2m high set within rural landscape; 
ï¿½ 
Loss of agricultural land; 
ï¿½ 
Perimeter hedge or woodland planting to screen the compound; 
and 
ï¿½ 
New access road and operational traffic.

Sources of impact during decommissioning 
11.8.54 
Temporary landscape and visual impacts similar to those described for 
construction are likely to arise during decommissioning.  
Preliminary assessment of impacts on landscape and landscape 
character 
11.8.55 
The introduction of the proposed industrial structures, security fencing 
and hard surfacing will add incongruous man-made elements to the 
landscape. The structures would be of a significant scale and would be 
visible over a wide area, particularly during the winter months following 
leaf fall. 
11.8.56 
The direct effects in terms of landscape losses or change on the site 
are as follows: 
ï¿½ 
Permanent displacement of an area of farmland covering the full 
extent of the electrical connection compound and access road;  
ï¿½ 
Temporary displacement of a wide (~30m) area of farmland along 
the length of the electrical connection for the construction works; 
ï¿½ 
Permanent displacement of a narrow (~10m) area of farmland 
along the length of the electrical connection for the operational 
access; and  
ï¿½ 
Removal of hedgerows to accommodate the construction trench 
and subsequent reinstatement planting. 
11.8.57 
The Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection Option 
1 site lies within the Ancient Plateau Claylands landscape character 
area which is described in the baseline study. Landscape character in 
the immediate vicinity of the Electrical Connection Compound and 
Electrical Connection Option 1 will be directly affected by the 
introduction of industrial development. However, the proposed 
Electrical Connection Compound would be sited adjacent to the 
existing high voltage overhead transmission line that runs roughly 
parallel with the A140.  
11.8.58 
The impact of the proposed electrical connection on the adjacent local 
and national landscape character areas will be addressed in the final 
landscape and visual impact assessment produced as part of the final 
EIA. However, based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that 
the impacts identified above arising as a result of Electrical Connection 
Compound and Electrical Connection Option 1, will have a slight 
significance over a localised area This preliminary assessment is based 
on PPL's current understanding of the landscape impacts, which may

change following further assessment work (albeit it is not considered 
that any change in assessment conclusion will be significant).  
Preliminary assessment of impacts on visual amenity 
11.8.59 
The visual impact of the Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 will 
be addressed in the landscape and visual impact assessment produced 
for the ES. The extent of visibility of the proposal will be assessed 
through site work undertaken during the winter months when screening 
from existing hedgerows is least effective. For the purposes of this 
report, visual impact has been considered on the basis of the 
preliminary site visit from the locations described below.  
11.8.60 
The proposed Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 will be visible 
from the wider landscape in all directions. Views will be limited to the 
upper part of the structures above and through intervening hedgerows. 
The dense network of tall hedgerows with trees near the compound will 
screen or filter views of the lower structures and security fencing. 
11.8.61 
The main receptors with potential views of the Electrical Connection 
Compound Option 1 include: 
ï¿½ 
Residents at the edges of settlements located to the south, west 
and north at Yaxley, Mellis, Thrandeston and Goswold Hall 
respectively; 
ï¿½ 
Public footpath users in the vicinity of Goswold Hall, including the 
bridleway along Love Lane to the east, and the bridleway along 
Green Lane to the west; and 
ï¿½ 
Road users on the A140 road travelling in both directions. 
11.8.62 
Based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that the impacts 
identified above arising as a result of the Electrical Connection Option 1 
and Electrical Connection Compound Option 1, will have a moderate 
significance over a localised area. This preliminary assessment is 
based on PPL's current understanding of the visual impacts, which may 
change following further assessment work (albeit it is not considered 
that any change in assessment conclusion will be significant).  
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION COMPOUND AND ELECTRICAL 
CONNECTION OPTION 2 
11.8.63 
The Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection Option 
2 site is located within agricultural land to the north east of The Leys 
and west of Love Lane. It would be sited within arable land 
characterised by medium scale fields where hedges have been 
removed to facilitate arable farming. The route would be designed to 
avoid loss of natural features, hedgerows and disruption to agriculture.

The Electrical Connection Option 2 and Electrical Connection 
Compound Option 2 area also lies within the Ancient Plateau Claylands 
landscape character area. Impacts on landscape and landscape 
character would be similar to Electrical Connection Option 1 and 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1 and the proposed industrial 
structures, security fencing and hard surfacing would be incongruous 
within the wider landscape. However, they would relate logically to the 
existing overhead transmission line. The structures would be of a 
significant scale and would be visible over a wide area, particularly 
during the winter months following leaf fall. 
11.8.68 
The impact of the proposed electrical connection on the adjacent local 
and national landscape character areas will be addressed in the final 
landscape and visual impact assessment produced as part of the final

location may provide more screening than the vegetation surrounding 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1.  
11.8.70 
The main receptors with potential views of the Electrical Connection 
Compound Option 2 include: 
ï¿½ 
Residents at the edges of settlements located to the south and 
west at Yaxley and Mellis respectively; 
ï¿½ 
People using PRoWs including the bridleway along Love Lane to 
the east, and the bridleway along Green Lane to the west; and 
ï¿½ 
Road users on the A140 road travelling in both directions. 
11.8.71 
Based on a preliminary assessment it is considered that the impacts 
identified above arising as a result of the Electrical Connection Option 2 
and Electrical Connection Compound Option 2, will have a moderate 
significance over a localised area. This preliminary assessment is 
based on PPL's current understanding of the visual impacts, which may 
change following further assessment work (albeit it is not considered 
that any change in assessment conclusion will be significant).  
 
11.9 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
11.9.1 
Mitigation of adverse environmental impacts can be achieved by 
avoidance, reduction, remedying of, or compensation. Primary 
mitigation measures form an intrinsic part of the proposed Project 
design through an iterative process. Secondary mitigation measures 
are those that are designed to address specifically the remaining 
(residual) adverse effects of the final development proposals.  
11.9.2 
Mitigation will be developed in the ES to provide a landscape strategy 
for the development that will fulfil relevant objectives illustrated in the 
Eye Airfield landscape Strategy (Dwg. No. 2162/D10) and the 
Development Brief.  Section 2.7 of the Eye Airfield Development Brief, 
Views and visual sensitivities, provides the following guidance for 
mitigation that will be developed in the landscape strategy for the 
proposed development: 
ï¿½ 
âCare should be taken in the design of any future development 
proposal that might impact on the viewpoints of greatest sensitivity 
and amenity. This will include resisting development in areas of 
highest sensitivity, and guiding development to areas of lower 
sensitivity;

ï¿½ 
Where development takes place, careful consideration should be 
given to siting, scale, colour and massing of development and how 
its impacts might be mitigated;  
ï¿½ 
There are opportunities to enhance views by introducing 
shelterbelts 
and 
reinforcing 
hedgerows 
and 
tree 
belts, 
strengthening important wooded ridgeline characteristics. The 
general area of the site that contributes most to visual amenity, and 
from where views of highest sensitivity are located is the southern 
part of the site (character area A);  
ï¿½ 
The rural lane corridor along Castleton Way is considered 
particularly sensitive, due to the proximity of public footpaths and 
footpaths that link to it, and its topography of slopes falling to the 
south. Viewed from the south, character area A slopes up to a 
horizon occupied by the existing industrial estates and the planted 
tree belt south of the compressor site; and 
ï¿½ 
A consistent approach is required for strategic landscape planting 
across the site that could be reasonably expected to mitigate and 
minimise the landscape and visual impact of the development.â 
11.9.3 
Under âLandscape Design Codeâ the Development Brief provides the 
following specific design guidance: 
ï¿½ 
âThe landscape structure of the airfield site is to be reinforced and 
extended with an objective to connect with landscape features 
beyond the site boundary; 
ï¿½ 
The historical features of the site of significance are to be retained 
and incorporated into the strategic layout of the site; 
ï¿½ 
Any new development incorporating chimneys, flues, masts or 
other vertical structures and tall industrial buildings should be 
sensitively planned, sited and designed, and carefully considered in 
relation to sensitive local views; 
ï¿½ 
Proposals for landscape mitigation should be commensurate with 
the landscape and visual impacts of development proposals; 
ï¿½ 
Lighting, particularly exterior lighting, should be designed and 
installed so it minimises detrimental landscape and visual impacts; 
ï¿½ 
A range of appropriate tree and shrub species should be used, 
having due regard for the requirements of the National Grid 
guidance where planting is near to pipelines.â 
11.9.4 
Recommendations for landscape mitigation within the vicinity of the 
Project Site contained in the Eye Airfield Landscape Strategy relate to 
the provision of structure planting adjacent to the airfield runways.

- 362 - 
 
Planting should typically be native species hedgerows comprising 
predominantly hawthorn with oak and field maple standards. 
11.9.5 
Mitigation planting along the western and southern boundaries of the 
Project Site adjacent to the airfield runways would be a key landscape 
feature of the proposed Project and the wider airfield. Planting along 
the western boundary of the application site would be part of a greater 
length of structure planting adjacent to the main north â south runway 
where the main objective is to emphasise the historic runway. 
Therefore, it is essential that all planting is similar in form, species 
composition and management to provide a uniform appearance. The 
structure planting could be either a woodland belt or a hedgerow with 
hedgerow trees.  
11.9.6 
Similarly, the same planting theme should continue along the southern 
boundary adjacent to the east â west runway. Planting in both locations 
should be sited outside the proposed Project site perimeter security 
fence to screen the industrial fence and provide a âgreenâ edge adjacent 
to the runways. Further consultation will be undertaken with MSDC 
prior to developing structure planting proposals in areas of the site 
adjacent to the runways. 
11.9.7 
Planting constraints are likely to exist in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
They may include buried archaeology, ecological habitats, and 
underground or overhead services. All restrictions will be identified prior 
to developing the site landscape strategy. Mitigation planting will be 
developed to fulfil ecological objectives and enhance biodiversity where 
possible. The landscape strategy will comprise proposals for planting 
and its subsequent management for a minimum period of 5 years to 
ensure the landscape objectives are achieved successfully. 
11.9.8 
As part of the iterative design process for the development, primary 
mitigation relating to the design, layout, selection of materials and 
colours 
for 
the 
proposed 
Project 
structures 
and 
associated 
infrastructure will be reviewed following this preliminary assessment. 
Planting to screen views from highly sensitive receptors will be 
incorporated into the site landscape strategy where practical. 
Construction  
11.9.9 
During construction, the following measures would be included in the 
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP): 
ï¿½ 
Limiting land clearance and occupation to the minimum necessary 
for the works; 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report 
 
PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff

- 363 - 
 
ï¿½ 
Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to 
be retained in accordance with current industry standards and 
recognised best practice;  
ï¿½ 
Temporary storage of topsoil and any other material considered of 
value for retention. Where practical stores would be sited to screen 
the construction works from highly sensitive receptors; 
ï¿½ 
Design and layout of site construction areas to reduce adverse 
impacts arising from the temporary security fencing and lighting;  
ï¿½ 
Agreed site access routes; 
ï¿½ 
Restricting construction site lighting outside normal working hours 
to the minimum required for workforce and public safety and 
security. Directional luminaries to be used to limit unwanted light 
spill; 
ï¿½ 
Maintenance of tidy and contained site compound; 
ï¿½ 
Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary 
structures and stockpiles when no longer required, and prompt 
reinstatement of temporary construction areas; 
ï¿½ 
Spreading of topsoil, reseeding and planting within the application 
site and adjoining areas of agricultural land that are to be reinstated 
as soon as possible after sections of work are complete; and 
ï¿½ 
Management of all reinstated area in accordance with a 5 year 
aftercare plan to ensure full and successful establishment of the 
planting and agricultural areas to the approval of the planning 
authority.  
Operation 
11.9.10 
To summarise, during operation mitigation would include:  
ï¿½ 
The high quality design of the proposed buildings, structures and 
perimeter security fencing; 
ï¿½ 
Neutral colours with a matt finish to reduce the visual impact of new 
structures. Colours will be selected to blend with existing buildings 
within  Eye  Airfield.  They  will  be  agreed  with  MSDC  /  SCC  and  
discussed in more detail in the ES and the Design and Access 
Statement 
ï¿½ 
Structure / hedgerow planting on the perimeter of the site to reduce 
views of ground level operational activities, and to emphasise the 
airfield runway corridors (historic features); 
ï¿½ 
Planting with native species of trees and shrubs similar to those 
present nearby, using local provenance stock wherever possible, in

order to enhance biodiversity and connect habitats to form an 
ecological network; 
ï¿½ 
Amenity planting at the site entrance using a proportion of large 
size trees for immediate effect; and 
ï¿½ 
The design of external lighting to reduce trespass, glare and 
spillage and by restricting usage to the minimum periods required. 
Decommissioning 
11.9.11 
Similar mitigation measures to those described above for construction 
would be implemented during decommissioning.  
11.10 
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Effects 
11.10.1 
The preliminary assessment described above has concluded that direct 
effects on the landscape fabric, character and views will arise during 
construction and operation of the proposed Project. Further detailed 
assessment will be undertaken to establish the significance of the 
landscape and visual effects, and will be presented in the ES. 
11.10.2 
This preliminary assessment will inform the development of the design 
of the proposed Project to ensure embedded and secondary mitigation 
measures are incorporated to avoid or reduce adverse residual 
landscape and visual effects wherever possible. Landscape mitigation 
described above will be developed following guidance set out in the 
EADF and Landscape Strategy. 
11.10.3 
No overall significant effects are likely to arise on designated Village 
Greens, Common Land or Open Access Land, or on locally designated 
Special Landscape Areas within the study area. 
11.10.4 
The potential for visual effects on settlement within the study area 
would be restricted to the outer edges of settlements nearest to the 
proposed Project at Eye, Yaxley, Mellis Green, Palgrave, Thornham 
Parva, Thrandeston, Stuston and Brome. Winter site survey will be 
undertaken to establish the extent of change in the composition of 
existing views. From the preliminary assessment no significant visual 
effects are predicted to arise. 
11.10.5 
Potential visual effects will arise to PRoWs within the southern part of 
Eye Airfield extending to Castleton Way including the airfield runways 
(heritage site), and to bridleways at Love Lane and Green Lane to the 
west of the A140. Significant effects of short term duration are 
predicted during construction and would be mitigated by screen 
planting during operation.

11.10.6 
The Power Generation Plant would be sited within an area of the 
former Eye Airfield where it would be seen in the context of similar 
industrial 
buildings, 
wind 
turbines 
and 
mature 
woodland 
belts/hedgerows. It would be sited near the National Grid Transmission 
Station and the chicken litter biomass power station, which comprise 
industrial building and stacks similar in scale to those proposed. The 
height of the Power Generation Plant stacks would be no more than 
30m high, significantly lower than the 40m high stack within the 
biomass power station. The scale of the stacks and taller structures 
would be modified by existing and proposed wind turbines >100 m high 
to the north and west of the Power Generation Plant. Potentially 
significant landscape and visual effects would be localised and would 
reduce as screen planting matures and adjacent open land to the south 
is developed by others. It will be designed to meet relevant landscape 
and visual objectives set out in the EADF, and will be sited within an 
area of Eye Airfield that has the capacity to accommodate development 
of the nature and scale proposed.  
11.10.7 
Landscape and visual impacts from the proposed Electrical Connection 
will be substantially mitigated by burying the cables underground. 
Options 1 and 2 for the Electrical Connection Compound will result in 
the introduction of incongruous industrial structures in the surrounding 
rural landscape, and loss of agricultural land. Effects would be reduced 
by micrositing the Electrical Connection Compound within the existing 
field pattern and by screen planting using native species. A similar 
approach will be taken for the gas connection above ground 
installation. 
11.10.8 
It is considered that potential landscape and visual effects would be 
localised due to the industrial character of the area surrounding the 
proposed Project, and by the extensive network of hedgerows and 
woodland within the vicinity of the Project Site. 
11.11 
Next Steps 
11.11.1 
A full LVIA will be undertaken in accordance with the assessment 
methodology and significance criteria, to determine potential significant 
landscape and visual impacts and to develop appropriate mitigation. It 
has not been possible to carry out the full assessment at this stage due 
to foliage that provides screening. This foliage prevents a worst-case 
assessment from being carried out and thus a full assessment will be 
carried out later in 2013 when the screening effects from plants are at 
their lowest. 
11.11.2 
Further consultation will be undertaken with MSDC, BDC, SNC to and 
SCC select viewpoints to be assessed in the LVIA. Photomontages 
(including night time views) and wireframes of the proposed Project will

be produced from selected viewpoints in consultation with the local 
planning authorities.  
11.11.3 
Consultation will be undertaken with MSDC and SCC with respect to 
the landscape strategy for the Project site in areas adjoining the historic 
airfield runways.

WASTE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH  
12.1 
Introduction 
12.1.1 
This Section of the PEIR addresses the waste management strategy 
and potential public health impacts of the proposed Project.  
12.1.2 
At present, it is anticipated that the main potential impacts to human 
health arising from the proposed Project will result from changes to 
local air quality during the construction, operation and demolition 
stages. However, as with any project of this magnitude, there are also 
potential impacts arising from pollution incidents, site run-off and noise 
impacts.  
12.1.3 
The biggest potential impacts regarding waste management will be 
from site preparation during construction.  
12.1.4 
The results of preliminary technical assessments relating to specific 
environmental impacts are presented in Sections 6 to 11 and 13-14 of 
this PEIR. The aims of this section therefore are to: 
ï¿½ 
Identify impacts arising from the generation of waste during the 
construction, operational and decommissioning stages of the 
Project and assess the significance of these impacts and how they 
can be mitigated.  
ï¿½ 
Describe other potential impacts arising from the Project that may 
be detrimental to human health and how these impacts can be 
mitigated. 
12.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements 
12.2.2 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) sets out 
assessment principles that are particularly likely to be relevant to 
energy NSIPs. In relation to waste and health related impacts it states: 
ï¿½ 
Safety (paragraph 4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): 
describes the relationship with other regimes and the general 
requirement that the decision maker will need to be satisfied that 
they are complied with.  
ï¿½ 
Health (4.13): requires that an assessment of potential health 
impacts is made in relation to each element of the proposed 
Project, such as in relation to air quality, waste or noise and 
describing the relationship with other regimes, stating at 4.13.5 that 
where separate air quality regulations are (or will be) satisfied then

- 370 - 
 
the decision maker is likely to consider these effective mitigation, 
whereas for noise or other aspects it will take account of health 
concerns when setting requirements.  
ï¿½ 
Waste Management (5.14): requires that waste is managed 
through the âwaste hierarchyâ, explains the relationship with the 
environmental permitting (EP) regime, and sets assessment 
principles to be used by the Secretary of State in determining an 
application for a DCO for an energy NSIP. These include the 
suggestion of a site waste management plan within the application, 
demonstrating that waste volumes are minimised, the impacts of at 
least the first five years of operation are assessed, and that waste 
is properly managed.  
Other National and Local Policy 
12.2.3 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
12.2.4 
The National Planning Policy Framework (2012) sets out the 
Governmentâs view of the principles of sustainable development along 
with guidance for local authority development planning and decisions 
on applications for planning permission. It seeks at paragraph 120 that 
planning policies and decisions should ensure that new development is 
appropriate for its location. The effects (including cumulative effects) of 
pollution on health, the natural environment or general amenity, and the 
potential sensitivity of the area or proposed development to adverse 
effects from pollution, should be taken into account. 
12.2.5 
Policy CS4 of the Mid Suffolk Core Strategy 2008 seeks to protect 
people and the environment from unsafe or unhealthy pollutants, by 
avoiding development that harms the quality of soil or air and/or causes 
noise, dust, odour or light pollution wherever possible. 
12.2.6 
The Suffolk County Council Minerals and Waste Development 
Framework Provides the policy framework for determining minerals and 
waste planning applications. The Waste Core Strategy DPD (adopted 
2011) covers the period to 2026 and establishes the overarching 
principles and policy direction for determining waste planning 
applications within Suffolk during this period. It also identifies strategic 
waste management sites across the County.

12.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
12.3.1 
In respect of waste management and health, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed project parameters (which are 
described in Section 4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 12.1 below.  
12.3.2 
The reason that the parameters identified in Table 12.1 represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to waste management and health 
impacts are that a greater number of GTG units will give rise to more 
waste during operation (e.g. more filters, more waste water from blade 
washing) and, as described in Sections 6 and 7 of this PEIR, give the 
largest potential in terms of air quality and noise, which, in turn has the 
potential for more detrimental impacts on human health.  
12.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connections is presented in this section. A decision on 
the preferred option for each will be taken following consultation. An 
assessment of the Electrical Connection Compound siting options will 
be provided in the full ES.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
12.4.1 
The assessment methodology and significance criteria used in this 
section differ for each of the potential impacts considered. They are set 
out in detail in Sections 6-11 and 13-14 of this PEIR. Where the 
methodology differs for determining impacts specific to human health, 
these have been stated.  
12.5 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
12.5.1 
The study area and specific receptors for each area of impact 
considered within this PEIR (Sections 6 to 14) are discussed in those 
sections.  
12.5.2 
In general, for public health impacts to be realised, the following must 
exist:

ï¿½ 
A source of (e.g.) contamination, dust or nuisance noise;  
ï¿½ 
A pathway; and 
ï¿½ 
A human receptor.  
12.5.3 
Given the nature of the proposed Project, there are potential sources of 
contamination (e.g. stack emissions may result in a change in air 
quality). Therefore, to minimise public health impacts, the sources must 
be controlled and / or pathways to receptors must be blocked.  
12.5.4 
Receptors can become exposed to contamination via dermal contact, 
oral contact or inhalation of a contaminated medium. Receptor 
sensitivity varies in relation to health, age and duration of exposure. 
12.5.5 
In this Section, potential receptor groups refer only to human receptors 
that could potentially come into contact with contaminants resulting 
from the Project: These receptors include: 
ï¿½ 
Residents of surrounding towns / villages; 
ï¿½ 
Adjacent commercial users; 
ï¿½ 
Recipients of agricultural produce; 
ï¿½ 
Recreational users (e.g. users of public rights of way); and  
ï¿½ 
Users of transport infrastructure.  
12.5.6 
Surrounding towns and villages include: 
ï¿½ 
Eye (1.7 km south east of the Power Generation Plant);  
ï¿½ 
Langton Green (1.3 km east of the Power Generation Plant);  
ï¿½ 
Yaxley (1.5 km South West of the Power Generation Plant); and  
ï¿½ 
Diss (4.75 km north of the Power Generation Plant).  
12.5.7 
Adjacent commercial users include other businesses within the Eye 
Airfield Industrial Estate.  
12.5.8 
Section 3 of this PEIR provides further details of the proposed Project 
redline boundary and its surroundings.  
12.6 
Air Quality 
12.6.1 
Section 5 of this PEIR provides a description of the preliminary 
assessment of the air quality impacts of the proposed Project 
undertaken as part of the EIA process.  
12.6.2 
The identified primary pollutants of concern from an air quality 
perspective are:

ï¿½ 
Dust (PM10 and PM2.5) during construction activities; and 
ï¿½ 
Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) during operation. 
12.6.3 
Elevated levels of these pollutants could cause negative health impacts 
to human receptors, including both cardiovascular and respiratory 
problems9. Children are particularly susceptible with regards to 
elevated NOx concentrations, and epidemiological studies have 
revealed the prolonged exposure to elevated NOx concentrations 
reduces lung function in children. 
12.6.4 
DEFRA provides health banding for concentrations of air pollutants 
likely to induce public health impacts in susceptible individuals10. These 
can be used as guidelines against which the human health impact of 
emissions to air can be assessed. For PM10 and  NOx, details are 
provided in Table 12.2.

12.6.5 
Additionally, the AQS Regulations specify a series of standards and 
objectives for air quality in the UK. The objectives are summarised in 
Section 6 of this PEIR.  
Construction - whole Project 
12.6.6 
During construction, dust emissions from the proposed Project will not 
be more significant than those normally encountered on construction 
sites. The dust particles that may be emitted during construction would 
be of large diameter and would therefore tend to resettle on the ground 
within 100 m to 500 m of the source; approximately 70 per cent of the 
dust would generally settle out of the atmosphere within 200 m, and 
less than 10 per cent could be expected to remain at a distance of 
400 m. This is reflected in the distance-related significance criteria 
presented in Section 5 of this PEIR.  
12.6.7 
The nearest housing is approximately 600m east of the Power 
Generation Plant boundary and approximately 200m from the Gas and 
Electrical Connections. . Therefore there is little potential that these 
properties could be impacted by dust from construction activities.  
12.6.8 
In order to limit any impacts, a CEMP will be prepared prior to 
construction, which will be prepared in accordance with the outline 
CEMP to be produced as an Appendix to the final EIA. This will require 
PPL and its contractors to implement a comprehensive dust 
suppression / mitigation and monitoring programme, based on âThe 
control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition â Best 
Practice 
Guidanceâ 
(Greater 
London 
Authority, 
2006). 
The 
implementation of these mitigation measures, as appropriate to the 
level of risk for each area / activity within the construction site (and the 
access roads to the site) will ensure that the impact of dust emissions 
from the construction site will not be significant. This will prevent 
construction work generating levels of atmospheric dust and emissions 
which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to local people or 
industry. 
Operation â Power Generation Plant 
12.6.9 
To accommodate all operating scenarios for the Power Generation 
Plant, a stack height of at least 20 m would be required in order to 
ensure adequate dispersion of the principal emissions. This minimum 
height would be secured by provisions in the draft DCO submitted as 
part of the application for a DCO for the proposed Project.

12.6.10 
The preliminary results of the air dispersion modelling studies are 
presented in Section 5.5 of this PEIR which presents the anticipated 
maximum process contribution to ground level concentrations of the 
identified pollutants as a result of operation of the Power Generation 
Plant, together with an assessment of the significance of the resulting 
total predicted environmental concentration. 
12.6.11 
Based on the bandings shown in Table 12. and the anticipated air 
quality impacts (including the maximum predicted environmental 
concentration) of the Power Generation Plant detailed in Section 6.5 it 
is extremely unlikely that the Power Generation Plant will have any 
adverse public health impacts with respect to air quality.  
12.6.12 
Furthermore, in order that the Power Generation Plant operates in 
accordance with the appropriate legislation and guidance, and to avoid 
air quality reaching prolonged unsafe levels, the Power Generation 
Plant will be designed in accordance with BAT as outlined in the 
âReference Document on Best Available Techniques for Large 
Combustion Plantâ (EU IPPC Bureau, 2006) and the Environment 
Agency (EA) Sector Guidance Note âHow to comply with your 
environmental permit: Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01)â (2009). This 
will be addressed through the Environmental Permit for the proposed 
Project. 
12.6.13 
The air quality assessment will also addresses the potential for impacts 
arising from increased vehicle movements as a result construction of 
the Project. 
Operation â Gas and Electrical Connection route corridor options 
and Electrical Substation options 
12.6.14 
During operation, it is not anticipated that there will be any impacts on 
air quality from the gas and electrical connections. They will not emit 
any pollutants and will require only very occasional maintenance which 
would generate an insignificant number of vehicle movements.  
Decommissioning - whole project 
12.6.15 
Works to decommission the Power Generation Plant, Electrical 
Connection Compound and Gas and Electrical Connection will be 
similar to those for construction. Therefore, the assessment undertaken 
for the construction phase is capable of acting as a proxy in each case 
for the demolition and decommissioning of the proposed Project. The 
air quality assessment has adopted this approach. Therefore, the air 
quality impacts from decommissioning on public health will be similar to 
those for construction. A demolition and restoration plan, which will 
mitigate any effects on public health from the decommissioning of the

proposed Project will be submitted to and agreed with MSDC / 
Environment Agency as a condition attached to the DCO. 
Conclusion 
12.6.16 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that the proposed Project will result in no likely significant effects on 
public health with respect to air quality. 
12.7 
Noise and Vibration 
12.7.1 
Section 7 provides details of the preliminary noise and vibration impact 
assessment undertaken for the development of the proposed Project.  
12.7.2 
The existing baseline conditions at noise sensitive receptors in the 
vicinity of the proposed Power Generation Plant site have been 
established by way of an attended noise survey as outlined in Section 
10.4 â Baseline Conditions and Receptors.  
12.7.3 
In order to determine the study area for the noise impact assessment, 
MSDC and the EA were consulted in order to agree a baseline noise 
survey methodology for the EIA for the Project. These discussions 
identified the nearest residential properties that could potentially be 
affected by noise generated during construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project, and considered to be noise sensitive 
receptors (NSR).  
12.7.4 
The Power Generation Plant site comprises land on the Eye Airfield 
industrial estate. The surrounding area is mainly open agricultural land 
with scattered residential dwellings. The small town of Eye is at a 
distance of approximately 1.3 km to the south east of the Power 
Generation Plant site, and the village of Yaxley at a distance of 800 m 
to the south west. The baseline noise climate in the area is largely 
dominated by road traffic during the daytime. During the night time 
when road traffic levels reduce a continuous low level noise is audible 
from the existing Eye Chicken Litter Power Plant.   
12.7.5 
The proximity of other noise-sensitive locations has also been 
considered as part of this assessment (see Section 10 â Noise and 
Vibration).  
12.7.6 
If a rural area is gradually developed with industrial facilities the level of 
background noise in that area has the potential to rise progressively 
over time with each new development. This progressive increase in 
background noise level is termed as âcreeping backgroundâ. Creeping 
background noise levels can be avoided by careful assessment at the 
planning stage for a new development. As such, the noise impact

- 377 - 
 
assessments undertaken as part of the EIA for the proposed Project 
will consider the available historic background noise data, and use the 
lowest measured background noise data of all available noise survey 
information as the baseline assessment conditions for the Project. The 
intention of this cumulative assessment approach is to assess and 
mitigate further incremental increases to the background noise climate 
by new development. 
Construction  
12.7.7 
Construction activity inevitably leads to some degree of noise 
disturbance at locations in close proximity to the construction activities. 
It is however a temporary source of noise (between 18 and 36 months). 
Noise levels at any one location will vary as different combinations of 
plant and machinery are used, and throughout the construction of the 
proposed Project as the construction activities and locations change. 
12.7.8 
Construction activities will not be undertaken outside of the core 
working hours, these are currently understood to be: weekdays 
07:00hrs to 19:00hrs, and Saturdays 07:00hrs to 13:00hrs unless prior 
agreement is reached with MSDC. 
12.7.9 
The outline construction noise assessment identifies that the predicted 
cumulative construction level is below the daytime limit of 65 dB(A), 
and the evening and weekend limit of 55 dB(A) at all receptors. 
Therefore, the significance of the overall impact of construction noise is 
predicted to be minor at all NSR locations and therefore deemed 
insignificant in EIA terms (as set out in Section 7.4).  
12.7.10 
Noise generating activities during construction will also be subject to 
the approved CEMP. This will be secured by a requirement for the 
submission to and approval by MSDC of a CEMP (an outline of which 
will be produced as an Appendix to the final ES). In addition, a 
requirement attached to the DCO will control noise levels at residential 
locations, and provide for the monitoring of noise levels at these 
locations during construction. 
12.7.11 
Construction of the Gas Connection is expected to lead to the 
generation of some short-term construction noise, primarily from the 
excavation of the trench in which the pipeline will sit. However, at any 
one location, the construction activities will only occur for a short period 
of time as the active working width moves along the gas pipeline route. 
In some locations the impact will be no greater than that experienced 
currently with the movement of agricultural machinery. Therefore a 
preliminary assessment of the significance of noise impacts can be 
considered as minor.

12.7.12 
Given the similarity of the two gas connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes.  
Operation - Power Generation Plant 
12.7.13 
The computer noise modelling software CadnaA (Version 4.1), which 
uses the ISO 9613 propagation algorithms has been used to undertake 
a provisional noise calculation. The model estimates the contribution to 
noise levels at each NSR location, and has been created using a 
representative sound power level for the whole Project. 
12.7.14 
The model is intended to provide an indicative assessment only for the 
operational phase of the Project.  
12.7.15 
The detailed operational noise modelling will be undertaken as part of 
the EIA, when full details of all plant items will be available.  
12.7.16 
The predicted noise levels at sensitive receptors from the Project are 
used to inform the BS 4142 operational noise assessment. 
12.7.17 
BS 4142 provides a methodology for the assessment of industrial noise 
in mixed residential and industrial areas. In this case, the standard 
suggests obtaining an assessment level by comparing the existing 
background noise levels with the 'rating level', which is the predicted 
noise output of the Project, corrected to account for any acoustic 
features such as tonal or impulsive noises. The semantics used for 
assessing the likelihood of complaints due to the introduction of a new 
industrial noise source are as follows: 
ï¿½ When subtracting the background level from the rating level, 
the greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of 
complaints. 
ï¿½ A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that 
complaints are likely. 
ï¿½ A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance. 
ï¿½ If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely. 
12.7.18 
The results of the preliminary operational noise assessment show that 
at all locations the rating level is above the lowest measured

background noise level. Based on the preliminary assessment the 
impact of operational noise from the Power Generation Plant is 
considered to be moderate adverse at NSR locations 1, 2, 3, 5 & 6. 
Whilst at NSR location 4 the impact is considered to be major adverse. 
The impact (without mitigation) on these receptors from the Power 
Generation Plant are therefore considered to be significant in EIA 
terms. 
12.7.19 
It is noted that the operational noise predictions are subject to change 
following the detailed noise modelling that will be undertaken during the 
EIA. 
12.7.20 
A requirement attached to the DCO will require that an acoustic design 
report will be submitted to and approved by MSDC prior to 
commencement of construction. This will ensure that the proposed 
Project incorporates noise-minimising measures by design. A 
requirement will provide for the on-going monitoring of noise at the 
boundary of the proposed Project site boundary to ensure that the 
specified noise levels for operation are met. There are therefore not 
anticipated to be any remaining noise impacts following mitigation.  
Operation - Gas and Electrical Connections and the Electrical 
Connection Compound 
12.7.21 
During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the 
gas AGI. This may be a low âhumâ noise or âhissâ type of noise as the 
AGI regulates the flow of gas from the NTS to the Power Generation 
Plant.  
12.7.22 
This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to 
the AGI. Given that there are no residential properties in close proximity 
to the proposed location for the AGI, an initial assessment is that the 
operational noise from the AGI would be negligible.  
12.7.23 
It is possible that a low âhumâ may be audible during operation of the 
Electrical Connection Compound caused by the flow of electricity 
through the electrical equipment at the site. However, this noise is 
usually imperceptible except when within very close proximity or during 
specific meteorological conditions. An initial assessment is therefore 
that the operational noise from the Electrical Connection Compound 
would be negligible. 
Decommissioning 
12.7.24 
Works to decommission the plant and structures on the Power 
Generation Plant and Gas and Electrical Connections will be similar to 
those for construction. Therefore, the assessment undertaken for the

construction phase is capable of acting as a proxy in each case for the 
demolition and decommissioning of the proposed Project. A 
requirement attached to the DCO secures the submission to and 
approval by MSDC of a demolition and restoration plan, which will 
mitigate any effects on public health from the decommissioning of the 
proposed Project. 
Conclusion 
12.7.25 
Based on the results of the above noise and vibration assessments, it 
can be concluded that that the proposed Project will have no adverse 
effects during the construction phase. The preliminary results of the 
operational noise assessment suggest that noise impacts will range 
from moderate to major adverse. At this stage, these impacts are 
considered as significant in EIA terms. However, following further study 
and assessment of potential mitigation measures, there are not 
considered to be any significant residual impacts.  
12.8 
Water Quality and Resources 
12.8.1 
Section 8 â Water Quality and Section 9 â Geology and Ground 
Conditions 
provide 
the 
water 
quality 
and 
resources 
impact 
assessments to date. The public could be exposed to contaminated 
water via: 
ï¿½ 
The recreational use of contaminated water;  
ï¿½ 
Drinking contaminated drinking water; or, 
ï¿½ 
Consuming agricultural produce which has come into contact with 
contaminated water.  
12.8.2 
Children and the elderly will be most vulnerable to negative health 
effects. 
12.8.3 
Exposure to contaminated water can have a wide range of health 
impacts. For example, acute level exposure to Poly-aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) leads to red blood cell damage which can lead to 
anaemia and a suppressed immune system11.  
12.8.4 
Drinking water and surface water quality standards can be used to 
assess the safety of contamination levels. For example, the maximum

allowable concentration of PAHs in drinking water is 0.1 Âµg/l, with 
anything above this concentration deemed unsafe if ingested12.  
Construction â whole project 
12.8.5 
Several construction activities could require the disposal of water from 
the proposed Project site including wheel washing facilities, welfare 
facilities and water used for dowsing (e.g. of cutting operations or 
stockpiles) and surface water runoff, as well as de-watering activities as 
a result of e.g. foundation excavation.  
12.8.6 
Construction activities may, if uncontrolled, potentially cause changes 
to surface water drainage due to the creation of soil piles formed during 
on-site excavation, levelling and other such onâsite works. Impacts 
would be associated with the potential to alter the efficiency / 
performance of the existing land drainage systems both on-site and in 
the vicinity of the proposed Project site.  
Operation â Power Generation Plant  
12.8.7 
During the operation of a SCGT power plant which incorporates air 
cooling, the use of operational water is minimal, as water is not 
required for the generation of steam or for cooling.  
12.8.8 
As such, the water at the site during operation will be primarily for 
maintenance and domestic sanitation, with a small quantity required for 
NOx control. 
12.8.9 
This domestic / sanitary water will be discharged to a new septic tank 
prior to removal from site for disposal by a suitably licensed contractor. 
12.8.10 
There will be no uncontrolled discharge to neighbouring watercourses. 
12.8.11 
The proposed Project site will be predominantly covered with 
hardstanding and surface water from any potentially contaminated 
areas will be retained on-site. The surface water drainage system for 
any areas with the potential for oil contamination of any surface water 
will feed to sumps and will pass through the oil interceptor / filters prior 
to discharge to a dedicated surface water holding tank / attenuation 
pond. The design of the surface and foul water drainage scheme will be 
subject to approval by the EA and SCC prior to commencement of 
construction.

12.8.12 
Access to the proposed Power Generation Plant site will be strictly 
controlled and security measures will incorporate suitable fencing and 
the use of security cameras. These measures will be put in place to 
ensure controlled access to the proposed Project such that no 
unauthorised persons will come into contact with any potentially 
contaminated materials. Therefore no potential pathway exists to 
impact on public health from contaminated water on-site. 
12.8.13 
Given the depth (~17 m) and low hydraulic transitivity of the superficial 
deposits overlying the Principal Groundwater Aquifer in the area, the 
potential for contaminated water percolating beneath the proposed 
Project site into the Aquifer is considered negligible.  
12.8.14 
The handling and storage of chemicals, fuels, oils and lubricants on-site 
for the purposes of operation will be controlled by a requirement. This 
provides for the submission to and approval of handling and storage 
details to SCC prior to commencement of operation of the proposed 
Project. 
Operation - Gas and Electrical Connections and the Electrical 
Substation 
12.8.15 
During operation, neither the Gas Connections, Electrical Connections 
or Electrical Substation require water. There will therefore be no 
impacts.  
Decommissioning â whole project 
12.8.16 
Works to decommission the plant and structures Project site of the 
proposed Project will be similar to those for construction. Therefore, the 
assessment undertaken for the construction phase is capable of acting 
as a proxy for the demolition and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project. 
12.8.17 
The geology and land contamination assessment has adopted this 
approach. Therefore, the surface water quality impacts from 
decommissioning on public health will be similar to those for 
construction. A requirement attached to the DCO secures the 
submission to and approval by SCC of a decommissioning and 
restoration plan, which will mitigate any effects on public health from 
the decommissioning of the proposed Project.  
Conclusion 
12.8.18 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that the proposed Project will result in no significant adverse public 
health impacts with respect to surface water quality.

12.9 
Geology and Land Contamination 
12.9.1 
Section 9 â Geology and Ground Conditions Pollutants provides the 
impact assessment for Geology and Land Contamination to date. At 
this stage, there have been no potential pollutants identified as being 
present at the proposed Project site. Although no ground investigations 
have been carried out, the potential for contaminated land to be 
identified is considered low, given the historic âgreen fieldâ agricultural 
use of the whole Project site including Power Generation Plant and 
connections. 
12.9.2 
Soil guideline values can be found on the EA website13; these provide 
guideline daily and mean exposures to contaminants according to land-
use (residential, allotment and commercial) and could be used as 
guidelines against which soil samples could be compared to ensure the 
safety of future users. 
Construction â whole Project 
12.9.3 
During construction, the existing soil conditions are not anticipated to 
negatively impact upon construction workers. Potential impacts to 
health (arising from oral, inhalation or dermal contact with potential 
contaminants within any made ground) are negated by the 
implementation of the confirmed mitigation measures (as set out in 
Section 9 â Geology and Land Contamination of this PEIR) at all times. 
The most relevant of these confirmed measures is the appropriate use 
of PPE at all times. For this site, when breaking ground, this PPE is 
likely to include gloves, mask, overalls and eye protection. 
12.9.4 
Additionally, an outline CEMP will include a suggested protocol to 
follow in the event of construction workers discovering contaminated 
material. 
12.9.5 
Given the history of the Project site (i.e. largely undeveloped greenfield 
land) it is considered very unlikely that contamination will be 
encountered during construction.  
12.9.6 
Potential impacts to public health (human receptors outside of the 
construction site) will be avoided by implementation of a Site Waste 
Management Plan, to be secured by a requirement. Measures will also 
be implemented to prevent the escape of contaminants. This will be 
secured by the CEMP, which must be approved by SCC prior to 
commencement of construction.

12.9.7 
Successful implementation of the mitigation measures discussed above 
and in Section 9 â Geology and Land Contamination will result in there 
being no significant public health impact with regards to land 
contamination 
Operation â Power Generation Plant 
12.9.8 
The proposed Project site will predominantly comprise buildings and / 
or areas of hardstanding. A small part of the proposed Project site may 
be landscaped but no areas of exposed (unvegetated) soils will remain 
and any landscaped areas will be covered with 600 mm of clean cover. 
Therefore the potential pathway between any ground contaminants and 
site users will be broken. It is considered that the potential for direct 
contact (dermal, oral or inhalation) with any remaining contaminants 
present beneath the surface is extremely low for future site operatives.  
Operation â Gas and Electrical Connections and Electrical 
substation 
12.9.9 
During operation, the Gas and Electrical Connections will be buried and 
ground reinstated above them. Therefore there are not anticipated to 
be any remaining pollutant linkages. The Substation will be covered in 
hardstanding and so any pollutant linkages would be broken.  
Decommissioning â whole project 
12.9.10 
Works to decommission the plant and structures on the proposed 
Project will be similar to those for construction. Therefore, the 
assessment undertaken for the construction phase is capable of acting 
as a proxy in each case for the demolition and decommissioning of the 
Project. The geology and land contamination assessment has adopted 
this approach. Therefore, the geology and land contamination impacts 
from decommissioning on public health will be similar to those for 
construction. A requirement attached to the DCO secures the 
submission to and approval by SCC of a decommissioning and 
restoration plan, which will mitigate any effects on public health from 
the decommissioning of the proposed Project. This could include the 
retention 
of 
the 
concrete 
foundations 
in 
the 
ground 
after 
decommissioning, thereby preventing the creation of pathways that 
may cause adverse effects to public health. 
Conclusion 
12.9.11 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that that the proposed Project will result in no adverse public health 
impacts with respect to geology and contamination.

Waste 
12.10.1 
The pathways for the proposed Project to impact upon human 
receptors will potentially be through: 
ï¿½ 
Inhalation of emissions from waste; and 
ï¿½ 
Dermal contact / ingestion of leachate from waste that could 
contaminate soils.  
12.10.2 
The proposed Project will operate in full accordance with the WFD, the 
EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (where 
relevant). PPL, at all phases of the Project, will seek to apply the waste 
hierarchy as part of their waste prevention and management policy. 
12.10.3 
The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
ï¿½ 
Prevention; 
ï¿½ 
Re-use; 
ï¿½ 
Recycling; 
ï¿½ 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
ï¿½ 
Disposal. 
Construction of Power Generation Plant Electrical Connection, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
12.10.4 
A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of 
construction method statements and a Site Waste Management Plan 
for approval by the local authority prior to commencement of 
construction, secured by a requirement attached to the DCO. Measures 
will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be 
re-used on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of 
any water from de-watering activities which will be handled by a 
suitably licensed waste contractor. 
12.10.5 
The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a 
manner that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the 
site) waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed 
contractors. Where hazardous waste is transported from the proposed 
Project site, it will be handled in accordance with relevant regulations, 
and, where necessary, be transported in sealed tankers.

Operation 
12.10.6 
A feature of the GT technology to be incorporated in the proposed 
Project is that waste generated should be minimal and will be restricted 
to the following:  
ï¿½ 
General office wastes;  
ï¿½ 
Used GT air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
ï¿½ 
Used ion exchange resins or used RO membranes (typically 
replaced every 5 to 10 years); 
ï¿½ 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
ï¿½ 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers.  
12.10.7 
No waste will be generated through the operation of either Gas 
Connection or Electrical Connection option, or from the Electrical 
Connection Compound.  
12.10.8 
Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on-
the Power Generation Plant site at any one time, and any such 
substances will be held in secured containers to prevent contaminant 
migration. Closed storage facilities or suitable dampening techniques 
will be utilised within the Power Generation Plant where emissions of 
dust etc. from waste are possible. All mitigation measures will be in full 
accordance with industry good practices. 
12.10.9 
All waste will be dealt with in a manner that complies with the relevant 
regulations and (upon leaving the site) waste will be treated and 
disposed of by suitably licensed contractors.  
Waste Classifications 
12.10.10 
There are a number of steps required in order to determine if a waste is 
hazardous or non-hazardous, as described in the EA âTechnical 
Guidance WM2 - Interpretation of the definition and classification of 
hazardous wasteâ (2013). 
12.10.11 
The revised Waste Framework Directive (rWFD) (2008/98/EC) provides 
a Europe-wide definition of hazardous waste as, âa waste possessing 
one or more of the 15 hazardous properties set out in Annex III of the 
rWFD,â and requires the correct management and regulation of such 
waste. Waste classification is based on the European List of Waste 
(Commission Decision 2000/532/EC) (formerly the European Waste 
Catalogue) and the âhazardous propertiesâ provided in Annex III of the 
rWFD. 
12.10.12 
There are three categories of entries in the List of Waste (LoW):

TRAFFIC TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
13.1 
Introduction 
13.1.1 
This chapter considers the likely significant impacts of the proposed 
development on the local transport network. A full Transport 
Assessment (TA) will be prepared as a separate document to 
accompany the proposed DCO Application. This chapter will report on 
the relevant findings at this preliminary stage of the assessment. 
13.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
13.2.1 
The following describes the existing policy and transport infrastructure 
information. 
National and Local Policy Statements 
13.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
traffic and transport impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. 
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
13.2.3 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the SoS in the determination of an energy NSIP. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1, 2011)  
13.2.4 
This document provides the relevant context in which to undertake 
Traffic and Transport appraisal. Section 5.13 details the requirements 
of the assessment and emphasises that âthe consideration and 
mitigation of transport impacts is an essential part of Governments 
wider policy objectives for sustainable development as set out in 
Section 2.2 of the NPSâ. 
13.2.5 
The guidance on the conduct of Transport Assessments in England is 
referenced in NATA/WebTAG and is the Department for Transportâs 
Guidance on Transport Assessments (2007) and the Highways 
Agencyâs Circular 02/2013 which present a framework for assessing 
development in the context of its impact on their transportation assets.

National Planning Policy Framework (2012) 
13.2.6 
This document supersedes various plan documents (including PPG13) 
in respect of local authority plan making and planning decisions, and 
sets out principles of sustainable development.  
13.2.7 
The NPPF states the need for a Transport Statement or Transport 
Assessment to support developments likely to generate significant 
numbers of trips. It suggests that development should take advantage 
of opportunities for sustainable travel, facilitated by a travel plan. 
13.2.8 
The transport objectives of the NPPF are to 
13.2.9 
âFacilitate economic growth by taking a positive approach to planning 
for developmentâ; and  
13.2.10 
âSupport reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and congestion, and 
promote accessibility through planning for the location and mix of 
developmentâ. 
13.2.11 
NPPF States that âAll developments that generate significant amounts 
of movement should be supported by a Transport Statement or 
Transport Assessment. Plans and decisions should take account of 
whether: 
ï¿½ 
the opportunities for sustainable transport modes have been taken 
up depending on the nature and location of the site, to reduce the 
need for major transport infrastructure; 
ï¿½ 
safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all people; 
and improvements can be undertaken within the transport network 
that cost effectively limit the significant impacts of the development.  
ï¿½ 
Development should only be prevented or refused on transport 
grounds where the residual cumulative impacts of development are 
severeâ 
Guidance on Transport Assessments (March 2007) 
13.2.12 
This document provides information on how to prepare a TA. 
13.2.13 
The paper outlines the need for the TA to encourage sustainable 
access and mitigate residual impacts of vehicles. It states that the goal 
of a TA is to estimate the impacts of the development and improve 
accessibility and safety for all modes, using a focus on public transport, 
walking and cycling.

DfT Circular 02/2013 - The Strategic Road Network and the 
Delivery of Sustainable Development 
 
13.2.14 
The document sets out the way in which the Highways Agency will 
engage with communities and the development industry to deliver 
sustainable 
development 
and, 
thus, 
economic 
growth, 
whilst 
safeguarding the primary function and purpose of the strategic road 
network. It replaces the policy set out in Department for Transport (DfT) 
Circular 02/2007 Planning and the Strategic Road Network.  
13.2.15 
The document states that development proposals are likely to be 
acceptable if they can be accommodated within the existing capacity of 
a section (link or junction) of the strategic road network, or they do not 
increase demand for use of a section that is already operating at over-
capacity levels, taking account of any travel plan, traffic management 
and/or capacity enhancement measures that may be agreed. However, 
development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds 
where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe.  
13.2.16 
Local authorities and developers will be required to ensure that their 
proposals comply in all respects with design standards. Where there 
would be physical changes to the network, schemes must be submitted 
to road safety, environmental, and non-motorised user audit 
procedures, as well as any other assessment appropriate to the 
proposed development. The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges sets 
out details of the Secretary of Stateâs requirements for access, design, 
and audit, with which proposals must conform.  
A Future for Transport: A Network for 2030 
13.2.17 
The Department for Transportâs White Paper sets out the Governmentâs 
strategy for transport up to 2030. The publication of this White Paper 
seeks to bring about improvements to all modes of transport through 
the creation of a coherent network. It focuses on three key themes of: 
ï¿½ 
Sustained investment 
ï¿½ 
Making improvements to transport management, and, 
ï¿½ 
Planning ahead 
13.2.18 
In terms of local travel, the document highlights the need to reduce car 
use by improving public transport services, improving the quality of the 
local environment and the use of travel plans to ensure that public 
transport, walking and cycling are seen as attractive alternatives to the 
car.

Planning for a Sustainable Future (2007) 
13.2.19 
This White Paper sets out the Government response to the Eddington 
and Barker reviews, and outlines some reforms to the planning system. 
Chapter 7 discusses sustainable economic development and the 
Governmentâs vision for reducing the impact of transport on the 
environment by reducing car travel. 
Suffolk Local Transport Plan â Part 1  
13.2.20 
Suffolkâs third Local Transport Plan â Part 1, published in 2011 details 
the County Councilâs transport strategy for the region from 2011 to 
2031. The key focus of the plan is to encourage and bring about 
development within the transport sector that will support Suffolkâs 
economy as it recovers from the recession as well as ensuring future 
sustainable economic growth.  
13.2.21 
The Local Transport Plan has four main aims in order to accomplish 
this, which are: 
ï¿½ 
Improving the Countyâs transport networks 
ï¿½ 
Reducing congestion  
ï¿½ 
Improving access to jobs and markets 
ï¿½ 
Encouraging a shift to more sustainable travel patterns 
13.2.22 
These will be essential for businesses in creating access to more jobs 
for more people, reducing travel costs and encouraging smarter ways 
to work. 
13.2.23 
The proposed Project is located within the Mid Suffolk area of the 
county, and the Suffolk Local Transport Plan highlights several key 
transport issues for this particular region, which include: 
ï¿½ 
The cycle network 
ï¿½ 
Rural bus provision 
ï¿½ 
Rural footpaths 
ï¿½ 
Local access to key services 
ï¿½ 
Lorry management 
13.2.24 
In order to fulfil these aims and tackle these problems, the Local 
Transport Plan also outlines the transport strategy for rural areas within 
Suffolk, which is based around five themes. They are: 
ï¿½ 
Better accessibility to employment, education and services

ï¿½ 
Encouraging planning policies to reduce the need to travel 
ï¿½ 
Maintaining the transport network and improving its connectivity, 
resilience and reliability 
ï¿½ 
Reducing the impact of transport on communities 
ï¿½ 
Support the county councilâs ambition of improving broadband 
access throughout Suffolk 
13.2.25 
Thus, an overall better relationship between the home, leisure, retail 
and employment is to be created, with new developments providing 
facilities that âpromote walking, cycling and local public transport access 
to local employment sites and wider transport networksâ. (LTP3, Part 1, 
page 14) 
Suffolk Local Transport Plan â Part 2 
13.2.26 
Suffolkâs third Local Transport Plan â Part 2, published in 2011 details 
the County Councilâs transport implementation plan for the region from 
2011 to 2015. The county councilâs priorities for investment in 
integrated transport are outlined in Table 13.1 below.

establish the scope and methodology of the TA and Travel Plan (TP). 
Minutes of this meeting will be presented in the consultation report that 
accompanies the proposed DCO Application. All comments raised in 
the Scoping Opinion and the meeting will be addressed in the TA. 
13.4.3 
The TA will be undertaken for the proposed DCO Application and will 
be structured in the following way: 
ï¿½ 
Policy Context - highlighting how the development fits with national, 
regional and local policy, and identifying policies that will guide the 
content of the TA.  
ï¿½ 
Existing Conditions - details on the surrounding transport network, 
including committed development and infrastructure in the local 
area, and the spatial and temporal scope of the traffic impacts.

13.4.4 
During the scoping process, it was indicated that there will need to be 
consideration of the transport impacts for the construction, operational 
and decommissioning phases of proposed Project, and as such these 
shall be considered within the TA. 
Environmental Impact 
13.4.5 
Potential effects are likely to be most significant for receptors within the 
local community, and employees at the former Eye Airfield, although 
any user of the A140 or B1077, or of the local PRoWs around the 
airfield could be impacted.  
13.4.6 
The likely effects of the proposed Project in environmental terms will be 
evaluated in accordance with 
the 
Institute of 
Environmental 
Assessmentâs (IEA) âGuidelines for the Environmental Assessment of 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

Road Trafficâ (1993). This evaluation will be informed by the findings of 
the Transport Assessment. 
13.4.7 
The proposed Project may cause potential effects to both motorised 
and non-motorised users and it will be ensured that effects for all 
modes of transport are considered. 
13.4.8 
As further work progresses in the full TA, the transport related 
environmental effects (as defined by IEA guidelines) can be assessed 
for the following factors: 
ï¿½ 
Traffic flows 
ï¿½ 
Delay 
ï¿½ 
Road safety 
ï¿½ 
Intimidation and fear 
ï¿½ 
Severance 
ï¿½ 
Pedestrian amenity 
13.4.9 
Effects may differ, dependent on whether the proposed Project is in its 
construction, operational, or decommissioning phase. 
13.4.10 
The effects of traffic in relation to noise and vibration, and air quality will 
be considered in relevant sections of the EIA. 
13.4.11 
The following describes how these effects may be caused, the 
consequences, and how the significance of these effects can be 
measured. 
Traffic Flows 
13.4.12 
The proposed Project is expected to result in changes in traffic flow for 
each of its phases since it will occupy land that is currently not 
occupied by development. 
13.4.13 
Changes can be considered as having a negative effect if there is a 
larger traffic flow, which can result in congestion, delay, severance and 
a polluted, unattractive and stressful environment. A larger traffic flow 
could be caused by an increase in vehicle demand, or through an 
increase in the number of HGVs. 
13.4.14 
Changes may also have a positive effect, if the consequence of the 
Project is a reduced traffic flow. This for example could be the outcome 
of one development which presently generates a high volume of traffic 
being replaced with a much less traffic intense development. Reduced

traffic flows can result in an improvement in congestion, delay and 
overall amenity of the environment. 
13.4.15 
IEA provides guidance on how the magnitude of changes in traffic flow 
should be determined, as shown in Table 13.3 
 
Table 13.3 - Criteria Defining Magnitude of Change in Traffic Flow 
Magnitude 
Criteria 
High 
Considerable change in condition (90+%) 
Medium 
Readily apparent change in conditions (60-90%) 
Low 
Perceptible change in conditions (30-60%) 
Very Low 
No discernible change in conditions (0-30%) 
 
13.4.16 
The overall significance of change is categorised based on the 
sensitivity of the receptor as shown in Table 13.4. For many effects, 
there are no simple rules or formulae which define thresholds of 
significance and there is, therefore, a need for interpretation and 
judgement on part of the assessor, backed-up by data or quantified 
information wherever possible. Consultation with stakeholders will 
enable determination of the sensitivity of each receptor.

The positive or negative effect of changes may therefore vary across 
receptors, with some road links experiencing a positive impact or being 
of low sensitivity, whereas others may have high sensitivity and high 
magnitude of impact and these will be identified accordingly.

Delay 
13.4.18 
An increase in delay, i.e. time spent in traffic queues is a negative 
effect that has repercussions in terms of pollution, accessibility, 
severance, and driver stress. Increases in delay can be the result of 
junctions and links operating above capacity, or due to the 
implementation of speed restrictions. 
13.4.19 
A decrease in delay is a positive effect that can lead to reductions in 
pollution and stress and improvements to accessibility and severance. 
A decrease would most likely be the result of improved junction 
capacity, either as a result of reduced traffic flow or a reengineered 
junction. 
13.4.20 
Through the consultation process, it has been possible to identify the 
receptors (links or junctions) that are likely to have high sensitivity, and 
further capacity analysis will enable a quantitative and qualitative 
determination of any changes in delay likely during any of the phases of 
the proposed Project. 
Road Safety 
13.4.21 
The proposed Project may have road safety implications, either in 
terms of an improvement or deterioration of the effect. Road safety has 
further implications in terms of driver stress, intimidation and fear, and 
severance. 
13.4.22 
Analysis within the TA will be able to provide a qualitative assessment 
of the quantity and cause of accidents and identify any patterns that 
may be exacerbated or mitigated by the proposed development. 
Intimidation and Fear 
13.4.23 
Intimidation and fear can be caused by a wide range of factors 
including location, highway layout, level of crime, and driver stress. 
However as discussed in the IEA guidelines, there are no commonly 
agreed thresholds for estimating these from other measurable factors. 
13.4.24 
Therefore a qualitative judgement, based on content of the Transport 
Assessment including the site audit and non-motorised user 
assessment would be used to determine the intimidation and fear effect 
of the proposed Project. 
Severance 
13.4.25 
The IEA guidelines describe severance as perceived division that can 
occur within a community when it becomes separated by a major traffic

artery. This for example may be a pedestrian unable to cross a road as 
a result of a large volume of traffic, or the loss of a PRoW or cycle lane. 
13.4.26 
It will be possible, using the site audit and non-motorised user 
assessment sections of the TA, to provide a qualitative assessment on 
the effect the proposed Project has on severance.  
Pedestrian Amenity 
13.4.27 
Pedestrian Amenity is defined within the IEA guidelines as the ârelative 
pleasantness of a journeyâ. This is affected by traffic flow, traffic 
composition, pavement width and separation from traffic. 
13.4.28 
A qualitative assessment of the effect of the proposed Project on 
pedestrian amenity can be given using the site audit and non-motorised 
user assessment included in the TA, with particular consideration given 
to any key public rights of way identified during the stakeholder 
consultation process.

PLANNING INSPECTORATE 
3.57 
The SoS considers it essential to categorise and quantify the type 
and volume of materials to be removed from the site and identify 
where potential traffic movements would be routed. 
Suitable construction routes will be 
identified and construction team to advise 
on volumes of material. This will be 
detailed in the TA of the ES, whilst a 
preliminary assessment, using 
assumptions, is set out in this PEIR. 
3.58 
The SoS welcomes the proposed consultation with the local 
highways authority and the Highways Agency (HA) on the 
assessment of transport impacts, particularly to identify any 
cumulative impacts. 
We will contact the HA to ensure that the 
assessment considers other schemes 
which may affect the results and document 
consultation in the TA of the ES 
3.59  
The Applicants attention is drawn to the comments received from 
the local authorities and PHE (see Appendix 2) with regard to 
inclusion of information within a Transport Assessment 
(TA),including reference to consideration of non-road transportation 
impact. 
We can confirm that non-road transport will 
also be considered in the assessment and 
reported in the ES 
3.60 
Information should be provided on the types of vehicles and plant 
to be used, the number of vehicle trips, during the construction and 
operation phases. This should include vehicular movements 
required during shut down and maintenance periods. 
Largest vehicle to be used will be 
described along with peak construction 
trips. 
Information on likely plant requirements will 
be provided  
Maintenance and shut down requirements 
will be considered. Where detail cannot be 
defined at the planning stage an indicative 
range of trips generated will be provided.

The above will be presented in the ES, 
whilst a preliminary assessment, using 
assumptions, is set out in this PEIR. 
 
3.61 
The access route to the site has not been confirmed within the 
Scoping Report. The ES should detail the transport routes to be 
used during construction and operational phases, both within the 
site and along the strategic road network. The measures to be 
employed to ensure that these roads will be utilised should be 
detailed. 
Access to the Power Generation Site will 
be from Castleton Way  
 
Construction access for the Gas 
Connection options will be as for the Power 
Generation Plant. 
 
Construction access for the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection 
Compound cannot be identified until an 
option has been chosen; however, the 
preferred access is via Old Norwich Road, 
which could require upgrade works.  
 
Operational access for the Gas Connection 
will be from Castleton Way. 
 
3.62 
The SoS recommends that the ES should take account of the 
location of footpaths and any public rights of way (PRoW) including 
bridleways and byways. The ES should clearly set out the impacts 
on them including within the wider area. It is important to minimise 
hindrance to them where possible. A clear indication should be 
given as to how the development will affect the existing and future 
facilities in the area and what mitigation would be appropriate in the 
A review of the existing pedestrian 
infrastructure is being undertaken. 
Construction and operational impacts are 
being considered 
Mitigation measures will be recommended 
depending on the impact. This will be 
included in the TA of the ES.

3.63 
The SoS welcomes the proposal to produce a Travel Plan for the 
construction and operational phases of the proposed development. 
If this is to form a separate document to the ES the Applicant 
should ensure that sufficient information is contained within the ES 
for it to be a standalone document. 
The TA will raise items that will be 
considered in the TP. 
The TP will be submitted as part of the TA 
of the ES  
3.64 
The significance of an identified effect from transportation will need 
to take into account a number of criteria. These criteria will need to 
be carefully described so that impact significance is clearly defined 
within the ES and so that it can be clearly understood how 
significance has been concluded. 
This PEIR provides initial details on the 
classification and magnitude of impacts, 
and further details of their significance will 
be provided in the ES.  
3.65 
Transport of the waste stored temporarily on site should be 
addressed in terms of the form of transport and the possible 
routing. 
Transport routes and requirements will be 
considered in the assessment where 
sufficient detail is available and reported in 
the TA of the ES. 
3.66 
Cross reference should be made to the Air Quality, Noise and 
Vibration, and waste assessments where appropriate. 
Cross references will be provided where 
required in the TA of the ES.

The ES will need to explain and justify assumptions made within 
the transport assessment of the application. These should be 
discussed with SCC in advance of the application. 
The scope of the TA and the assessment 
methodology will be agreed with SCC and 
detailed in the TA of the ES. 
49 
The ES will need to provide information on all construction and 
operational transport. The assumption that the vehicles will mainly 
be personnel related (5.10.1) seems very unlikely and is not 
accepted at this point. Information will also be required on vehicles 
used for materials, delivery and disposal, and construction 
equipment for all aspects of the construction. 
Information will be provided in the TA of 
the ES on trip numbers for construction 
and operational transport including 
vehicles likely to be used for materials, 
delivery, disposal and construction

A profile of vehicle numbers throughout the construction and for 
typical operation will be required (5.10.2). There will also need to 
be information on how delivery and shift times will be managed to 
avoid peak periods along the delivery/commuting routes. 
A profile of traffic will be provided in the 
TA. Information on delivery and shift times 
will be provided and assessed against 
peaks,  
51 
The route for abnormal loads will need to be agreed with SCC 
Structural Engineering section (5.10.3).

ES 
52 
Information will need to be provided on the type of vehicle and 
vehicle movements required for the operational phase (5.10.4), for 
example related to the tankering of water supplies (see water 
resources below). Consideration will also then need to be given to 
the timing of these movements to cause minimal impact on the 
network. Impact on the local network would also be affected by the 
introduction of any new access route to the site off the A140. 
The operational phase will be assessed as 
part of the TA. This will include identifying 
the new trips generated by the site and the 
impact on the local road network. 
Consideration will be given to the timing of 
movements as mitigation if the assessment 
finds that it is required. 
53 
The A140 at this location needs to be considered as a corridor 
rather than a selection of specific junctions (5.10.5 & 5.10.6). This 
corridor should cover from a point south of the junction of the A140 
with Castleton Way to a point north of the junction of the A140 and 
B1077. Particular attention needs to be assessing the impacts of 
additional traffic on safety and evaluating the need for any 
mitigation measures. 
A review of safety will be undertaken. 
Whilst individual junction assessments will 
be undertaken, the TA will consider the 
queues and interaction between junctions 
along the A140. Additionally, we will 
provide an assessment on existing speeds 
and likely impacts in the TA of the ES 
54 
Reference is made to a new access off the A140 (5.10.6); it is not 
clear if this refers to a permanent access to the site or temporary 
access for the purpose of the electrical connection work. 
Construction access for the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection 
Compound cannot be identified until an 
option has been chosen; however, the 
preferred access is via Old Norwich Road, 
which could require upgrade works.

The approach set out at paragraph 5.10.7 should not limit the 
options for mitigation or demand management considered during 
the transport assessment process. The extent of residual impact 
will have to be agreed 
Approaches to mitigation outside the TA 
process will be detailed in the ES. 
56 
The comparison of existing traffic flows should be by vehicle 
category so that the relative impact of construction related traffic 
can be assessed (5.10.9). Sufficient traffic data should be obtained 
to ensure a thorough assessment of transport impacts; the term "if 
considered necessary" seems to contradict this approach. 
Traffic flows will consider the level of heavy 
vehicles on the road network. Relevant 
data collection to be agreed with Suffolk 
County Council and reported in the TA of 
the ES 
57 
The ES needs to address the issue of sustainable non motorised 
access to the site on local roads, in particular the B1077 where 
there is no dedicated footway to the main site entrance. It should 
be noted that the impact of the development on all Non- Motorised 
Users needs to be considered, not just pedestrians (5.10.10). In 
addition to severance from amenity areas, the assessment also 
needs to consider NMU's use of the highway network for other 
uses. Mitigation will be needed to address any significant residual 
impacts, for example through the upgrade of part of the public 
footpath network on the airfield site to bridleway to provide a 
preferable alternative means of access. 
The TA will consider the impact for all 
transport users including pedestrians and 
cyclists. Desire lines through the study 
area will be identified to inform where 
infrastructure improvements may be 
required. This will be reported in the TA of 
the ES 
58 
The sentence "and predicted traffic associated with the 
development." should be added to paragraph 5.10.11 
Predicted traffic will be incorporated into 
the TA of the ES. A preliminary 
assessment, using assumptions, is set out 
in this PEIR.  
59 
SCC is the highway authority for this area (5.10.12). The Highways 
Agency should be consulted on potential impacts on the strategic 
network where this forms part of the delivery route (when it is 
confirmed where this is). MSDC should be consulted on their 
understanding of issues and potential sources of additional traffic 
Agreed. Discussion will be reported in the 
TA of the ES

from developments in the area. For the non-strategic network, SCC 
should be consulted directly. 
60 
The preparation of a travel plan is a key part of assessing potential 
mitigation and demand management, this needs to form part of this 
process and not be an add on as suggested by paragraph 5.10.13. 
The travel plan also needs to be deliverable and enforceable and a 
draft should be provided with the application. Particular regard 
should be had to the opportunity to deliver a rail-bus interchange 
facility at Diss for construction workers, and, more generally to 
improve connectivity between the site and adjacent employment 
and residential areas. 
A TP will be produced as part of the 
proposed DCO Application submitted with 
the TA of the ES. Sustainable modes of 
travel will be explored and SMART 
initiatives proposed. 
61 
With respect to possible cumulative impacts, there is a need to 
take into account the impact along the proposed delivery routes 
rather than just the impact of associated developments in the 
immediate area (5.13.1). SCC can advise on this once the delivery 
routes are clarified. 
Delivery routes will be assessed in the TA 
of the ES 
62 
We would expect all the mitigation proposals to be set out in a 
Code of Construction Practice, a draft of which should be provided 
with the application. It should include details of traffic routeing, 
provisions for access and a travel plan. Details of a preconstruction 
condition survey for the highway (including public rights of way) 
network will need to be provided and provisions set out for the 
reinstatement of damage. 
Routing, access and travel plan 
arrangements will be presented in the TA. 
Detailed design work such as condition 
surveys and damage assessments would 
be undertaken as a requirement following 
the grant of the DCO as details of this are 
unlikely to be known.

In paragraph 5.10.5 on page 115 of the scoping report it mentions 
that the vehicular access to the site will be âvia the A140, entering 
the site from the south via Castleton Lane [sic] and Potash Laneâ. 
Potash Lane is on the eastern side of the airfield and is accessible 
only via the B1077. There is presently no vehicular route within the 
airfield from the end of Potash Lane to the proposed site. If there is 
any intention of opening an access route here to enable a route 
through from the B1077 to the site, further assessment and 
mitigation will be necessary at the junction of the B1077 and the 
A140, which is probably even more hazardous than the one further 
south. 
There is no intention to open an access to 
the east of the site at this stage. Where 
reference to Potash Lane is made in the 
Scoping Document, it is in reference to the 
former air strip which runs north/ south 
across the airfield, not the road to the 
south of the compression station. The 
impact of any new access points on 
adjacent junctions will be assessed fully in 
the TA and a preliminary assessment, 
using assumptions, is set out in this PEIR.

There will be car parking provided within compound areas for the 
Power Generation Plant and the Electrical Connection Compound.  The 
proposed Project will consider the councilâs policy on parking standards 
during the operational phase of the development and reflect a desired 
shift to sustainable transport methods.  
Highway Network 
13.6.11 
As shown in Insert 13.7 the site is located adjacent to the A140, which 
is a major transport route from which the national road network is easily 
accessible. The road runs north-south linking Ipswich and Norwich. 
Approximately 3 km north of Eye, the A140 joins the A143. The A143 
provides access to Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth to the east and to 
Bury St Edmunds in the west. 
13.6.12 
The A140 is a 50 mph single carriageway road, reducing to 40 mph at 
the northern end of former Eye Airfield on the approach to the 
Thrandeston Road. The speed limits on the road network are described 
in Insert 13.7 
13.6.13 
The existing employment uses on the former Eye Airfield are accessed 
via the B1077. From the South, the B1077 is accessed via a dedicated

right turn lane which is signed as shown in Insert 13.8. From the North, 
access is via a left turn. Rectory Road also provides access from the 
A140, forming a smaller triangle north of the airfield with the A140 and 
the B1077, however, this route is not encouraged given lack of signing 
for this direction.  
13.6.14 
Castleton Way runs from the south-west corner of the airfield 
eastwards into Eye and is an unrestricted country road for the majority 
of its length until it reaches Eye, where the speed limit turns to 30 mph.

Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
Access 
13.6.19 
The Electrical Connection to the National Grid is proposed to run from 
the Power Generation Plant site on the former Eye Airfield, across the 
A140, to the Electrical Connection Compound in the west where it will 
connect to the overhead lines approximately 2 km from the Power 
Generation Plant site 
13.10- Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
 
13.6.20 
The Electrical Connection is proposed to run underground along a 
linear route corridor which will be constructed as part of the Project. 
During construction, there will be a requirement to undertake work on 
the A140, Old Norwich Road and Leys Lane as the corridor will run 
across these roads. 
13.6.21 
The linear route corridor will run across existing fields to the Electrical 
Connection Compound. The preferred access for construction staff and 
vehicles to the substation and electrical route connection is via A140 / 
Eye Road and then via Old Norwich Road during construction. A full 
assessment of suitable access arrangements and alternatives will be 
undertaken as part of the TA. A permanent access road would be

required to provide maintenance vehicles with a route to the Electrical 
Connection Compound. The location of this road is subject to further 
development. This and other alternatives will be assessed in the final 
ES, with the preferred option being the same as that for construction.   
Road Safety and Collisions 
13.6.22 
There have been a total of 28 collisions in a three year period from 
2009 to 2011 on this part of the A140. The majority (24) are classed as 
slight collisions, and are concentrated at junctions in the area. Eight of 
the slight collisions occurred along a 0.6 km section either side of 
B1077 on the A140. Several other slight collisions occurred along the 
B1077, with one at an entrance way into the Eye Airfield industrial 
estate; two at a bend in the road just north of the entrance to Progress 
Way, and two between Century Road and Bellands Way in Langton 
Green.  
13.6.23 
Two of the three serious collisions within the 2 km buffer of the 
proposed development site occurred along the A140. One of these 
collisions occurred at a local private access and involved two vehicles, 
and one casualty. The other occurred approximately 0.7 km north of the 
A140 junction with Castleton Way, and involved two vehicles, with three 
casualties. The third serious collision took place within Eye, along 
Church Street and involved one vehicle and one casualty. One fatal 
collision occurred within the 2 km buffer with one casualty and involved 
four vehicles at Brome crossroads. 
13.6.24

13.7 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
13.7.1 
The TA will establish the existing capacity and speed conditions around 
the Project Site and assess junction and corridor performance in 
relation to a number of receptors. This will be based on data collected 
on the Project site (anticipated September 2013) and existing data.

13.7.2 
The TA will present the findings of trip estimates from the proposed 
Project, construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project, the mode split of all trips, and the likely distribution across the 
transport network. A number of junction assessments will be 
undertaken and forecasting of baseline traffic data will be carried out to 
establish a âdo minimumâ scenario for a future year. 
13.7.3 
The impact of the proposed Project, construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project will be established by adding 
trips associated with the development to the âdo minimumâ scenario to 
create a âdo somethingâ and the impacts will be presented in the TA. If 
necessary, mitigation measures will be proposed to reduce the number 
of trips, or provide capacity to cater for these additional trips. 
13.7.4 
A TP will be created and adopted in which sustainable transport will be 
promoted throughout the life cycle of the proposed Project. 
13.7.5 
The main transport impacts are likely to be limited to the peak 
construction times in the Project programme and this is likely to be only 
for a temporary duration during construction. As the only route into the 
Power Generation Plant site and Gas Connection is via Castleton Way, 
constraint on junction performance is likely to occur at this junction 
although this qualitative assessment will be tested fully in the Transport 
Assessment.  
13.7.6 
In relation to the Gas Connection, Electrical Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound, it is anticipated that temporary and permanent 
road construction would be required to facilitate access of vehicles, 
both abnormal loads, and smaller service vehicles, to the Electrical 
Connection Compound and trenching works for the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection Again, this qualitative assessment will be 
appraised fully in the Transport Assessment. 
13.7.7 
A provisional assessment of the likely impacts for each of the elements 
of the Project is presented below. 
POWER GENERATION PLANT 
Construction 
13.7.8 
There is likely to be an increase of traffic on the A140 as construction 
workers travel to and from the Power Generation Plant site and HGVâs 
access the Power Generation Plant site. Additionally, the junction of 
Castleton Way is likely to have increased demand as this junction will 
be on the route to the Power Generation Plant.

13.7.9 
Abnormal loads are unlikely to cause any significant impacts on the 
road network as routes, delivery times and street furniture assessments 
will be planned to accommodate abnormal loads and this will be agreed 
with SCC prior to undertaking. 
Operation 
13.7.10 
There will be minimal impacts during the operation of the Power 
Generation Plant as operational staff numbers will be relatively low and 
the delivery and removal of goods to the site are expected to be low 
during the day. 
Decommissioning 
13.7.11 
The decommissioning stage will be similar to the construction phase in 
that a number of construction staff will be required to decommission the 
Power Generation Plant. Therefore, there is likely to be an increase of 
traffic on the A140 as construction workers travel to and from the site 
and HGVâs access the site. Additionally, the junction of Castleton Way 
is likely to have increased demand as this junction will be on the route 
to the Power Generation Plant. 
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1 
Construction 
13.7.12 
The number of construction workers required to construct the Gas 
Connection Option 1 will be low in relation to the Power Generation 
Plant. As such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with 
additional trips on the network. There will be some additional traffic 
caused by the arrival and departure of construction workers and HGVâs 
delivering and removing goods from the corridor. However, this is 
anticipated to be low.  
Operation 
13.7.13 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment to the local transport network. 
Access to the Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 will be via 
Castleton Way and Potash Lane. 
Decommissioning 
13.7.14 
The decommissioning stage will be similar to the construction phase in 
that a number of construction staff will be required to decommission the 
Gas Connection Corridor Option 1. However, as with construction, the 
number of workers required to construct the Gas Connection Corridor

Option 1 will be low and as such, there is likely to be limited impacts 
associated with additional trips on the network. 
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 2 
Construction 
13.7.15 
The number of construction workers required to construct Gas 
Connection Corridor Option 2 will be low in relation to the Power 
Generation Plant. As such, there is likely to be limited impacts 
associated with additional trips on the network. There will be some 
additional traffic caused by the arrival and departure of construction 
workers and HGVâs delivering and removing goods from the corridor, 
however, this is anticipated to be low.  
13.7.16 
There will be a requirement to undertake temporary road works across 
Potash Lane, although the impacts of this will be managed through 
temporary traffic management arrangements and the impacts are likely 
to be negligible. 
Operation 
13.7.17 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment to the local transport network 
Access to the Gas Connection Option 2 will be via Castleton Way and 
Potash Lane. Any other access to the corridor will be within private 
land. 
Decommissioning 
13.7.18 
The decommissioning stage will be similar to the construction phase in 
that a number of construction staff will be required to decommission the 
Gas Connection Option 2. However, as with construction, the number 
of workers required to decommission the Gas Connection Option 2 will 
be low and as such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with 
additional trips on the network. 
13.7.19 
There may be a requirement to undertake temporary road works across 
Potash Lane, although the impacts of this will be managed through 
temporary traffic management arrangements and the impacts are likely 
to be negligible.

construction workers and HGVâs delivering and removing goods from 
the corridor. The impacted roads are A140, Eye Road, The Street and 
Old Norwich Road.  
13.7.21 
A new access road would be constructed to allow access from the 
preferred option of Old Norwich Road along the corridor to the 
Electrical Connection Compound. This will cater for all vehicle types 
including abnormal loads. Abnormal load routing, delivery schedule and 
street furniture considerations will be agreed with SCC officers in 
advance of undertaking. 
13.7.22 
Temporary traffic management will be required as the Electrical 
Connection Option 1 runs across the A140, Old Norwich Road and 
Leys lane. Consideration will be given to off peak traffic working over 
the A140 to limit adverse impacts on traffic. 
Operation 
13.7.23 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment on the local transport network. 
Access to the Electrical Connection Compound could be via a new 
access road from the preferred option of Old Norwich Road which could 
also cross Leys Lane. 
Decommissioning

Once further work has been undertaken for the EIA, it will be possible 
to identify any highway works, or provision for non-motorised users, 
based on the findings of the assessment. If any are identified as the 
Project progresses, then these will be taken into account in the 
assessment of impacts.

Next Steps 
13.10.1 
The objective of the TA is to determine the impact of all phases of the 
proposed Project on users of all modes of transport. This will make it 
possible to develop appropriate mitigation measures that will minimise 
adverse transportation impacts for those impacted. 
13.10.2 
Following the Scoping Opinion responses and the meeting held with 
SCC, items raised in the Scoping Opinion and during the Meeting will 
be addressed in the full TA. The following main assessments will be 
undertaken as part of this next stage of the appraisal: 
ï¿½ 
Identification of the scope and boundary of construction works, site 
operations and site decommissioning. This will include details on 
enabling highways works, staff arrangements, types of vehicles, 
and means of access. 
ï¿½ 
Estimation of the number of trips generated during peak periods for 
each development phase. These will be agreed with SCC and 
derived from use of the TRICS database where appropriate, or will 
alternatively be based on staffing and construction/service vehicle 
requirements. 
ï¿½ 
Assessment of traffic growth on junctions and links in the study 
area. This would involve use of a gravity model to establish the 
origin and destination of Project traffic. It would be necessary to 
compare the 2013 base year with a future year do nothing scenario 
(without Project) and a future year do something scenario (with 
Project). 
ï¿½ 
Junction capacity analysis, through modelling of junctions identified 
as having high traffic growth, or identified as requiring consultation 
through the stakeholder meetings. This would be done for the 2013 
base year, and the future year do nothing and do something 
scenarios. This will inform the need for any junction improvements. 
ï¿½ 
Link capacity analysis of key corridors to the proposed Project. This 
will identify the need for any road improvements. 
ï¿½ 
A non-Motorised user assessment will provide a qualitative 
assessment of the impacts faced by non car users, i.e. an 
assessment of the proposed Project impact on pedestrian amenity 
and severance 
ï¿½ 
A more comprehensive review of accident data to identify any 
safety issues and offer mitigation, where appropriate. 
ï¿½ 
A review of the access arrangements for Abnormal Loads and any 
temporary mitigation measures required to enable their travel to the 
proposed Project site.

CULTURAL HERITAGE AND ARCHAEOLOGY 
14.1 
Introduction 
14.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to significantly impact upon both surface and 
buried archaeological assets, as well as having an impact upon the 
setting and appreciation of assets of Cultural Heritage importance, 
including surrounding Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and 
Conservation Areas. 
14.1.2 
At this PEIR stage of the assessment, an archaeological DBA has been 
undertaken which investigates all historical records within 1 km of the 
initial Project Redline Boundary as it was presented in the EIA Scoping 
Report. The assessment identified 47 Heritage Assets within this DBA 
Study Area and its 1 km Study Area. A total of 72 Listed Buildings were 
also identified including two Grade I Listed Buildings, six Grade II* 
Listed Buildings and 64 Grade II Listed Buildings. A total of 43 findspots 
reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme have also been recovered 
within the 1 km Study Area. 
14.1.3 
This section presents the findings of the DBA and provides a summary 
of the remaining work that is planned prior to completion of the ES. 
14.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements 
14.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
historic environment impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. 
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
14.2.3 
NPS EN-1 at section 5.8 sets out assessment principles relevant to 
energy NSIPs in relation to the historic environment. . 
14.2.4 
Paragraph 5.8.1 of the NPS states that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in 
adverse impacts on the historic environment. The following paragraph 
(5.8.2) defines the historic environment as including all aspects of the 
environment resulting from the interaction between people and places 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report

through time, including all surviving physical remains of past human 
activity, whether visible, buried or submerged, landscaped and planted 
or managed flora. Those elements of the historic environment that hold 
value to this and future generations because of their historic, 
archaeological, architectural or artistic interest are called heritage 
assets. The policy states that a heritage asset may be any building, 
monument, site, place, area or landscape, or any combination of these. 
The sum of the heritage interests that a heritage asset holds is referred 
to as its significance. 
14.2.5 
Paragraph 5.8.3 discusses statutory designated heritage assets and 
suggests such categories are: a World Heritage Site; Scheduled 
Monument; Protected Wreck Site; Protected Military Remains, Listed 
Building; Registered Park and Garden; Registered Battlefield; 
Conservation Area; and Registered Historic Landscape (Wales only). 
14.2.6 
Paragraph 5.8.4 goes on to highlight that there are heritage assets with 
archaeological interest that are not currently designated as scheduled 
monuments, but which are demonstrably of equivalent significance. 
These include those that have yet to be formally assessed for 
designation; those that have been assessed as being designatable but 
which the SoS has decided not to designate, and those that are 
incapable of being designated by virtue of being outside the scope of 
the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. 
Furthermore, in Paragraph 5.8.5 the policy considers that the absence 
of designation for such heritage assets does not indicate lower 
significance. If the evidence before the Secretary of State indicates to it 
that a non designated heritage asset of the type described in 5.8.4 may 
be affected by the proposed development then the heritage asset 
should be considered subject to the same policy considerations as 
those that apply to designated heritage assets. 
14.2.7 
In paragraph 5.8.6 the section concludes that the Secretary of State 
should also consider the impacts on other non-designated heritage 
assets, as identified either through the development plan making 
process (local listing) or through the Secretary of Stateâs decision 
making process on the basis of clear evidence that the assets have a 
heritage significance that merits consideration in its decisions, even 
though those assets are of lesser value than designated assets. 
14.2.8 
The policy considers (Paragraph 5.8.8) that as part of the applicant's 
assessment the applicant should provide a description of the 
significance of the heritage assets affected by the proposed 
development and the contribution of their setting to that significance. 
The level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the 
heritage assets and no more than is sufficient to understand the 
potential impact of the proposal on the heritage asset. As a minimum

- 451 - 
 
the applicant should have consulted the relevant Historic Environment 
Record and assessed the heritage assets themselves using expertise 
where necessary according to the proposed development's impact. 
14.2.9 
Paragraph 5.8.9 is concerned with heritage assets with an 
archaeological interest and states that the applicant should carry out 
appropriate desk-based assessment and, where such desk-based 
research is insufficient to properly assess the interest, a field 
evaluation.  
Other National and Local Policy 
14.2.10 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
14.2.11 
National planning policies on the conservation of the historic 
environment are also set out in the NPPF, which was published by the 
DCLG in 2012. Sites of archaeological or cultural heritage significance 
that are valued components of the historic environment and merit 
consideration in planning decisions are grouped as âHeritage Assetsâ. 
The NPPF states that âHeritage Assets are an irreplaceable resourceâ 
the conservation of which can bring âwider social, cultural, economic 
and environmental benefits...â (DCLG 2012, Section 12: 126). It also 
states that the â...significance of any Heritage Assets affected including 
any contribution made by their setting...â should be understood in order 
to assess the potential impact (DCLG 2012, Section 12: 128). In 
addition to standing remains, Heritage Assets of archaeological interest 
can comprise sub-surface remains and, therefore, assessments should 
be undertaken for a site with potential below ground archaeological 
deposits. 
14.2.12 
NPPF draws a distinction between designated Heritage Assets and 
other remains considered to be of lesser significance; â... great weight 
should be given to the assetâs conservation. Substantial harm to or loss 
of a Grade II listed building, park or garden should be exceptional. 
Substantial harm to or loss of designated Heritage Assets of the 
highest significance, including scheduled monuments, protected wreck 
sites, battlefields, Grade I and II* listed buildings and Grade I and II* 
registered parks and gardens and World Heritage Sites, should be 
wholly exceptional...â (DCLG 2012, Section 12: 132). Therefore, 
preservation in situ is the preferred course in relation to such sites 
unless exceptional circumstances exist. 
14.2.13 
It is normally accepted that non-designated sites will be preserved by 
record, in accordance with their significance and the magnitude of the

harm to or loss of the site as a result of the proposals, to â...avoid or 
minimise conflict between the heritage assetâs conservation and any 
aspect of the proposals...â (DCLG 2012, Section 12: 129). Non-
designated Heritage Assets of archaeological interest will also be 
subject to the policies reserved for designated Heritage Assets if they 
are of equivalent significance to scheduled monuments (DCLG 2012, 
Section 12: 132). 
14.2.14 
The Practice Guide to PPS5 remains in force, having accompanied 
PPS5 (2010) whose policies were incorporated, some modified, into the 
NPPF in 2012.  
Mid Suffolk District Council 
14.2.15 
The MSDC DPD was adopted in September 2008. Following a review 
carried out in late 2012, the adopted Core Strategy DPD should be 
read in conjunction with the âCore Strategy Focused Review (December 
2012)â.  
14.2.16 
The relevant policy is âCore Strategy Objective SO 4 â To protect, 
manage, enhance and restore the historic heritage / environment and 
the unique character and identity of the towns and villages by ensuring 
that new developments are appropriate in terms of scale and location in 
the context of settlement form and characterâ. 
14.2.17 
However, not all the DPDs within the LDF have been completed and 
adopted and the Local Plan (adopted 1998) contains some âsavedâ 
policies including the following: 
14.2.18 
Policy HB1 (Protection of Historic Buildings): The district planning 
authority places a high priority on protecting the character and 
appearance of all buildings of architectural or historic interest. Particular 
attention will be given to protecting the settings of listed buildings.  
14.2.19 
Policy HB8 (Safeguarding the Character of Conservation Areas): 
Priority will be given to protecting the character and appearance of 
Conservation Areas and the district planning authority will expect new 
building, alterations or other forms of development to conserve or 
enhance their surroundings. Similar care will be taken when 
considering proposed development on land which lies adjacent to a 
conservation area. In particular, the protection of significant views into 
and from the Conservation Area is regarded as a material consideration 
and will be safeguarded.  
14.2.20 
Policy HB13 (Protecting Ancient Monuments): The district planning

scheduled ancient monuments or other monuments of national 
importance including their settings.  
14.2.21 
Policy HB14 (Ensuring archaeological remains are not destroyed) 
states that where there is an overriding case for preservation, local 
authority planning permission for development that would affect an 
archaeological site or its setting will be refused. It also provides that 
that having taken archaeological advice, the local planning authority 
may decide that development can take place subject to either 
satisfactory measures to preserve the archaeological remains in situ or 
for the site to be excavated and the findings recorded. In appropriate 
cases the local planning authority will expect a legally binding 
agreement to be concluded or will impose a planning condition 
requiring the developer to make appropriate and satisfactory provision 
for the excavation and recording of the archaeological remains. 
14.2.22 
The EADF (February 2013) recognises at section 2.9 that the former 
Eye Airfield is a heritage site and describes the setting, history and 
reproduces the historic environment record of the area covered by the 
development brief. It explains the county archaeologistâs likely 
expectations as to field evaluation and other forms of evaluation, 
recording and mitigation. This would likely comprise a programme of 
archaeological investigation, with the investigation phase comprising 
geophysical survey and then targeted evaluation (trial trenching). 
Approach 
14.2.23 
Standards and Guidance: The proposed Project Environmental Impact 
Assessment Scoping Report (PRO-4100-PB-ENV-RPT-R40 Parsons 
Brinckerhoff 2013) proposed the undertaking of a Desk-based 
Assessment, and consequently this document has been written to 
comply with the Guidance and Standards for Desk-based Assessments 
in compliance with NPS EN-1 and the National Planning Policy 
Framework (See Section 3.1, above). Furthermore, the assessment 
was carried out in accordance with the relevant professional guidelines 
- Institute for Archaeologists (IfA) and English Heritage (IfA 2012a 
Standard and Guidance for Archaeological Desk-based Assessments; 
IfA 2012b Code of Conduct; English Heritage 2006 Management of 
Research Projects in the Historic Environment (MoRPHE)). 
14.2.24 
Following the Scoping Report, consultations were carried out with 
English Heritage and the County Archaeologist at SCC. The scoping 
responses outlined the study areas for the desk-based assessment and 
the cultural heritage section, provided information on sites of 
archaeological significance and a proposed mitigation strategy. This 
has been adhered to within this report.

14.2.25 
Study Area: This DBA has focused on the proposed Project Site, 
although historic information for the immediate surrounding area 
(hereafter known as the 1 km Study Area) has been considered in 
order to provide an essential contextual background, in accordance 
with the Scoping Report and in consultation with the SCC County 
Archaeologist.  
14.2.26 
Terminology: The technical terminology applied to the assessment 
process in this document is based on that contained within the Cultural 
Heritage Section (Volume 11, Section 3, Part 2) of the DMRB issued by 
the HA in 2007. This has been widely adopted throughout the heritage 
industry as a baseline. However, the terminology has been enhanced 
as appropriate throughout this report. 
14.2.27 
Cultural Heritage comprises scheduled monuments, listed buildings, 
parks and gardens, battlefields, conservation areas, earthworks and 
buried archaeological remains. For the ease of presentation in this 
document cultural heritage features are referred to as Heritage Assets, 
and additionally for the purposes of clarity a minor distinction is made 
between standing remains and archaeological sites. 
14.2.28 
Aims: The DBA studies the historic environment within the agreed 
study area. It consists of an analysis of data in order to identify the 
likely Heritage Assets, their significance, character of the study area 
and consideration of the setting of the Heritage Assets, and the nature, 
extent and quality of the known or potential archaeological, historic, 
architectural and aesthetic interest. Significance is to be judged in a 
local, regional, national or international context as appropriate (IfA 
2012a). 
14.2.29 
Objectives: The specific objectives of this DBA are to: 
ï¿½ 
Assess the potential for Heritage Assets to survive within the 
proposed Project Site and Study Area; 
ï¿½ 
Assess the significance of the known or potential Heritage Assets; 
ï¿½ 
Identify the potential impact of proposed or predicted changes on 
the significance of the assets and their settings; 
ï¿½ 
Provide strategies for further evaluation where the nature, extent or 
significance of the resource is not sufficiently well defined; 
ï¿½ 
Suggest strategies to conserve the significance of the Assets and 
their settings, and; 
ï¿½ 
Present proposals for appropriate archaeological mitigation.

14.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
14.3.1 
In respect of cultural heritage and archaeology, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed Project parameters (which are 
described in Section 3 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 14.1 below.

14.3.2 
 
14.3.3 
The reason that the parameters identified above represent the realistic 
worst case in relation to cultural heritage and archaeology impacts are 
due to the larger foot print in comparison to a scenario with fewer 
GTGs. This larger land take would inevitably result in greater ground 
disturbance and potential to affect buried archaeology. It is estimated 
that there would be no material difference on the impact on the setting 
of cultural heritage assets between any of the other potential scenarios. 
14.3.4 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection, 
Electrical Connection and the Electrical Connection Compound are 
presented in this section. 
14.4 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
14.4.1 
Data Collection: The principal sources of information consulted were 
historical and modern maps, although published and unpublished 
secondary sources were also reviewed. The following repositories were 
consulted during the data-gathering process:  
ï¿½ 
Suffolk County Historic Environment Record (HER); 
ï¿½ 
Catalogue of aerial photographs held by the National Monuments 
Record (NMR); 
ï¿½ 
Literature review of publicly available data including reports on any 
cultural heritage or archaeological work conducted in or near the 
study area;  
ï¿½ 
Historical maps including Ordnance Survey. 
14.4.2 
Site Visit: The Project Site was visited in order to assess its character, 
identify visible historic features and assess possible factors which may 
affect the survival or condition of known or potential assets. A

photographic record was compiled as a part of the site visit and a 
selection of these are presented as Plates 9-16. All of the Heritage 
Assets identified through the data collection and the site visit are 
described in detail in the gazetteer (Section 5). Their location is shown 
on Figure 14.1. 
14.4.3 
Setting of the Assets: The Project Site and its 1 km Study Area were 
visited in order to allow a preliminary assessment of the potential for 
indirect impacts on the setting of the Heritage Assets. At this stage a 
drive through of the relevant landscape was undertaken, and an outline 
photographic archive compiled. The general topography was noted, as 
was the presence of any large areas of tree plantation, and building 
complexes such as housing estates, industrial plant, and so forth. 
However, due to the preliminary nature of this assessment, a realistic 
worst-case scenario is presented. This outline assessment will highlight 
the need for further more detailed assessment of setting at a later stage 
as appropriate. 
14.4.4 
Significance: Initially, the significance of the Heritage Assets is judged 
in a neighbourhood, local, regional, national and international context, 
which results in the cultural value or sensitivity of the asset being 
determined along with the appropriate form of mitigation (Table 14.2, 
below). Once the value is established then the archaeological, historic, 
architectural and aesthetic interests are discussed (Section 5, below).

present in every case and professional judgement is used in balancing 
the different criteria.  
 
14.4.6 
In order to consider the archaeological and historic significance in 
particular, an additional set of criteria are employed which relate to the 
SoSâs criteria for assessing the national importance of monuments, as 
contained in Annex 1 of the policy statement on scheduled monuments 
produced by the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport (2010). 
These criteria relate to period, rarity, documentation, group value, 
survival/condition, fragility/vulnerability, diversity, and potential and are 
presented in Section 5. The consideration of the significance of 
statutory designated assets including listed buildings is reflected in their 
Grade, and so it is not necessary to apply the criteria mentioned to this 
type of Heritage Asset. 
14.4.7 
Potential Impact: In order to assess the potential impact of any future 
development on built heritage or buried archaeological remains, 
consideration has been afforded to: 
ï¿½ 
Assessing in detail any impact and the significance of the effects 
arising from any future development of the Scheme Area; 
ï¿½ 
Reviewing the evidence for past impacts that may have affected 
the archaeological sites of interest identified during the desk-based 
assessment; 
ï¿½ 
Outlining suitable mitigation measures, where possible at this 
stage, to avoid, reduce, or remedy significant adverse impacts. 
14.4.8 
Key impacts have been identified as those that would potentially lead to 
a change to the Heritage asset. Each potential impact has been 
determined as the predicted deviation from the baseline conditions, in 
accordance with current knowledge of the site and the proposed 
development. The impact is assessed in terms of the sensitivity or 
value of the asset to the magnitude of change or potential scale of 
impact during the proposed development. The magnitude, or scale of 
an impact is often difficult to define, but will be termed as substantial, 
moderate, slight, or negligible, as shown in Table 14.3, below.

The interaction of the potential scale of impact (Table 2) and the 
importance or value of the Heritage Asset (Table 1) produces the 
impact significance. This may be calculated by using the matrix shown 
in Table 14.4:

Significance of the Impact 
 
14.4.10 
It is normal practice to state that impacts of moderate significance or 
above are regarded as significant impacts. Mitigation measures as 
appropriate for each Heritage Asset affected are presented in section 
14.15. Residual impacts are then assessed to determine if there are 
any likely significant environmental effects following mitigation having 
been applied.  
14.4.11 
Limitations: This assessment is based on the proposed Project as 
presented at the time of compiling this report. Changes to the proposed 
Project and any additional technical data made available will be 
considered in any further assessment of the scheme, for instance the 
ES Cultural Heritage Chapter.  
14.4.12 
Accessibility to all parts of the proposed Project Site and its 1 km Study 
Area was restricted, especially in the north-eastern section due to the 
presence of industrial developments. 
14.5 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
14.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and industry 
standard methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction, 
operation and decommissioning are minimised. In respect of cultural 
heritage and archaeology this mitigation includes:

ï¿½ 
Choice of SCGT technology which allows for shorter stacks, thus 
reducing the impact on the setting of Cultural Heritage Assets. 
ï¿½ 
The refinement of the connection routes within the corridors to 
avoid archaeological assets where possible. 
14.5.2 
The assessment in this Section takes such design mitigation into 
account. Any additional mitigation developed in response to specific 
impacts identified in this assessment is described in paragraph 14.9 
below.

The following section presents a summary of the historical and 
archaeological background of the general area. This is presented by 
historical period (Table 14.6) and has been compiled in order to place 
the study area into a wider archaeological context.

14.7.2 
Prehistoric Period (30,000 BC â AD 43): Evidence for Palaeolithic 
activity in Suffolk is well-attested with sites, such as Hoxne, Barnham 
and High Lodge, which have indicated that human occupation in East 
Anglia began around 500,000 years ago (Austin 1997: 7). Indeed, the 
site at Hoxne is located approximately 2km east of the Project Site. 
Mesolithic activity is known from surface finds within East Anglia, 
particularly within the Fens and the Brecklands (Austin 1997: 9), 
although no evidence has been found within the Project Site or its 1 km 
Study Area. 
14.7.3 
The advent of the Neolithic brought many changes to the landscape 
including deforestation as demonstrated at Diss Mere just to the north 
of the 1 km Study Area (Brown and Murphy 1997: 12). This led to a 
change in flint tool technology and four Neolithic flint finds have been 
found within the 1 km Study Area (HA02, HA18, HA37 and HA46). 
Despite the introduction of bronze during the Bronze Age, flint 
continued in use. Two findspots of Bronze Age axes have been 
revealed within the 1 km Study Area (HA10 and HA11) indicating

human activity. Indeed, they may have been used for woodland 
management as indicated by pollen analyses at Scole (Brown and 
Murphy 1997:16), just to the north of the 1km Study Area. Late 
Neolithic and early Bronze Age activity has been identified during an 
excavation at Hartismere High School Playing Fields in Eye. The 
evidence comprised four cremations and a crouched inhumation of 
probable Bronze Age date (Caruth and Goffin 2012). 
14.7.4 
Iron Age activity within the 1 km Study Area has been identified during 
an excavation at Hartismere High School Playing Fields revealing 
evidence of late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pottery, pits and two 
roundhouses suggesting occupation (Caruth and Goffin 2012). Further 
late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pottery was found during an evaluation 
at the Sports Hall Car Park at Hartismere High School in Eye (Craven 
2008a). An evaluation at Hartismere Hospital in Eye supports this with 
further finds of pottery (Brooks 2012). Late Iron Age field systems have 
been indicated at Scole and Yaxley and an enclosure found at 
Barnham (Bryant 1997: 28). An Iron Age pottery scatter has been 
discovered within the Project Site (HA38). 
14.7.5 
Romano-British Period (AD 43 â AD 410): The remains of a Roman 
Road (Margaryâs 3d) run through the centre of the Project Site in a 
north-west/south-east direction (HA40). It is now overlain by the 
modern A140. This road connects Coddenham to the south of the 
Project Site with Scole, a Roman settlement site, to the north. The road 
was sectioned at Coddenham to reveal an agger 1 ft 6 inches high, 
which could be dated to c AD 70 (Moore with Plouviez and West 1988: 
29). Excavations at Hartismere High School in Eye have revealed a 
multi-period settlement with the majority of the activity dating to the 
Romano-British period. The finds included Romano-British pottery, 
metalwork including coins, and ceramic building material suggesting 
there was a structure (Craven 2009). Romano-British pottery was also 
found during an evaluation at Hartismere Hospital in Eye (Brooks 
2012). Findspots of Romano-British pottery and artefacts have also 
been yielded within the Project Site and 1km Study Area (HA07, HA08, 
HA12, HA14, HA17, HA22, HA29 and HA41).  
14.7.6 
Early Medieval Period (AD 410 â AD 1066): The name Eye derives 
from the Old English meaning âislandâ due to the marshy conditions 
surrounding the settlement and its close proximity of the River Dove 
(Paine 1993: 1). Anglo-Saxon (AD 410-1066) evidence is plentiful 
within Suffolk with the famous burial site of Suffolk Hoo located 
approximately 35km south-east of the Project Site. Within the 1 km 
Study Area, evidence for Anglo-Saxon occupation is clear from the 
excavations at Hartismere High School Playing Fields in Eye (Caruth 
and Goffin 2012). The settlement comprised two earth-fast post-hole 
buildings and at least 18 sunken-featured buildings. A trackway

bisected the site in a north-south direction. Test pits at the New Sports 
Hall, Hartismere High School in Eye identified early Anglo-Saxon 
features, which appear to be a continuation of the settlement activity 
witnessed at the Playing Fields (Craven 2008b). An evaluation at 
Hartismere Hospital in Eye has also revealed early Anglo-Saxon 
pottery and a brooch, along with occupational evidence (Brooks 2012). 
Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon activity is demonstrated by the 
numerous findspots within the 1 km Study Area (HA15, HA35, HA36 
and HA42).  
14.7.7 
Late Medieval Period (AD 1066 â 1540): The Domesday Book 
mentions Eye, along with the nearby settlements of Thrandeston, 
Yaxley and Brome suggesting they were established settlements by 
1086. They formed part of the Hundred of Hartismere, an administrative 
division (Rumble 1986). This indicates the early antiquity of these sites 
and it is likely that they were established during the Anglo-Saxon 
period. Eye Castle was built in 1066-71 by William Malet, a Norman 
Baron, who came to England with William the Conqueror (Paine 1993, 
1). His son, Robert, founded the Benedictine Priory of Eye in 1086-7 
(Page 1975: 72). Indeed, several medieval churches are known in the 
surrounding area, such as St Margaret in Thrandeston (HA06), St Mary 
at Thornham Parva, St Mary in Yaxley (HA16), Church of St Peter and 
St Paul and the Church of St Peter at Palgrave, all of which are Grade I 
Listed Buildings. 
14.7.8 
From the early fifteenth century, the Cornwallis family became 
residents at Brome and owned lands in the surrounding area (Paine 
1993: 23), including the land on which the Project Site stands. This is 
attested by the Eye Enclosure Map of 1812, which states that the 
Marquis Cornwallis is the landowner. The land was used for agricultural 
purposes. 
14.7.9 
Four medieval greens have been identified within the 1 km Study Area 
(HA01, HA04, HA19 and HA32) and provide insights into medieval 
settlement patterns, particularly on the claylands (Wade 1997: 52). At 
Langton Grove Farm, an evaluation revealed sixteenth century activity 
including ditches and pits close to a green-edge settlement. One of the 
deep features has been interpreted as an infilled pond (Everett 2003). 
At land north of Langton Lodge, an evaluation also revealed evidence 
of the original medieval green edge (Gardner 2004). Archaeological 
monitoring at Mellis Primary School located a medieval ditch, which has 
been interpreted as a marker for separate plots on Mellis Green (HA01) 
(Craven 2008c). An evaluation at the southern edge of Mellis green 
revealed evidence of early medieval pottery, two pits and a ditch. The 
evidence suggests the area was used for fish ponds and not settlement 
(Sommers 1998). Indeed, the green at Mellis is of regional significance 
as it contains a church (St Mary the Virgin, a Grade II* Listed Building,

See Table 6, below), which is an unusual settlement pattern for this 
area. Medieval settlement patterns normally comprised a âhall-and-
churchâ, which included a manorial hall, normally moated with an 
associated church. These âhall-and-churchâ settlements sometimes 
developed into villages and hamlets, which can be seen today. These 
settlements tend to be earlier in date than the green-edge settlements 
(Suffolk HLC). 
14.7.10 
Numerous moated sites have been found within Suffolk, six of which 
are located within the 1 km Study Area (HA05, HA13, HA20, HA27, 
HA28 and HA47). They generally comprise wide ditches, often water-
filled, that enclose one or more islands of dry ground on which stood 
domestic or religious buildings. They functioned as status symbols 
rather than for defensive purposes and were generally built between 
1250 and 1350. 
14.7.11 
Post-Medieval Period (AD 1540 â c AD 1750): Agricultural activity 
continued into the post-medieval period as indicated by the historical 
mapping (See Section 4.3, below). The majority of the buildings were 
farmhouses, such as Goswold Hall (HA20), which was constructed 
during the late sixteenth / early seventeenth century. It was also a 
moated manorial site and probably has medieval origins. Its dovecote 
(HA21) was constructed sometime during the eighteenth century.  
14.7.12 
Other evidence of post-medieval activity within the 1 km Study Area 
includes quarrying activity, which was revealed during an evaluation at 
Hartismere Hospital in Eye (Brooks 2012). A post-medieval ditch was 
found during an evaluation at Yaxley, along with unstratified post-
medieval ceramic building materials and pottery (Brooks 2008). 
14.7.13 
Industrial Period (c AD 1750 â 1901): In 1823, the last Marquis 
Cornwallis passed away and his lands were bought by Matthias 
Kerrison of Bungay for his son, General Sir Edward Kerrison (Paine 
1993: 23). During this period farming was the mainstay of the economy 
in this part of Suffolk and barley, in particular, was grown for its use in 
brewing and malting. A Grade II Listed Building, Malting Farm (HA27), 
is located within the study area, which may have functioned as such. 
Other buildings of note include Hartismere Hospital (HA45), a former 
union workhouse which became a âPoor Law Institutionâ in the 1920s as 
indicated on Ordnance Survey (OS) mapping (1927). A post-mill 
(HA43) and a windmill (HA33)  are  the  only  assets  within  the  1  km  
Study Area to suggest industrial activities, albeit on a small-scale. 
14.7.14 
Modern Period (Post-1901): During World War II, an airfield was 
constructed at Eye (HA31) by the US Army Engineer Battalions 827 
and 859 and British contractors. Work began in 1943 and was 
completed in early 1944 and comprised three intersecting runways, two

hangars, administrative buildings and living quarters for 2,894 
servicemen. Station 134 of the 490th Bomb Group of the US Air Force 
occupied the base until 1945 when it was handed over to the RAF 
Bomber Command. It was decommissioned in 1961 and part of it was 
subsequently developed for industrial and residential use. Stromit 
Boards were first to occupy the site in 1962, followed by A. Moor and 
Sons in 1966 and Mill Farm Mushrooms in 1970. British Gas erected a 
Gas Compressor station in 1975 on the airfield. In 1992, the Eye 
Chicken Litter fired power station was opened (Paine 1993: 59-60). 
Archaeological monitoring in Yaxley revealed a WWII spigot mortar 
emplacement, which formed part of the outer defences of Eye Airfield 
(Sommers 2011).  
14.8 
Archaeological Interventions  
14.8.1 
A number of archaeological interventions have been carried out within 
the study area. Some of these have already been referred to in the 
archaeological and historical background (e.g. Caruth and Goffin 2012, 
Craven 2008a, Craven 2008b, Craven 2008c, Craven 2009, Brooks 
2008, Brooks 2012, Sommers 2011).  
14.8.2 
An archaeological evaluation was carried out in advance of the 
construction of an industrial unit at the Roy Humphrey site to the 
immediate west of the proposed Power Generation Plant. However, this 
did not reveal any features, finds or deposits of archaeological 
significance (Cass 2010). A further evaluation was undertaken again to 
the immediate west of the Project Site in advance of the construction of 
two wind turbines. This did not reveal any features, finds or deposits of 
archaeological significance (Cass 2011). 
14.9 
Development of the Scheme Area  
14.9.1 
A number of maps have been consulted including county, tithe and 
Ordnance Survey. One of the earliest county maps to show Eye and its 
environs is Speedâs map of Suffolk (1610), which annotates the main 
settlements discussed in this desk-based assessment including Ays 
(Eye), Thrandeston, Yaxley and Brome highlighting the antiquity of 
these places. All of these settlements appear to be associated with a 
castle or manor house indicating their importance at this time (Insert 
14.1).

14.9.2 
Hodskinsonâs map of Suffolk (1787) again lists all the relevant 
settlements, although with some changes in spellings. Brome is 
âBroomeâ, Thrandeston is âThrandistonâ and Goswold Hall (HA20) is 
annotated as âGosland Hallâ. Broome Green (HA32), Great Green 
(HA19), Little Green (HA04) and Mellis Green (HA01) are clearly 
shown, amongst others, highlighting the medieval agricultural 
landscape. Malting Farm (HA27) can be seen as a building to the north 
of âGosland Hallâ and to the south of the road. Eye Priory is also 
annotated. The Roman Road (HA40) can clearly be seen running 
through the Project Site (Insert 14.2).

14.9.3 
The study area extends over several historic parishes and therefore a 
number of tithe maps were consulted including Yaxley (1839), Eye 
(1839) and Thrandeston (1846) (Insert 14.3 & Insert 14.4). The tithe 
map for Yaxley (1839) includes the southern half of both the western 
and eastern parts of the Project Site. It does not, however, include the 
proposed Power Generation Plant site or the proposed Gas and 
Electric Connections. According to the tithe apportionment, the land in 
the south-eastern part of the Project Site belonged to Sir Edward 
Kerrison and the occupier was Samuel Peck. The land was used for 
predominantly arable purposes, along with some pasture. The plots 
within the south-western part of the Project Site were also used 
predominantly for arable agricultural purposes and were owned by J.C. 
Cobbold Esq. and were occupied by a James Allen. The Roman Road 
(HA40) can clearly be seen as a major thoroughfare through the 
Project Site (Insert 14.3).

14.9.4 
Eye Tithe map (1839; Insert 14.4) shows the north-eastern part of the 
study area, which roughly covers plots 401 and 402. These were 
owned by Sir Edward Kerrison and occupied by Robert Tillett. They 
were both known as âLong Fieldâ and were used for arable purposes. 
These fields and their associated boundaries (HA30) are likely to be 
medieval in origin as indicated by the long strips. All of the surrounding 
land within the study area was owned by Sir Edward Kerrison and 
much of it occupied by Robert Tillett for arable purposes. The field 
name for plot 399 was âBrick hearth closeâ, which suggests that a brick 
kiln may have been located here to the immediate west of the study 
area. The Roman Road (HA40) can be seen running in a north-
east/south-west direction along the western limits of the map.

An extract from the Thrandeston tithe map (1846) is shown in Insert 
14.5, below. This tithe map shows the north-western part of the study 
area and, again, demonstrates the agricultural landscape of nineteenth 
century mid Suffolk. Goswold Hall (HA20) and its associated dovecote 
(HA21) are shown on this map, although they are not annotated as 
such. Goswold Hall is listed as âpremisesâ, although to the south is a 
field known as âDovehouse closeâ. The landowner is Thomas French 
Esq. and the occupier is John Kirby. The land surrounding Goswold 
Hall is owned and occupied by the same people and a mixture of arable 
and pasture land use is apparent. 
14.9.6 
The Roman Road (HA40) can be seen running through the map in a 
north-east/south-west direction. Other farmhouses are listed, such as 
âMaltings Farmâ (HA27) to the north, which is a Grade II Listed Building 
and also a medieval moated site. âThe Laysâ, later known as The Leys 
on Ordnance Survey mapping, is located to the south-west of Goswold 
Hall.

The Ordnance Survey mapping shows more detailed and accurate 
information regarding the development of the land from the 19th century 
onwards. The earliest 25 inch mapping dates to 1886 and is shown in 
Insert 14.6, below. The vast majority of the study area can be seen in 
this map, apart from the north-western and eastern tips. The study area 
is located at the eastern edge of the map to the immediate east of 
Yaxley Plantation. This area appears to be the same as the earlier tithe 
map with agricultural use. The Roman Road (HA40), Goswold Hall 
(HA20) and medieval field boundaries (HA30) can clearly be seen on 
this map also.

An aerial photograph from 1947 was viewed, which shows Eye Airfield 
(HA31) (Rolfe 2009) and the field boundaries (HA30). Further 
Ordnance Survey mapping (1958, 1977, 1989) show the airfield 
(HA31), which was in disuse by this point. The field boundaries (HA30) 
are still extant on the 1958 mapping, but are not shown on the later 
maps. However, the land has continued to be used for agricultural 
purposes and it is possible that they are still extant. 
14.10 
Site Visit and Setting Initial Assessment 
14.10.1 
A site visit was carried out in June 2013, which included a drive through 
of the 1 km Study Area. A photographic archive was compiled and a 
selection of views is presented as Insert 14.9 to Insert 14.16. The land 
within the study area comprises part of the former Airfield (HA31) in the 
eastern part, whilst the western part is dominated by agricultural land. 
Within the 1km Study Area are several small villages, such as Yaxley, 
Thrandeston, Brome, Langton Green and parts of Eye and Mellis. 
Between these villages is gently undulating agricultural land, belts of 
trees and industrial parks. A photographic record was maintained 
throughout and a selection of photographs is presented in Insert 14.9 to 
Insert 14.16, below.  
14.10.2 
In terms of setting, there is a belt of trees to the east of Goswold Hall 
(HA20) and its dovecote (HA21), which would screen the setting and

the view to a certain extent. A further belt of trees lies to the east of the 
study area, which would aid the screening of settings of Heritage 
Assets in that direction. There are also trees to the north-east of 
Yaxley, which contains a number of Listed Buildings. However, the 
trees would not completely screen the settings, especially during the 
winter months. Further assessment of the visual impact on settings of 
Heritage Assets will be discussed in more detail in the forthcoming 
Cultural Heritage Chapter of the Environmental Statement.

HA24, HA27, HA29, HA30, HA31 and HA40), three of which are Grade 
II Listed Buildings (HA20, HA21 and HA27). An additional five 
designated Heritage Assets lie within the 1 km Study Area (HA05, 
HA06, HA16, HA28 and HA43), of which two are Grade I Listed 
Buildings (HA06, HA16) and three are Grade II Listed Buildings (HA05, 
HA28, HA43). A further Heritage Asset (HA34) is a lane that lies within 
the 1 km Study Area and may once have extended onto the study area.

Criteria  
14.12.2 
Where assets do not possess a statutory designation, their significance 
has been determined with reference to the SoSâs criteria for assessing 
the national importance of monuments, as contained in Annex 1 of the 
policy statement on scheduled monuments (DCMS, 2010). These 
criteria 
relate 
to 
period, 
rarity, 
documentation, 
group 
value, 
survival/condition, fragility/vulnerability, diversity, and potential. The 
definition of these criteria is presented in Table 14.10, below.

Table 14.10 - Definition of Criteria used to Determine Archaeological 
Significance 
Criteria 
Definition 
Rarity 
This should take account of all aspects of the distribution 
of a particular class of Heritage Asset, both in a national 
and a regional context.  
Period 
Heritage Assets that characterise a category of asset or 
period. 
Survival/Condition 
The survival of an assets archaeological potential both 
above and below ground is a particularly important 
consideration and should be assessed in relation to its 
present condition and surviving features.  
Documentary 
Evidence 
The significance of a Heritage Asset may be enhanced by 
the existence of records of previous investigation or, in the 
case of more recent assets, by the supporting evidence of 
contemporary written records 
Potential 
On occasion, the nature of the evidence cannot be 
specified precisely but it may still be possible to document 
reasons anticipating its existence and importance. This is 
usually confined to buried remains rather than upstanding 
Heritage Assets. 
Diversity 
Some Heritage Assets may possess a combination of high 
quality features, others a single important attribute. 
Group Value 
The value of a single Heritage Asset (such as a field 
system) may be greatly enhanced by its association with 
related contemporary assets (such as a settlement and 
cemetery) or with assets of different periods. 
Fragility/Vulnerability 
Highly important archaeological evidence from some field 
monuments can be destroyed by a single ploughing or 
unsympathetic treatment; there are also existing standing 
structures of particular form or complexity whose value 
can again be severely reduced by neglect or careless 
treatment. 
Settlement 
Listings 
 
14.12.3 
Similarly, where Heritage Assets do not have statutory designation their 
historical and aesthetic significance is determined through the use of 
the criteria defined below (Table 14.11). The aesthetic criteria do not

relate to buried archaeological remains as these are not visible above 
ground. The criteria are generally applied to non-designated buildings 
and structures, and to places (which are not considered here). 
 
Table 14.11 - Definition of Historical and Aesthetic Significance 
Criteria 
Definition 
Historical 
This originates from the ways in which past 
people, events and aspects of life can be 
connected through a place to the present. This 
may include illustrative value, such as its 
connection to an important development, such as 
technology, or associative value, such as the 
connection to an important event or person. 
Aesthetic 
This is derived from the ways in which people 
draw sensory and intellectual stimulation from a 
place or building. These may be related to the 
design of a place, for example, through defensive 
reasons, or the informal development over time, 
such as the relationship of structures to their 
setting. 
 
14.12.4 
The consideration of the significance of Listed Buildings is reflected in 
their Grade and so it is not necessary to apply the criteria shown above 
to this type of Heritage Asset. Grade I listed buildings are those which 
are considered to be of exceptional national architectural or historic 
importance. Grade II* Listed Buildings are of particular national 
importance and special interest. Both Grade I and II* Listed Buildings 
are of great importance to the nationâs built heritage and their 
importance will generally be beyond dispute. Grade II Listed Buildings 
are usually designated for their architectural and historic interest. They 
are usually of a more local or regional significance and make up around 
95 per cent of all listed buildings. A plan showing the Listed Buildings 
within the 1 km Study Area is shown in Figure 14.2.

Statement of Significance 
14.13.1 
The Heritage Assets within the study area (HA09, HA12, HA18, HA20, 
HA21, HA24, HA27, HA29, HA30, HA31 and HA40) have been 
considered using the criteria, with the results below. The Heritage 
Assets (HA01, HA04-HA06, HA13, HA16, HA19, HA25, HA26, HA28, 
HA32-HA34, HA39, HA43-HA45 and HA47) outside of the study area, 
but within the 1 km Study Area have also been assessed as the 
development has the potential to impact on the setting of these in a

visual manner. Heritage Assets HA02, HA03, HA07, HA08, HA10, 
HA11, HA14, HA15, HA17, HA22, HA23, HA35-HA38, HA41, HA42 
and HA45 are findspots lying outside The Project Site and therefore 
have not been considered as the development cannot impact on these 
assets. 
14.13.2 
Period: The medieval period Heritage Assets, such as the moated sites 
(HA05, HA13, HA20, HA27, HA28 and HA47), the greens (HA01, 
HA04, HA19 and HA32) and the churches (HA06, HA16) are typical 
features regionally within East Anglia. The Roman Road (HA40) is also 
characteristic of Roman roads across England and Europe. The WWII 
airfield (HA31) is also not an unusual feature in the English landscape 
and is characteristic of World War 2 airfields. 
14.13.3 
Rarity: Medieval churches were generally not built on greens and 
therefore the green at Mellis (HA01) and its associated church (Church 
of St Mary the Virgin), which is a Grade II* Listed Building (DSF6749) is 
considered to be a rare medieval settlement pattern (Suffolk HLC).  
14.13.4 
Documentation: The routes of Roman Roads have been well-
documented (e.g. Margary 1973). Much of the medieval and post-
medieval information is documented in the literature, such as 
Domesday Book and from cartographic sources. Other details could be 
discerned through further documentary research, but this would be 
unlikely to alter the results set out in this report.  
14.13.5 
Group value: The moated sites (HA05, HA13, HA20, HA27, HA28 and 
HA47) have group value as they all had similar functions and forms. 
The greens (HA01, HA04, HA19 and HA32) were part of the medieval 
agricultural landscape and can therefore be grouped together. The 
medieval churches (HA06, HA16) are linked through their religious 
functions. 
14.13.6 
Survival/Condition: As the majority of the study area comprises 
agricultural land, and although some ploughing may have been carried 
out, generally there is high potential for the survival of buried 
archaeological remains. Previous archaeological evaluations within the 
study area have not revealed any archaeological evidence, although an 
abundance of archaeology has been identified from excavations within 
the 1 km Study Area.  
14.13.7 
Fragility/Vulnerability: Any surviving field boundaries within the Project 
Site (HA30), which probably date to the medieval period, are vulnerable 
should any development take place. Any Heritage Assets that lie within 
the study area that will be impacted upon by any groundworks, such as 
cabling, access tracks, etc are vulnerable.

14.13.8 
Diversity: The medieval landscape is relatively diverse with agricultural 
features, such as the greens (HA01, HA04, HA19 and HA32) 
settlement, such as the moated sites (HA05, HA13, HA20, HA27, 
HA28 and HA47) and religious sites, for example churches (HA06, 
HA16).  
14.13.9 
Potential: Within the study area, there is potential for buried 
archaeological remains as the land has continuously been used for 
agriculture since at least the medieval period. Field boundaries (HA30) 
are noted on both the tithe and OS mapping and appear to have the 
classic strip field layout of the medieval period. Its close proximity to the 
Roman Road (HA40) and the known settlement at Scole, just to the 
north of the 1 km Study Area, along with findspots of Romano-British 
pottery in the vicinity suggest there is high potential for Romano-British 
buried remains. The multi-period settlement site at Hartismere High 
School less than 1 km to the south-west of the study area, along with 
scattered findspots within the 1 km Study Area indicates high potential 
for archaeological buried remains dating from the Neolithic to the 
Anglo-Saxon period.

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
POWER GENERATION PLANT 
Construction 
14.14.2 
There are no statutory designated heritage assets within the Power 
Generation Plant site . There are two non-designated assets within the 
Power Generation Plant site, these are: 
ï¿½ 
HA30 - Field boundary, and 
ï¿½ 
HA31/EYE072 â the former Eye Airfield 
14.14.3 
Additionally, there is potential for previously unknown heritage assets 
(buried archaeological remains) to be present within the Power 
Generation Plant site. It is anticipated that the construction phase will 
cause both direct and indirect adverse impacts.  
14.14.4 
There will be a direct impact on the two non-designated assets from 
construction related ground disturbance. There is also potential for a 
direct impact on previously unknown buried archaeological assets. 
14.14.5 
Although no listed buildings lie within the Power Generation Plant site it 
is considered that due to the low-lying nature of the local topography 
that there will be an indirect impact on the setting of quite a number of 
this asset type. As a worst-case scenario, the setting of 70 listed 
buildings could be subject to indirect impact. These are all located

within 1km of the Power Generation Plant site (Table below). As visual 
impact may extend further than 1km, the forthcoming final Cultural 
Heritage Chapter of the ES will consider a wider Study Area of 5km as 
agreed with English Heritage. This would almost certainly increase the 
number of listed buildings subject to impact. Table 14.12 provides a list 
of all the Listed Buildings within 1km of the proposed Power Generation 
Plant.

Operation  
14.14.6 
Following a suitable programme of archaeological mitigation there will 
be no direct impacts on either known or potential heritage assets 
throughout the operation phase of the plant.  
14.14.7 
Although sensitive mitigation could alleviate the effects of indirect 
impacts to a degree, it is anticipated that the indirect adverse impact on 
the setting of the listed buildings shown above (Table 14.12) will 
continue throughout the operation phase of the Power Generation 
Plant.  
Decommissioning 
14.14.8 
There will be no direct impacts on either known or potential heritage 
assets throughout the decommissioning phase of the Power 
Generation Plant. 
14.14.9 
There will be an indirect positive impact on the setting of the listed 
buildings shown above in Table 14.12. 
GAS CONNECTION ROUTE CORRIDOR OPTION 1

Although no listed buildings lie within Gas Connection option 1, it is 
likely that due to the low-lying nature of the local topography that there

As a worst-case scenario the setting of approximately 30 listed 
buildings could be subject to indirect impact, although due to the nature 
of the works the significance of the effect would be very low and 
temporary. These buildings are all located within approximately 0.5 km 
of Gas Connection option 1

Connection Compound Option 2. The significance of the effect will be 
low.

Decommissioning 
14.14.42 
There will be no direct impacts on either known or potential heritage 
assets throughout the decommissioning phase of the connection. 
14.14.43 
There could be a temporary indirect adverse impact on the setting of 
the listed buildings (Table 14.16) during this phase if infrastructure is 
removed from the routes. The significance of the effects would be very 
low significance and temporary.   
14.15 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
14.15.1 
Current legislation draws a distinction between archaeological remains 
of national importance and other remains considered to be of lesser 
significance. Those perceived to be of national importance may require 
preservation in situ, whilst those of lesser significance may undergo 
preservation by record, where Regional / County or Local / Borough 
significance can be demonstrated. 
14.15.2 
No buried archaeological sites have been identified within the study 
area that may be considered as being of national importance and 
therefore merit preservation in situ. However, the lack of development 
across the site increases the likelihood of survival of any below ground 
remains. 
14.15.3 
Following consultation with the Suffolk County Archaeologist, a 
programme of archaeological evaluation has been agreed. This will 
comprise a geophysical survey in the first instance. This non-intrusive 
investigation will be followed by a programme of archaeological trial 
trenching should the findings of the geophysical surveys necessitate. 
The trial trenches would be sited across the Power Generation Plant 
site in accordance with the results of the geophysical survey, and also 
along the Gas Connection option and the option for the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound once the preferred 
routes have been identified, although the potential impacts from either 
option do not vary) in order to assess the direct impacts on below 
ground archaeological deposits, and to determine their survival and 
character.  
14.16 
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Effects 
14.16.1 
On the basis of the preliminary historic environmental information and 
assessment described above, taking into account potential mitigation 
measures, likely significant effects cannot yet be been ruled out as a 
result of indirect visual impact on arising from the proposed Project. 
This applies for listed buildings within 1km of the proposed Project

14.16.2 
Although some level of suitable screening may be achievable it is not 
always possible to mitigate against the effects of tall structures on the 
setting of heritage assets. There will be residual effects on the setting 
of the listed buildings, although this will be of low significance for the 
majority of the buildings.  
14.16.3 
The archaeological mitigation works will serve to preserve by record all 
the heritage assets (known and potential) which are subject to a direct 
impact. This will take place prior to construction and therefore there will 
be no residual effects remaining on these assets. 
14.17 
Next Steps 
14.17.1 
A written scheme of investigation detailing the archaeological mitigation 
and comprising a method statement will be compiled and submitted to 
the Suffolk County Archaeologist for comments. 
14.17.2 
The mitigation will include a programme of geophysical survey 
(magnetometer) to be undertaken within the proposed site of the Gas 
Generation Plant and the four connection corridors. This will inform 
intrusive site investigations (trial trenching), which will target areas of 
known archaeology and potential archaeology. It is likely that an 
archaeological watching brief will also be undertaken in specific areas. 
14.17.3 
Following the completion of the archaeological investigation a report 
and archive will be compiled.

15.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements 
15.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
socio-economic impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
15.2.3 
NPS EN-1 acknowledges that âthe construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic 
impacts at local and regional levelsâ (paragraph 5.12.1). At paragraph 
4.2.2 it states that in addition to an ES prepared in accordance with the 
European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive âthe [SoS] will 
find it helpful if the applicant sets out information on the likely significant 
social and economic effects of the development, and show how any 
likely significant negative effects would be avoided or mitigated. This 
could include employment, equality, community cohesion and well-
being.â 
15.2.4 
NPS EN-1 states that where the proposed project is likely to have 
socio-economic impacts at local or regional levels, the applicant should 
undertake and include in their application an assessment of relevant 
socio-economic impacts, which may include the creation of jobs and 
training opportunities; the provision of additional local services and 
improvements to local infrastructure, including the provision of 
educational and visitor facilities; effects on tourism; and the impacts of 
a changing influx of workers during the different phases of the energy 
infrastructure. 
15.2.5 
It further notes that in making a decision on energy NSIP the Secretary 
of State may attribute limited weight to assertions of socio-economic 
impact that are not supported by evidence and may take into account 
mitigation such as planning obligations and particular options as to 
phasing the development in relation to impacts.  
15.2.6 
NPS EN-2 Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure should be 
considered alongside NPS EN-1. It emphasises the benefits of a low 
carbon economy including the likely âpositive effects on the Economy 
and Skills, and Health and Well-being as secondary benefits and 
positive effects in the medium/long term on climate change.â

15.2.7 
NPS EN-4 Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines sets 
out policy for route selection for gas supply infrastructure and gas 
pipelines, along with likely impacts of their construction, commissioning 
and operation. 
15.2.8 
NPS EN-5 factors that should be taken into account related to route 
selection for developers, along with likely impacts of their construction, 
commissioning and operation. 
15.2.9 
While only a number of the impacts raised in the NPSs are considered 
likely to be relevant to the proposed Project, the socio-economic 
assessment may also take into account any relevant positive provisions 
the developer has made or is proposing to make to mitigate impacts 
(for example through planning obligations) and any legacy benefits that 
may arise as well as any options for phasing development in relation to 
the socio-economic impacts, to enable them to be considered by the 
Secretary of State for the purposes of decision-making. 
Other National and Local Policy 
15.2.10 
Whilst the Planning Act 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant 
NPS, other national and local planning policy can be considered 
important and relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of 
an energy NSIP. 
15.2.11 
The National Planning Policy Framework (2012) (the NPPF) sets 
sustainable development at its core, stating that the policies set in 
paragraphs 18-219, taken as a whole, constitute the Governmentâs 
view of what sustainable development in England means in practice for 
the planning system. It recognises that sustainable development has 
three dimensions: economic, social and environmental, and these are 
reflected in the 12 âCore planning principlesâ. Those of relevance to 
socio-economic impact assessment are: 
ï¿½ 
Proactively drive and support sustainable economic development to 
deliver the homes, business and industrial units, infrastructure and 
thriving local places that the country needs. Every effort should be 
made objectively to identify and then meet the housing, business 
and other development needs of an area, and respond positively to 
wider opportunities for growth. Plans should take account of market 
signals, such as land prices and housing affordability, and set out a 
clear strategy for allocating sufficient land which is suitable for 
development in their area, taking account of the needs of the 
residential and business communities;

ï¿½ 
take account of and support local strategies to improve health, 
social and cultural wellbeing for all, and deliver sufficient 
community and cultural facilities and services to meet local needs. 
15.2.12 
These underpin the 13 ways of âdelivering sustainable developmentâ, 
the most relevant to the socio-economic impact assessment being 
listed below: 
ï¿½ 
Building a strong, competitive economy (1) 
ï¿½ 
Supporting a prosperous rural economy (3) 
ï¿½ 
Promoting healthy communities (8) 
15.2.13 
In relation to (1) it is stated that âthe Government is committed to 
ensuring that the planning system does everything it can to support 
sustainable economic growth. Planning should operate to encourage 
and not act as an impediment to sustainable growth. Therefore 
significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic 
growth through the planning systemâ (paragraph 19). At paragraph 21 it 
is stated that âinvestment in business should not be over-burdened by 
the combined requirements of planning policy expectations. [Local] 
Planning policies should recognise and seek to address potential 
barriers to investment, including a poor environment or any lack of 
infrastructure, services or housingâ.  
15.2.14 
In relation to (3) it is stated at paragraph 28 that âplanning policies 
should support economic growth in rural areas in order to create jobs 
and prosperity by taking a positive approach to sustainable new 
development. To promote a strong rural economy, local and 
neighbourhood plans should support the sustainable growth and 
expansion of all types of business and enterprise in rural areas (â¦)â.  
15.2.15 
In relation to (8) it is stated at paragraphs 69 and 70 that (local) 
planning policies and decisions should develop a shared vision with 
communities of the environment and facilities they wish to see, and 
take an integrated approach to the location of economic uses of land. 
The consultation and publication of the Eye Airfield Development Brief 
by Mid Suffolk District Council is likely to represent one example of the 
application of this policy.  
15.2.16 
The 2012 Gas Generation Strategy highlights that gas-fired power 
stations are relatively cost effective and quick to build. It states that 
these plants can âoffer employment opportunities throughout the 
countryâ. 
15.2.17 
The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan states, âCoal and gas will 
remain important to ensure our electricity supply is reliable and secure

as we move towards greater dependence on intermittent renewable 
sources like windâ 
15.2.18 
The Mid-Suffolk Local Plan (1998)14 plan identifies the former Eye 
Airfield as having proposed uses for Industrial, commercial and 
business development. Policy E2 favours âindustrial uses on allocated 
sitesâ. 
15.2.19 
The Mid Suffolk District Council Core Strategy (2008) in conjunction 
with the Focused Review (2012) designate Eye as a town in the 
settlement hierarchy in Policy CS1 to which the majority of 
development will be directed. Policy CS6 refers to the provision of local 
services and infrastructure in conjunction with new development where 
appropriate, the overall aims including to reduce the need to travel, 
improving the safety and ease of accessing jobs, retail and other 
services by sustainable modes of transport, and to contribute to 
identified local infrastructure priorities. Policy CS11 seeks to ensure a 
sufficient supply of employment land, including by protecting existing 
designated employment land. Eye Airfield Industrial Estate and the 
former Eye Airfield itself are both identified as of âmediumâ quality and 
previously developed land.  
15.2.20 
SCC commissioned a study (West Suffolk Review of Employment 
Land (2008)15 in 2008 which recognises the former Eye Airfield as a 
local employment area. The former Eye Airfield is recognised as an 
appropriate location for industrial development. 
15.2.21 
The Suffolk Growth Strategy (2013) 
16 outlines Suffolkâs ambitions for 
the future. Energy is identified as being one of Suffolkâs priority growth 
sectors because it has significant growth potential in terms of job 
creation. Suffolkâs proximity to oil and gas resources gives it a âcrucial 
advantage in the energy sectorâ. By 2028 it is envisaged that 
âemployment in the energy sector has more than doubled since 2013 
and provides some of the highest value-added jobs in the countyâ. It 
also seeks to help develop a âcoordinated economic strategy which 
sets out how Suffolk will create more, higher value, high skill jobs and 
increase wealth across the countyâ. The Strategy also analyses 
strengths and weaknesses of the Suffolk economy, places a spotlight 
on the challenges and opportunities ahead and defines how the county, 
district and borough councils will work together with local partners to 
create the right conditions for business growth.

Eye Airfield Development Framework (February 2013)17 was 
prepared to assist Mid-Suffolk council to manage and control 
development on the former Eye Airfield going forward to 2031. This site 
is recognised as having the potential to provide additional jobs for the 
area.  
15.3 
Project Scenario for Assessment 
15.3.1 
The features associated with a realistic worst case scenario differ 
depending on whether socio-economic, tourism or community 
infrastructure receptors are the subject of consideration. For example, 
while a CCGT plant with a greater concentration of generation 
equipment, a taller stack, and a larger footprint may have greater 
potential to cause adverse impacts on local tourism and recreation 
businesses, it would have a greater level of beneficial impact within the 
construction sector (providing labour requirements can be met locally). 
The respective âworst caseâ socio-economic, tourism and community 
infrastructure effects in each area are indicated below.  
Table 15.1 - Realistic Worst Case Scenario  
Receptor  
Worst case scenario effect  
Socio-economic 
Insufficient labour supply. Excessive in-migration 
of labour leading to labour market distortions.  
Tourism  
Major detrimental impact on areas tourism appeal 
and tourism product leading to tourism related 
business closures. And/or accommodation 
capacity issues arising from demand from the 
proposed Project construction workers 
Community 
facilities  
Major capacity pressures on education and health 
services in construction phase. Transport and 
physical severance issues leading to temporary/ 
permanent closure of community facilities 
15.3.2 
The project above is assessed against its potential to generate these 
types of impact

Guidance  
15.4.2 
The assessment follows UK Government guidelines and best practice. 
The methodology used to estimate impacts follows guidance set out in 
the HM Treasuryâs Green Book18 and English Partnerships (EP) 
Additionality Guide, as well as taking into account the Department for 
Business Innovation and Skills research on additionality.19  
Study Areas 
15.4.3 
The following study areas have been used in this assessment. Given 
the adjacency of the different components common study areas have 
been adopted. The socio-economic and tourism study areas were 
defined in the consultation exercise on methodology with consultees:  
ï¿½ 
Socio economic study area - The study area for the socio-
economic assessment is based on drive time catchment areas from 
the Project Site. The âlocal areaâ is defined within a 30 minute drive 
time, âwider areaâ within a 45 minute drive time, and âwider regionâ 
within a 60 minute drive time (please see Insert 15.1)   
ï¿½ 
Tourism study area - The study area for the tourism assessment 
is defined by a 15 km radius from the Project Site. Facilities or 
notable points of focus of visitor attraction within this area have 
been reviewed. Any significant tourism facilities located just outside 
the boundary have also been included (please see Insert 15.2)   
ï¿½ 
Community Infrastructure study area - As proximity is likely to be 
the main determinant of impacts and their scale, the status (or 
catchment) of the community facility receptors in an area 
determines the scale and significance of any impacts. Whilst Eye is 
defined as a âtownâ in the settlement hierarchy in the Core Strategy 
(2008), it has a population of some 2,000 people. Its community 
facilities are likely to serve a local area, their catchment not 
extending to settlements of similar or larger size. Effects will 
therefore tend to be limited to receptors in this local area. For this 
assessment, this is taken to be within a 5 km radius.

Approach 
15.4.4 
The main stages of the approach are as follows:  
Review available data/information 
15.4.5 
Data and information from national, regional and local databases has 
been reviewed, identifying information gaps and requirements for data 
gathering e.g. business, supply chain and other surveys. 
15.4.6 
Comparative analysis 
15.4.7 
Data and information regarding the predicted and/or experienced 
socioeconomic effects of similar projects is being examined  
Baseline 
15.4.8 
The Study areaâs socioeconomic position has been described using 
standard indicators. This provides a baseline from which potential 
impacts can be assessed: 
ï¿½ 
Economic: the area has been described using a combination of: 
standard sources and indicators: research available at study area 
level; and research into the business and labour market structure of 
the local economy. 
ï¿½ 
-Tourism: the areaâs visitor attraction has been profiled including: 
visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and 
value; and the local tourism economy. 
ï¿½ 
Social: Indices of deprivation and demographic structure have been 
examined. An audit of community infrastructure has been prepared. 
ï¿½ 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other relevant 
policy have been reviewed to identify related economic, social and 
regeneration objectives which the Project may affect (whether 
contributing to their realisation or otherwise). 
Assessment of potential economic impacts 
15.4.9 
A detailed assessment of likely effects on the local, regional and 
national economy during construction, operation and decommissioning 
of the proposed Project is being prepared. This will assess the scale of:  
ï¿½ 
Direct economic impacts: jobs and GVA that are wholly or largely 
related to construction, decommissioning, and operation and 
maintenance of the proposed Project 
 
 
Progress Power Project Preliminary

PRO-4200-PB-ENV-RPT-R50.docx 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
October 2013 
for Progress Power Limited 
 
- 527 - 
 
ï¿½ 
Indirect economic impacts (positive and negative): jobs and GVA 
generated in the study area in the chain of suppliers of goods and 
services to the direct activities 
ï¿½ 
Induced economic impacts: jobs and GVA created by direct and 
indirect employeesâ spending in the study area or in the wider 
economy 
ï¿½ 
Wider economic (catalytic) impacts (positive and negative): 
employment and income generated in the economy related to the 
wider role of the proposed Project in influencing economic activities 
(including wider socio-economic effects).  
Assessment of potential tourism impacts 
15.4.10 
Tourism and recreational behaviour will only be detrimentally affected 
where the effects of the proposed Project either changes the 
visitor/user pattern in terms of numbers, and /or their patterns of 
expenditure for the worse. As such, opportunities for tourist and visitor 
expenditure, any potential variation in expenditure or visitor numbers, 
and consequent effects on turnover or employment are of key 
importance.  
15.4.11 
A business survey will be carried out to gain a more detailed 
understanding of the local tourism economy and its current 
performance. Businesses that will be contacted include key visitor 
accommodation providers, leisure activity providers and other relevant 
tourism businesses. 
15.4.12 
Facilities or notable points of focus in the study area have been 
identified. Based upon the proposed Project's anticipated visibility, 
comment is provided on the likelihood of the proposed Project 
influencing visitor and tourist attitudes and behaviour towards these 
visitor facilities and locations.  
15.4.13 
The significance of tourism impacts will be determined through an 
understanding of the sensitivity of a receptor and the anticipated 
magnitude of effect.  
Assessment of potential community infrastructure impacts 
15.4.14 
An assessment of the likely significant effects on local, regional and 
national community receptors during construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project is being carried out. This 
assessment 
includes 
an 
audit 
of 
community 
infrastructure 
facilities/receptors within the local area and its associated effects (i.e. 
effects on local schools, local authority services and other 
infrastructure).

Mitigation measures 
15.4.15 
Where impacts are assessed as significant adverse, mitigation 
measures are outlined. As with impact identification, mitigation 
measures will be described discretely to address construction, 
operation and decommissioning impacts. 
Conclusions on cumulative and residual effects 
15.4.16 
An assessment of cumulative and residual effects will be provided 
stating the likely cumulative impacts of the proposed Project with other 
projects in the study area or beyond; and in what way, if at all, the 
proposed Project would have post-mitigated or residual effects on its 
local and wider socio-economic context. Trans-boundary effects have 
been scoped out by the SoS. 
15.4.17 
This approach has been discussed with officers from Suffolk County 
Council and Mid-Suffolk District Council who have confirmed its 
appropriateness for the purpose of this assessment. It has also been 
sent to other statutory consultees for comment. At this time, a number 
of responses are still to be received 
Sensitivity, magnitude and significance criteria 
15.4.18 
In addition to quantitative and qualitative assessment, impact 
significance is defined by the combination of the sensitivity of receptors 
and the magnitude of impacts on them. Criteria specific to 
socioeconomic factors have been adopted in defining the hierarchies of 
receptor sensitivity and impact magnitude. 
Determining socio-economic sensitivity of effect 
 
15.4.19 
For economic impacts and effects (including employment), the 
availability of labour and skills is critical in accommodating the 
demands, needs and requirements of the proposed development. 
Adequate capacity results in a low sensitivity, while limited capacity 
results in a high sensitivity.  
15.4.20 
The key socio-economic indicators for the Study Area in relation to the 
criteria include: 
ï¿½ 
the proportion of skilled workforce in the study area relative to 
national averages  
ï¿½ 
educational attainment levels in relation to national averages 
ï¿½ 
the 
proportion 
of 
employment 
in 
relevant 
sectors 
(i.e. 
manufacturing and construction workers) in the Study Area

Sensitivity  
Example 
Very High 
There is no availability of labour and skills in the areaâs 
workforce (this is dependent on specific project 
requirements and the degree to which they can be met in 
the Study area). 
The Project would lead to labour market pressure and 
distortions (i.e., skills and capacity shortages, import of 
labour, wage inflation). 
High  
There is low/limited availability of labour and skills in the 
areaâs workforce (The Project would lead to labour market 
pressure and distortions (i.e., skills and capacity 
shortages, import of labour, wage inflation). 
Medium  
The area has a constrained supply of labour and skills. 
The Project may lead to labour market pressure and 
distortions. 
Low (or lower) 
The receptor has a readily available labour force: some 
skill deficits. 
The Project is unlikely to lead to labour market pressure 
and distortions  
Negligible 
Where an effect would not be discernible; and/or where 
fewer than 10 jobs would be created or lost within the 
Study Area. 
and/or 
Effects would be temporary (i.e. experienced for less than 
one year). 
Determining socio-economic magnitude of effect 
 
15.4.21 
The magnitude of the effect of potential socioeconomic impacts is 
assessed against the thresholds shown in Table15.3.

Sensitivity of tourism receptor 
15.4.22 
Impact significance is determined through an understanding of the 
sensitivity of a receptor and the anticipated magnitude of effect.  
15.4.23 
In considering the level of tourism sensitivity, the standing of the 
receptor or resource is the defining factor. This is established against: 
ï¿½ 
Tourism businessâ relative attraction to customers from outside the 
Study Area and the proposed Projectâs potential to influence 
broader perceptions of the area. Where a majority of trade is non-
local this is more likely to be the case; 
ï¿½ 
the relative importance of tourism as a business sector. Where 
tourism is more important relative to other sectors, impacts may 
have the potential to generate broader impacts. Similarly, where it 
is of relatively low significance, impacts on tourism and related 
sectors are unlikely to generate a high level of adverse impact 
across the broader economy.

Significance of Impact 
15.4.29 
Impact significance is the term used to categorise the impact, e.g. 
negligible, minor, moderate and major; and can be positive, neutral or 
negative. It takes into account the sensitivity of the receptor and the 
magnitude of effects in the EIA Methodology (Section 3)  
15.5 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
15.5.1 
The proposed Project has been designed from the outset to ensure its 
impacts are minimised. This includes mitigation that is embedded into 
the design of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and industry 
standard methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction, 
operation and decommissioning are minimised. 
15.5.2 
In terms of tourism and recreation, the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant and the installation of the associated gas and 
electrical cables will be programmed wherever practicable to avoid 
particularly sensitive locations, recreational user viewpoints and 
corridors at peak user periods. For example the location of the Power 
Generation Plant is located in an industrial area thus reducing its visual 
impact. 
15.6 
Scoping Consultations

âI have reviewed the method statement and it all seems logical. My only comment would 
be the cumulative impact of this and other major projects happening in the region at 
roughly the same time and the potential for an overall reduction of leisure visitors to the 
area for long periods. Disruption of ânormalâ availability of accommodation for leisure 
visitors could result in them choosing to visit another part of the country with the 
economic impact not only impacting the accommodation providers themselves but also 
the attractions, restaurants and bars whoâs income originates from those visitors.â 
 
âWhilst there is a need for such projects here in East Anglia in order to create and 
support both direct and indirect employment, the potential impact on our Â£4.2bn visitor 
economy needs to be considered with appropriate measures to protect and ensure that 
any negative impacts taken into consideration.â

Need to differentiate between construction and operational impacts here. Negative 
tourism impacts during construction would be from general disruption/traffic, but 
operationally from visual impacts. The impact on accommodation/services would also 
differ between construction and operation due to different numbers of workers 
(clarification of maintenance regime/outages work?). You propose to evaluate tourist 
impacts out of main season. The EIA will of course need to present a worst-case 
scenario, so if you do not assess for impacts during the high season, that would logically 
not permit works to occur in the main season as that would take you out of the scope of 
the ES. 
Disagree, as 
respondents will be 
asked to provide 
tourism business 
information for both 
peak and off peak 
seasons. The timing

Our approach to mitigation for socio-economic impacts is to; 
1. secure early and strong commitment from developers to work with local stakeholder to 
maximise the local economic development opportunities arising from the development. 
2. secure early discussions with developers over a long term skills plan which will meet 
the construction and operational needs of the development and aligns with local 
initiatives that are underway 
More detail on the proposals to promote local recruitment (Scoping Report 5.12.1) would 
also be useful.

âClarity on the impact on existing sports facilities as a result of the development. Will any 
facilities be lost due to the site development? Will access to any existing facilities be 
reduced? If so how will this be mitigated? 
Will access to existing facilities be impacted during the construction phase? If so how will 
this be mitigated? 
Will the development result in a deviation of routes to access existing facilities? If so 
what time impact will this have for existing users to get to any given site? Drive time for 
sports facilities is normally expected to be no more than 20 minutes? 
Will there be any significant population growth as a result of the development? If so what 
impact does this have on existing sports pitches and sports facilities? Does the local 
authority have a playing pitch and sports facilities strategy and what capacity in provision 
does it identify? Do existing facilities have capacity to accommodate additional demand? 
If not what is the solution?â

Economic Activity 
15.7.5 
The economic activity rate is a useful measure of the labour market 
opportunities available in the area21. The local areaâs level of economic 
activity is comparable to the national average. 
                                                   
21
 The economic activity rate measures the percentage of the population, both in employment and unemployed 
that represent the labour supply regardless of their labour status.  The figure represents the degree of success of 
the area in engaging people in productive activity.

The proposed Projectâs local area is characterised by relatively low 
levels of unemployment. Rural areas typically have higher levels of self-
employment. The proportion of self-employed workers in the local area 
is higher than the national average indicting relatively high levels of 
entrepreneurship. However, the proportion of retired people in the local 
area is particularly high. Nonetheless, overall the local labour market is 
generally comparable with the wider area, region and national 
averages.

is also high. Agriculture, manufacturing and construction employment in 
the local area is above the national average however, as in many rural 
areas, the proportion of people who work in finance and real estate is 
low.

 Socio Economic and Labour Market Sensitivity 
15.7.12 
The socio-economic profile outlined above indicates that a constrained 
supply of labour and skills. The proposed Project may lead to labour 
market pressure and distortions (i.e. wage inflation, skills and capacity 
shortages, import of labour). 
15.7.13 
The overall sensitivity of the labour market is assessed as low/ 
medium.  
Tourism Context 
15.7.14 
This section provides a tourism profile of the East of England 
specifically Suffolk and Norfolk in terms of visitor and tourist trends, 
tourism volume and value, visitor patterns, visitor accommodation, 
occupancy rates and expenditure patterns. The most up-to-date 
sources of information have been used. Where possible figures for 
MSDC are used in preference to the wider Suffolk County area as the 
proposed development is located in this council boundary.

The International Passenger Survey is carried out annually and in it 
visitors to the UK are asked what activities they undertake whilst 
visiting. Between 2006 and 2009 the top three most popular activities in 
the East of England were to âeat in restaurantsâ, âgo to a pubâ and âshop 
for clothes and accessoriesâ. Other activities included âsightseeing of 
famous monumentsâ, âvisiting the countryside and villages,â and âgoing 
to museumsâ. Less prominent activities include golf, researching 
ancestry and visiting spa/beauty centres.  
Visitor Accommodation 
15.7.18 
In 2012 Visit England carried out an accommodation stock audit in the 
East of England. This audit profiled the type of establishments in the 
area, and specified the number of bed-spaces contained within them. 
15.7.19 
Both Mid Suffolk and South Norfolk have a low proportion of serviced 
and non-serviced establishments in their wider county regions. Mid 
Suffolk accounts for 12% of serviced and 8% of nonâserviced 
establishments in Suffolk, while South Norfolk accounts for 10% and 
5% of serviced and non-serviced establishments respectively in 
Norfolk.  
15.7.20 
Both areas also account for a low proportion of bed-spaces (both 
serviced and non-serviced) in their county regions. 
15.7.21 
The low concentration of accommodation provision in Mid Suffolk and 
South Norfolk indicates that neither area is considered among the main 
visitor destinations in their respective counties.

Overseas Visitor Trips 
15.7.23 
Insert 15.3 shows that in terms of overseas tourism, visitor numbers to 
both Suffolk and Norfolk have fluctuated between 2006 and 2012. In 
this period Suffolk went from 237,000 visitors in 2008 to a low of 
186,000 in 2011. Norfolk recorded its highest number of visitors 
(231,000) in 2008 and its lowest (160,000) in 2011. This reduction can 
be expected due to the current economic climate and more people 
choosing to holiday at home. However, both areas have noted recent 
increases in their visitor numbers.  
15.7.24 
In 2012, Suffolk and Norfolk accounted for 11% and 10% respectively 
of trips in the East of England. Other parts of the East of England such 
as Cambridgeshire and Essex each account for around a quarter of 
trips.

Overseas Visitor Nights 
15.7.29 
The number of overseas visitor nights has fallen recently in both Suffolk 
and Norfolk. In Suffolk numbers have fallen from a high of 2.1 million 
nights in 2006 to 1.5 million nights in 2012. In Norfolk nights have gone 
from a high of 2.1 million nights in 2008 to 1.6 million nights in 2012. 
15.7.30 
In 2012 there were 14.3 million overseas visitorsâ nights in the East of 
England. Suffolk (11%) and Norfolk (12%) account for just under a 
quarter of trips in the East of England region. Overseas visitors 
preferred to stay in locations in Cambridgeshire and Essex, which 
accounted for 31% and 21% respectively of overseas nights.

Overseas Visitor Spend 
15.7.31 
Overseas visitor spend in Suffolk and Norfolk has remained fairly 
consistent between 2007 and 2012. However, spend in Suffolk fell 
significantly from a high of Â£222 million in 2006. In 2012 Suffolk and 
Norfolk both noted increases in overseas visitor spend relative to the 
previous year. 
15.7.32 
In total, visitor spend in the East of England in 2012 was Â£773 million. 
Suffolk (Â£86 million) and Norfolk (Â£81 million) each account for just over 
a tenth of the total visitor spend in the wider region. Cambridgeshire 
(Â£265 million), Essex (Â£139 million) and Hertfordshire (Â£132 million) all 
account for higher overseas visitor expenditure.  This highlights the 
relative tourism attraction of Suffolk and Norfolk in the East of England 
context.

Profile of Tourism Business

Table 15.13 - Profile of Tourism Businesses within 5 and 15km of 
Project Site (2003 & 2008) shows the number of tourism related 
businesses within 5km and 15km of the Project Site by category in 
2003 (earliest year available) and 2008. The composition of tourism 
businesses remained relatively constant over the 5 year period. In the 
5km area there has been a 5% increase in tourism related businesses 
between 2003 and 2008. Similarly in the 15km area there has been a 
1% increase in tourism related businesses. In the 15km area nearly half 
of the businesses in 2008 were either restaurants or bars.  
15.7.34 
In the 15km area there are a total number of 5194 businesses, of which 
8% are tourism businesses. This shows that tourism businesses do not 
form a significant proportion of businesses in the area. In the 5km area 
there are a total of 1293 businesses, of which 8% are tourism 
businesses. The low proportion of tourism businesses indicates that 
tourism is not the main drivers of the local economy.

Insert 15.1 shows the concentration of tourism businesses per super 
output area within a 15 km radius from the Project Site. Diss has the 
highest concentration of tourism related businesses (31-60) in the 
15km radius of the Project Site. These consist of businesses such as 
restaurants, bars as well as recreational activities. Other areas to the 
south east, south west and north of the site have 1-5 tourism 
businesses. Most of the 15km radius has between 5-15 tourism related 
businesses. Tourism businesses are present in the area, but not at a 
large scale.  Nearby areas outside the 15km radius such as Bury St 
Edmunds have much higher concentrations of tourism-related 
businesses. 
Tourism Sensitivity 
 
15.7.36 
The tourism profile outlined above indicates that tourism is not a 
significant sector in the local area. Therefore, tourism is considered to 
be of low sensitivity to the proposed Project. 
 
Community infrastructure audit 
15.7.37 
Within 5km of the Project Site there are a range of community 
infrastructure such as schools, libraries, care homes, hospitals, 
dentists, community centres and parks. This includes the following 
facilities as Shown on Figure 15.1. 
Education

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Socio Economic 
15.8.2 
The proposed Project will deliver positive socio-economic impacts through:  
ï¿½ 
employment creation; and  
ï¿½ 
capital expenditure and workers spending in the local economy.  
15.8.3 
These effects, with the exception of decommissioning employment (negligible) have been assessed to be of 
minor positive significance (Table 15.14). No adverse socio-economic impacts or effects are identified 
through the assessment.

There is already an existing stack at adjacent to the Project Site of 
greater height than the proposed Project. Therefore, the level of 
visual impact is considered to be minor as the visual impact of 
industrialisation has already been established.  
Moreover, the likelihood of significant impact reduces with 
distance. The majority of tourism related-businesses within 15km 
are located 5-10km away from the Project Site. The probability of 
the proposed Project significantly affecting tourism in terms of 
visual impact is considered low.  
Noise

there is not a significant cluster of tourism-related activity around 
the Project Site. Therefore, air quality is not expected to be a 
significant issue for tourism in the area.

The route corridor is designed to avoid particularly sensitive tourism 
and recreation locations. It route corridor runs through farmland and 
there are no known key promoted walking/cycling paths/routes 
running through the proposed route corridor. Therefore, no 
significant effects are expected. However, if any key routes were 
later highlighted as being affected, the contractors would ensure 
ongoing safe access and provide an alternative were any

There are already existing over head lines adjacent to the 
proposed Electrical Connection Compound area which are much 
taller than the proposed compound; however, the compound 
would be situated within a rural landscape. Therefore, the level of 
visual impact on tourism is considered to be moderate.  
Moreover, the likelihood of significant impact reduces with 
distance. The majority of tourism related-businesses within 15km 
are located 5-10km away from the proposed compound. The

although with the development of a traffic management plan 
these should be minimal. During operation, traffic movements to 
the electrical connection compound will be minimal and there are 
no anticipated impacts at this preliminary stage.

It is considered unlikely that the operation or effectiveness of 
community facilities would be affected by the appearance of 
the proposed Project. Patronage of recreation based 
community facilities is primarily driven by demand for the 
activity they host. As long as services or facilities can be 
provided from the receptor the visual appearance of the 
development should not affect levels of patronage or its 
operation.

significant effects on socio-economics, tourism and recreation and 
community infrastructure as a result of the proposed Project. 
15.11 
Next Steps 
15.11.1 
Building from this initial assessment the following steps will be 
undertaken in the next phase of socio-economic analysis: 
ï¿½ 
A mapping of the ZTV analysis against tourism and recreational 
receptors in the area to gain a better understanding of the potential 
visual impact of the assessment; 
ï¿½ 
The impact assessment will be informed in part by a Business 
Survey, which will ask local tourism-related businesses in the area 
what impact the proposed Project and associated gas and electrical 
connections will have on their business and on tourism in the wider 
area. 
ï¿½ 
Detailed estimates of the economic impact of the construction and 
operation of Project and the construction of the gas and electricity 
components.

CUMULATIVE IMPACT 
16.1 
Introduction 
16.1.1 
This section provides a preliminary assessment of the potential cumulative 
impacts associated with the proposed Project based on the current 
understanding of the proposed Project and its surroundings. It draws on the 
assessment of impacts provided in sections 6 to 15, along with information 
relating to other developments in the area, either existing or proposed. 
16.1.2 
A more detailed assessment of these impacts will be provided in the ES 
that accompanies the proposed DCO Application.  
16.1.3 
Cumulative impacts can be either: 
ï¿½ 
Type 1 Cumulative Impacts 
These are combined effects of different types of impact on a single 
receptor. For example: dust, noise and visual impacts resulting from 
construction and operation of the proposed Project and other 
reasonably foreseeable future developments; or  
ï¿½ 
Type 2 Cumulative Impacts 
These are the same type of impact from the proposed project and 
current or reasonably foreseeable future developments which may 
individually be insignificant, but could be cumulatively significant. For 
example: cumulative traffic impacts during construction.  
16.1.4 
This section presents the current and reasonably foreseeable future 
developments considered as part of this preliminary cumulative impact 
assessment are listed and described in Table 16.1 
16.1.5 
For the purposes of this assessment, reasonably foreseeable future 
developments have been defined as those which 
ï¿½ 
are consented but not yet built;  
ï¿½ 
are not yet consented but in the planning system; and  
ï¿½ 
are committed to come forward (i.e. supported in a development plan)

Although the construction of proposed Project has the potential to add 
to emissions from existing industrial activities, including the Diss 
Compressor Station and Chicken Litter Power Station, these activities 
will be considered as part of the normal impact assessment process 
given that the operational developments will form part of the baseline 
upon which construction emissions would be assessed are already 
captured in the baseline assessment and are thus not considered 
cumulative. As such the only potential cumulative impact on air quality 
is the construction of the Eye Wind Power Ltd turbines, which would 
likely also generate dust and traffic emissions.

Cumulative impacts may arise due to: Noise and vibration generating

Project; together with, noise and vibration emissions from nearby 
operation within the former Eye Airfield, including the wind turbines, 
Chicken Litter Power Station and other industrial estate activities. 
Although these existing noise sources are already captured in the 
baseline, it is important to consider the addition to these sources to 
ensure that âNoise Creepâ, where there is a gradual increase in 
background noise over time, is not permitted to occur.

that these two projects were built in parallel, there would not be 
expected to have any negative impact on any ecologically designated 
sites.

Impact 
Although a number of potential impacts on water quality have been 
identified for the proposed Project, depending upon the choice of the 
Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical Connection, no other 
impacts from other activates have been identified that would result in a 
cumulative effect.

Cumulative 
Impact 
As the main impact on Geology, Ground Contamination and 
Agriculture from the construction of the proposed Project would be the 
sterilisation of Agricultural Land, the only cumulative impact would be 
an increased loss of agricultural land in the area following the 
construction of the consented turbines, which would also result in 
temporary sterilisation.

Impact 
It is possible that the proposed Project could have some level of 
cumulative impact in respect to Landscape and Visual impact, 
particularly in association with the new and consented wind turbines. 
Although all but the Eye Wind Power turbines are existing 
developments, it is important to consider these existing features in the 
cumulative assessment to reduce the potential for âLandscape 
Saturationâ. Further details of this potential impact will be understood 
once the LIV assessment has been undertaken.

Impact 
Along with the construction of the proposed Project, none of the 
identified developments are considered likely to result in any negative 
impacts on human health. Although the proposed Project will produce 
waste, the waste from the other developments is included in the 
baseline assessment. The only potential cumulative impact on from 
waste would be associated with the construction of the Eye Wind 
Power turbines, with would likely be minimal.

Impact 
Cumulative impacts could arise if the consented turbines were 
constructed at the same time as the proposed Project, however, as 
that development has already been consented, the likelihood of the 
two developments being constructed in parallel is minimal and steps 
would be taken to ensure that that does not happen.

Impact 
None of the identified developments are considered likely to impact 
upon buried archaeology; however, it is possible that there could be a 
cumulative impact on the setting of cultural heritage impacts if the 
construction activities are visible, in addition to one of the other large 
structures associated with these developments. This effect is similar to 
Landscape Saturationâ as described above.

None of the identified developments are considered to contribute to 
cumulative impacts in respect to Air Quality during operation. The 
primary reason for this is that all developments excluding the Eye 
Wind Power turbines are included in the baseline assessment, and 
once constructed, these turbines will not produce any emissions.

The only development that could potentially result in a cumulative

constructed, they will be relatively self sufficient and any scheduled 
maintenance visits would have a negligible impact on local traffic 
flows.
