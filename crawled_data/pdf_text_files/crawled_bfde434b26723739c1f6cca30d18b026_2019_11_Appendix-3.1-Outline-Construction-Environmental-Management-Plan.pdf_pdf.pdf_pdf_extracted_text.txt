Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This Outline Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) has been 
prepared as part of the PEIR for the Project’. This Outline CEMP has been 
prepared by AECOM on behalf of the applicant, Abergelli Power Limited (APL).  
1.1.2 
The Project comprises of an Open Gas Cycle Turbine (OGCT) peaking power 
generating station and associated infrastructure. The Project is described in detail 
in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description and its location provided in Figure 1.1 
and Figure 1.2 of the PEIR. 
1.2 
Purpose of this Document 
1.2.1 
The aim of this Outline CEMP is to provide a framework from which a final CEMP 
will be produced at DCO submission for the Project.  The CEMP will provide 
assurance to the decision maker and stakeholders that appropriate measures for 
preventing and reducing environmental effects will be adopted during the 
construction of the Project and secured via this document. This purpose of a CEMP 
is to set out the approach towards, and framework for, environmental management 
during the construction phase (including site preparation) and to provide mitigation 
against potentially adverse construction impacts on environmental resources, local 
residents and businesses. Both standard environmental good practice and project 
specific mitigation, as committed to within the PEIR are included within this Outline 
CEMP.   
1.2.2 
This Outline CEMP covers all elements of the Project as described in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description of the PEIR, although some measures will only be 
relevant to particular project elements or specific works, and this will be made clear 
in the text of the document.  The principles of this Outline CEMP outline the 
standards, environmental management and good practice which will also be 
consistently applied to the construction of the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
1.2.3 
This Outline CEMP will be developed following consultation to produce the CEMP 
which will be submitted with the DCO Application for the Project.  Post-consent, the 
CEMP will require updating in accordance with a DCO Requirement and will be 
approved by CCS prior to any construction commencing onsite. The CEMP 
submitted to City and will be substantially in accordance with this outline CEMP. 
Any details as may be required by DCO Requirements will be included during 
detailed design. The approved CEMP will be used as an environmental 
management and monitoring tool for the duration of the construction phase. The 
CEMP will be kept onsite as a live document, being updated as and when required 
(for example to recognise changes in regulations, good practice guidance, actions 
from onsite audits or a change in situation onsite).

1.2.4 
The approved CEMP will fall within the scope of the main contractor’s externally 
certified environmental management systems, and as such will be subject to 
independent audits by the relevant certification bodies. 
1.2.5 
Measures set out in this document and the approved CEMP will have regard to the 
Welsh Government document ‘Construction and Demolition Sector Plan’ (Ref 1.1) 
which seeks to move towards zero waste by detailing outcomes, policies and 
delivery actions for organisations, companies and individuals involved with the 
construction and demolition sector in Wales.

CEMP.  
2.2 
Communications and Training  
a) Community Liaison 
2.2.2 
The following steps will be taken by APL/the main contactor to make the public 
aware of the activities onsite and the available lines of communication with the 
Project: 
 
Neighbouring residents and occupiers will be notified of the start of construction 
activities and the likely duration of the construction phase; 
 
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published local to the 
Project Site. There will be a dedicated person responsible for dealing with any 
complaints, which could be the Environmental Manager.  This person will have 
the appropriate authority to resolve complaints. An ‘out of hours’ telephone 
number will be made available if required. A Welsh speaker can be available at 
request; 
 
Liaison will be maintained with CCS’s Environmental Health Officer (EHO) for 
the duration of the construction phase;  
 
Should any complaints regarding dust or noise be received the details will be 
passed to the EHO for verification purposes; and 
 
Should any unforeseen event occur on the Project Site that has the potential to 
cause pollution then the relevant regulatory bodies will be notified immediately. 
As far as possible, notice will be issued to the EHO for dealing with an 
unforeseen activity that may give rise to a particular nuisance problem. 
 
b) Environmental Site Meetings  
2.2.3 
To ensure dissemination of environmental information, environmental meetings will 
be held throughout the duration of the Project construction. The frequency of 
meetings will be determined by the main contractor, but will not be less than once 
per month. These meetings will be held for all site personnel and will be attended 
by the ECoW or similar environmental expert (if required).  
2.2.4 
Any environmental issues or lessons learnt will be reported at these meetings along 
with any updates or changes to environmental management plans. A “Look  Ahead” 
at relevant environmental management or special requirements linked to specific 
upcoming tasks or seasonality will also be provided.

c) Site Signage and Notice Boards 
2.2.5 
Working areas will be clearly marked with appropriate signage and warnings to 
ensure that they are avoided by members of the public. 
2.2.6 
Site notice boards for disseminating information to Site personnel will be positioned 
either within individual work stations or in a centralised location. Site notice boards 
will display method statements, emergency contacts, and relevant statutory and 
non-statutory advice and guidance. 
d) Site Inductions  
2.2.7 
The main contractor will ensure all employees, sub-contractors, suppliers, and 
other visitors to the Project Site receive induction training.  The Site Induction will 
include a summary of environmental risks associated with the Project and the 
onsite environmental methods and standards. Any environmental methods and 
standards specifically relevant to the inductee’s role or task will be highlighted.   
2.2.8 
Topics that will be covered in the Site Induction include, but are not limited to; 
 
Pertinent areas of environmental sensitivity, such as ecological, archaeological, 
hydrological or geological sensitive areas; 
 
Pollution prevention and protection of the water environment (including 
concrete washout); 


 
Environmental incident and near miss reporting.   
 
e) Training in Environmental Requirements  
2.2.9 
The main contractor will ensure all personnel are suitably trained in general site 
good practice and environmental emergency response procedures, including the 
use of spill kits, silt mitigation and concrete washing out.  Good practice and 
emergency response training will be provided by a suitably qualified person on a 
regular basis.  The main contractor will keep a record of this training.  
2.2.10 Toolbox talks will be provided as part of briefings on specific tasks, based on 
method statements and environmental standards.  The will provide on-going 
reinforcement and awareness of environmental sensitivities and issues on the 
Project Site.  Toolbox talks will be task specific and will identify the sensitive 
receptors and provide advice on any specific procedures that need to be followed 
and the mitigation measures that should be implemented. For specialist topics, 
toolbox talks may be presented by an ECoW (or equivalent suitably trained 
specialist).  
2.2.11 A programme of relevant toolbox talks will be drawn up by the Environmental 
Manager or main contractor based on upcoming construction activities. Additional 
toolbox talks may be required outside of this based on circumstances such as 
unforeseen risks, repeated observation of bad practices, perceived lack of 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limtied 
 
AECOM 
9 
 
 
awareness, or a pollution event. A record of all toolbox talks reporting highlights of 
the meeting and attendees will be maintained.  
2.3 
Register of Mitigation  
2.3.1 
A register of embedded and additional mitigation measures committed to within the 
PEIR has been attached in Appendix A: Mitigation Register to this Outline CEMP. 
The Register will need to be updated for the DCO Application in response to any 
consultee comments and updated EIA technical assessments. The finalised 
Register will be used to inform the onsite environmental management and provide 
a tool for aiding the preparation of method statements or environmental standards. 
The register covers several environmental topic areas and will be regularly updated 
to reflect any additional risks resulting from the main contractor/s selected methods 
of working, changing site conditions etc. Mitigation measures have been identified 
under the following general headings: 
 
Air Quality;  
 
Noise and Vibration; 
 
Ecology; 
 
Water Quality and Resources; 
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology; 
 
Landscape and Visual; 
 
Traffic, Transport and Access; 
 
Historic Environment; and  
 
Socio-economics.  
2.4 
Method Statements and Site Environmental Standards 
2.4.1 
The main contractor will prepare Method Statements for specific construction 
activities and Site Environmental Standards for day-to-day Project Site operations 
such as housekeeping, material storage and waste management. These will be 
based on standard good practice measures (as set out within relevant management 
plans in Section 3 of this Outline CEMP), statutory requirements, environmental 
sensitivities and any Requirements of the DCO.  
2.4.2 
Site Environmental Standards will be printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice 
boards and used as a briefing tool onsite. They will also form the basis of toolbox 
talks on the relevant Project Site operations.  
2.4.3 
The method statement will be communicated to all or task specific personnel ahead 
of the commencement of the relevant activities using an agreed instruction format 
(e.g. toolbox talks).

and when particularly hazardous activities are being carried out. Additional Method 
Statements or Site Environmental Standards will be produced where significant risk 
to the environment is identified.  
2.5.4 
An Audit Close-out Schedule will be maintained by the main contractor. Any 
observations, corrective action requests or non-compliance notices identified 
through inspections will be logged in an Audit Close-out Schedule. Progress 
against corrective and preventative actions logged in the Schedule will be reported 
to APL on a regular basis.  
i. 
Daily Inspections  
2.5.5 
The nominated site personnel or the Environmental Manager will conduct daily 
checks against environmental requirements. This could be done against a pro 
forma or similar, based on the measures outlined within method statements and 
Environmental Standards relevant to activities being conducted on that day.  
2.5.6 
Daily inspections will include visual inspections of dust emissions as described in 
Section 4.3.  
i. 
Weekly Inspections 
2.5.7 
Weekly Project Site inspections will be carried out by the Environmental Manager, 
which will assess the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation on the Project 
Site.

and the associated timescales.  
i. 
Monthly Complaints Reporting 
2.5.9 
The main contractor will report to APL regarding any nuisance complaints from the 
general public and actions on how these have been addressed. The process for 
receiving and actioning complaints is set out in the Community Liaison (starting 
paragraph 2.2.2).  
i. 
Environmental Monitoring  
2.5.10 Any requirements for specific monitoring programmes as determined through the 
DCO or pre-construction surveys (i.e. ground investigations) will be conducted at 
appropriate intervals by a suitably qualified individual.   
b) Incidents and Near Misses  
2.5.11 An indicative environmental Emergency Response Plan is detailed in Section 4.6 of 
this CEMP.  This will be finalised by the main contractor. The plan in the approved 
CEMP will follow the stop – contain – notify protocol and will detail responsible 
personnel and contacts for reporting. All personnel will be briefed on the notification 
protocol for alerting the main contractor and Environmental Manager of an 
environmental emergency as part of their Site Induction. Environmental emergency 
response training and toolbox talks will also be conducted at regular intervals by a 
suitably qualified person.  
2.5.12 The main contractor will maintain a register of all environmental incidents, 
dangerous occurrences and/or near misses, each supported by an Environmental 
Incident Report Form. This will document the nature, date and time of the incident, 
corrective action(s) taken, and details of any contact with regulatory agencies. All 
incidents will be reported to the appropriate regulatory body and APL on the day 
that they occur or within 24 hours.  
2.5.13 All environmental incidents, dangerous occurrences and near misses will be 
reviewed by the Environmental Manager and where necessary changes to working 
practices/procedures will be implemented. Lessons learnt, along with any updates 
to method statements, sections of the approved CEMP and toolbox talk will be 
communicated to all personnel at Environmental Site Meetings.

3. 
General Environmental Management Measures During 
Construction Phase  
3.1 
Safety 
3.1.1 
The main contractor will have the day to day responsibility for maintaining Health 
and Safety throughout the construction phase. A risk assessment and method 
statement (RAMS) will be produced and detail how risk will be minimised through 
an approved procedure, which will:  
 
Identify the significant Health and Safety impacts that can be anticipated;  
 
Assess the risks from these impacts;  
 
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; and 
 
Report where an inappropriate level of residual risk is identified so that action 
can be taken.  
3.1.2 
There will be no access to construction areas by the general public. The Project 
Site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access including where permissive 
routes cross the construction areas. 
3.1.3 
Traffic safety should be promoted by all project personnel to prevention and control 
traffic related injuries. Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite. This will also 
minimise disturbance of bare surfaces.  
3.1.4 
The following good practice measures will be implemented by the main contractor 
to ensure the safety of site personnel:  
 
The provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including 
footwear, masks, protective clothing and goggles where required; 
 
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ area of the 
Project Site; 
 
Welfare facilities will be made available; 
 
All site workers will be required to wash their hands and remove overalls/boots 
when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the Project Site; 
 
Any soils excavated that are considered by the main contractor to be potentially 
contaminated will be reported, left in situ and fenced off until their appropriate 
treatment (in line with Section 4.6: Emergency Response Plan); and 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage and 
construction materials in order to prevent the contamination of ground water. 
3.1.5 
The main contractor will ensure that qualified first-aid can be provided at all times. 
Appropriately equipped first-aid stations will be easily accessible throughout the 
Project Site. 
3.2 
Construction Site Housekeeping 
3.2.1 
Good construction site housekeeping practice will be applied at all times. As far as 
reasonably practicable the construction working areas for the Project Site will be 
designed using the following principles: 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
All work areas will be secured; 
 
Any fuels or liquid materials will be stored and bunded in compliance with the 
relevant regulation;  
 
Signage and boundary fences will be regularly inspected, repaired and 
replaced as necessary; 
 
All working areas will be kept in a clean and tidy condition; 
 
Wheel washing and dust suppression facilities will be provided when and where 
required; 
 
Waste will be removed at frequent intervals; and 
 
Construction waste susceptible to spreading by wind or liable to cause litter will 
be stored in secure containers. 
3.3 
Storage of Fuels and Chemicals 
3.3.1 
The main contractor will ensure that fuels and chemicals are stored appropriately 
and the measures are in place to prevent pollution of ground and water. Fuel will be 
stored: 
 
In areas where potential for contamination of water bodies is low i.e. outside 50 
m of a spring, well or borehole and 10 m of an open watercourse; 
 
In areas that are low risk of flooding; 
 
In tanks that meet the manufacturing standards appropriate for the type of oil 
stored and comply with BS EN ISO 9001; 
 
With contents clearly marked on the storage containers;   
 
With secure and appropriately sized bunds being suitable to contain 110% of 
the contents (single tank).  If there is more than one storage container, the 
bund will be capable of containing 110% of the largest tank, or 25% of the total 
aggregate capacity, whichever is the greatest;  
 
Tanks/ storage containers will be protected against vehicle collision; and  
 
All deliveries will be overseen by site personnel with emergency response 
training. 
3.3.2 
A Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) store will be set up in the 
site compound. COSHH assessments and Material Safety Data Sheets will be held 
with the COSHH materials. A COSHH register will be created and maintained 
onsite. 
3.3.3 
All site personnel and sub-contractors will be made aware of the COSHH 
requirements through site inductions and specific toolbox talks. Daily site 
inspections will be used to review and monitor the storage and issue of COSHH 
materials. 
3.4 
Welfare Facilities 
3.4.1 
Welfare cabins, toilets and drying facilities, in line with The Construction (Design 
and Management) Regulations 2015 (Ref 3.1) will be provided within the Project 
Site for the use of site personnel. Grey and foul water from welfare facilities will not 
be discharged directly into ditches or watercourse, but will be collected through a 
foul water drainage system that will either drain to a septic tank or a package 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
treatment plant within the Project Site. It is likely that the latter would be the 
preferred option for ease of maintenance and environmental criteria. The 
processed water would then discharge onsite or to a nearby watercourse. 
3.4.2 
Where portable generators are used, industry good practice will be followed to 
minimise noise and pollution from such generators. 
3.4.3 
The risk of infestation by pests or vermin will be minimised by the appropriate 
collection, storage and regular collection of waste, the prompt treatment of any pest 
infestation and effective preventative pest control measures. 
3.5 
Public Right of Ways 
3.5.1 
There are three Public Right of Ways (PRoW) that cross the Project Site. Specific 
mitigation measures for the management of these PRoWs is contained within the 
Construction Traffic Management Plan, which will be finalised post-consent, in 
consultation with the PROW officer at CCS.  
3.5.2 
It is not proposed to permanently divert any PRoWs although measures will be 
implemented during the construction phase to maintain safety to users from 
construction traffic and also from any excavations which may be present. Any 
temporary closures, required for public safety, will be advertised in advance and 
diversions or directions to alternate routes will be provided where practicable.  
3.5.3 
Appropriate signage will be placed prior to the construction area to ensure users 
are aware of the works prior to arriving. Should works be undertaken in the 
immediate location of the crossing, banksman will be employed to avoid any 
potential adverse effects from construction traffic. In addition, suitable fencing will 
be implemented to ensure users of the permissive routes are segregated from 
construction traffic appropriately and safely if required.  
3.6 
Timing of Works 
3.6.1 
Construction will be programmed in such a way as to ensure that construction 
activities are undertaken in a timely manner while minimising environmental risk as 
far as possible, e.g. seasonal sensitivities or inclement weather will be considered. 
Construction activities may be undertaken simultaneously at more than one area of 
the Project Site.  The work programme will be agreed with CCS prior to 
construction commencing onsite. In the event that the programme changes 
significantly, the changes will be communicated to CCS.  
3.6.2 
Construction activities will be scheduled so that works that have the potential to 
impact upon ecological receptors are conducted outside key periods of seasonal 
activity, for instance, vegetation clearance would be conducted outside of the 
breeding bird season.  
3.6.3 
Construction activities will also be scheduled, where possible to reduce the risk of 
pollution. Measures include: 
 
Minimising the periods for which soils are exposed and stockpiled thereby 
reducing the risk of generating silt laden runoff;  
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Avoiding, where possible, undertaking specific activities such as earthworks 
during prolonged and heavy rainfall thereby reducing the risk of sediment or 
pollutants becoming entrained in excess runoff; and 
 
Avoiding, where possible, undertaking activities in closer proximity to 
watercourses when water levels are higher and adjacent land is at risk of 
flooding.   
3.7 
Working Hours 
3.7.1 
Construction activities will not take place outside the hours of 08:00- 18:00 Monday 
to Friday and 08.00-13.00 on Saturday and public holidays, unless otherwise 
agreed with CCS. These limits will not apply during commissioning and testing of 
the Project. 
3.8 
Lighting 
3.8.1 
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to provide a safe 
working environment during hours of darkness. Artificial lighting can be a nuisance 
to any nearby residence and can disrupt nocturnal species.  
3.8.2 
An outline lighting strategy will be prepared for the DCO application with the 
specific details of the proposed lighting selection and configuration for the Project 
Site.  
3.8.3 
All artificial lighting used at the Project Site will be in accordance with the Institute 
of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Guidelines (Ref 3.2) and the Bat Conservation 
Trust’s (BCT) interim guidance on artificial lighting and wildlife (Ref 3.3). 
3.8.4 
In order to minimise light disturbance to ecological receptors: 
 
There will be no light intrusion beyond the boundary of the proposed Project 
Site, particularly within the Lletty Morfil SINC to the north and east of the 
Generating Equipment Site, which is a habitat that supports bats; and  
 
There will be no night-time working within the Lletty Morfil SINC for the 
construction of the Electrical Connection and Access Road.  
3.8.5 
The general design objectives that will be used to ensure that adverse effects of 
lighting (through adding light to a darker rural landscape) associated with 
construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
 
Luminaires will be appropriately designed for the required task; 
 
Louvres and shields will be used to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
 
Construction lighting will be directed away from all sensitive receptors; 
 
For the illumination of large areas, in order to limit light trespass, glare and 
sky glow from the plant, preference will be given to several, lower lighting 
units rather than tall, wide beam lighting units; 
 
Vehicle lights will be properly directed (conforming to MOT requirements) and 
lenses will be intact to prevent un-necessary glare and light intrusion; 
 
Lighting will be reduced or switched off when not required for safety purposes; 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Security lighting will be kept at the minimum level needed for visual and 
security protection;  
 
Dark corridors will be maintained along hedgerows and watercourses and any 
other linear features by avoiding light encroaching on these areas. This will 
avoid the fragmentation of habitat used by species such as bats and also 
otters that use these features to move at night-time; and  
 
If appropriate, the use of infra-red floodlighting and CCTV systems will be 
considered for security to reduce the need for visible lighting outside working 
hours.

Environmental Management Plans 
4.1.1 
The following sections outline the likely contents of the topic specific Management 
Plans which will be developed either for the DCO Application in outline form or to 
be submitted to discharge a DCO Requirement post-consent. The contents are not 
exhaustive and will be finalised for the DCO Application.   
4.2 
Noise and Vibration Management Plan 
4.2.1 
This section considers nuisance noise including vibration from construction 
activities and good practice measures to comply with any maximum boundary noise 
limits imposed on the Project and to minimise potential effects on any nearby 
sensitive noise receptors.  
4.2.2 
All 
construction 
activities 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
recommendations of BS 5228 ‘Code of Practice for Noise and Vibration Control on 
Construction and Open Sites’ (Ref 4.1). This code details the legislative 
background to noise control, along with the recommended procedures for effective 
liaison between developers, site operators and local authorities. Methods of how to 
minimise the impact of site noise on site workers and local residents are also 
provided.  
4.2.3 
Other relevant legislation and guidance:  
 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as it applies to Wales) (Ref 4.2); 
 
BS 7385:1993 ‘Evaluation and Measurement for Vibration in Buildings’ (Ref 
4.3). 
a) Contents of Plan 
4.2.4 
A detailed noise assessment will be carried out once the main contractor is 
appointed in order to identify specific mitigation measures for the Project. Noise 
levels will not exceed any boundary noise limits set out in the DCO Application.  
4.2.5 
To minimise the risk of noise complaints, the main contractor will advise potentially 
affected residents and occupiers of any construction activities to be undertaken 
outside of working hours. Those potentially affected will also be provided with the 
environmental complaints telephone number and the point of contact for any 
queries. Further details of how complaints will be dealt with are set out in the 
section on Community Liaison (Section 2.2).  
4.2.6 
The main contractor and all sub-contractors working on site have a general duty to 
take all reasonably practicable measures to minimise nuisance from noise and 
vibration that has the potential to impact on the local community or environment.  
4.2.7 
To achieve this and avoid the potential for construction activities to give rise to 
consequences that would otherwise be statutory nuisances (but for the provision of 
the DCO), Best Practicable Means (BPM) as defined in Section 79(9)(a) of the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Ref 4.2) must be employed and the following 
requirements will be complied with: 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Careful consideration will be given to the appropriate selection of plant, 
construction methods and programming; 
o 
Inherently quiet plant items will be selected wherever practicable;  
o 
Equipment that breaks concrete by munching or similar, rather than by 
percussion, will be used as far as is practicable; 
o 
Where possible, lower noise piling (such as rotary bored or hydraulic 
jacking) will be used rather the driven piling techniques (if required);  
o 
Where practicable, rotary drills actuated by hydraulic or electrical power 
will be used for excavating hard materials;  
o 
Off-site pre-fabrication will be utilised where practicable; and 
o 
Noisy construction activities will be programmed to be conducted at less 
disruptive times. 
 
Noise emission standards will be complied with; 
o 
Modern plant that complies with the latest European Commission (EC) 
and UK noise emission requirements will be used onsite;   
 
Equipment and plant will be fitted with sound reducing measures where 
possible; 
o 
All major compressors will be ‘sound-reduced’ models fitted with properly 
lined and sealed acoustic covers which will be kept closed whenever the 
machines are in use; and  
o 
All ancillary pneumatic percussive tools will be fitted with mufflers or 
silencers of the type recommended by the manufacturers; 
 
Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately to minimise 
noise; 
o 
The manufacturer’s written recommendations will be regarded or other 
appropriate operation and maintenance programmes which reduce noise 
and vibration emissions will be used; 
o 
Machines in intermittent use will be shut down during periods of inactivity 
or throttled down to a minimum; 
o 
Loading and unloading of vehicles, dismantling of equipment such as 
scaffolding or moving equipment or materials around the Project Site, will 
be conducted in such a manner as to minimise noise generation; and 
o 
Construction traffic will be appropriately routed on public roads and along 
access tracks to minimise noise disturbance;  
 
Noise and vibration emission will be considered when designing Project Site 
layout: 
o 
The Project Site will be arranged so that construction activities and 
vehicle routes minimise the need for reversing movements;  
o 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps will be 
positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance (e.g. as far away as 
practicable from residential receptors); 
o 
If necessary, temporary acoustic barriers or enclosures will be provided;  
 
All site personnel will be made familiar with current legislation and the 
Guidance within BS 5228 (Ref 4.1); and 
 
No employees, sub-contractors and persons employed on the Project Site are 
to cause unnecessary noise from their activities (e.g., excessive ‘revving’ of 
vehicle engines, music from radios, shouting and general anti-social 
behaviour).

4.3 
Air Quality Monitoring and Management Plan 
4.3.1 
This plan contains a proposed air quality monitoring plan and standard good 
practice measures for reducing dust and emissions from vehicles. 
4.3.2 
Guidance relevant to the implementation of air quality measures include;  
 
BS 6031: 2009: Code of Practice for Earth Works (Ref 4.7); 
 
HSE Vehicle at Work Guidance (Ref 4.9); and  
 
Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) Guidance on Air Quality Monitoring 
in the Vicinity of Demolition and Construction Sites (Ref 4.4).  
 
a) Contents of Plan  
4.3.3 
In line with IAQM guidance (Ref 4.4) on monitoring air quality at construction sites; 
daily visual inspections of dust emissions will be made in conjunction with dust 
emissions monitoring at locations to be agreed with NRW. This data will be used to 
ensure that mitigation measures are appropriate and being applied rigorously and 
to provide early warning of increased dust emissions to inform the cessation or 
modification of activities prior to impacts occurring. 
4.3.4 
Monitoring will be undertaken in the vicinity of the Lletty Morfil SINC. Since the risk 
for ecosystems relates to dust deposition, a real time monitor for total suspended 
particulate matter will be installed. Trigger levels for the instrument, which would 
suggest increasing risk/emissions, will be agreed with NRW prior to the 
commencement of construction. The monitoring stations will be mobile and will be 
moved around the Project Site as the principal activities move. 
4.3.5 
The following are general good practice measures that will be implemented onsite 
to control dust and vehicle emissions. If inspections and monitoring find that plumes 
of dust are visible, behind moving vehicles for example, or dust was visibly 
deposited on roads outside of the Project Site, more vigorous control measures 
may be required. 
i. 
Site Management 
 
All personnel will be made aware of nuisance dust and will be trained in dust 
management; and 
 
Project Site plant will be maintained so as to reduce emissions. 
ii. Earthworks 
 
Disturbance of the ground will be kept to a minimum wherever possible; 
 
 
Necessary vegetation/ topsoil removal will be carried out in discrete sections 
with progressive restoration of exposed areas to minimise wind erosion; 
 
Earthworks and excavation areas will be kept damp, and will be avoided during 
periods of exceptionally dry weather; and 
 
Earthworks will be undertaken following BS 6031:2009 (Ref 4.7). 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

AECOM 
35 
 
iii. Material Handling 
 
The number of handling operations will be kept to a minimum to ensure that 
dusty material isn’t moved or handled unnecessarily; 
 
Soil handling will be restricted during adverse weather conditions such as high 
winds or exceptionally dry spells; 
 
 
Drop heights will be kept to a minimum and will be enclosed where possible; 
 
Transportation of aggregates and fine materials will be conducted in enclosed 
or sheeted vehicles; 
 
Dampening methods will be used where necessary; and 
 
Methods and equipment will be in place for immediate clean-up of spillages of 
dusty or potentially dusty materials. 
iv. Stockpiles 
 
Stockpiles will be located away from sensitive receptors where dust nuisance is 
likely to result; 
 
During exceptionally dry and windy periods stockpiles will be kept damp; 
 
Soils will, where appropriate be landscaped into suitable shapes for secondary 
functions e.g. visual screening; and 
 
Appropriate shrouding/ wind shielding measures dependent on particulate size 
will be put in place to prevent dust generation from stockpiled materials.  Long-
term stockpiles may be capped or grassed over. 
v. Traffic Measures 
 
Unsurfaced roads will be graded regularly to remove loose gravel and kept in a 
clean and compacted condition; 
 
A mechanical road sweeper will be made available if required for the cleaning 
of public roads (in agreement with CCS and South Wales Trunk Road Agent 
(SWTRA)); 
 
 
Wheel/ vehicle wash facilities will be provided at Project Site entrance/exit; and 
 
Any vehicles carrying loose materials will be enclosed or appropriately sheeted. 
vi. Emissions Management   
 
Plant and equipment will be operated as far as possible away from residential 
areas or sensitive receptors near to the Project Site; 
 
An onsite speed limit will be implemented by the main contractor that will be 
appropriate to the types of construction plant utilised and the Project Site 
hazards in line with Vehicles at Work guidance from the Health and Safety 
Executive (HSE) (Ref 4.9);  
 
Onsite vehicle movement will be kept to a minimum and restricted to 
adequately compacted internal roads; 
 
 
All plant utilised on Project Site should be regularly inspected.  Monitoring of 
plant will include: 
o 
Ensuring no black smoke is emitted other than during ignition;   
o 
Ensuring exhaust emissions are maintained to comply with the 
appropriate limits; 
 
Vehicle exhausts will be directed away from the ground and other surfaces and 
preferably upwards to avoid road dust being re-suspended to the air; and  
 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

AECOM 
35 
 
 
Exhausts will be positioned at a sufficient height to ensure adequate dispersal 
of emissions. 
4.4 
Water Management Plan 
4.4.1 
This Water Management Plan sets out good practice for safeguarding water 
resources and quality on the Project Site.  
4.4.2 
Guidance relevant to this plan includes:  
 
The BS ‘Code of Practice for Earthworks’ BS 6031:2009 (Ref 4.7) and  
 
The BS 'Code of Practice for Foundations' BS 8004:2015 (Ref 4.8)

a) Contents of the Plan 
4.4.3 
Details on the design of the proposed drainage system for the Project Site during 
the construction phase are available in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description 
of the PEIR and the Flood Consequence Assessment in Appendix 9.1 of the PEIR. 
Surface water, foul water and water potentially contaminated with oil (oily water) will 
have separated drainage systems on the Project Site. Foul water and oily water will 
not be directly discharged into drains or watercourse, but collected and treated.  
4.4.4 
The general measures below will be considered in the implementation of the 
Project Site drainage system.   
i. 
Drainage Management 
4.4.5 
The following measures will be implemented to safeguard water quality from 
pollutant sources not related to silt or sediment:  
 
All Project Site drainage measures will be developed in consultation with NRW 
prior to the commencement of construction;   
 
Sequencing of work will be such that proposed drainage measures, including 
flow controls and attenuation storage will be in place prior to erection of 
buildings and hardstanding;  
 
The construction oily water drainage will be designed in accordance with NGTS 
2.20 ‘Oil Containment at Electricity Substations and Other Operational Sites’ or 
similar approved guidelines; 
 
The construction surface water drainage system will adopt the principles of the 
SuDs Manual (Ref 4.6) to adequately drain the site and prevent ponding; and 
 
Any artificial drainage additional to the proposed swales and ponds will only be 
installed where necessary. The individual lengths, depths and gradients of 
these drains will be minimised to avoid intercepting large volumes of diffuse 
overland flow and generating high velocity flows during storm events.

35 
 
4.4.6 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will incorporate 
measures to prevent an increase in flooding during construction works. It is 
expected that the CEMP will include provisions such as: 
 
New temporary and/or permanent drainage ditches to prevent uncontrolled 
surface runoff of contaminated water;  
 
Silt traps within drainage ditches to reduce the flow of suspended solids from 
the Project Site;  
 
Settlement lagoons and/or proprietary settlement tanks as required to reduce 
the flow of suspended solids from site ;  
 
Suitable layout of the construction site and application of suitable management 
techniques to prevent runoff from stockpiles directly ion to the watercourse; 
and  
 
Monitoring of overland flow routes along the eastern extent of the Generating 
Equipment Site to ensure minimal impedance of flow routes.    
 
ii. Proximity to Water 
4.4.7 
The following good practice measures will be implemented to minimise the potential 
of direct pollution to water: 
 
A 10 m buffer will be applied to all Project Site watercourses. Where possible, 
this buffer will not be entered by plant and machinery;   
 
Stockpiles of excavated soils/peat will be located away from surface 
watercourses and away from known surface drainage pathways as much as 
possible; 
 
Laydown areas and plant and machinery will be stored at least 10 m from 
watercourses and where possible, in low flood risk areas; and  
 
Oil storage will comply with the measures set out in the Pollution Prevention 
Plan (Section 4.5Error! Reference source not found.) including, where 
possible being located at least 50 m from an open watercourse.   
 
iii. Silt and Sediment 
4.4.8 
The following measures will be implemented in order to reduce the potential 
generation of silt laden runoff:  
 
The Project Site will be laid out to prevent runoff from stockpiles entering 
watercourses;  
 
Bare ground exposure will be minimised by only removing vegetation from 
areas that require to be exposed in the near future and completing 
reinstatement as soon as practicably possible; 
 
Pumped water from excavations and de-watering activities will be drained to a 
suitably sized settlement pond to remove silt before discharge;   
 
Project Site roads will be regularly maintained and kept free from sediment 
deposits in order to reduce the volume of silt becoming entrained in surface 
runoff and entering any watercourse or drain;

 
Mitigation will be implemented as required (silt fencing, placement of straw 
bales into ditches, sediment traps) to intercept and collect silt, reduce runoff 
velocity and encourage deposition of suspended sediment; and   
 
Care will be taken during felling operations to reduce the risk of sedimentation 
and erosion into the watercourses. 
 
4.5 
Pollution Prevention Management Plan 
4.5.1 
This plan covers measures to minimise the risk of pollution to ground and water 
from the storage and use of potentially polluting materials onsite. The sections 
below detail the storage of fuels and oil, management of non-oil chemicals, 
potential pollution from construction vehicles, plant and machinery and the use of 
cement and concrete.  
4.5.2 
An Emergency Spill Response Plan is set out within Section 4.6.  
4.5.3 
All fuel storage will comply with the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Oil 
Storage) (Wales) Regulations 2016 (Ref 4.10).   
a) Contents of Plan 
i. 
Movement, Parking and Re-fuelling of Vehicles and Plant 
4.5.4 
Vehicles and plant will comply with the following:  
 
In order to prevent compaction and erosion of undeveloped ground, movement 
of construction plant and vehicles will be limited to clearly defined access tracks 
and construction areas only.   
 
All construction plant and vehicles will be parked/stored at least 50 m away 
from surface waterbodies and springs.   
 
All construction plant and vehicles will be checked daily for oil and fuel leaks 
and record of such checks kept by the Environmental Manager (or ECoW).    
 
Mobile plant will be in good working order, kept clean and fitted with drip trays 
where appropriate. 
 
Refuelling of construction plant and vehicles will be undertaken on an 
impermeable surface at a temporary construction compound only.   
 
All refuelling activities will be supervised by site personnel with emergency 
response training.  
ii. Cement and Concrete 
4.5.5 
Concrete and cement are alkaline and corrosive, and can have a highly polluting 
impact in water and on land and are harmful to human flesh. 
4.5.6 
Due to the size of the Project Site it is likely that concrete batching will occur on 
site. The equipment used for concrete batching should be operated in accordance 
with Process Guidance Note 3/01(12) (Ref 4.11). 
4.5.7 
Mixing and washing of concrete will not take place within 10 m of any watercourse 
or swale and waste waters will not be discharged into the water environment. All 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

site personnel will receive training on concrete washout as part of their Site 
Induction.  
4.6 
Emergency Response Plan 
4.6.1 
This plan provides response measures for potential environmental emergencies 
that could arise during the construction of the Project. These include; discovery of 
unknown contaminated ‘hotspots’; spills of contaminants such as chemicals, fuels 
or waste materials; and entry of contaminants into watercourses during flood 
events. 
4.6.2 
This Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed by the main contractor and 
finalised in the approved CEMP. The main contractor will also supply emergency 
contact details for nominated site personnel, relevant regulatory bodies and 
emergency services. These details will be available on site notice boards 
(paragraph 2.2.6) and will be displayed along with a plan of the Project Site that 
displays safe storage areas and the location of response equipment, such as spill 
kits.  
4.6.3 
The emergency plan and contact details will be shown to all site personnel as part 
of the Site Induction. Nominated site personnel will be provided with emergency 
response training. There will be regular toolbox talks on emergency response 
procedures and all site personnel will be informed of the notification procedure in 
the event of discovering contamination or a spill as part of the Site Induction.   
4.6.4 
All incidents where the Emergency Response Plan is implemented will be reported 
inline with the Incident Response Procedure detailed in Section 2.5: Monitoring 
and Auditing (starting paragraph 2.5.11).  
a) Contaminated Hotspots Plan 
4.6.5 
Ground investigations will be conducted to identify any potentially existing 
contaminated land within the Project Site. In the case where a contaminant is 
identified, a contaminant specific management plan will be produced. 
4.6.6 
As such, the procedure below is proposed to be followed in the eventuality that an 
unidentified contaminant “hotspot” showing visual or olfactory evidence of 
contamination is discovered during construction: 
 
Relevant construction activities will be stopped immediately; 
 
The discovery will be reported to the Environmental Manager or appropriate 
personnel as identified by the main contractor; 
 
The area will be sealed off in order to contain the spread of contaminants; 
 
The area will be cleared to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion; 
 
The relevant regulator and/or CCS will be contacted once it is confirmed that 
contamination has been found; 
 
Testing will be arranged; and 
 
Details of the incident will be recorded, including photos and relevant 
information on the Environmental Incident Report Form.

b) Emergency Spill Response Plan 
4.6.7 
Appropriate spill response materials for the chemicals, fuels and oils stored onsite 
will be provided throughout the Project Site. Spill kits will be made available at fuel 
storage and refuelling locations and in individual plant and vehicles. Use of plant 
and hazardous materials will be done in the presence of at least one operative 
trained in emergency response.  
4.6.8 
The main contractor will produce an emergency response plan that will follow the 
STOP – CONTAIN – NOTIFY – CLEAN UP – REPORT procedure. An indicative 
procedure is set out below:  
 
STOP 
o 
Construction activities will be stopped immediately; 
o 
Spilt substance will be identified and any information available (i.e. 
COSHH material sheet) obtained along with the correct PPE;  
o 
If safe to do so, the spill will be stopped to prevent more material spilling, 
e.g. oil drums will be righted or valves closed; and 
o 
Sources of ignition will be switched off. 
 
CONTAIN 
o 
The spillage will be immediately contained using bunds of earth or sand, 
drip trays, boom and or spill materials;  
o 
Drains and watercourses will be checked to see if the spill has reached 
them. Where possible, spills will be diverted and drains will be bunded to 
stop the spill entering the drainage network; 
o 
Spillage and runoff will not be washed into the drainage system.  
 
NOTIFY 
o 
The Environmental Manager will be notified;  
o 
The Environmental manger will then notify the relevant regulator, CCS 
and APL.  
 
CLEAN UP 
o 
The spill will be cleaned up using appropriate spill materials OR by an 
expert/ specialist clean-up contractor; 
o 
Contaminated soil, ground and water will be disposed of as hazardous 
waste (section 4.7.10). 
 
REPORT  
o 
An Environmental Incident Report will be completed in line with the 
Incident Response Procedure (Section 2.5.11). 
c) Flood Risk Management Plan  
4.6.9 
The following provides an outline of the measures to be implemented to minimise 
flood risk: 
 
The main contractor will sign up to receive NRW flood warnings or flood alerts 
for the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw; 
 
The main contractor will sign up to receive high rainfall alerts provided by the 
MET office as flood warming for the Project Site; 
 
Weather forecasts will be checked regularly; 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Plant, machinery and stockpiles will be stored away from watercourses, ditches 
and low lying areas that could flood; 
 
If flooding of the Project Site is expected, vehicles and plant machinery that 
pose a hazard will be moved to higher ground or off-site if appropriate; 
 
If flooding of the Project Site occurs, plant machinery and vehicles will be 
checked to ensure they are safe before use; and 
 
Where possible, temporary works (including stockpiles and drains) will be set to 
direct overland flows away from the main Project Site and access routes. 
4.7 
Waste and Material Management Plan 
4.7.1 
To ensure efficiency of resource use, prevention of litter nuisance and compliance 
with waste legislation, this sections sets out good practice waste and material 
management measures. 
4.7.2 
Construction activities associated with materials and/or waste generation include: 
 
Site clearance will remove vegetation and undergrowth in work areas 
generating organic materials and waste;  
 
Excavation; it is estimated that the overall quantity of excavated material (solid) 
from the construction is to be approximately 19,000m3. This figure is a measure 
of excavated material in the ground and bulk material. The worst case scenario 
assessed in Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access of the PEIR assumes 
that none of this excavated material can be reused within the Project Site. 
However the worst case is not anticipated; and  
 
General day-to-day construction operations such as use of welfare facilities and 
deliveries generating packaging, domestic waste and sewage.  
4.7.3 
The EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (Ref 4.13) provides the overarching 
legislative framework for the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste, 
and includes a common definition of waste. The Project will operate in accordance 
with the WFD, together with the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2016 (Ref 4.15) and the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2005 (as amended by the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) 
Amendment Regulations 2009 and 2016) (Ref 4.14). 
4.7.4 
Other guidance referred to within the CEMP includes: 
 
The Waste Classification Technical Guidance WM3 (Ref 4.16), which sets out a 
standardised classification of waste based on material properties; 
 
Welsh Government Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy (Ref 4.17); and 
 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s (DEFRA) Waste Duty 
of Care Code of Practice (Ref 4.18). 
a) Contents of Plan 
i. 
Waste Hierarchy  
4.7.5 
Onsite waste management will align with the Waste Hierarchy, which promotes 
efficient resource use and minimisation of waste through the priority ordering of the 
following measures: 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Prevention; 
 
Preparing for re-use; 
 
Recycle; 
 
Other recovery; and  
 
Dispose (Ref 4.14).  
4.7.6 
The priority order may be deviated from if a better overall environmental outcome is 
recognised for a particular resource or waste.  
ii. Waste Prevention 
4.7.7 
The following preventative measures will be adopted:  
 
Building materials ordered will be the correct size so as not to be wasted due to 
being obsolete;  
 
The appropriate volume of material will be ordered to avoid excess; 
 
Ordering of new materials will be avoided if there are existing materials 
available or able to be adapted to the task within the Project Site;  
 
Deliveries will be timely and directly placed in secure storage areas, double 
handling will be kept to a minimum;  
 
Re-usable materials will be identified onsite and removed for storage and re-
sale;  
 
Excess materials will be returned to the supplier if possible; and 
 
General information on site waste management will be provided in Site 
Inductions and toolbox talks with feedback welcomed. 
iii. Classification of Waste 
4.7.8 
APL and/ or the main contractor will identify and classify all Project Site waste 
streams in line with the categories and methods set out in the Waste Classification 
Technical Guidance WM3 (Ref 4.16).  
iv. Storing Waste  
4.7.9 
Where resources are earmarked for recycling, recovery or disposal the following 
method of storage will be implemented to minimise the risk of waste escaping, litter 
and/ or pollution:  
 
All waste will be stored at the location in which it is generated, or within a 
designated central waste storage area; 
 
These designated waste storage areas will be isolated from surface water 
drains and areas that discharge directly to the water environment;  
 
Waste will be stored in suitable containers of sufficient capacity to avoid loss, 
overflow or spillage; 
 
Storage of liquid wastes will be on impermeable bunds that hold the capacity of 
the container;  
 
Waste will be segregated by waste stream and storage containers will be 
clearly signed with the waste that they will hold e.g. wood, metal, plastics or 
other appropriate waste stream; 
 
Storage containers will be secure, covered or enclosed;  
 
There will be separate containers for hazardous waste (see Paragraph 4.7.10); 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Skips will be monitored and action taken if waste levels are too high; and   
 
Burning of waste is prohibited. 
v. Hazardous Waste 
4.7.10 “Hazardous waste” is any waste which contains properties that might make it 
harmful to human health or the environment (Ref 4.19). 
4.7.11 Hazardous waste could arise during construction from the following sources: 
 
Maintenance of plant and machinery; 
 
Oily water waste;  
 
Oily rags; 
 
Oil absorbent pads etc.; and 
 
Environmental Spill recovery (small amounts only; larger volumes taken away 
directly for disposal). 
4.7.12 All Hazardous waste will be segregated by type and from other waste streams. All 
waste oil will be stored in a bunded facility until such times that it is collected. Used 
filters, rags and absorbents will be stowed in the hazardous waste container in 
drums or waste oil bags.  
vi. Transporting Waste 
 
Waste contractors will be checked periodically (bi-annually) to ensure they 
have valid licences;  and 
 
All waste leaving the Project Site will be accompanied by a Waste Transfer 
Note (WTN) for non-hazardous waste or a Special Waste Consignment Note 
(SWCN) for hazardous waste.  A copy of which will be retained for 2 (WTN) or 
3 years (SWCN). 
4.8 
Habitat Management Plan  
4.8.1 
Construction activities will be carried out in such a way as to ensure that 
disturbance to any nearby ecologically sensitive areas is minimised and that 
appropriate measures are adopted to avoid impacts on protected species in 
accordance with relevant good practice and statutory requirements.

Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
 
Fencing will be erected around the Project Site to prevent spill over to areas 
outside of the Project footprint, particularly in areas adjacent to features of 
interest/value;  
 
Information and procedures regarding the biodiversity associated with the 
Project Site will be disseminated to Project Personnel through training, toolbox 
talks and summarised on site notice boards (detailed in Section 2.2.5); 
 
All reasonably practicable measures will be employed to minimise harm to, and 
disturbance of, wildlife caused by noise and vibration, dust, surface water 
runoff, waste and pollution. This may include avoidance of certain activities 
during sensitive times of the year such as breeding and nesting bird season; 
 
Avoidance through micro-siting will be undertaken wherever possible, in 
consultation with the ECoW, as necessary; 
 
Trenches and holes should be covered when not being worked on to prevent 
entry by mammals and where this is not possible exist and escape routes such 
as ramps or mammal ladders will be provided;  
 
Open entrances to pipes and pipelines should be covered when not being 
worked on to prevent access by mammals; and  
 
Regular 
environmental 
inspections, 
incorporating 
biodiversity, 
will 
be 
undertaken to check that detrimental impacts on ecological features are being 
minimised (see Section 2.5). 
4.8.4 
An Ecological Mitigation Area will be implemented for the protection of reptiles and 
amphibians. The proposed location will be confirmed for the DCO Application within 
the Outline Landscaping Plan. Details on trapping and translocating reptiles will be 
provided in the Outline Habitat Management Plan as part of the DCO application. 
Information on proposed techniques is currently available in Chapter 8: Ecology of 
the PEIR.  
4.8.5 
Vegetation clearance of areas with good reptile habitat will be supervised by the 
ECoW. The main contractor will ensure the integrity of the ecological mitigation 
area through restricted access and regular maintenance of fencing. Awareness of 
the area and measures to protect reptile and amphibian habitat will be raised 
through the Site Induction and toolbox talks prior to site clearance and any other 
relevant construction activities as identified by the ECoW or Environmental 
Manager. 
4.9 
Invasive Species Management Plan 
4.9.1 
Construction activities will be carried out in such a way so as to, as far as 
practicably possible, control the spread of invasive species from the Project Site.  
4.9.2 
Measures set out in this Outline CEMP are in line with the responsibilities detailed 
in the Wildlife and the Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  
a) Contents of the Plan 
4.9.3 
The results of the invasive species survey will be updated before construction 
commences. Specific measures for invasive species will be set out in the ecological 
management plan, an outline of which will be submitted with the DCO. The 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
Ecological Management Plan will consider measures for the control and eradication 
of invasive species, such as; 
 
The implementation of buffer areas around identified or suspected plants;  
 
The management of vehicle movements to reduce dispersal of seeds within 
and outside of the Project Site; 
 
The implementation of vehicle inspections and wash stations for controlling the 
spread of invasive species, if required; 
 
Details on monitoring and reporting of invasive species;  
 
Species specific treatments (e.g. pulling and/ or herbicides) the timing of 
treatment and any additional consents or requirements (i.e. consent to use 
herbicide close to a watercourse); and 
 
How waste containing invasive species will be classified and managed. 
4.9.4 
Awareness of the legal requirements relating to invasive species and the potential 
health risks that certain species can pose, will be included within toolbox talks and 
posters on identification of relevant species will be made available on site notice 
boards.  
4.9.5 
Should an invasive species be found, works will be stopped and appropriate 
measures implemented by the ECoW or other suitably qualified individual.  
4.10 
Landscape Management Plan 
4.10.1 This Landscape Management Plan outlines good practice measures for the 
retention and protection of trees and for reducing visual intrusion during 
construction. Reinstatement is considered in the Land Reinstatement and 
Restoration Plan (Section 4.11) and planting is considered in Chapter 11: 
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment of the PEIR.  
4.10.2 Works with trees will be compliant with BS 5837: 2012 (Ref 4.23) and BS 3998: 
2010 (Ref 4.24) 
a) Contents of Plan 
4.10.3 Construction activities will be carried out in such a way to ensure that, as far as 
reasonably practicable, disturbance to visual receptors is minimised.  
4.10.4 The following measures will be adopted as appropriate: 
 
Good housekeeping measures will minimise unsightly waste  and secure 
storage will be provided for materials at risk from displacement by wind; 
 
Temporary stockpiles will be located in defined storage areas, away from 
sensitive visual receptors; 
 
No advertisements or fly posting will be permitted on any fence and all graffiti 
will be removed and made good as soon as reasonably practicable; 
 
All boundary fences will be maintained in a neat and tidy condition; 
 
Any temporary fencing will be removed as soon as reasonably practicable after 
completion of the works; and 
 
Temporary lighting will be selected and sited so as to minimise visual intrusion 
(as set out in Section 3.8 Artificial Lighting Plan), whilst maintaining the safe 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
35 
 
and efficient operation of work areas.  At night and during periods of darkness, 
directional security lighting will be used.  
4.10.5 The following good practice measures will be adopted and implemented for the 
protection of trees retained onsite:  
 
A Root Protection Area (RPA) will be set up around trees to be retained onsite 
prior to commencement of construction; 
 
The RPA will be demarcated by ‘Netlon’ fluorescent mesh fencing or similar 
physical barrier. The protective fencing will be maintained for the duration of the 
construction phase and checked on a regular basis;  
 
In the event that an RPA cannot be maintained at 12 times the diameter at 
breast height (DBH) mitigation such as bog matting, flotation tyres and hand 
digging will be utilised;  
 
No machinery or material will be stored within the RPA; 
 
To ensure retained trees do not become hazardous, the condition of trees will 
be checked by the Environmental Manager or ECoW at an appropriate 
frequency and following storm events where there may be damage from wind 
throw;  
 
Where a tree is damaged or diseased advice will be sought from an 
Arboriculturalist (unless the ECoW is appropriately qualified) for appropriate 
treatment measures;  
 
Where hazardous branches or trees require to be felled this will be done by a 
qualified tree surgeon in line with BS 3998: 2010;  
 
Before felling trees will be surveys for potential bird nest or bat roosts by the 
ECoW; and 
 
The waste hierarchy will be applied to forestry arisings and alternate onsite 
uses will be sought before disposal is considered.  
4.11 
Peat Management Plan 
4.11.1 A Peat Management Plan will be prepared after Ground Investigations have been 
conducted, post-consent. The Peat Management Plan will detail predicted volumes 
of peat excavated on the Project Site, the characteristics of the excavated peat, 
and how and where this excavated peat will be stored, reused and managed 
4.12 
Land Reinstatement and Restoration Management Plan 
4.12.1 This plan sets out planned and good practice measures for the reinstatement of 
areas of the Project Site once they are no longer required for construction.  
4.12.2 Prompt implementation of reinstatement and restoration measures aim to reduce 
the effects of: 
 
Compaction of subsoil, which can lead to inhibited drainage and root growth; 
 
Exposed ground, which can cause loss of topsoil, dust and water pollution 
through wind blow and erosion; and  
 
Visual intrusion.

a) Contents of Plan 
4.12.3 Planned reinstatement at the Project Site includes the following considerations and 
measures:  
 
Land reinstatement will normally take place in the autumn following the 
construction phase. The length of the gas connection route will be reinstated to 
its original condition and returned to its previous use;  
 
Where compaction may have occurred a ‘sub-soiler’, which lifts and shatters 
the subsoil will be used before the topsoil is reinstated; 
 
Topsoil that has been stored in the Laydown Area will be spread and levelled 
across the width of the strip, using hydraulic excavators or bulldozers. In areas 
where stones have been brought to the surface, stone picking will be carried 
out mechanically; 
 
The finish in which the soil is left will be agreed with the relevant land occupier. 
Land to be reinstated as grassland will either be reseeded in the autumn or the 
following spring. The reptile fences will remain in place until the grass crop is 
established; 
 
Temporary construction fences will be removed once an agreement has been 
reached with the landowners that the land can be handed back to them; and 
 
Hedgerows will be reinstated in the first planting season following the 
completion of construction and land reinstatement work. 
4.12.4 The following lists general reinstatement good practice measures that will be 
adopted for the implementation of the specific measures: 
 
Reinstatement will be carried out as soon as possible following any vegetation 
stripping to ensure integrity is maintained;  
 
The reinstatement of the construction areas will be undertaken to the standard 
to be agreed with CCS, using the existing soil and vegetation wherever 
possible; 
 
Stripped soil will be reinstated as close to where it was removed as possible;  
 
Subsoil, topsoil and turf will be replaced in the same order as removed;  
 
Restoration works will be carried out in suitable weather conditions noting that 
wet ground conditions can be difficult as can hot dry and windy spells; and  
 
Natural regeneration of habitats will be promoted in all appropriate areas as 
advised by the Environmental Manager or ECoW.

Introduction   
A.1.1 
This Appendix provides a register of mitigation for all mitigation measures that have 
been identified in the PEIR for the Project, and are incorporated within the Outline 
CEMP and all other topic-specific Management Plans.  The measures listed in this 
Appendix will be updated for the DCO Application to include relevant DCO 
Requirements.  
A.1.2 
Table A.1 – Table A. 2 collate the mitigation measures outlined in the PEIR and 
have been separated into construction, operation and phases. Decommissioning 
measures will be similar to that of construction.  These tables show the 
corresponding reference to the PEIR, the relevant Management Plan(s) and their 
document reference, and also cross-referencing the responsibility for the 
preparation, approval and delivery as set out in the CEMP.

A CEMP will be prepared and then implemented during 
construction to mitigate any adverse environmental effects. An 
Outline CEMP for the Project is provided in Appendix 3.1 of the 
PEIR. It includes measures relating to the environmental topics 
assessed in this PEIR which will mitigate the effects of 
construction. The CEMP will be finalised and followed by the 
Contractor on site, once the content has been agreed with CCS. 
The Outline CEMP includes the following information: 
 
Community liaison; 
 
Nuisance management including measures to avoid or 
minimise the impacts of construction works (covering dust, 
noise, vibration and lighting); 
 
Site waste and materials management measures; 
 
Surface and ground water protection measures; 
 
Pollution control measures; 
 
Peat management measures as required; 
 
Landscape and visual impact mitigation (such as retention of 
existing trees and minimising visual intrusion of construction 
works); 
 
Security measures; a protocol in the event that unexpected 
contaminated land is identified during ground investigation or 
construction; 
 
A protocol for the restoration of land which is temporarily 
used 
for 
construction 
following 
the 
date 
of 
final 
commissioning; 
 
Environmental training requirements; and 
 
Ecological mitigation measures including avoidance of 
sensitive features.

Institute of Air Quality Managers (IAQM) guidance on monitoring 
air quality at construction sites (Ref A.1) recommends that, in 
addition to visual inspections, ambient air monitoring is undertaken 
in the vicinity of high risk sites. This data is required for two 
reasons: the first relates to ensuring that mitigation measures are 
appropriate and being applied rigorously; the second is to provide 
early warning of increased dust emissions which allows for the 
cessation or modification of activities prior to impacts occurring.

Monitoring will be undertaken in the vicinity of the Lletty Morfil 
SINC. Since the risk for ecosystems relates to dust deposition, a 
real time monitor for total suspended particulate matter will be 
installed but this needs to be an ‘indicative instrument’ only. 
Trigger levels for the instrument, which would suggest increasing 
risk/emissions, should be agreed with NRW prior to the 
commencement of construction. The monitoring stations will be 
mobile and would be moved around the Project Site as the 
principal activities move.

It is anticipated that core working hours and boundary noise will be 
limited during construction by a Requirement in the DCO. Working 
hours are likely to be between 08.00 and 18.00 on weekdays, and 
between 08.00 and 13.00 hours on Saturdays and public holidays. 
Some works may be allowed to take place outside of normal 
working hours provided they do not cause any noise disturbance. 
Should it be necessary to conduct work with the potential to 
generate noise, outside these core hours, this would be with the 
prior written agreement of CCS. These limits will not apply during 
commissioning and testing of the Project.

Mitigation measures for inclusion within the CEMP may contain, 
but is not limited to: 
 Abiding by any construction noise limits at nearby NSRs; 
 Ensuring that all processes are in place to minimise noise 
before works begin and ensuring that best practicable 
measures (BPM) are being achieved throughout the 
construction programme, including the use of localised 
screening around significant noise producing plant and 
activities; 
 Ensuring that modern plant is used, complying with the latest 
European noise emission requirements.  Selection of 
inherently quiet plant where possible; 
 Hydraulic techniques for breaking to be used in preference to 
percussive techniques where practical; 
 Use of lower noise piling (such as rotary bored or hydraulic 
jacking) rather the driven piling techniques (if required), 
where possible;  
 Off-site pre-fabrication, where practical; 
 All plant and equipment being used for the works to be 
properly maintained, silenced where appropriate, operated to 
prevent excessive noise, and switched off when not in use; 
 All contractors to be made familiar with current legislation 
and the guidance in BS 5228 (Parts 1 and 2), which should 
form a prerequisite of their appointment; 
 Loading and unloading of vehicles, dismantling of site 
equipment such as scaffolding or moving equipment or 
materials around the Project Site, to be conducted in such a 
manner as to minimise noise generation; 
 Appropriate routing of construction traffic on public roads and 
along access tracks;  
 Consultation with BDC and local residents to advise of 
potential noisy works that are due to take place; and  
 Monitoring of noise complaints, and reporting to the main 
contractor for immediate investigation.

The preferred approach for controlling construction noise and 
vibration is to reduce levels at source where possible, but with due 
regard to practicality. Sometimes a greater noise or vibration level 
may be acceptable if the overall construction time, and therefore 
length of disruption, is reduced.

Monitoring 
During operation, monitoring is considered appropriate in order to 
track the success of delivery of proposed mitigation.  Ideally this 
monitoring would be based on regular or fixed measurements 
close to the Project Site boundary to give consistency by 
minimising the impact of weather and extraneous sources.  The 
measured levels at these locations must be calibrated against the 
levels at the receptors as part of the plant commissioning sound 
test procedure.  Any change in Project Site boundary levels can 
then be related directly to changes at the receptors.

Due to the ‘Good’ population of common lizard and the presence 
of low numbers of grass snakes within the survey area it is 
recommended that a trapping and translocation programme is 
undertaken to help protect any reptiles from being injured or killed. 
The actions involved in the proposed trapping and translocation 
are outlined below: 
 
Any construction areas suitable or known to support reptiles, 
including any routes in and out, areas for site compounds, 
offices or storage of materials/waste, will be fenced off using 
suitable fencing (drift or semi-permanent) to limit individuals 
attempting to enter the site from the adjacent land.  
 
No construction activities, including pedestrian access will be 
allowed outside of the fencing in areas of habitat suitable for 
supporting reptiles.  
 
A number of refugia (at a density of 50/ha) will be placed 
within the fenced area to attract reptiles.  
 
Each day, up to twice a day for a minimum of 60 days an 
ecologist will check the refugia for the presence of reptiles.  
 
Any reptiles or amphibians found will be captured for 
relocation to a pre-determined receptor site (see below).  
 
After 60 days the trapping can cease once there have been 
five consecutive days where no reptiles have been found.  
 
After the fenced area has been cleared of reptiles and prior 
to soil stripping the vegetation can undergo a process habitat 
management and hand searches for reptiles  
 
Supervision of the soil strip during construction work by a 
suitably qualified ecologist will be required to help protect 
injury or killing of reptiles.

The receptor site for the trapped reptiles can be within the Project 
Site boundary, or alternatively a receptor site can be chosen off-
site (within the same county or administrative area). However, 
there is a deficit of suitable receptor sites within the county and 
adjacent counties, and the costs associated with sorting and 
transporting trapped reptiles may be prohibitive.  
For either option the receptor site will: 
 
Have habitat suitable for supporting reptiles (can be made

 
Not currently support a population of the species of common

To allow the most appropriate and effective mitigation measures to 
be determined and will be finalised for inclusion in the approved 
CEMP, the following surveys will be undertaken:  
 
Building assessments and further bat surveys on Buildings 6, 
7 and 8 within the Abergelli Farm;  
 
During December 2017, January and February 2018 static 
bat detectors are placed as near to the estimated locations of 
the mine shaft and adit as is safe to do so. This will be done 
with the aim of any bat activity being recorded in these 
areas, suggesting a nearby hibernation-site; and;  
 
Pre-construction checks on trees scheduled for removal for 
their current bat roost potential with consideration of the 
seasonal survey timings.

Maintain connectivity of foraging and commuting habitats by the 
retention of trees and hedgerows wherever possible and utilising 
'brown hedgerows' of brash, to maintain connectivity during 
construction.  For linear features identified as key forging or 
commuting habitat, where possible the Gas Connection should be 
installed using drilling to retain feature and connectivity across the 
Project Site.  Embedded mitigation includes the provision of 
replacement habitats that will benefit foraging and commuting 
bats. Indicative areas, based on the previous layout are as follows, 
although these figures are subject to change: 
 
0.9 1 ha of woodland/scrub; 
 
5.04 ha of grassland (acid grassland/marshy grassland

The Project incorporates welfare facilities, which will require a site 
foul water drainage system. The Project Site is remote and it is 
believed it will be unfeasible to connect to a public sewer. 
Therefore, a foul water drainage system will either drain to a septic 
tank or a package treatment plant within the Project Site but 
outside any area at risk of flooding. It is likely that the latter would 
be 
the 
preferred 
option 
for 
ease

It is not expected that it will be possible to connect the surface 
water drainage system to an infiltration basin due to the presumed 
predominantly clayey ground and high groundwater level in 
places. This will be confirmed when the Ground Investigation 
surveys are carried out. Instead the discharged flow of water at the 
Generating Equipment Site boundary from the surface water 
drainage system will be attenuated in order to maintain the 
equivalent greenfield runoff flow for a range of events up to the 1 
in 100 year event (with climate change allowance). The flow will be 
attenuated using suitably sized attenuation ponds with restricted 
discharge pipes to the existing greenfield runoff rates. An 
emergency overflow will be provided to the attenuation ponds to 
prevent site flooding in the event of an extreme rainfall event.

The lighting should utilise warm light luminaire such as yellow or 
amber LED.  White LED lamps have a broad spectrum of light with 
whilst yellow and amber LED lamps each have a specific, narrower 
spectrum and have peak wavelengths between 590 and 660 nm, 
which is less attractive to invertebrates.  This in turn will reduce the 
number of bats that will be attracted to feed and be open to 
predation through increased visibility.

Any new fencing will continue to allow the movement of otters and 
badger across the Project Site through the inclusion of badger 
gates or large gaps between the bottom of the fence and the 
ground. Speed limits on the Access Road will be enforced to help 
reduce the likelihood of any traffic mortalities or collisions.

Adaptation of different platform levels at the locations of key 
elements of the Project development. In line with this, the ground 
level of the Welsh Water main easement area will be retained at 
the existing level in order to provide a path for any flood water to 
pass through the Project Site, thereby avoiding the elevated Power 
Generation Plant (PGP) areas – with the PGP finished floor level to 
be raised by approximately 150 millimetres (mm) above the site 
road crown level while keeping the plant plinths at 300 mm above 
the site level.

Creation of new ecological ponds in the construction laydown area 
and southeast of the Generating Equipment Site (refer to Chapter 
8 of the PEIR for details). These are additional to those proposed 
for attenuation of runoff and will mitigate for loss of habitat at the 
existing ponds in the south-eastern corner of the Generating 
Equipment Site.

Utilising technology (OCGT) will allow a significant reduction in 
stack height compared to other technology types. As a result of 
selecting OCGT technology, there will be no visible plume arising 
from the stack. The high temperature of the exhaust gases means 
that water vapour is well above the condensation point which 
would give rise to a visible plume.  The minimum height of the 
stack is 35m in order to ensure the adequate dispersal of 
pollutants.

The architectural design of the buildings and structures on the 
Project Site has been designed to reduce glare and to assimilate 
the Project into the surrounding landscape as much as possible by 
using neutral recessive colours to lessen the contrast with the 
surrounding landscape and break up the overall massing of the 
large scale structures.

An outline landscape mitigation strategy has been developed to 
both provide reinstatement planting as well as to integrate the 
Project into the landscape and its wider setting. The planting 
proposals will be developed in accordance with the various utility 
and service constraints within the site and are presented on 
Figures 11.10 – 11.12.

Whilst any significant mode shift away from the private car is 
unlikely for the Project - there are likely to be only a maximum of 
five workers on site at the same time - a Travel Plan will be created 
specifically targeting employees to decrease the number of 
vehicles accessing the Project. A range of non-car Initiatives would 
be implemented to encourage the use of alternative modes of 
travel to the private car.
