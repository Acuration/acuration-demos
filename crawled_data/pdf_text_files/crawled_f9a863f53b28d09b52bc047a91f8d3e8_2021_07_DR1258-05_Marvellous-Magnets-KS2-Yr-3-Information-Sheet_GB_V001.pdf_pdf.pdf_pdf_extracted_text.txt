Marvellous magnets
Magnetism is an invisible force – although you can see its effect in action 
sometimes (see points 3, 4 and 5)
A magnet will only attract or repel another object when that object enters 
its magnetic field - the area where it’s possible to feel the magnetic force 
(see Did you know?)
The same poles of different magnets (or magnetic fields) will repel each 
other and pull apart
The opposite poles of different magnets (or magnetic fields - see point 5) 
will attract each other and pull together
Every magnet has a north (N) pole and a south (S) pole

Objects are either attracted to a magnet or not. If something is attracted, 
we say it's magnetic - and most (but not all!) metals are magnetic.

Did you know?
Unlike most other forces, magnetic force can 
act at a distance! That means that a 
magnet can pull a magnetic object 
along a surface without 
touching the object.
This is Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire. We use giant magnets to 
make enough electricity to power six million homes! The magnet is found inside the 
generator, which generates electricity. There’s one magnet inside each generator, 
and the power station has six generators.
We have a magnet that’s 15 metres long and weighs 82 tonnes (as heavy as 82 
small cars) that spins 50 times a second!
