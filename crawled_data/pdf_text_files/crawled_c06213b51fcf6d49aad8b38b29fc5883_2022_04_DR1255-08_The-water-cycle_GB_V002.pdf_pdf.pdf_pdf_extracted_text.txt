The water cycle is a good way to explore changes in states of matter. All the water 
on Earth is constantly moving and going through a loop of change and recycling. 
This cycle includes evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection.  
Let’s take a look at each of those in turn:
Evaporation
Condensation
Precipitation
Collection
Evaporation is the process of water (or 
another liquid) becoming a gas. In the 
water cycle, this can happen when the 
ocean warms up after being heated by 
the sun. The sea water becomes gaseous 
and rises upwards.
Condensation happens when the 
evaporated sea water rises high enough 
to start cooling down. It condenses back 
into water and these droplets of water 
become clouds in the sky.
Precipitation occurs when the clouds 
become heavy enough for the water 
droplets to fall back down to the ground 
– as rain, sleet, hail, or snow.
Collection is what happens to the 
precipitation as it’s collected in oceans, 
lakes and reservoirs. From these places, it 
begins to evaporate and the cycle starts 
all over again.
