 
Gender Pay Gap 2022 
Introduction 
Each year we publish our Gender Pay Gap statistics for the UK. Here's what Will Gardiner, 
Drax CEO, said about our stats and progress on making Drax more inclusive:  
“At Drax, we want everyone to feel like a valued member of the team, as we work to enable 
a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. As a part of this, we are continuing to report on and 
make progress against our goals for our workforce’s gender balance and Gender Pay Gap.”  
“We remain committed to our efforts to create greater equity across Drax and will continue 
working to create a fair, safe and inclusive working environment for all of our colleagues.” 
Understanding our Gender Pay Gap 
We have calculated the median and mean gender pay data based on hourly rates of pay as 
at the snapshot date of 5 April 2022 with a comparison to 2021. We also show median and 
mean bonus pay data for bonuses up until 5 April 2022.

Making progress for the future 
Drax is committed to building a fair, safe, and inclusive working environment, where 
everyone has the tools to do their best work, and feels they belong.  
To make this commitment a reality, we have a responsibility to act to close our Gender Pay 
Gap. We are taking action to address this imbalance and improve the fairness of our 
processes for everyone at Drax through measurable action.
