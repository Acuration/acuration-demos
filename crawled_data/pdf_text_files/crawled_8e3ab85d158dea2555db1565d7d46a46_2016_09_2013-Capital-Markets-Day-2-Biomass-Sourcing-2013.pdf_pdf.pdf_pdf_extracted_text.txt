Drax Group plc
Conversion of existing coal units requires a specific type of biomass
Sensitivity to
corrosion, slagging
and fouling
Large quantities;
proven technology
- product similar to
coal
Greenhouse gas
emissions and cost
Clean wood focus;
limited other biomass
Pellet form
Conversion at
source
Biomass is an Abundant Resource

Distribution of Global Forest Resource(2)
Biomass is the fourth largest energy resource
By 2050 sustainable biomass could supply 10%-20% of the world’s primary energy requirement(1)
4 billion hectares of forest globally
c.30% of the total land area
More than 50% total annual harvest is consumed as fuelwood
•
Predominantly for small scale domestic use
Global annual wood harvest is equivalent to c.1.8 billion tonnes of wood pellets
Global annual
wood harvest
(2012)
3.6bn m3
Fuelwood
1.9bn m3
Industrial wood
1.7bn m3

Drax Group plc
Large, well established and most often
highly interdependent
•
Primary economic driver is sawlog
•
Traditional wood markets in decline in
selective areas
- Consumption by forest products industry
declining
•
Wood pellets can be complementary to
existing forest products
- Higher utilisation
•
Un-merchantable whole trees can also be
utilised for pellets
- Optimising sustainable forest management
e.g. undersized , misshapen, ‘off’ species
Large dimension
e.g. Sawlog
Small dimension
e.g. Pulpwood

Early growth of the biomass supply portfolio focused on:
Speed to market in politically stable regions
Existing sustainable forestry industry, some pelleting infrastructure and good logistics
Opportunities best placed to obtain finance
US has > 300M hectares
forest land
US forests are growing
US South has vast resource
of sustainable forests
•
Relatively short rotation
•
South East inventories
increased > 90% since 1950(1)
Consumption by forest
products industry declining
•
By >100Mt since 2000(2)

Wood pellet supply
Significant growth in wood pellet
imports into Europe
•
2009-2012 CAGR(2) of 35% to 4.3Mt
•
Industrial market projected to represent
c.50% of total pellet market by 2020(3)
•
Global pellet market expansion expected
to maintain historic growth rate
Wood pellet demand
Total wood pellet demand was c.21Mt
in 2012(1)
•
Largest demand and growth is Europe
Growing the Wood Pellet Supply Market
Wood pellet supply market will develop with demand growth
Drax facilitating investment to grow the supply chain through a combination of:
•
Long-term take or pay contracts
•
Selected own-investment in the supply chain
•
Fostering a partnership approach

Fuel Contract Pricing
Most biomass is imported
Significant focus understanding
underlying markets and supplier cost base
Detailed supply chain knowledge allows
informed contracting
•
Drivers of upward pressure on
pellet prices
- Procurement from sources
further away from export facilities
- Expanding to new geographies
•
Strategy to mitigate upward pressure
- Hedging
- Driving efficiencies through aggregation and
economies of scale
- Potential to widen fuel envelope (agricultural
residues)
£8/GJ (2013 prices) remains firm guidance
