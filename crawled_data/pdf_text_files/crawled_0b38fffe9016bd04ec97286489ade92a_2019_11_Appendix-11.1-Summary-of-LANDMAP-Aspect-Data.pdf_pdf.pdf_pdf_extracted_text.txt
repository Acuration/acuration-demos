Rhyd-y-pandy
SWNSVS738
Rolling farmland mosaic on land ranging between 60m and
200m AOD, with slight upland character at these higher
elevations generated by the adjacent uplands.  Essentially
rural landscape, although criss-crossed by network of minor
roads and greater detractor of overhead power wires on steel
pylons.  The southern area is also influenced by road noise
from the busy M4.  Three separate parts to this aspect area.
Change detection 2014: adjacent settlements have expanded
into this area in three places
-
Morrison Hospital,
Pontarddulais and Pontlliw.  Plus new business park
developing on former works site, adjacent to J46 of M4,
general erosion of rural character.
Moderate (rolling farmland typical of
area)
Medium Term:
Restrict 
overhead 
pylons, 
especially
steel/lattice support.  Sensitive management of
urban edge and business park to reduce
intrusion.

Gower

Agricultural
SWNSHL398
An area of fieldscape not based on the open-field system, but
evolving as a result of gradual enclosure of the uplands and
their foothills.  There is some evidence for enclosure in the
pre-Norman period, and the process continued into the
second half of the 19th century.  Some unenclosed land and
woodland remains.  Limited industrial activity, mainly mining
took place in the 19th century.  The settlement pattern is
basically dispersed, but ribbon developments occurred in
areas of industrial activity.
Outstanding
Outstanding integrity, survival, rarity
and potential, with high condition
rating
None
