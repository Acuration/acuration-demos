INTRODUCTION
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
Parsons Brinckerhoff has been commissioned by Abergelli Power Ltd
(ALP) to undertake a BS5837: 2012 “Trees in Relation to Design
Demolition and Construction – recommendations” (BS5837)
arboriculture survey in relation to the proposed 299MW gas-fired
‘peaking’ plant at Abergelli Farm Felindre, near Swansea (hereafter
referred to as ‘the Project’).
1.2
Context
1.2.1
The Arboriculture Survey Report is required in support of an application
for Development Consent as an Appendix to the Environmental
Statement (ES) for the Project.
1.3
Purpose
1.3.1
The purpose of this report is to assess all qualifying trees, groups of
trees, hedges and woodland (individuals with a stem diameter of at
least 75mm measured at 1.5m above ground level) within the survey
areas (identified as “project site” within the Tree Constraints Plan at
appendix D)and those where the Root Protection Areas (RPA) may be
affected by the Project as defined in BS5837
1.3.2
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd carried out the BS5837 Arboriculture Survey
between 17th and 19th September 2014 and on 18th November 2014.
1.4
Planning and Legislative Context
1.4.1
This report has been carried out in accordance with the most recently
published (30th April 2012) BS5837 which updates the previous
BS5837 of 2005 by:
· 
Taking account of current practice regarding planning for the
management, protection and planting of trees in the vicinity of
structures, and for the protection of structures near trees;
· 
Updating the guidance in relation to building regulations; and
· 
Recognising the contribution that trees make to climate change
adaptation.
1.4.2
Trees are a material consideration in the UK planning system, and
existing trees are an important factor on construction sites, whether on
or near the working areas. BS 5837 2012 Arboriculture reports are
intended to assist decision-making, by ensuring consideration is given
Abergelli Power BS5837 Arboriculture
Survey Report
Arboriculture Report
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff
November 2014
for Abergelli Power
- 10 -
to existing and proposed trees in the context of design, demolition and
construction.
1.4.3
The primary source of protection afforded to trees is through the
application of Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) as part of the Town and
Country Planning (Tree Preservation) (England) Regulations 2012
which came into effect on April 6th 2012. There are two offences under
this Act:
· 
in contravention of tree preservation regulations: cut down, uproot
or wilfully destroy a protected tree; or to damage, top or lop it
wilfully in such a manner as to be likely to destroy it; or to cause
and permit any such activity; and
· 
to carry out any other works in contravention of tree preservation
regulations.
1.4.4
It has been confirmed that there are no tree preservation orders with
the survey site.
1.4.5
 In recent years greater weight has been added to the protection of
ancient and veteran trees within our landscape. This is reflected in the
recent update to Planning Policy Wales which states “Ancient and Semi
Natural woodlands are irreplaceable habitats of high biodiversity value
which should be protected from development that would result in
significant damage” (paragraph 5.2.9).
1.4.6
 The Forestry Act of 1967 requires any person wishing to fell trees to
apply for a felling licence before those works are undertaken. There are
many exemptions to this requirement that often reflect good forest and
woodland management and other exemptions that may be reasonably
expected such as dead, diseased or dangerous trees. Exemptions are
also afford to works required to facilitate planning consent

METHODOLOGY
2.1
Survey
2.1.1
The trees on the survey site qualifying for survey were inspected and
classified, by a competent arboriculture consultant with regard to
BS5837.  The trees were classified in accordance with BS5837: 2012
tree quality assessment categories A, B, C and U, as set out in Table 1
and 2 of the British Standard. Qualifying trees are defined as individual
trees with a stem diameter of at least 75 mm measured at 1.5 m above
ground level.
2.1.2
All trees within the survey site were inspected from ground level using
the Visual Tree Assessment (VTA) method. VTA assessment is a non-
invasive method for ascertaining the physiological and structural
condition of trees. The method requires the use of a Thor 10 nylon
acoustic mallet, and a wire probe.
2.1.3
The VTA was undertaken on the above ground portion of the trees. No
aerial inspection, sampling, or excavations for the purpose of soil or
root analysis were undertaken. Binoculars were used to inspect the
upper parts of the tree canopy from ground level, if required.
2.1.4
To allow the assessment of trees on site to be completed in a
practicable way and to best reflect the tree population on site, where
trees formed groups either aerodynamically, through mutual support or
by forming a screen or other such feature they have been recorded as
such. This is a widely used method and is supported by Section 4.4.2.3
of BS 5837: 2012.
2.2
Survey Limitations
2.2.1
Trees are large dynamic organisms, influenced by a variety of
environmental variables, whose health and condition can change
rapidly.  Due to the changeable nature of trees and other site and
environmental considerations which may influence the trees, this
report, and any recommendations made within it are valid for a period
of 12 months from the date of the site survey (November 2014).
2.2.2
Although comments and recommendations on the safety of particular
trees may have been made, this survey is not a tree hazard
assessment and should not be used as such.
2.2.3
Any management recommendations have been made in accordance
with BS 3998: 2010 “Tree Works – Recommendations” and industry
best practice. Works have been recommended in accordance with any
statutory obligations owed by the land owners or occupiers.

RESULTS
3.1
Overview
3.1.1
None of the trees within the survey site were found to be of such poor
condition that urgent remedial work was required.
3.1.2
The hedge recorded as part of this survey was not made the subject of
detailed assessment for their importance in relation to the Hedgerow
Regulations.
3.2
Site Context
3.2.1
Many of the trees within the survey site were of reasonable but not
outstanding quality. Due to the relatively low hedges and open field
systems mature trees are locally prominent in the landscape.
3.2.2
The following features were recorded during the survey and recorded in
the Tree Survey Schedule in Appendix A and plotted on the Tree
Constraints Plan in Appendix D:
· 
Woodlands 1 and 2;
· 
Groups 1 to 6;
· 
Hedge 1; and
· 
Trees 922 to 924.
3.2.3
Where access was not possible, trees were listed as A to C. These
trees were not tagged and stem diameters were estimated using
neighbouring trees as a reference.
3.3
Notable Features
3.3.1
Woodland 1 is designated as Ancient Woodland and a Site of
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). It is relatively open
woodland with birch as the dominant species in most areas. Many of
the birch trees are in full maturity and will start to decline over the next
20 to 30 years. This is due to the fungal pathogen Piptoporus betulinus
(birch strop fungi) which is dormant in birch trees for most of their life
becoming active when the tree suffers a wound or bark lesion. The
fruiting body of this fungi is clearly visible on many of the birch within
this woodland.  It is important to note that the decline of the birch within
the woodland is not a sign of ill health or poor quality within the
woodland. The decline of the birch will make way for the oak and ash
within the woodland to succeed and form woodland with greater
longevity.

3.3.2
Woodland 2 to the south of the National Grid Access Road is
designated as Ancient Woodland and a SINC. However, it is of
relatively low quality with the oldest individuals within the woodland
being no more than 80 or 90 years old and the majority being under 50
years old. The woodland would benefit from management and creation
of a more structured woodland edge.
3.3.3
The trees to the north of the National Grid Access Road at this location
(within Group 1) are also located within Ancient Woodland and a SINC.
They are of greater quality individually than those within the Woodland
2 and when considered as parts of the hedge form a linear feature
providing connectivity east to west. The existing National Grid Access
Road extends in places to almost 2 m under the saplings, bramble and
leaf litter that has accumulated at the edge of the clear area.
3.3.4
Many of the individual trees on site such as those within groups 5 and 6
have grown from former hedge lines or are formed from outgrown
hedge trees. Browsing by horses has caused bark damage in some
areas.
3.3.5
Groups 3, 4 and 6 will require pruning and in some cases minor felling
to allow construction traffic pass safely without causing damage to the
vehicles or vegetation. Pruning should be carried out in accordance
with Section 154 of the Highway Act 1980 to a height of 5.2m above the
carriage way.  These works are not considered to be a significant
impact.

CONCLUSION
4.1.1
The presence of trees on the Project Site is not considered to be an
obstruction to the Project. Careful consideration of trees at all stages of
the development process will ensure that existing trees of high
retention value are retained and protected throughout the Project.
Suitable mitigation for any tree loss should be designed into the Project
from the outset.
4.1.2
The Tree Constraints Plan (TCP), in Appendix D, will be used as a tool
to inform the Project design, the practicalities of implementing the
Project throughout construction and the final landscaping / mitigation
planting.
4.1.3
Table 1 of BS 5837 (shown in Appendix B) defines Category C trees as
“Trees of low quality with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at
least 10 years, or young trees with a stem diameter below 150mm”.
With this point in mind, Category C trees can potentially be removed if
suitable justification is given and appropriate mitigation provided.
4.1.4
British Standard 5837 provides a specification for protective fencing as
shown in Appendix C. Although this fencing is perfectly suitable for
individual significant trees it is not always practical for large areas of
fencing. With this in mind it is recommended that for large areas
fencing constructed of wooden post and netting with appropriate
signage may be used.
