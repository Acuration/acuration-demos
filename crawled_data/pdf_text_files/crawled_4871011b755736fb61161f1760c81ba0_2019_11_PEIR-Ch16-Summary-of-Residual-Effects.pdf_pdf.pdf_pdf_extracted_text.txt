Summary of Residual Effects 
16.1 
Introduction 
16.1.1 This chapter provides a summary of the residual effects following the 
implementation of the embedded and any additional mitigation measures as 
required. Full details can be found in the respective topic chapters of this PEIR. 
16.2 
Summary of Mitigation Measures 
16.2.1 Schedule 4, part 7 of the EIA Regulations requires an ES to include “A description 
of the measures envisaged to avoid, prevent, reduce or, if possible, offset any 
identified significant adverse effects on the environment and, where appropriate, of 
any proposed monitoring arrangements (for example the preparation of a post-
project analysis).” 
16.2.2 The mitigation, monitoring and enhancement measures included in this PEIR fall 
into one of the following categories: 
 
Embedded mitigation incorporated into the design, such as the height of the 
stack; 
 
Embedded mitigation in methods of construction as included within the 
Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1); and 
 
Additional mitigation measures identified as a result of the EIA, such as topic 
specific management plans. 
16.2.3 A topic summary of the key issues addressed by the PEIR and the mitigation 
measures identified has been included in Table 16.1.  
16.3 
Residual Effects 
16.3.1 The residual effects of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection, and the Project as a whole following implementation of the mitigation 
measures have been assessed.  
16.3.2 Each technical chapter contains a detailed account of residual effects and section 
16.3 summarises the main residual effects. The criteria for assigning the 
significance of effects are set out in section 4.6 of this PEIR and within relevant 
technical chapters where a different, topic-specific approach is followed. 
16.3.3 Note, as set out in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment, 
Negligible effects are not considered to be residual and have therefore not been 
included in the residuals table for each technical chapter or in Table 16.1 below. 
Minor effects are not considered significant, and Moderate and Major Effects are 
considered significant.  
16.3.4 The Project will result in the following beneficial residual effects:

 
Socio-Economic: There will be Negligible beneficial effects on the labour 
market due to employment produced through the Project, during both 
construction and operation. 
 
Traffic: There will be temporary Minor effects on Weekday traffic on the M4 
during the AM Peak Hour.  
 
Ground Conditions, Geology & Hydrogeology: There will be Minor beneficial 
effects where the previously worked land and known mine workings are 
stabilised if / where discovered and remediated if required.  
16.3.5 The PEIR has also identified a number of adverse effects that will mainly occur 
during construction which will include the following:

Construction of the Project 
 The construction of the Project will have a Minor adverse effect on one Noise Sensitive Receptor. 
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 The noise from the operation of the Power Generation Plant will have a Minor adverse effect during 
daytime and night-time. 
Ecology 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant 
 There will be permanent Minor adverse habitat loss to Broadleaved Woodland, trees, and Semi-
Improved Natural Grassland. 
 There will be a permanent Minor adverse effect on Invertebrates, Amphibians, Breeding Birds, due to 
potential loss of habitats, including breeding, foraging, and sheltering habitats.

Residual Effect 
 There will be permanent Minor adverse habitat loss to trees  
 There will be temporary Minor adverse effects Reptiles, Invertebrates, and Amphibians through the 
temporary loss of habitats. 
 There will be temporary Minor adverse effects to Breeding Birds from noise, loss of habitat and 
localised night time illumination in winter months 
 There will be a Minor adverse temporary habitat loss to broadleaved, one pond, and up to 180 m of 
Hedgerows. 
 There will be a Minor adverse effect to Badgers and Otters from potential to harm via construction 
activities. 
 There will be potential Minor adverse effects to Bats due to temporary removal of foraging habitat and 
disturbance from construction activities. 
 There is a Minor adverse effect from the potential for construction activities to spread invasive 
species.   
Construction of the Electrical Connection 
 There will be temporary Minor adverse effects to Breeding Birds from noise and localised night time 
illumination in winter months.  
 There is the potential for Otters to be effected due to construction of the Electrical Connection which is 
within 10 m of several watercourses. This is classified as a Minor adverse effect. 
Operational Phase of the Power Generation Plant 
 Bats and Invertebrates will experience Minor adverse effects from the operation lighting. 
Water Quality and 
Resources 
Construction of the Project 
 
There is a potential Negligible effect from discharging water from construction excavations containing 
increased pollutants and sediment loads from movement of materials to all identified receptors with the 
exception of the Loughor Estuary, which was considered to have a Minor adverse effect.  
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 
Effects from surface water runoff from impermeable areas and disruption of water storage and flow 
from the presence of the Generating Equipment Site on the Afon Llan and its tributaries are predicted 
to be Minor adverse.

Geology, Ground 
Conditions and 
Hydrogeology 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant 
 
The construction of the Power Generation Plant is predicted to have Minor adverse effects to mineral 
resources, structures from stability or ground conditions, land quality, human health and controlled 
waters, with Negligible effects on agricultural land and peat deposits.  
Construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
 
The construction of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection are both predicted to have a Minor 
adverse effect on mineral resources for both coal and sand and gravel reserves, and a Negligible 
effect on agricultural land.  
Operation of the Project 
 
The operational phase is anticipated to have a Minor adverse effect all receptors from the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, with the exception of Power Generation 
Plant structures which has a Minor beneficial effect from the stabilisation of ground conditions as part 
of the presence of the Power Generation Plant.  
Landscape and Visual 
Effects 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant 
 
Effects on visual amenity from viewpoints 9, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are Moderate or Major adverse, which 
is significant. All other remaining viewpoints conclude Minor adverse effects or Negligible. 
Construction of the Gas Connection 
 
Construction of the Gas Connection would affect the Public Right of Way, north of Abergelli fach 
(viewpoint 9), resulting in a Moderate effect. This is considered to be significant, however this effect is 
temporary as the trench would be reinstated post-construction.  
Construction of the Electrical Connection 
 
Construction of the Electrical Connection would not have any significant effects on the landscape and 
visual receptors due to its location beside the Access Road and the temporary trench being reinstated 
after construction.  
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 
The Power Generation Plant would impact the same five representative viewpoints (viewpoints 9, 14, 
15, 16 and 17) as during construction, with Moderate to Major effect, which are therefore considered 
significant.

Traffic, Transport, and 
Access 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant 
 The majority of the transport links within the assessment will experience a Minor adverse effect during 
the peak hour for Severance, Pedestrian Delay, Pedestrian, Amenity, Fear and Intimidation, which is 
therefore considered not significant.  
 Effects to Link 1 and effects to footpaths which cross within the Project Site Boundary, are considered 
Moderate and therefore significant.   
 There is predicted to be an increased delay on the B4489 due to the Power Generation Plant which is 
considered Minor adverse, and a reduced delay on M4 East Bound and West Bound Off-Slip which is 
considered Minor beneficial.   
Construction of the Gas Connection  
 The Gas Connection is predicted to cause Minor adverse effects from increased HGV weekday 
movements at Link 1, and Moderate effects on footpaths due to temporary closures and pedestrian 
experience during construction. Effects to driver delay, Accidents and Safety and Weekday Hour are to 
be confirmed in the DCO Application. 
Construction of the Electrical Connection  
 The effect on footpaths during the construction of the Electrical Connection is expected to be 
Moderate due to temporary closures and pedestrian experience, which is considered significant. 
Effects to driver delay, Accidents and Safety and Weekday Hour are to be confirmed in the DCO 
Application.  
Historic Environment 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant 
 Construction of the Power Generation Plant will not have a physical impact on any known historic 
asset. No known historic assets exist within its footprint. Therefore this is a Negligible effect.  
Construction of the Gas Connection  
 Construction of the Gas Connection will not have a significant physical impact on any known historic 
asset, with the exception of where the Gas Pipeline crosses a small percentage of a historic boundary 
(feature reference AB03), therefore requiring its removal. As this feature was already substantially 
altered when the preceding Oil Pipeline was installed, it is considered that little of the original historic 
fabric remains.

Residual Effect 
 The Gas Connection will also run parallel to a second historic boundary (feature reference AB04), 
which coincides with the western limit of the Project Site boundary. However, a Negligible effect is 
anticipated due to the proximity of the Gas Pipeline to the historic boundary of approximately 25 m. 
Construction of the Electrical Connection 
 Construction of the Electrical Connection will not have a physical impact on any known historic asset. 
No known historic assets exist within its footprint. Therefore this is a Negligible effect.  
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 Given the intervening landscape has been significantly developed, it is not anticipated that the 
Conservation Area, Park and Garden and Listed Buildings will be adversely affected by the Project.  
 It is anticipated that Project may be visible to the Scheduled Ancient Monument (Mynydd Pysodlyn 
Round Barrow) and therefore is considered to have a Minor adverse effect on the basis of its High 
value sensitivity. However this is not significant.  
Socio-Economics 
Construction of the Project  
 The construction of all components of the Project is predicted to have little to no adverse impacts on 
tourism, business, and communities during construction. The National Route 43 is likely to experience 
Minor Adverse effects during construction, and is therefore not considered significant. 
Operation of the Project 
 During the Operational Phase, of all components of the Project is predicted to have little to no adverse 
impacts on tourism, business, and communities. The National Route 43 is likely to experience Minor 
Adverse effects during construction, and is therefore not considered significant. The Project as a 
whole is expected to have Minor adverse effect on community Infrastructure receptors.
