Appendix 14.1 Socio-economic Technical Baseline
The socio-economic profile sets a context for the assessment and highlights key
socio-economic issues.  The indicators are also used to determine the overall
sensitivity of the labour market (socio-economic receptor).
As indicated in Table 14.8, all areas have experienced population increases since
2001, a trend which is expected to continue to 2035.  Over the same period the
population of the UK has increased and is expected to rise further at a greater rate
than the local area, wider area and wider region. The local area population is
expected to grow at a lower rate in the future than that experienced between 2001
and 2017.  Population growth in the wider area and wider region is expected be
below that of the UK.
Across the local area, wider area, wider region and
comparator area, household growth is expected to exceed population growth (See
Figure 14.1).

Current population data indicates that the proportion of potentially economically
inactive residents (i.e. those aged between 0-16 and over 65) make up 36% of the
population locally. This is consistent with the wider area and UK average.
Projections for the region indicate that there will be a reduction in the working age
population and increases in their dependency ratio1 which is likely to put additional
pressure on services in the local and wider areas and wider region.  By 2035 nearly
a quarter of the regional population2 is expected to be of retirement age.  This is
greater than the projected UK average.
Table 14.9 below sets out the age structure in the vicinity of the Project Site.

Age band projections are not available for the local area. However, projections for
the administrative areas (i.e. the county of Swansea and the West Wales region)
coinciding with the study area indicates a reduction in the working age population
between 2017 and 2035. This is shown in Table 14.10.
1 The dependency ratio (or proportion of working age people) is significant as it measures the relationship between the
productive element of a population and the economically dependent. In Swansea there is to be a reduction in the
proportion of working age population from 63% to 62%. In West Wales, it will decrease from 62% to 58%.
2 Age band projections not available on local level. Experian estimate that the proportion of residents at retirement age will
be 24% in Swansea and 28% in West Wales

The local area, wider area and wider region are all characterised by marginally
lower levels of unemployment compared to the national average. However, each
area has a higher proportion of people who are permanently sick/disabled than the
UK average. This is summarised in Table 14.12.
3 The economic activity rate measures the percentage of the population, both in employment and unemployed that
represent the labour supply regardless of their labour status.   The figure represents the degree of success of the area in
engaging people in productive activity.

The primary industries of employment in the local area include retail, human health
and social work, education, and public administration/defence. Together these
industries account for just over half of local employment. This is comparable to the
wider area and wider region but higher than UK levels.
Construction and
manufacturing employment accounts for almost a fifth of all jobs in the study area.
These industries make up a higher proportion of employment than in the UK. This
is summarised in Table 14.13.

Location Quotients for the Study Area shows how they differ in relation to national
averages for employment.4 On this measure, the local area, wider area and wider
region have particular concentrations in public administration/defence and water
supply, sewerage, waste management & remediation. The local and wider area
also indicates the importance of mining and quarrying, owing to proximity to sites at
Felindre, Caerbont, Merthyr Tydfil, and Aberdare.
4 The Location Quotient quantifies the concentration of an industry in a geographical area compared to a wider reference
area. A value of ‘1’ indicates parity in terms of the proportion of jobs in that industry compared to the national average,
whilst the values below/above indicate a smaller/greater proportion of local jobs in that industry compared to the national
average.

National Readership Survey (NRS) social grades are a system of demographic
classification widely used in market research5.  The NRS social grades provide an
insight into the skills profile of a population.
As shown in Table 14.14, the local area, wider area and wider region each have a
lower than average proportion of people in the highest and second highest social
grades (AB and C1). Each area also has a higher proportion of people in the lowest
social grades (DE). The wider region is slightly more skilled than the immediate
local area.

In summary, the socio-economic study area exhibits some characteristics
consistent with a low sensitivity labour market (i.e. increasing population and above
average levels of construction and electricity and gas workers).
It is unlikely that the Project will lead to undue labour market pressure or distortions
(i.e. wage inflation, skills and capacity shortages, import of labour).

Appendix 14.2 Tourism Business Survey
This analysis summarises the key findings from the local tourism business survey
carried out during November and December 2014. The survey population included
all businesses which could be considered to derive part of or all of their trade from
tourism within the defined study area.  The study area was selected as it was
considered unlikely that tourism businesses located outside this would experience
either beneficial or adverse impacts (tourism study area described at paragraph
14.5.2).
The analysis provides a detailed understanding of the potential impacts perceived
by businesses as a result of the Project. Businesses were identified mainly through
internet searches12 with 58 tourism related businesses identified.  The survey had a
response rate of 29%.

Number of Employees
The average number of employees was eight indicating the majority of businesses
are small scale.
Customer base
Figure 14.3 Type of Customer
Over half of the respondent’s trade comes from local customers.  Over a tenth of
trade is from business visitors.  Around a quarter of trade comes from tourists and
leisure visitors.  This suggests that respondent businesses are less reliant on
tourist/visitor trade within the study area.

No business reported that they felt that their business would decline.
Business trends
Respondents were asked to comment on the factors influencing business trends.
The most frequently mentioned were weather and reputation.   Other important
factors mentioned included product, price and value for money.
Occupancy rate
Accommodation business respondents were asked about their occupancy rate
during the peak and off peak season.  Only two respondents answered this
question reporting average peak season occupancy of 100% and an average off-
peak figure of 78%.
Business Survey: Baseline conclusion
Of the 58 businesses surveyed, 17 responded to the tourism business survey
questionnaire, giving a 29% response rate.
A high proportion of responses were from businesses located in Pontardawe and
Bryncoch.   A number of the businesses were small in size.
The highest proportion of responses was from bars and pubs. The survey identified
that a high proportion of trade was from local customers. The origins tourist/visitor
customers were mainly from the UK.
The main activities customers participated in when visiting the area were going on
long and short walks, as well as sightseeing.
The majority of businesses considered that their business performance had been
increasing over the last three years. Current levels of satisfaction were high, with all
respondents reporting trade as being fair or good. Respondents were also

Weather, reputation, product, price and value for money were deemed to be the
most influential factors impacting upon business trends.
Tourism Business Survey – Impact Analysis
This section analyses the business survey responses in terms of perceived impact
on business performance and the wider South-West Wales tourism product13.
Figure 14.8 Perceived Impacts of Project on business performance
All 17 respondents provided an answer as to what impact they felt the Project
would have on their business.  The vast majority of respondents considered that it
would have no impact on their business.  A number of these respondents
considered that the Project was too far away from their business to affect them
directly.  Others stated that they didn’t get many tourists as the area is not on the
tourist trail.
Three respondents suggested that the Project could have varying degrees of
beneficial impact on their business performance.  These businesses felt they could
benefit from accommodating construction workers, with one business claiming that
they had a positive experience of workers staying for other construction projects.
Only one business considered the Project would have an adverse impact on their
business. The main reason given for this response was the potential visual impact
of the Project. The respondent also had concerns over potential traffic congestion
issues as other energy infrastructure projects e.g. the nearby solar project have
caused disruption previously.
13 Impacts were categorised as follows: Low Impact (<10 %); Medium Impact (10-15 %); and High Impact (>15 %). The definitions of
magnitude - Major adverse taken as >15% on business turnover, Moderate adverse taken as 10-14%, and Minor adverse taken as <10%
- are based on market experience (Criteria outlined in methodology section).

Figure 14.9 Perceived Impacts of Project on South-West Wales Tourism
Businesses were also asked to indicate what they expected the impact might be on
South-Wales tourism in general. Over two-thirds of respondents considered that it
would have no impact on tourism and visitor numbers, with a further 15%
considering any adverse impact to be low or minimal.
One respondent perceived there to be a medium adverse impact (located in
Pontardawe), whilst another respondent located in Felindre predicted a high
adverse impact. Concerns raised by respondents primarily related to potential
visual impacts.  Other concerns related to potential air quality and traffic impacts.
One respondent felt that there was already too much energy infrastructure in the
area.
Duration of Adverse Effects
Of those respondents who considered there to be adverse impacts half felt the
impacts would last for the life of the Project.  The other half felt that adverse
impacts would be experienced during both the construction and operation of the
Project.
Duration of Beneficial Effects

Conclusion
In terms of impact, the vast majority of respondents felt that the Project would have
no impact on business performance.  Some businesses felt that they would benefit
at the construction phase through related demand for accommodation, food and
drink and other services.
Only one respondent predicted an adverse impact on business performance based
mainly on perceived adverse visual impact.
The majority of respondents felt that the Project would have either no or low
adverse impact on tourism in South Wales.  Less than a fifth expected the impact to
be either medium or high adverse, with visual impact and potential traffic
congestion (during construction) cited as the main factors.
Overall, the business survey analysis has shown that a number of accommodation
providers, food and drink and other similar businesses in the study area are not
reliant on tourism trade and are reporting high/increasing business confidence.
The vast majority of respondents do not predict any significantly adverse impact on
either their own business performance or the wider South-West Wales tourism
offer.
The magnitude of change as perceived by the respondents to the business survey
is assessed as being minor.
The potential effect of the Project on tourism businesses in the area is assessed as
being of slight significance, given the low sensitivity of the area in tourism terms
and the minor magnitude of change.  This assessment is derived from the
methodology set out in Table 14.8.
