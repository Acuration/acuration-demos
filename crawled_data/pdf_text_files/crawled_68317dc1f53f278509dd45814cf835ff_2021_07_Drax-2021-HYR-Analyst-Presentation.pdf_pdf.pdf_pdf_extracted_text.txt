Forward Looking Statements
29 July 2021
This presentation may contain certain statements, expectations, statistics, projections and other information that are or maybe forward-looking. The accuracy 
and completeness of all such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial position, strategy, projected costs, plans, 
beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc ("Drax") and its subsidiaries (the "Group"),including the integration of 
Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc (“Pinnacle”) as part of Drax, are not warranted or guaranteed. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. Although Drax believes that the statements, 
expectations, statistics and projections and other information reflected in such statements are reasonable, they reflect Drax’s current view and no assurance 
can be given that they will prove to be correct. Such events and statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially 
from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Group, 
which could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These include, 
but are not limited to, factors such as: future revenues being lower than expected; increasing competitive pressures in the industry; target dates for the 
commissioning of plants not being achieved, the expected returns from the acquisition of Pinnacle not being fully realised (for example due to one or more 
risks as identified in the circular issued to shareholders in connection with the acquisition arising) capital investments being delayed and/or general economic 
conditions or conditions affecting the relevant industry, both domestically and internationally, being less favourable than expected. We do not intend to 
publicly update or revise these projections or other forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, and we do not 
assume any responsibility for doing so.

Biomass Has A Critical Role to Play in the Fight Against Climate Change
Drax is a world leader in sustainable biomass

UK – bioenergy could double to meet 
15% of UK’s primary energy demand 
by 2050
Europe – bioenergy to grow by 70% 
between 2030 and 2050 to deliver 
negative emissions and BECCS a part of 
every EU scenario that reaches net 
zero by 2050
Japan – biomass power capacity to 
double from 4GW to 8GW by 2030
Sustainable biomass and BECCS 
internationally recognised as 
critical to decarbonisation
UK – Energy White Paper and 10-point 
plan reiterated commitments to 
sustainable biomass and BECCS
Europe – biomass support to continue 
through REDIII with emphasis on 
BECCS
Japan – new energy plan expected to 
include higher bioenergy use and 
ambitious new climate targets
Clear international accounting policy 
under UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change – reaffirmed in 2019
International policy 
developments support 
sustainable biomass sourcing
Uses of low-grade residuals, sawdust, 
thinnings, branches, tops and other 
low-grade wood, which have limited 
alternative markets and is often 
considered waste
Independent Advisory Board and 
external audit and certification of all 
biomass 
Drax is a world leader in the 
use of sustainable biomass
US Southeast – carbon stocks 
increased >90% since 1950
Canada – primarily sourced from 
highly regulated Crown land based on 
annual allowable cut
Healthy managed forests 
support biodiversity, prevent 
disease and wild fires
“Without biomass, we’re not 
going to make it. We need 
biomass in the mix, but we need 
the right biomass in the mix”
“Biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of 
applications in which it can be used as a substitute for fossil-fuel based 
products and activities, from power generation to hydrogen production 
and even new forms of plastics. Along with its ability to deliver negative 
emissions, this makes biomass one of our most valuable tools for 
reaching net zero emissions.”

suppliers verified and audited against

Global Need for Biomass and BECCS 
Potential for significant global demand for sustainable biomass to support negative emission from BECCS
Research by Coalition for Negative Emissions shows potential for 2 to 4bn tonnes of negative emissions from BECCS by 2030
Coalition for Negative Emissions Report
Current pipeline of negative emissions projects insufficient
-
Scale of action required by 2050 will be profound
-
BECCS, DACS and natural climate solutions have a role
Total sustainable global market potential for BECCS
-
2 to 4bn tonnes of negative emissions by 2030
Effective cost of negative emissions using BECCS(1)
-
Current - £225 to £90/tonne
-
At scale - £145 to £45/tonne
2-4bn tonnes = 500-1,000 4Mt BECCS plants 
or 1 in 3 of today’s global at-scale coal plants converted
1.
Effective cost subtracts non-CO2 outputs, e.g., wood for certain NCS, power for BECCS on power

UK Energy White Paper
Description of biomass and BECCS
42
By 2022, we will establish the role which BECCS can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy 
and, as part of a wider biomass strategy, set out how the technology could be deployed. Biomass is unique 
amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of applications in which it can be used as a substitute for 
fossil-fuel based products and activities, from power generation to hydrogen production and even new 
forms of plastics. Along with its ability to deliver negative emissions, this makes biomass one of our most 
valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions.
In the government’s response to Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) latest annual progress report to 
Parliament, we announced that we will publish a new Biomass Strategy in 2022. As part of this strategy, we 
will set out the results of a review of the amount of sustainable biomass available to the UK, and how this 
resource could be best utilised across the economy to help achieve our net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
target by 2050.
Our review will assess the UK’s current biomass sustainability standards, which are already some of the world’s 
most stringent, to see where and how we can improve them even further. Our review will also consider the role 
biomass can play in delivering our wider environmental targets, including on air quality. We will shortly issue a 
call for evidence: ‘Biomass for net zero’, to inform the development of our strategy. We will issue a preliminary 
position paper by summer 2021, once the evidence has been reviewed. Critical to our consideration will be 
the role of BECCS in our energy system. BECCS plants could deliver negative emissions, by capturing the 
carbon released during biomass combustion, gasification and other processes, provided supply chain emissions 
are sufficiently low. There are a number of applications for BECCS across the economy, including clean 
hydrogen production, power generation, waste management and in heat for industrial processes and we need 
to ensure that it is deployed where it has the greatest value in reducing emissions. For example, current 
support for electricity generation, which converted from coal to using biomass as a fuel source, expires in 
2027. BECCS could provide a long-term future for this capacity
p.53, UK Energy White Paper, December 2020
Supports increased use of bioenergy as part of European Commission’s strong environmental mandate
In July 2021 the European Commission published its “fit for 55” package of proposals 
-
Package is designed to put in place the policies required for the EU to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Almost all of the EU’s key climate 
legislation has been revised, including REDIII, the EU ETS, the Energy Taxation Directive, LULUCF and a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) has been 
introduced
Biomass and BECCS central to Commission plans
-
Commission forecasts 70% increase in biomass to supply BECCS out to 2050, and substitute coal in coal-dependent regions
-
Carbon CfD introduced in EU ETS package to support the scaling up of BECCS 
-
c.€32bn Innovation Fund in EU ETS to support technologies such as BECCS with capital expenditure and operating expenditure
-
c.€19bn Euro fund in EU ETS to support lower income Member States move away coal to renewables, such as biomass 
-
2023 ‘negative emission regulation’ will support market certainty for BECCS 
Renewable Energy Directive III
-
REDII takes full account of biomass sustainability and is aligned with EU Taxonomy rules
-
Expect REDIII to take several years to develop
-
Key initial observations
-
Eligibility criteria – supports development of BECCS and coal conversions 
-
From 2026 all existing and new subsidy for forest biomass to be focused on a just transition area (i.e. coal dependent region) or BECCS
-
Development of cascade principle to ensure best use of forestry material and only low-grade materials are used for biomass
-
Sustainability criteria – forest biomass may not be sourced from primary forests, wetland or peatland
