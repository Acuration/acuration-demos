Introduction and statement approval
At Drax, we strive to do the right thing, seeking to make a positive contribution 
to society as we also work toward achieving our purpose of enabling a zero 
carbon, lower cost energy future . Our business strategy is supported by three 
pillars of being People Positive, Nature Positive and Climate Positive . 
Our People Positive strategy sets out how we seek to meet our People Positive 
commitments . You can read more about the strategy in the ‘Our People’ section 
of this Statement and in our Annual Report . 
In conjunction with our People Positive strategy, our respect for human rights 
forms part of our Values (see page 5) and our Group Policy Framework . We 
believe that everyone at Drax should be paid fairly, work freely, and have good 
working conditions .
We have established a Supply Chain Human Rights (‘SCHR’) programme 
focused on identifying the risk of human rights abuses within our supply chain . 
This programme considers modern slavery as well as attentiveness to the 
potential for wider abuses and welfare matters .
In this, our seventh Modern Slavery Statement, we outline the SCHR 
programme progress we have made in 2022, and our focus for 2023 . We 
are making this Statement for the financial year ended December 2022 
in accordance with the requirements of section 54, part 6, of the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 . This Statement applies to all companies within Drax Group 
(‘Drax’) that are required to publish a Statement, as listed in the ‘Statement 
Scope’ section .
The Board has reviewed, approved, and adopted this statement . I signed it on 
behalf of the Board of Directors of Drax Group plc, following its approval on 21 
February 2023 .
Dwight Daniel Willard Gardiner (known as Will Gardiner) 
CEO, Drax Group plc

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Our progress
In 2022, we committed to moving forward on several deliverables and a summary of our progress is provided in the table below and overleaf .
Section 
What we said we’d do in 2022:
What we did:
Governance 
Continue our plan to carry out annual reviews of the Drax Code 
of Conduct (‘Drax Code’) and Supplier Code of Conduct (‘Supplier 
Code’) . Ensure any amendments are subject to Ethics and 
Business Conduct Committee (EBCC) approval .  
The EBCC reviewed and approved the Drax Code and Supplier Code, and we republished them in 
September and October 2022 respectively .
Continue to report to the EBCC  on the activity of the Supply 
Chain Human Rights Working Group (SCHR WG) . 
Quarterly reporting to the EBCC on the activities of the SCHR WG continued throughout 2022 . 
Explore upstream, post-contract diligence and supplier 
compliance support in higher risk jurisdictions .  
The EBCC approved our updated approach to customer due diligence in its Q3 2022 meeting .
As a test case for our proposed Force for Good activities, we’ve been working closely with a 
Vietnamese supplier to strengthen standards . This included the development of an agreed workplan, 
regular check ins and completion (by a third party) of a Sustainability and Social Audit in June 2022 . It 
also included a follow up visit from our Sustainability and Business Ethics teams in November 2022, 
and sharing of procedural documents and training materials . Engagement with the supplier is ongoing .
Risk Assessment 
Implement additional tools to strengthen the risk assessment 
process, as deemed appropriate by the EBCC  .
In July 2022, the EBCC approved a new, consolidated country risk rating against which supplier risk is 
assessed . At the Q3 2022 meeting, the EBCC approved a mandatory requirement for Environmental 
and Social Impact Assessments in relation to assessing the acquisition of assets or businesses .
Due Diligence 
Carry out a supplier assurance audit of our Vietnamese 
supply chain  .
Following a third-party completed the audit (in June 2022)  our Sustainability and Business Ethics 
teams did a follow up visit to Vietnam in November 2022  . A workplan to address suggested 
improvements is in place and is being progressed through regular check ins (via Teams)  . Further site 
visits across the Drax supply chain are planned for 2023 .
Reflect the Social Responsibility Alliance’s ‘Slavery and 
Trafficking Risk Template’ (STRT) in our own due diligence 
questions (where we’ve identified gaps)  .
The STRT review was completed in September 2022 and questions added to the Drax Ethical Due 
Diligence questionnaire, as necessary . The questionnaire is deployed to new third parties, as applicable 
(with refresh requirements for higher risk third parties) .
Implement across Drax  a more coordinated and holistic 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) approach to due 
diligence and audit . 
We have started work on improving the robustness of our supplier onboarding approach . This includes 
ensuring that our teams which are contributing to the process have clear responsibilities .
Complete the project to provide a geographical representation of 
our supply chains  .
Work continues in providing a graphical representation of our supply chains, with further activity 
planned to make these publicly available .

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Policies and procedures 
Continue with our annual review cycle of the Codes of Conduct 
and the Human Rights policy  .
See above, regarding our Codes of Conduct . In addition, we reviewed, enhanced, approved and 
republished our Human Rights policy in 2022; it continues to be available externally on drax.com .
Implement an enduring due diligence process for Northern 
Operations’ (formerly Pinnacle) customers, as well as First 
Nations, Joint Ventures (JVs), and suppliers  .
At its Q3 2022 meeting, the EBCC approved an ethical due diligence process for our Northern 
Operations’ customers and First Nations groups . The proposal for JVs was presented and approved at 
the Q4 2022 meeting (in January 2023) . 
Employment practices 
Identify other Drax UK suppliers that may pay below the real 
Living Wage and agree milestones for when they can put it 
in place  .
In 2022, we identified those in-scope Drax UK suppliers who pay below the real Living Wage and are in 
the process of agreeing milestones with them to complete the accreditation process .
Supplier Contracts 
Finalise the implementation of our Supplier Code for new 
agreements with third parties, or at the point of renewal/
extension for existing agreements  .
We continued to integrate the Supplier Code into relevant new agreements and at the point of 
renewal/extension for existing agreements with third parties . 
Consider adding further detail about our non-fuel procurement 
activities to the Responsible Sourcing section of our website . 
Our Procurement team implemented a new Global Procurement policy during Q4 2022 . Over the 
course of 2023, the team will work towards implementing a Supplier Management Framework to 
support the policy (including Responsible Sourcing content for the website) .
Implement the new standard business ethics clauses 
(incorporating the Supplier Code) into our Northern Operations’ 
procurement practices  .
We have developed Standard Business Ethics clauses for Northern Operations (in Canada - Former 
Pinnacle) and are incorporating them into relevant contracts .
Training 
Arrange a launch day in relation to our collaboration with AW 
Jenkinson, to further increase awareness of the UK’s Modern 
Slavery and Exploitation helpline  .
The launch day went ahead in March 2022 . Representatives from Drax, AW Jenkinson, Associated 
British Ports, Unseen UK, and the Humber Modern Slavery Partnership (see ‘Our awareness and 
training’ section below) all attended .
Consider additional, tailored training for our ‘at higher risk’ teams . 
We furthered our association with Unseen UK by committing to ensure those in our teams working 
in sectors, territories or with potential third parties each of which could be deemed ‘at higher risk’ use 
its eLearning material to increase awareness amongst our colleagues of modern slavery indicators  . 
Amendments are being made to the module ahead of deployment in Q1 2023  .
 Issue further awareness-raising articles to existing colleagues 
and Non-Permanent Workers (‘NPWs’)   .
 We shared various communications with colleagues during 2022 relating to modern slavery 
and supply chain wellbeing issues  . These included targeted communications regarding the 
aforementioned UK Modern Slavery and Exploitation helpline launch day, Anti-Slavery Day, and a 
Mission to Seafarers initiative .
Speak up culture 
Continue our Speak Up awareness-raising campaign  .
During 2022, we continued to raise awareness of our Speak Up programme via various internal 
communications and training, re-published and promoted our updated ‘Speak Up Guidance 
for Managers’ in October .
Working together 
Continue our work with both the UN Global Compact and 
Unseen UK  .
We have continued our participation in the UN Global Compact’s Modern Slavery Working Group over 
the course of 2022, feeding back key information to the Drax Supply Chain Human Rights Working 
Group . In addition, we participated in the Utilities Against Slavery Steering and Working Groups .
Explore other potential partnerships, including the Humber 
Modern Slavery Partnership (HMSP), and add associated 
services to our toolkit, as required  .
We have continued to provide financial support to the UK’s Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline 
(operated by Unseen UK) .  We presented our SCHR programme structure to the HMSP in Q1 2022 
and HMSP representatives attended the launch day relating to our collaboration with AW Jenkinson . 
Additionally, in Q4 2022, we commenced working with The Mission to Seafarers (see ‘Our awareness 
and training’ section for further details) .

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Our business
Generation
Our portfolio of flexible, low-carbon and 
renewable UK power assets – biomass, 
hydro, and pumped storage generation 
– provides renewable, dispatchable 
power and system support services to 
the electricity grid .
Our dispatchable power has a vital role 
to play in enabling the transition to more 
renewable energy and a more flexible 
energy system: generating renewable 
electricity when the sun doesn’t shine 
and the wind doesn’t blow .
We are the UK’s largest source of 
renewable power by output, and Drax 
Power Station is the UK’s largest single 
source of renewable electricity by 
output . Our portfolio provides long-term 
earnings stability and opportunities to 
optimise returns from the transition to a 
low-carbon economy .
We are developing options for BECCS 
at Drax Power Station in the UK and 
exploring options for global BECCS .
Customers
Our Customers business 
is principally focused on 
renewable electricity sales 
to industrial and corporate 
customers in the UK .
The business also offers 
non-generation system 
support and energy 
management services, 
such as the provision 
of decarbonization 
services, including vehicle 
fleet electrification . It 
also provides a route 
to market for many 
smaller embedded                    
renewable generators . 
Pellet Production
The material we use to make pellets 
includes sawmill and forest residuals, 
and low grade roundwood, material of a 
lower grade which is unsuitable for use 
in a sawmill . They provide a sustainable, 
low carbon fuel source that can be 
safely and efficiently delivered through 
our global supply chain .
The forests we source our biomass 
from are managed in accordance with 
standards designed to support the 
health and growth of these forests 
over the long term . Based in the US 
south and in Western Canada, we have 
17 operational and development sites 
with nameplate capacity of around 5Mt 
once expansions are complete .
We have US$4 .1bn of long-term 
contracted sales to third parties across 
Asia and Europe . Our Generation 
business also uses pellets sourced 
from our Pellet Production sites to 
make flexible, renewable electricity for 
the UK .
Our purpose: 
To enable a zero carbon,           
lower cost energy future
Our ambition:
To be carbon negative by 2030
Our strategic aims: 
To be a global leader in             
carbon removals
To be a global leader in 
sustainable biomass
To be a UK leader                        
in dispatchable,                    
renewable power
Our values: 
We care about what matters
We’re a can-do kind of place
We see things differently
We listen carefully
We do what we say we’ll do

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Our people
As at the end of December 2022 we employed around 
3,200 people across the UK, North America, and Japan. Our 
colleagues are at the heart of our success and are key enablers 
of our business strategy and our ethical, inclusive culture.
People Positive strategy
People Positive: We aim to be a responsible business partner and neighbour 
in the supply chains and communities in which we operate, conducting 
our business with honesty, integrity and respect . We seek to engage 
stakeholders proactively and focus on delivering positive impacts regarding 
health, safety, the environment and human rights for the workers and 
communities linked to our operations .
Our People Positive strategy encompasses a wide range of the various aspects 
of a colleague’s experience at Drax, including the systems we use, our policies, 
our values, and our culture . There are more details about this strategy in our 2022 
Annual Report, available at drax.com . 
In 2022, we recognised the impact upon our colleagues’ wellbeing of the cost of 
living . To help provide additional support, we introduced a new financial wellbeing 
partner, Nudge, offering personalised, online financial wellbeing hints and tips . 
In addition, we worked with Nudge to provide seminars, including how to better 
manage the effects of the cost of living and we brought forward the annual pay 
review date to 1 January (from 1 April) to help colleagues . We also continued to 
educate and raise awareness of the non-financial wellbeing support that’s on 
offer through our benefits providers and learning resources . And in the UK, we 
increased the number of qualified Mental Health First Aiders at our sites .  
Work also began to create effective and efficient frameworks, policies and 
working practices that ensure simplicity, autonomy and ownership of people 
matters across the Group . Our People teams have worked collaboratively on 
projects with internal specialists (e .g . from IT and data science) to provide a better 
colleague experience on key interactions . These include the introduction of new 
benefits and the renewal of existing benefits .  
We have reviewed many of the significant People policies to ensure they met the 
up-to-date needs of our business and colleagues . We also introduced and built 
upon new, inclusive family-friendly policies (e .g . time off for dependents) and a 
Group Bereavement policy .
Our Resourcing strategy underpins our plans for growth, working with colleagues 
across the Group to assess and plan for the near to long term . This has included 
new advertising and engagement strategies to attract, retain and develop 
diverse talent pools that reflect the demographics of the areas in which we 
operate . It’s also included our Strategic Workforce Plan (focused on future 
workforce planning) that will enable us to grow internationally and adapt to 
business changes .

To ensure we provide a safe and healthy workplace for our colleagues, each management 
team regularly reviews local health, safety and environmental (HSE) performance . The 
Group HSE Committee undertakes a Group HSE performance review each quarter . The 
Executive Committee reviews these findings and the CEO also reports on progress at 
each Board meeting . Additionally, Drax Leadership Team monthly meetings commence 
with a ‘safety standout’ where key safety messages are shared .
During 2022, we completed the Group-wide roll-out of a new HSE and Quality IT 
reporting platform . This single system allows more data analysis of incidents, corrective 
actions, hazard management, risk management and behavioural observations . In 2023, 
we will develop dashboards to assess trends to inform areas for action .
We continued to undertake reviews of our reward strategies in each market, with the 
aim that our people are appropriately incentivised, rewarded and recognised for their 
contribution . Such strategies are part of enabling us to create a high performing and 
inclusive culture . Encouraging an inclusive environment continues to be fundamental to 
our people positive approach . 
Our current values continue to provide the framework for our people behaving and acting 
with integrity . However, recognising our ambitious growth strategy and the enhanced 
focus on colleague experience, we have started work to review those values, as part of 
a wider project to build our employee value proposition (EVP) . Our EVP will contribute 
to developing our culture, values and colleague experience framework, to create an 
environment where we recognise the importance of colleague wellbeing and enable 
everyone to contribute in achieving our Group’s strategy .
Encouraging an inclusive environment continues to 
be fundamental to our people positive approach.

Our recruitment processes
Although the risk of modern slavery taking place within 
our business is much lower than we believe is the case 
in our supply chain, we have steps in our recruitment 
procedures designed to address such risks, including:
• 
Carrying out “right to work” checks and ensuring 
that the agencies we use to supply non-permanent 
workers carry out equivalent checks
• 
Completing pre-employment checks to verify the 
identity of prospective colleagues and to ensure 
they’re over 16 years of age
• 
Completing disclosure and barring service checks 
for specific roles to enable us to make safer 
recruitment decisions 
• 
Making sure that an employment contract is in place 
before an individual starts employment in the Group
• 
Paying all our UK-based colleagues at least the real 
Living Wage and reviewing this in Q1 every year to 
ensure any rate changes are captured
• 
Providing information about our Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) policy, reporting channels and 
external service
We have various assurance processes in place to check 
that these steps are effectively applied .
We respect our colleagues’ rights in areas such as freedom of association and collective 
bargaining . Approximately 14% of the Drax UK workforce is covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement . In Canada, 7 .5% of the workforce is covered by collective 
bargaining . There are My Voice Forums enabling a two-way dialogue between members 
of the Board of directors, the senior leadership team and colleagues . We maintain healthy 
relationships with our trade union partners and attend bi-monthly meetings to discuss 
potential issues that may affect members . We also undertake annual negotiations on pay .
We communicate with colleagues, both formally and informally . We use a combination 
of media including emails, our intranet, a quarterly newsletter, and open forum meetings 
involving members of the senior leadership team . Each week, the CEO takes questions 
from across Drax on a wide range of topics and we share his responses with all colleagues . 
We invite colleagues to complete a ‘My Voice’ engagement survey then share the results 
and progress any actions arising . The most recent was undertaken in September 2022 and 
the results shared with employees in December 2022 .

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Our Supply Chain Human Rights programme
Our governance
Our Supply Chain Human Rights Working Group (SCHR WG) is 
responsible for the development of our SCHR programme . It provides 
a quarterly report on its activity to our Ethics and Business Conduct 
Committee (EBCC), which oversees the programme and is a sub-
committee of our Executive Committee . The SCHR WG includes 
representation from the teams across Drax deemed ‘at higher risk’ of 
encountering modern slavery due to the nature of their engagement 
with current and potential partners in our supply chain .
The EBCC:
• 
Is responsible for making sure that Drax takes appropriate steps to 
investigate and remediate the risk of modern slavery, both within our 
own business and our supply chain
• 
Has approved a protocol and remediation plan, that we must follow if 
we discover modern slavery in our business or supply chain
An annual report on EBCC activity and decisions is submitted to our 
Audit Committee, which comprises non-executive directors . In 2022, no 
instances of modern slavery were identified for escalation to EBCC but 
work continues to ensure we understand the potential risks .
We also recognise the risk of modern slavery in our supply chains may 
increase as our operations enter new territories . So, we are developing 
policies and practices and raising awareness that reflects UK standards 
and is informed by good practice . This seeks to ensure we identify 
the potential for modern slavery promptly and establish the tools 
and governance structures required for determining the appropriate 
remedial action .

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Policy
Summary
How it links to modern slavery
Code of Conduct
This Code applies to all employees, non-permanent workers and 
anyone working on behalf of Drax . It sets out our high-level principles 
and the expected standards of behaviour in relation to various topics, 
including modern slavery . It was most recently reviewed in 2022 .
Our Code of Conduct has multiple sections, including those covering: Dignity at Work; 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Anti-corruption and Human Rights . It sets out the Drax 
zero tolerance approach to corruption, as well as detailing our various Speak Up reporting 
channels and approach to non-retaliation .
Supplier Code
This Code sets out the standards we expect of our suppliers and any 
subcontractors they use in relation to supporting Drax activities . It 
forms part of relevant supply contracts, with provisions for termination 
if there’s a serious breach . It was subject to review in 2022, with 
amendments including updated Speak Up contact details and further 
information on the real Living Wage .
This Code mandates that suppliers must: not breach any internationally-proclaimed human 
rights; not engage underage workers or any workers subject to any form of modern slavery; 
comply with all applicable laws in relation to working hours and remuneration; and provide 
a safe and healthy working environment . It also encourages our UK suppliers to pay the real 
Living Wage and provides details of our Speak Up service .
Human Rights 
This policy sets out the human rights standards Drax abides by, and the 
prevention and remediation approach we adopt . 
The policy covers multiple areas including: Safe and healthy workplace; Dignity at Work; 
working hours; wages and benefits (fair pay); Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Collective 
Bargaining and Freedom of Association; forced labour and human trafficking; and 
child labour .
Responsible Sourcing
Our Responsible Sourcing policy includes a commitment to supporting 
people and communities . In 2022, we commenced a review of the 
policy and will publish an update in 2023 .
As part of our Responsible Sourcing commitment we:
• 
Promote respect for human rights including safeguarding the labour rights of workers, 
and not engaging in any form of discrimination, compulsory labour or child labour . 
(i .e . via our due diligence processes, direct supplier engagement, our Supplier Code, 
contractual clauses etc) .
• 
Verify that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect health and safety in forests 
and pellet mills (i .e . through our due diligence processes) .
• 
Use certification schemes/chain of custody processes that aim to deliver traceability on 
both the origin of our biomass and the associated supply chain .
Our policies and procedures
Our Group Policy Framework sets out our high-level principles (in our Codes), our mandatory and standardisation policies and supporting procedures/guidance . We summarise 
below the documents that link to our SCHR programme, some of which are publicly available via drax.com .
12
2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Procurement
This policy aims to standardise our approach and set out clear 
principles, controls, and procedures relating to procuring and/
or contracting with third parties . All Drax Business Units and 
functions must comply with the policy, which also outlines the role of 
Procurement and the engagement with suppliers on behalf of Drax 
globally .   
Our new Global Procurement Policy was issued in Q4 2022 . During 2023, the team will 
focus on training and processes to support the Policy .
Safety, Health 
and Wellbeing
Our combined Group-wide Safety, Health and Wellbeing policy outlines 
our OneSafeDrax vision and our commitment to everyone finishing 
their day of work safe and well .
Our people are at the heart of everything we do, and colleague wellbeing is important to 
our overall success . The Group policy, signed by the Chair of our Board and our CEO, sets 
out what we aim to achieve . Together, we all share responsibility for the safety, health and 
wellbeing of ourselves and our colleagues .
Dignity at Work
Our Group-wide Dignity at Work policy ensures all colleagues 
understand the standards we expect when it comes to respecting 
one another .
The policy outlines expected standards of behaviour, and those which are not tolerated, 
including harassment and victimisation . It also helps colleagues understand what steps they 
can take if they experience such behaviour .
Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion
Our Group-wide DE&I policy ensures all colleagues understand that 
we do not tolerate any form of discrimination, bullying or harassment 
based on identity or background . 
This policy outlines the behaviours we expect from all colleagues and steps which can be 
taken where the experience of colleagues does not meet those standards .
Disciplinary
Our disciplinary policy sets out the standard of conduct we expect from 
our colleagues with the aim of achieving consistency in process and 
approach when dealing with disciplinary issues . 
This policy is clear on the standards of conduct expected and the steps that Drax will take if 
a colleague fails to follow the policy . 
Family Friendly
Our UK wide Family Friendly policies set out what we do to support 
colleagues who are just starting a family, and those already with a 
family, and in need of support (e .g . dependent leave) .
The policies enhance the statutory pay offering and mirror the offering for shared parental 
leave to the enhancements offered for maternity and adoption leave . This ensures all UK 
colleagues have equality when it comes to family friendly leave . 
Speak Up 
(whistleblowing)
Our Speak Up (whistleblowing) policy – and wider programme – 
provides a mechanism for all colleagues, and other people associated 
with Drax, to raise concerns while ensuring protection from 
victimisation or retaliation .
The programme ensures that our colleagues, suppliers, communities and others have a 
means of reporting genuine concerns (including in relation to modern slavery) regarding our 
own business and our supply chain .
13
2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Our due diligence
Country approval
Global rights indices (amongst other 
indices, such as the Corruption 
Perception Index) continue to 
contribute to our country risk 
assessment process . The EBCC must 
assess higher risk countries before Drax 
can conduct business there, and can 
consider blanket country approvals 
or specific contract approvals, or 
refer to the Executive Committee, 
where considered appropriate . Such 
considerations depend on the combined 
commercial interest in that country and 
the level of risk identified with it and/or 
the associated supply chain .
Supplier approval
Proportionate due diligence checks 
are carried out on suppliers and, where 
appropriate, their associated persons 
and supply chain . Should we identify 
concerns during the process, we may 
obtain enhanced due diligence from 
a specialist service provider before 
escalation to the EBCC . The EBCC (or 
Executive Committee) will then decide 
whether to appoint the supplier or not .
Mergers and acquisitions
In 2022, we reviewed and updated 
our ethical due diligence approach to 
ensure its suitability for merger and 
acquisition activity . The EBCC approved 
this revision at its Q3 2022 meeting . Our 
approach to joint venture due diligence 
was developed in Q4 2022 and was 
considered at the EBCC’s meeting held 
in January 2023 . Human rights risks 
are a key focus of any related exercise, 
and we assess potential targets 
against our legal requirements and 
ethical standards .
Due diligence system
We have established an ethical due 
diligence platform for all our business 
units to carry out due diligence . We 
use the platform to perform initial due 
diligence and monitor relevant suppliers 
(escalating red flags to the EBCC as 
necessary) . Our Ethical Due Diligence 
questionnaire has been benchmarked 
against the Social Responsibility 
Alliance’s Slavery and Trafficking Risk 
Template and incorporates appropriate 
content . Via the questionnaire, we 
collect supply chain risk intelligence, 
allowing us to ask for further 
information when one or more elements 
are considered of higher risk . 
Modern slavery instances
In 2022, our due diligence processes did 
not identify instances of modern slavery 
in our supply chain .
Our risk assessment
Due to the controls and practices we’ve adopted, we believe the risk of modern 
slavery in our own business is very low . However, given the increasing variety 
and complexity of the third parties with which we engage  and jurisdictions in 
which we work1, the risk of modern slavery is higher in our supply chain . This 
may further increase as we continue to expand the business into new territories .
Global rights indices also contribute to the risk assessment of potential suppliers . 
Where higher risks are identified during our due diligence process, we escalate 
and pursue enquiries more directly . 
1 We have around 7,000 suppliers across our procurement activities and engage with many different industries 
including forestry, manufacturing, freight and logistics, engineering, construction, IT, and site services. 
Force for Good
In 2022, we established a working ‘Force for Good’ group . The group’s purpose 
is to develop long-term, managed commercial relationships that incentivise the 
development of supply chains to align with our principles at source, and in our 
use of acceptable biomass . Force for Good activities will ensure participation and 
a net positive impact across the communities neighbouring such supply chains .
The ‘Force for Good’ group has been working with an existing biomass supply 
chain in Vietnam to inform the development of a management framework to 
support the concept .  
2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Non-fuel procurement
The adjacent graphic provides statistics on the country of origin of our non-fuel 
procurement activities, by percentage of spend on our tier 1 supply . It shows that 
100% of our spend is with tier 1 suppliers based in countries that we consider are 
lower risk for modern slavery . 
During 2022, our Procurement team continued - as part of its supplier relationship 
management regime - to map our non-fuel supply chain . We identified four 
areas of spend as ‘higher risk’ for modern slavery: smart meters; electric vehicle 
charging; workwear (including personal protective equipment); and construction 
commodities . For these areas, we are developing increased scrutiny of the supply 
chains of the suppliers with whom we have contracted . Throughout 2023, we’ll 
refresh our Supplier Management Framework, enabling us to get to know key 
suppliers better .
In the meantime, our intention is to continue carrying out risk based due diligence 
on all suppliers prior to contracting, including compliance with our Supplier Code 
(or equivalent) . We also endeavour to include contractual obligations with suppliers, 
requesting they comply with our standard and cascade it to their subcontractors . 
Where necessary, we’ll expect to employ the services of specialist audit firms to 
provide additional detail where needed .

Fuel procurement 
The adjacent graphic provides statistics on our fuel 
procurement, by percentage of volume and geography, 
in 2022 . Of those countries listed, we consider Russia 
(included in the ‘Other European’ percentage), Belarus, 
Vietnam, and Brazil to be of higher risk . 
It should be noted that the Russian and Belarussian 
material was procured before the start of the Russia-
Ukraine conflict . We took a decision in the early phase 
of the conflict to cease procurement activity in Russia 
and Belarus .
We carried out additional due diligence on our Vietnamese 
and Brazilian supply chains in 2022 .

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
In 2022, we integrated Northern Operations’ colleagues (in Canada 
- former Pinnacle) into our Group Documentation Framework . This 
included (but was not limited to) mandatory reading of the Code 
of Conduct and our Anti-bribery and Corruption policy . We also 
summarised our Human Rights policy (along with other policies 
related to business ethics) in a ‘Keeping Ethics in Mind’ document . 
Our Speak Up (whistleblowing) policy had been deployed in 2021 .
We deployed our second Code of Conduct refresher eLearning 
module to other colleagues, including modern slavery content . And 
we marked Anti-Slavery Day (18 October) with a communication 
encouraging colleagues to do something to:
• 
Raise their own awareness
• 
Raise the awareness of others 
• 
Support an organisation working on this important issue

Keeping ethics in mind
We explained our involvement in a Mission 
to Seafarers initiative . We provided financial 
and volunteer support to prepare and deliver 
Christmas packages to seafarers in dock at 
Immingham Port . Our aim was to raise the 
profile of the wellbeing challenges faced by 
these essential workers in our supply chain .
Colleagues across the Group wore orange 
on 30 September 2022, the National Day 
of Truth and Reconciliation in Canada . 
This is a day of reflection on the impact of 
the residential school system: to honour 
survivors, their families, and communities, 
and to remember the children who never 
came home .
We held a launch day for an awareness 
raising campaign in collaboration with one 
of our logistics partners, AW Jenkinson . In 
addition to providing financial support to the 
UK’s Modern Slavery & Exploitation Helpline, 
AW Jenkinson displays the helpline details on 
the back of several vehicles it uses . The aim 
for Drax is to help raise general awareness 
of the helpline and connect with anyone 
who may need to use it . During the launch 
day, AW Jenkinson’s drivers were provided 
with information to help them spot modern 
slavery red flags .

2022 Modern Slavery Statement
Our ‘Speak up’ culture 
We encourage all those connected with Drax to challenge 
potentially unethical behaviour and we promote a speak up 
culture . Within Drax, individuals can raise concerns directly 
via their line management, the Group Business Ethics team, 
or Company Secretary (the Whistleblowing Officer for Drax) . 
Alternatively, an independently operated and confidential 
Speak Up helpline and web portal are available (in multiple 
languages) . Third parties to Drax can also raise their concerns 
via the Group Business Ethics team, Whistleblowing Officer, 
or external Speak Up service . Details on how to do this are set 
out in our Supplier Code .
The external reporting service enables reporters to 
anonymously – should they wish – raise concerns relating 
to Drax . The service forwards any issues raised to the Group 
Business Ethics team and/or the Whistleblowing Officer (in 
accordance with the reporter’s anonymity preference) and 
the recipient(s) will acknowledge, assess, and investigate as 
appropriate . The Group Business Ethics team/Whistleblowing 
Officer will report concerns raised, the status of any 
investigation and any recommended remediation measures . 
Such reports go to the EBCC, the Board, the Audit Committee 
and, where appropriate, the relevant authorities .
It is against our values to punish (or otherwise retaliate against) 
anyone raising a matter under our Speak Up Policy .
No concerns relating to modern slavery were raised through 
our reporting channels in 2022 .

Working together
Organisation
Summary of activity
Sustainable Biomass Program
In 2013, Drax co-founded – with six other energy companies – the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) . The SBP is a certification system 
for woody biomass (mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips) used in industrial, large-scale production of biomass for electricity 
generation . The SBP proactively encourages the adoption of standards and due diligence processes, which include the promotion of 
human rights . For suppliers to be approved under the certification scheme, they must satisfy multiple requirements, including those 
aligned with modern slavery due diligence . Further information on this programme is available on the SBP website .
UN Global Compact
Since 2018, we have been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a voluntary corporate sustainability initiative that 
encourages businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible practices . There’s further information about the UNGC 
on its website . Our Annual Report forms our yearly ‘communication on progress’, set against the UNGC’s Ten Principles on human rights, 
labour, environment, and anti-corruption, and on actions to support the Sustainable Development Goals . As a member of the UNGC 
Modern Slavery Working Group, we are able to collaborate with peers, developing and enhancing our approach to addressing the risks of 
modern slavery .
Unseen UK
Unseen UK is a charity providing independent support for survivors of trafficking and modern slavery; it runs the UK Modern Slavery and 
Exploitation Helpline . It provides free, independent, information and advice 24/7 to potential victims, businesses, the public and statutory 
agencies . In 2022, we continued to provide financial support for the operation of the helpline and furthered our association with Unseen 
UK . A key commitment was to use its eLearning material to increase the awareness of modern slavery across our ‘at higher risk’ teams . 
Amendments are being made to the module ahead of deployment in Q1 2023 .
Slave Free Alliance
We are members of the ‘Utilities Against Slavery’ steering and working groups . These forums enable utility service providers to discuss 
areas of mutual concern and share ideas on ways to combat modern slavery . The purpose of the working group, which meets 6-weekly, 
is to raise awareness and prevent the exploitation of workers and the community, to share best practice amongst members and to 
collaborate and produce a coordinated response to reducing risks in supply chains . 
In 2023, we intend to engage Slave Free Alliance (an international social enterprise, owned by global anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice) 
to carry out a gap analysis of our SCHR programme .
The Mission to Seafarers
In November 2022, the Mission to Seafarers attended our SCHR WG to inform members (and colleagues from our UK based logistics 
team) about its important work . We are keen to grow our association and, in December 2022, we brought together three of our suppliers 
to provide financial and volunteer to support the Mission . This involved the packing and delivery of Christmas parcels to seafarers in dock 
at Immingham Port (in the UK) . We want to do more for the wellbeing of these essential workers in our supply chain and are seeking 
volunteer opportunities to extend these types of activities to our non-UK operations in 2023 . 
Wider stakeholder engagement
Like many international businesses, our global activities affect a diverse group of stakeholders . 
We maintain a detailed map of internal and external stakeholders . This enables us to assess how the stakeholder landscape is developing, 
and to recognise and respond to the expectations of a wide range of them, This ensures we consider their interests in our decision-making .
Modern slavery registries
In 2022, we published our statement on the government’s new registry .
We participate in several working groups designed to bring about positive change on a larger scale . We also collaborate with 
other organisations and bodies to promote the awareness of modern slavery and other supply chain human rights issues .
