Electrical Connection 
Electrical Connection  
A new electrical connection to 
export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the 
NETS comprising an 
underground double circuit 
Tee-in. This would require one 
new tower (which will replace 
an existing tower and be 
located in the existing 
Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, 
thereby resulting in no net 
additional towers). This option 
would require two SECs, one 
located on each side of the 
existing transmission line, and 
both circuits would then be 
connected via underground 
cables approximately 500 
metres in length to the 
Substation.

SUMMARY  
1.1 
This Statement of Reasons relates to the DCO Application by Millbrook Power 
Limited ("MPL") to the Secretary of State under the PA 2008 for powers to 
construct, operate and maintain: 
1.1.1 
the Power Generation Plant, located primarily on land within 
the former clay pits known as "The Rookery", Marston Vale 
Bedfordshire; 
1.1.2 
the Gas Connection; and  
1.1.3 
the Electrical Connection.  
1.2 
This Statement explains why it is necessary, proportionate and justifiable for 
the Development Consent Order (“DCO”) contained within the DCO 
Application to include compulsory acquisition powers, and why there is a 
compelling case in the public interest for MPL to be granted these powers.  
1.3 
MPL has had regard to the provisions of the PA 2008 and advice and 
guidance issued in relation to the PA 2008 in promoting its DCO. 
1.4 
The matters addressed in this Statement are summarised in this section. 
References to numbered sections or paragraphs are to sections or paragraphs 
of this Statement.  
Powers of Compulsory Acquisition under the Planning Act 2008 (Section 
3) 
1.5 
Section 120 of the PA 2008 provides that an order granting development 
consent may make provision relating to, or to matters ancillary to, the 
development for which consent is granted. Schedule 5 to the PA 2008 lists the 
matters ancillary to the development, which includes the acquisition of land, 
compulsorily or by agreement, and the creation, suspension or extinguishment 
of, or interference with, interests in or rights over land, compulsorily or by 
agreement.  
1.6 
Section 122 of the PA 2008 provides that an order granting development 
consent may include provision authorising the compulsory acquisition of land 
only if the Secretary of State, in respect of the Application, is satisfied that (of 
relevance to the Project) the land is required for the development to which the 
DCO relates and the land is required to facilitate or is incidental to that 
development.  
1.7 
Further, it is also necessary for the Secretary of State to be satisfied, in 
relation to the DCO Application, that there is a compelling case in the public 
interest for the inclusion of powers of compulsory acquisition in the DCO. 
Scheme Details (Sections 2 and 4) 
1.8 
MPL is seeking to develop a gas fired power station, electrical connection and 
gas connection at The Rookery, near Stewartby in the Marston Vale, 
Bedfordshire.

1.9 
The Power Generation Plant at The Rookery would operate as an Open Cycle 
Gas Turbine ("OCGT") peaking plant designed to provide an electrical output 
of up to 299 Megawatts ("MW"). As a peaking plant, the Power Generation 
Plant would be required to operate when there is a surge in demand for 
electricity associated with a particular event or where there is a sudden drop in 
power being generated from other plants that are designed to be constantly 
operational (e.g. a sudden outage) (known as a ‘stress event'). The Power 
Generation Plant would also help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times when other 
technologies (e.g. renewable energy sources such as wind and solar farms) 
cannot generate electricity due to their intermittent operation and reliance on 
weather conditions. The Power Generation Plant would operate for up to a 
maximum of 2,250 hours in any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling 
average does not exceed 1,500 hours. 
1.10 
The location of the Power Generation Plant is shown on the Power Generation 
Plant Land Plan (Document Reference 2.5) and the various components that 
comprise the Power Generation Plant are shown on the Works Plan 
(Document Reference 2.6). 
1.11 
The Gas Connection would be a new 1.8 km underground gas pipeline and 
AGI to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the existing 
national transmission system. 
1.12 
In order to function, the Power Generation Plant requires an electrical 
connection. The new Electrical Connection includes a new Substation, two 
underground electrical circuits each up to 500m in length, and two Sealing 
End Compounds (“SECs”) to connect the substation to the Generating 
Equipment and the existing 400 kV network. 
1.13 
The proposed Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are referred to as the "Project". The Gas Connection and the 
Electrical Connection are 'associated development' for the purposes of section 
115 of the PA 2008.  
Location and Description of the Order Land (Section 5) 
1.14 
The Power Generation Plant would be located on land at The Rookery, near 
Stewartby, Bedfordshire. The entire Project lies within the administrative 
boundaries of BBC and CBC, with whom discussions and consultations on a 
range of matters have been held since 2014 as documented in the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1).  
1.15 
The Order land covers an area of approximately 48 ha and comprises the land 
required for the Power Generation Plant, the Electrical Connection and the 
Gas Connection. 
1.16 
The area required by the Power Generation Plant extends to 12.5 ha of land 
forming part of The Rookery, Marston Vale, Bedfordshire and is shown 
coloured pink, blue and yellow on the Power Generation Plant Land Plan 
(Document Reference 2.5). 
1.17 
The land required for the Gas Connection is shown coloured pink, blue and 
yellow on the Gas Connection Land Plan (Document Reference 2.5). The area 
required by the AGI extends to 0.48 ha of land situated to the east of Lower

Farm and west of Park Farm (the area shown coloured pink on the Gas 
Connection Land Plan (Document Reference 2.5). 
1.18 
The Pipeline route has an approximate length of 1.8 km and its direction and 
width varies to account for natural and man made features along the route, but 
generally provides for a working width of 50m (the permanent easement width 
would likely generally be 10m). 
1.19 
The Electrical Connection covers approximately 19.07 ha and is located next 
to the Generating Equipment within Rookery South Pit and shown coloured 
pink, blue and yellow on the Electrical Connection Land Plan (Document 
Reference 2.5). The underground electrical circuits would consist of cables 
buried in four trenches approximately 500m in length and typically 5 m apart. 
Two SECs would also be required to take the cables underground at the point 
of connection into the existing 400 kV overhead line. Each SEC would cover a 
maximum area of 0.16 ha. 
1.20 
MPL is seeking compulsory acquisition powers to secure certain lands, new 
rights and interests within the Order Limits in order to facilitate the Project:  
1.20.1 
The land over which compulsory acquisition powers are 
sought in respect of the freehold is shown edged red and 
shaded pink on the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5). 
This land is described in more detail in the Book of 
Reference (Document Reference 4.3). A summary of the 
status of negotiations, together with the reason for the 
acquisition, is set out in Table 2, at section 6.6. Article 19 of 
the DCO is relied upon in respect of this land;  
1.20.2 
The land over which only new rights (including restrictive 
covenants) are being compulsorily sought is shown edged 
red and shaded blue on the Land Plans (Document 
Reference 2.5). This land is described in more detail in the 
Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3). A summary 
of the status of negotiations, together with the reason for the 
acquisition, is set out in Table 2, at section 6.6. Article 22 of 
the DCO is relied upon in respect of these rights; 
1.20.3 
The land over which temporary use only is sought, pursuant 
to Articles 28 and 29 of the DCO, is shown (for 
completeness and ease of understanding) edged red and 
shaded yellow on the Land Plans (Document Reference 
2.5). This land is described in more detail in the Book of 
Reference (Document Reference 4.3). A summary of the 
status of negotiations, together with the reason for the 
temporary use, is set out in Table 2, at section 6.6. No 
compulsory acquisition of rights is sought over this land.  
1.21 
Where MPL is seeking either land or new rights over land, then temporary use 
of such land pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 is also sought. The reason for 
seeking temporary use powers over this land is that it allows the Applicant to 
enter on to land for particular purposes (including site preparation works) in 
advance of any vesting of the relevant land/rights. It should be noted that there 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
15 
are other Articles within the DCO that allow the Applicant to enter onto or 
otherwise affect land (see paragraph 6.6).  
1.22 
Pursuant to Article 23 of the DCO: 
1.22.1 
all private rights over land subject to compulsory acquisition 
under the DCO are to be extinguished; 
1.22.2 
all private rights over land subject to the compulsory 
acquisition of rights under the DCO are to be suspended and 
unenforceable or, where so notified by MPL, extinguished in 
so far as in either case their continuance would be 
inconsistent with the exercise of that right; 
1.22.3 
all private rights over land of which MPL takes temporary 
possession under the DCO are to be suspended and 
unenforceable for so long as MPL remains in possession of 
the land and so far as their continuance would be 
inconsistent with the exercise of the temporary possession of 
that land. 
1.23 
Article 20 of the DCO is based on Section 237 of the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990 and gives MPL the authority to carry out or use the 
authorised development and do anything else authorised by the DCO 
notwithstanding that it involves the interference with an interest or right 
(meaning any easement, liberty, privilege, right or advantage annexed to land 
and adversely affecting other land including any natural right to support) or a 
breach of a restrictive covenant. In this case, the interest, right or restrictive 
covenant would be overridden. 
1.24 
Part 3 of the Book of Reference identifies those plots where rights may be 
suspended or extinguished under Article 23 and where interests, rights and 
restrictive covenants may need to be overridden under Article 20. 
1.25 
Article 30 gives MPL the authority to acquire land and rights from Statutory 
Undertakers, and to extinguish or suspend their rights, and to remove or 
reposition their apparatus, subject to the provisions of Schedule 10 which 
contains protective provisions for their benefit. 
1.26 
The Project will also interfere with the following publically adopted highways 
(MPL is in active discussions with the Highways Authority in this regard): 
1.26.1 
Green Lane from which a new access road is to be 
constructed to serve the Project;  
1.26.2 
Station Lane which will be temporarily closed from time to 
time, for short periods, during the construction of the 
Electrical Connection;  
1.26.3 
Houghton Lane affected by the upgrading of an existing 
agricultural track which has a junction onto Houghton Lane 
and the subsurface below the road will be affected by the 
construction of the Pipeline (part of the Gas Connection). 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
16 
The Pipeline will be constructed in this location using a 
drilling technique, leaving the highway itself unaffected.  
1.27 
MPL is relying on Articles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 27 of the DCO in order to 
enter onto streets and to lay and maintain apparatus in them, to construct 
means of access and to create temporary prohibitions and restrictions of the 
use of streets to carry out works. Where no compulsory acquisition of rights is 
required on, under or over streets, then the street is not shaded on the Land 
Plans (i.e. it remains white) as the aforementioned Articles will be relied upon.  
1.28 
Any interference with rights restrictions etc. over the Order Land arising from 
the exercise of any Articles in the DCO which provide statutory access and/or 
use of land within the Order Limits are captured in Part 3 of the Book of 
Reference. 
 
 
Need for the Compulsory Acquisition of Land and Rights (Section 6) 
1.29 
MPL has completed an option agreement for that part of the Order Limits on 
which the Power Generation Plant is to be constructed together with part of 
the Electrical Connection and part of the Gas Connection. 
1.30 
However, MPL is including this land within the Order Land in order to ensure 
that land assembly and title to it can be secured with certainty. In addition, 
there may be unknown rights, restrictions, easements or servitudes affecting 
that land which also need to be overridden, removed and/or extinguished in 
order to facilitate the construction and operation of the Project without 
hindrance. 
1.31 
MPL has been seeking to acquire the remaining land, temporary use of land 
and new rights (shown edged red and shaded pink, yellow and blue 
respectively on the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5) by private treaty, in order 
to ensure implementation of the Project. However, it has not yet been possible 
to acquire all of the land, the temporary use of land and the rights required by 
private treaty. In addition, MPL requires certain rights and restrictions to be 
suspended, overridden or extinguished within the Order Land so as to ensure 
there are no impediments to the construction, operation and maintenance of 
the Project. 
1.32 
Plot 4_PGP is required to access the Power Generation Plant. MPL seeks a 
right of access of no more than 15 metres in width during construction and the 
right to construct, use and maintain a permanent access road of no more than 
10 metres in width (including any verges). The intention is for the access road 
to connect into any road that may be constructed by the undertaker pursuant 
to numbered work 5A of the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011. The size of plot 4_PGP reflects the limits of deviation on the 
Works Plan (Document Reference 2.6) for Work No. 2 which has been 
designed to reflect the limits of deviation shown on the works plan for the 
Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011.  
1.33 
Plots 6_EC and 9_EC are required for the Electrical Connection. MPL is 
seeking powers to acquire part of the land for the SECs and seeking new 
rights over the remaining land, to facilitate the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Electrical Connection. A maximum of 0.16 ha of land is 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
17 
permanently required for each SEC (Work No. 6(a)). The exact position of the 
SECs is not yet known as final design and layout of the facility has not yet 
been undertaken. The final design, layout and micro siting will be subject to 
detailed engineering assessments. It is standard practice for major 
infrastructure projects that the full range of investigations and surveys is not 
carried out until the detailed design stage. These plots therefore include a 
degree of flexibility to accommodate the siting of the SECs, subject to detailed 
design, and to allow for mitigation, including landscaping and planting, in order 
to mitigate certain environmental effects around the boundaries of this facility. 
Detailed design of the Electrical Connection would be undertaken by NGET 
following the grant of any consent for the Project. MPL will only compulsorily 
acquire the minimum amount of land necessary to construct, use and maintain 
the SECs. New rights may be acquired and restrictions imposed over the 
remainder of plots 6_EC and 9_EC to facilitate the Electrical Connection and 
the provision and maintenance of the proposed landscaping and planting. 
1.34 
MPL considers the inclusion of 6_EC and 9_EC as land to be acquired to be 
reasonably necessary and that the compelling case test is met in the 
circumstances of the case. 
1.35 
Plots 1_GC, 7_GC, 8_GC, 9_GC and 10_GC are required for the Pipeline 
forming part of the Gas Connection. The Pipeline route has an approximate 
length of 1.8 km and its direction and width varies to account for natural and 
man made features along the route, but generally provides for a working width 
of 50m. The permanent easement width would likely generally be 10m. The 
micro siting for the Pipeline will be subject to detailed engineering 
assessments. MPL will only compulsorily acquire rights and impose 
restrictions over the minimum amount of land necessary to construct, use and 
maintain the Pipeline. 
1.36 
In the absence of powers of compulsory acquisition, the Order Land may not 
be assembled, uncertainty will continue to prevail and MPL considers that its 
objectives and Government policy objectives would not be achieved. 
1.37 
MPL's justification for seeking compulsory acquisition powers, in accordance 
with the provisions of the PA 2008, is to secure land, the temporary use of 
land, the new rights (including restrictive covenants) and other interests 
required to enable MPL to construct, operate and maintain the Project within a 
reasonable commercial timeframe. The inclusion of powers of compulsory 
acquisition in the DCO is sought in order to ensure that this can be achieved. 
The land and rights together with the land required for temporary use is no 
more than that is required to facilitate the Project, its construction and future 
maintenance. 
1.38 
There is an element of overlap between the authorised development in the 
Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 (promoted by 
Covanta Rookery South Limited) and the Project. However, there is no overlap 
between the generating station and waste recovery facility (Work Nos. 1 and 2 
in the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 and the 
Generating Equipment and Substation (Work Nos. 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 5) (for 
further details see Appendix 5 of the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1). 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
18 
1.39 
MPL and Covanta Rookery South Limited are currently discussing the terms of 
protective provisions and/or an interface agreement that will enable the works 
permitted by the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 and 
the DCO to be carried concurrently or simultaneously without prohibiting or 
causing any adverse impacts to the other project. 
1.40 
MPL has included protective provisions in the DCO for the benefit of Covanta 
Rookery South Limited.  
1.41 
MPL also proposes to amend the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011 to include protective provisions for the benefit of the MPL. These 
provisions are required to ensure that there is no impediment to the 
construction or operation of the works permitted by the DCO.  
Alternatives to Compulsory Acquisition (Section 6.7) 
1.42 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, MPL looked at a range of sites 
around the UK to support power generation plants of the Project's nature. This 
search for potential power generation plant sites across the UK was focused 
on areas that were capable of meeting MPL's strategic project development 
criteria. 
1.43 
In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough to 
support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and integral infrastructure) 
and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and electrical connection points 
were both key considerations. 
1.44 
From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to close 
sensitive receptors, the current make up of the surrounding area, previous site 
uses and land quality and proximity to sensitive ecological habitats. 
1.45 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the siting 
of the Power Generation Plant: 
1.45.1 
Close proximity to the NTS; 
1.45.2 
Close Proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400kV 
overhead line); 
1.45.3 
The Generating Equipment Site is within previously 
developed land, lying below ground level; 
1.45.4 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for 
energy infrastructure; 
1.45.5 
It has a well-developed road network for access to the 
Project Site; 
1.45.6 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation 
Plant and integral infrastructure; 
1.45.7 
It avoids environmentally sensitive areas. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
19 
Justification for the Use of Powers of Compulsory Acquisition (Section 
7) 
1.46 
The urgent need for energy generation, including gas fired generating stations 
and unabated gas and peaking plants, are provided in NPS EN-1, the Gas 
Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012) and the National Infrastructure Plan (HM 
Treasury, 2014). The Project would contribute materially to meeting this need. 
1.47 
Besides this considerable public benefit, there would be other benefits of the 
Project. These include economic benefit to the local area through the creation 
of up to 150 jobs during the 22 month construction period and up to 10 full 
time equivalent permanent jobs during operation as well as other contracts 
(e.g. maintenance) which would be offered locally where possible. Local 
biodiversity may be improved by the implementation of ecological 
enhancement measures. 
1.48 
Due regard has been paid to all relevant and important considerations. These 
include the findings of community and statutory consultation processes which, 
as documented in the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1), have 
influenced considerations as to the design and siting of the Project. Local 
economic development and environmental policy designations have been 
considered in the design, siting and mitigation proposals within the Project. 
1.49 
The Project is in line with the relevant National Policy Statements, being NPS 
EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5. Considerations as to siting, 
Habitats and Species Regulations, alternatives, Good Design, consideration of 
Combined Heat and Power, grid connection, safety, health, nuisance and 
security have been given due consideration as demonstrated in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) and its appendices (Document Reference 6.2), the 
DAS (Document Reference 10.2), the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1) and the Grid Connection Statements (Document Reference 
9.1 and 9.2). The ES has also assessed all relevant likely significant 
environmental effects and has proposed appropriate mitigation where feasible. 
These measures are to be secured through compliance with various submitted 
documents and further approvals such as under the proposed requirements 
attached to the draft DCO (see Schedule 2 to the draft DCO, Document 
Reference 3.1). 
1.50 
As such, it is considered that there are no relevant matters that give rise to 
adverse impacts sufficient to outweigh the identified benefits of the Project. 
1.51 
In conclusion and in line with the factors set out in Section 104 of the PA 2008 
Act there is a compelling case in the public interest for the Order to be made in 
the terms proposed and in the absence of sufficient indications to the contrary. 
Special Considerations (Section 8) 
Statutory Undertakers Land/Apparatus 
1.52 
There are various assets belonging to Statutory Undertakers that lie within the 
Order Land, namely Anglian Water Services Limited, National Grid Electricity 
Transmission plc, National Grid Gas plc, Eastern Power Networks plc and 
CLH Pipeline System (CLH-PS) Ltd. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
20 
1.53 
MPL is currently in active discussions with Anglian Water Services Limited, 
National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, National Grid Gas plc, Eastern 
Power Networks plc and CLH Pipeline System (CLH-PS) Ltd regarding asset 
protection agreements and/or any Protective Provisions that they may wish to 
see included in the DCO.  
Other consents    
1.54 
Other consents are required in order for the Project to be constructed and 
subsequently operate. The document ‘Details of Other Consents and 
Licences’ (Document Reference 5.6) sets out the additional consents required 
and when they will be applied for.  
Human Rights (Section 9)  
1.55 
The DCO has the potential to infringe the human rights of persons who own 
property or have rights in the land proposed to be acquired pursuant to the 
DCO.  
1.56 
MPL considers that there would be very significant public benefit arising from 
the making of the DCO for the Project. That benefit can only be realised if the 
DCO includes compulsory acquisition powers.  
1.57 
MPL considers that there is a compelling case in the public interest for the 
exercise of such powers of compulsory acquisition. MPL considers that it 
would, therefore, be appropriate and proportionate for the Secretary of State 
to make the DCO, including the grant of compulsory acquisition powers.  
Further Information (Section 10)

2. 
INTRODUCTION   
2.1 
This Statement of Reasons relates to an application by MPL to the Secretary 
of State under the PA 2008 for powers to construct, operate and maintain an 
to 299 MW gas fired peaking power generation plant.  
2.2 
The Project would comprise: 
2.2.1 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an OCGT peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating station 
as a whole, measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
(a) 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator 
with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant 
(together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
(b) 
a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the 
Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short 
Access Road’);  
(c) 
a 
temporary 
construction 
compound 
required 
during 
construction only (the ‘Laydown Area’); 
2.2.2 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in 
length (the ‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System (the ‘Gas 
Connection’). The Gas Connection also incorporates an AGI at the 
point of connection to the National Transmission System; and 
2.2.3 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the NETS (the ‘Electrical Connection’), comprising an 
underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower 
(which will replace an existing tower and be located in the existing 
Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in 
no net additional towers). The Electrical Connection also comprises of 
two SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, 
and both circuits would then be connected via underground cables 
approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
2.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 
12.5 ha in area.  
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land 
upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in 
order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project 
Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
22 
2.5 
This Statement has been produced pursuant to Regulation 5(2)(h) of the 
Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 (the "APFP Regulations") and the Department of 
Communities and Local Government guidance, 'Planning Act 2008: Guidance 
related to procedures for the compulsory acquisition of land' (September 2013) 
(the "Guidance"). 
2.6 
The Project, comprising an electricity generating plant with an average gross 
electrical output in excess of 50 MWe, falls within the definition of a "nationally 
significant infrastructure project" under section 15(2) of the PA 2008. It is, 
therefore, necessary for MPL to apply to the Secretary of State for 
development consent to construct, operate and maintain the Project under 
Section 31 of PA 2008.  
2.7 
This Statement forms part of the suite of documents accompanying the DCO 
Application submitted in accordance with Section 55 of the PA 2008 and 
Regulation 5 of the APFP Regulations. The DCO Application seeks the 
making of the proposed Millbrook Power (Gas Fired Power Station) Order 
201*, which would confer the powers required. 
 
2.8 
This Statement is one of a number of documents required to support the DCO 
Application submitted to the Secretary of State and should be read together 
with those documents. This Statement explains why it is necessary to acquire 
land, acquire and/or create rights and impose restrictions in, on and over land, 
to override, suspend or  extinguish rights in, on and over land and to 
temporarily use land for the purposes of the Project, if necessary by 
compulsion. 
2.9 
The Application is necessary so that MPL has the requisite powers to 
construct, operate and maintain the Project which is a nationally significant 
infrastructure project for which there is a pressing national need. The Project 
itself has been the subject of an extensive consultation exercise. It is in line 
with national and local policy in respect of planning and energy generation. 
MPL has contracts in place to acquire a substantial part of the land required 
for the Project. A contract has been signed to acquire the land where the 
Power Generation Plant will be located and for part of the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection (see the Power Generation Plant Land Plan, the 
Electrical Connection Land Plan and Gas Connection Land Plan, Document 
Reference 2.5). Negotiations with regard to the purchase of land, the 
acquisition of and/or creation of easement rights and any other rights 
(including restrictive covenants) and interests required for the remaining Gas 
Connection and for the Electrical Connection are in progress (the land affected 
by these negotiations are shown on the Gas Connection Land Plan and the 
Electrical Connection Land Plan, both in Document Reference 2.5). Table 2 in 
Section 6 sets out the current negotiation status. 
2.10 
Although negotiations for the purchase of land, rights and interests are 
ongoing in respect of the remaining land and new rights required for the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, it is necessary 
for MPL to seek compulsory acquisition powers to secure such land, rights 
and interests and to ensure that any third party interests or encumbrances 
affecting such land, rights and interests are acquired, overridden or 
extinguished pursuant to the DCO, thereby ensuring that the Project can be

constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with the powers sought 
under the DCO. 
2.11 
As referred to above, MPL has secured a contract to acquire the land where 
the Power Generation Plant will be located and for part of the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection. MPL is including this land within the Order Land in 
order to ensure that land assembly and title to the land required for the Project 
can be secured with certainty. MPL is also seeking to ensure that certain 
easements and other private rights identified as affecting the land are 
overridden, suspended or extinguished so as to facilitate the construction and 
operation of the Project without hindrance (see the Book of Reference 
(Document Reference 4.3)). In addition, there may be unknown rights, 
restrictions, easements or servitudes affecting that land which also need to be 
overridden, removed and/or extinguished in order to facilitate the construction 
and operation of the Project without hindrance. 
2.12 
MPL considers that there is a compelling case in the public interest, in 
accordance with section 122 of PA 2008, for the making of the DCO and the 
inclusion of powers of compulsory acquisition to enable the Project to be 
constructed, operated and maintained.  
3. 
POWERS OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION UNDER THE PLANNING ACT 
2008 
3.1 
Powers 
3.1.1 
Section 120 of the PA 2008 provides that an order granting 
development consent may make provision relating to, or to matters 
ancillary to, the development for which consent is granted. Schedule 
5 to the PA 2008 lists the matters ancillary to the development. These 
include: 
(a) 
the acquisition of land, compulsorily or by agreement 
(paragraph 1); 
(b) 
the 
creation, 
suspension 
or 
extinguishment 
of, 
or 
interference 
with, 
interests 
in 
or 
rights 
over 
land, 
compulsorily or by agreement (paragraph 2); 
(c) 
the abrogation or modification of agreements relating to land 
(paragraph 3); and 
(d) 
the payment of compensation (paragraph 36). 
3.1.2 
Section 122 of the PA 2008 provides that an order granting 
development consent may include provision authorising the 
compulsory acquisition of land only if the Secretary of State, in 
respect of the application, is satisfied that: 
(a) 
the land is required for the development to which the DCO 
relates; 
(b) 
the land is required to facilitate or is incidental to that 
development; or  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
24 
(c) 
the land is replacement land for commons, open spaces, 
etc.1  
3.1.3 
Further, it is also necessary for the Secretary of State to be satisfied, 
in relation to the DCO Application, that there is a compelling case in 
the public interest for the land to be acquired compulsorily. This is 
required by section 122(3) of the PA 2008.  
3.2 
Powers of compulsory acquisition in the DCO for the Project  
3.2.1 
Under environmental impact assessment legislation applicable to the 
Project, there is no general requirement to consider alternatives, only 
a requirement to outline the main alternatives studied by the applicant 
and an indication of the main reason for the applicant's choice. 
Furthermore, National Policy Statement EN-1 ("NPS EN-1") advises 
at paragraph 4.4.1 that "from a policy perspective this NPS does not 
contain any general requirement to consider alternatives or to 
establish whether the proposed project represents the best option." 
However, NPS EN-1 makes it clear at paragraph 4.4.3 that where 
there is a policy or legal requirement to consider alternatives the 
applicant should describe the alternatives considered in compliance 
with these requirements.  
3.2.2 
As explained in Sections 6 and 7 of this Statement, MPL has given 
careful consideration to the suitability of the Order Limits for the 
Project. The DAS (Document Reference 10.2) considers the 
alternatives in the design of the Project and the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) sets out the main alternatives studied by MPL. 
Alternatives are also further discussed in Section 6.7 below.  
3.2.3 
Having finalised the location for the Project, MPL completed an option 
agreement with O&H Q7 Limited (“O&H”) for that part of the Order 
Limits on which the Power Generation Plant, part of the Electrical 
Connection and part of the Gas Connection is to be located within 
land owned by O&H (Plots 1-PGP, 1A-PGP, 1B_PGP, 2_PGP, 
3_PGP, 4_PGP, 5_PGP, 5A_PGP, 6_PGP, 7_PGP, 4_EC (part), 
5_EC, 6_EC, 7_EC, 8_EC, 9_EC, 10_EC, 11_EC, 12_EC, 13_EC, 
1_GC, 1A_GC, 1B_GC, 2_GC, 3_GC, 4_GC, 5_GC, 6_GC). 
3.2.4 
However, MPL is seeking compulsory acquisition powers to secure 
this land or new rights (including restrictive covenants) over it, to 
ensure that land assembly and title to all of the Order Land can be 
secured with certainty. In addition, there may be unknown rights, 
restrictions, easements or servitudes affecting that land which also 
need to be overridden, removed and/or extinguished in order to 
facilitate the construction and operation of the Project without 
hindrance.  
3.2.5 
In addition, MPL requires the remaining land, legal interests and 
rights (including restrictive covenants) as shown on the Land Plans to 
construct and operate the Project, particularly the Gas Connection 
and the Electrical Connection (see the Gas Connection Land Plan 
                                                      
1 The provision referred to in this sub-paragraph is not relevant in respect of the Project.

25 
and the Electrical Connection Land Plan, both in Document 
Reference 2.5), in a reasonable timeframe to enable the Project to be 
constructed and contribute to the need for energy supply.    
3.2.6 
Whilst land, rights and interests will be secured by agreement 
wherever possible, and negotiations continue with all identified 
owners, it is essential that compulsory acquisition powers are 
available to MPL to enable the Project to be constructed at the 
earliest opportunity.  
3.2.7 
Powers are also sought to enable the use of the Order Limits for the 
purposes of the Project and to ensure that any, for example, rights, 
restrictions, easements or servitudes are over-ridden, suspended 
and/or extinguished.  
4. 
SCHEME DETAILS  
4.1 
MPL is seeking to develop a gas fired power station with an electrical 
connection and a gas connection at land at The Rookery, Marston Vale 
Bedfordshire. MPL is the SPV which has been set up to develop the Project 
and MPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Drax Group plc.  
4.2 
It is intended that the Power Generation Plant would operate within the 
framework established by government under the Capacity Market. This is a 
key part of the government’s Electricity Market Reform and seeks to ensure 
that the UK has enough reliable electricity capacity to meet current and future 
electricity demand. Operation under the Capacity Market is subject to bidding 
into a competitive auction and it would be necessary for a DCO to be made in 
order to participate in this auction. Accordingly the design of the scheme and 
the terms of the DCO have paid regard to the need for a competitive bid. 
However, participating in, or being successful in, the Capacity Market is not a 
pre-requisite for MPL to construct and operate the Project.   
4.3 
The main elements of the Project are set out in paragraph 2.2 above. More 
detail on the elements that comprise the Project can be found in Chapter 3 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
5. 
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ORDER LAND 
5.1 
Description of the Order Limits   
5.1.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be located on land at The 
Rookery, Marston Vale Bedfordshire. This section describes the 
Order Limits together with key features and characteristics of the 
surrounding 
landscape. 
The 
entire 
Project 
lies 
within 
the 
administrative boundary of BBC and CBC, with whom discussions 
and consultations on a range of matters have been held since 
January 2014 as documented in the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1).  
5.1.2 
The Order Limits (also called the Project Site) are located south of 
Green Lane, east of the Marston Vale Railway Line and Millbrook 
Proving Ground, west of the Midland Main Line Railway and north 
west of Millbrook. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
26 
Power Generation Plant  
5.1.3 
The area required by the Power Generation Plant extends to 12.5 ha 
covering part of The Rookery disused clay pits to the south of Green 
Lane and east of South Pillinge Farm.  
Gas Connection 
5.1.4 
The Gas Connection corridor would be constructed between the AGI 
and the Generating Equipment. The Pipeline begins at the AGI which 
would allow connection to the NTS feeder line, east of Millbrook 
Proving Ground approximately 1.45km south of the Generating 
Equipment Site crossing the farm track accessing farmland, 
continuing north across public footpath 7 and Houghton Lane, running 
north under the Overhead Transmission Lines and parallel to the 
Midland Main Line Railway, turning north west across the CLH 
Pipeline System and public footpath 15 before turning westwards into 
the Power Generation Plant. 
Electrical Connection  
5.1.5 
The Electrical Connection would be constructed between the 
Substation and the new transmission tower (replacing an existing 
tower and to be built within the existing NETS corridor, to the south 
east of Pillinge Cottages). The underground cables exit the 
Substation and travel west then immediately south running parallel to 
South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge Cottages terminating at the new 
transmission tower. 
5.2 
Description of the Order Land       
5.2.1 
MPL is seeking compulsory acquisition powers to secure certain 
lands, rights and interests within the Order Limits to facilitate the 
Project.   
5.2.2 
The land over which compulsory acquisition powers are sought in 
respect of the freehold is shown edged red and shaded pink on the 
Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5). This land is described in more 
detail in the Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3). Article 19 
of the DCO is relied upon in respect of this land.  
5.2.3 
The land over which only new rights (including restrictive covenants) 
are being compulsory sought is shown edged red and shaded blue 
on the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5). This land is described 
in more detail in the Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3). 
Article 22 of the DCO is relied upon in respect of these rights.   
5.2.4 
Plot 4_PGP is required to access the Power Generation Plant. MPL 
seeks a right of access of no more than 15 metres in width during 
construction and the right to construct, use and maintain a permanent 
access road of no more than 10 metres in width (including any 
verges). The intention is for the access road to connect into any road 
that may be constructed by the undertaker pursuant to numbered 
work 5A of the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
27 
2011. The size of plot 4_PGP reflects the limits of deviation on the 
Works Plan (Document Reference 2.6) for Work No. 2 which has 
been designed to reflect the limits of deviation shown on the works 
plan for the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011.  
5.2.5 
Plots 6_EC and 9_EC are required for the Electrical Connection. MPL 
is seeking powers to acquire part of the land for the SECs and 
seeking new rights over the remaining land, to facilitate the 
construction, operation and maintenance of the Electrical Connection. 
A maximum of 0.16 ha of land is permanently required for each of the 
SECs (Work No. 6(a)). The exact position of the SECs is not yet 
known as final design and layout of the facility has not yet been 
undertaken. The final design, layout and micro siting will be subject to 
detailed engineering assessments. It is standard practice for major 
infrastructure projects that the full range of investigations and surveys 
is not carried out until the detailed design stage. These plots therefore 
include a degree of flexibility to accommodate the siting of the SECs, 
subject to detailed design, and to allow for mitigation, including 
landscaping and planting, in order to mitigate certain environmental 
effects around the boundaries of this facility. Detailed design of the 
Electrical Connection would be undertaken by NGET following the 
grant of any consent for the Project, taking into account this 
evolutionary design process and the fact that mitigation proposals 
would need to be finalised alongside this design. MPL will only 
compulsorily acquire the minimum amount of land necessary to 
construct, use and maintain the SECs. New rights may be acquired 
and restrictions imposed over the remainder of plots 6_EC and 9_EC 
to facilitate the Electrical Connection and the provision and 
maintenance of the proposed landscaping and planting. 
5.2.6 
MPL considers the inclusion of 6_EC and 9_EC as land to be 
acquired to be reasonably necessary and that the compelling case 
test is met in the circumstances of the case. 
5.2.7 
Plots 1_GC, 7_GC, 8_GC, 9_GC and 10_GC are required for the 
Pipeline forming part of the Gas Connection. The Pipeline route has 
an approximate length of 1.8 km and its direction and width varies to 
account for natural and man made features along the route, but 
generally provides for a working width of 50m. The permanent 
easement width would likely generally be 10m. The micro siting for 
the Pipeline will be subject to detailed engineering assessments. MPL 
will only compulsorily acquire rights and impose restrictions over the 
minimum amount of land necessary to construct, use and maintain 
the Pipeline. 
5.2.8 
The land over which temporary use is sought pursuant to Articles 28 
and 29 of the DCO is shown (for ease of understanding) edged red 
and shaded yellow on the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5). 
This land is described in more detail in the Book of Reference 
(Document Reference 4.3). Articles 28 and 29 of the DCO are relied 
upon in respect of this land and, as such, no compulsory acquisition 
of rights is sought. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
28 
5.2.9 
Where MPL is seeking either land or new rights over land, then 
temporary use of such land pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 is also 
sought. As such, these parcels are shown as pink or blue in 
accordance with the above conventions in the same way as for land 
as set out at 5.2.6 above. 
5.3 
Private rights, interests, other rights and restrictive covenants affecting 
the Order Land to be extinguished, suspended or overridden 
5.3.1 
Pursuant to Article 23 of the DCO: 
(a) 
all private rights over land subject to compulsory acquisition 
under the DCO are to be extinguished; 
(b) 
all private rights over land subject to the compulsory 
acquisition of rights under the DCO are to be suspended 
and unenforceable or, where so notified by MPL, 
extinguished in so far as in either case their continuance 
would be inconsistent with the exercise of that right; and 
(c) 
all private rights over land of which MPL takes temporary 
possession are to be suspended and unenforceable for 
so long as MPL remains in possession of the land and so far 
as their continuance would be inconsistent with the exercise 
of the temporary possession of that land. 
5.3.2 
Article 20 of the DCO is based on Section 237 of the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 and gives MPL the authority to carry out 
or use the authorised development and do anything else authorised 
by the DCO notwithstanding that it involves the interference with an 
interest or right (meaning any easement, liberty, privilege, right or 
advantage annexed to land and adversely affecting other land 
including any natural right to support) or a breach of a restrictive 
covenant. In this case, the interest, right or restrictive covenant would 
be overridden. 
5.3.3 
Part 3 of the Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3) identifies 
those plots where rights may be overridden, suspended or 
extinguished under Articles 20 and 23. 
5.4 
MATTERS AFFECTING THE ORDER LAND AND BEING INTERFERED 
WITH BY THE PROJECT  
Public Highways  
5.4.1 
Within the Order Land, there are the following publically adopted 
highways which will be affected by the Project:  
(a) 
Green Lane from which a new access road is to be 
constructed to serve the Project; 
(b) 
Station Lane will be affected by oversailing works of the 
Electrical Connection. This will include temporary closure to 
allow the erection and dismantling of safety equipment 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons

29 
required for the construction of the Electrical Connection and 
temporary traffic management measures to ensure safe 
access to the Electrical Connection by construction vehicles; 
(c) 
Houghton Lane will be affected by drilling operations under 
the highway in connection with the Gas Connection; the 
creation of a new means of access to serve the AGI and 
temporary traffic management measures on the highway at 
the crossing point for construction vehicles in the vicinity of 
the Gas Connection. 
5.4.2 
In respect of these public highways, MPL is relying on Articles 8, 9, 
10, 11, 12, 14 and 27 of the DCO in relation to street works to enter 
onto them and to lay and maintain apparatus in them, to construct 
means of access and to create temporary prohibitions and restrictions 
of the use of such streets to carry out such works. Where no 
compulsory acquisition of rights is required on, under or over streets, 
then the street is not shaded on the Land Plans (i.e. it remains white) 
as the aforementioned Articles will be relied upon. 
5.4.3 
Any interference with rights, restrictions etc. over the Order Land 
arising from the exercise of any Articles in the Order which provide 
statutory access and/or use of land within the Order Limits are 
captured in Part 3 of the Book of Reference (Document Reference 
4.3). 
5.4.4 
Access to all premises adjoining public highways affected by the 
Project will be maintained at all times during the execution and 
operation of the works and will not be materially affected by the 
operation of the Project. 
Utility Rights 
 
5.4.5 
Article 30 gives MPL the authority to acquire land and rights from 
Statutory Undertakers, and to extinguish or suspend their rights, and 
to remove or reposition their apparatus, subject to the provisions of 
Schedule 10 which contains protective provisions for their benefit.  
5.4.6 
Where the rights of utilities, in relation to their apparatus, are 
interfered with, steps will be taken to remove or reposition their 
apparatus so that utility services can be reinstated, maintained and 
operated. Articles 30, 31 and 32 of the DCO will be relied upon in this 
respect. 
5.4.7 
MPL has contacted the applicable statutory undertakers in respect of 
the Protective Provisions that they would like to see in the DCO. 
Discussions are ongoing in this regard (see section 8.3 below), 
however draft Protective Provisions are included in the draft DCO 
submitted with the DCO Application.

The DCO contains the following additional powers which may 
constitute an interference with land and/or rights over land and as 
such are captured in Part 3 of the Book of Reference (Document 
Reference 4.3): 
(a) 
Article 16 – Discharge of water; 
(b) 
Article 17 - Authority to survey and investigate the land;

6. 
NEED FOR THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND AND RIGHTS       
6.1 
The matters to which the Secretary of State must have regard  
6.1.1 
Under Section 122 of the PA 2008, a DCO which includes 
compulsory acquisition powers may be granted only if the conditions 
in Sections 122(2) and 122(3) of the PA 2008 are met. The conditions 
to be met are: 
(a) 
at Section 122(2), that the land is required for the 
development to which the DCO relates or is required to 
facilitate or is incidental to the development (see this section 
6); and  
(b) 
at Section 122(3), there is a compelling case in the public 
interest for the land to be acquired compulsorily. The 
Secretary of State must be persuaded that the public 
benefits from the compulsory acquisitions will outweigh the 
private loss suffered by those whose land is to be acquired 
or from whom new rights are to be acquired (see this section 
6).  
6.1.2 
In respect of the Section 122(2) condition, the Guidance (at 
paragraph 11) states that applicants should be able to demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that the land in question is 
needed for the development for which consent is sought. The 
Guidance goes on to say that the Secretary of State will need to be 
satisfied that the land to be acquired is no more than is reasonably 
required for the purposes of the development.  
6.1.3 
In respect of the Section 122(3) condition, the Guidance (at 
paragraph 13) states that the Secretary of State will need to be 
persuaded that there is compelling evidence that the public benefits 
that would be derived from the compulsory acquisition will outweigh 
the private loss that would be suffered by those whose land is to be 
acquired. At paragraph 14, the Guidance states that in determining 
where the balance of public interest lies, the Secretary of State will 
weigh up the public benefits that a scheme will bring against any 
private loss to those affected by compulsory acquisition.  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
31 
6.1.4 
Further, paragraphs 8 to 10 of the Guidance also set out a number of 
general considerations that the applicant must demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary of State when justifying an order 
authorising compulsory acquisition. These are as follows: 
(a) 
that all reasonable alternatives to compulsory acquisition 
(including modifications to the Project) have been explored 
(see section 6.7 below); 
(b) 
that the proposed interference with the rights of those with 
an interest in the land is for a legitimate purpose and is 
necessary and proportionate (see sections 6.4  to 6.7 
below); 
(c) 
that MPL has a clear idea of how it intends to use the land 
which it is proposed to acquire (see sections 6.4  to 6.7 
below);  
(d) 
that there is a reasonable prospect of the requisite funds for 
the acquisition becoming available (see the Funding 
Statement (Document Reference 4.2); and  
(e) 
that the purposes for which compulsory acquisition of land 
powers are included in the DCO are legitimate and are 
sufficient to justify interfering with the human rights of those 
with an interest in the land affected (see sections 6.4  to 6.7 
and 9 below).  
6.1.5 
This statement sets out the factors that MPL considers demonstrate 
that the conditions in Section 122 of the PA 2008, and the 
considerations set out in the Guidance, are satisfied.   
6.2 
Need for Compulsory Acquisition (Sections 122(2) and (3) of the PA 
2008)   
6.2.1 
As stated above at paragraph 3.2.3, MPL completed an option 
agreement for that part of the Order Limits on which the Power 
Generation Plant is to be located together with part of the Gas 
Connection and part of the Electrical Connection. However, MPL is 
including this land within the Order Land in order to ensure that land 
assembly and title to the Order Land can be secured with certainty. 
MPL is also including this land within the Order land so as to ensure 
that certain easements and  other private rights identified as affecting 
that land are extinguished, so as to facilitate the construction and 
operation of the Project without hindrance (see the Book of Reference 
(Document Reference 4.3). In addition, there may be unknown rights, 
restrictions, easements or servitudes affecting that land which also 
need to be overridden, removed and/or extinguished in order to 
facilitate the construction and operation of the Project without 
hindrance.  
6.2.2 
In addition, to ensure that the Project can be facilitated, and the 
Government's policy in relation to the timely provision of new 
generating capacity is met within a reasonable timescale, MPL 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
32 
requires the acquisition of a number of property interests in third party 
ownership and the grant of powers to facilitate acquisition and/or 
creation of rights (including restrictive covenants) and interests and to 
suspend or extinguish rights and other interests in or over land. 
6.2.3 
MPL has been seeking to acquire the remaining land, rights (and 
restriction) over land and temporary use of land (shown edged red 
and shaded pink, blue and yellow respectively on the Land Plans 
(Document Reference 2.5)) by private treaty, in order to ensure 
implementation of the Project. However, it has not yet been possible 
to acquire all of the land, the temporary use of land and the rights 
required by private treaty. In addition, MPL requires certain matters to 
be suspended, overridden or extinguished within the Order Land so 
as to ensure there are no impediments to the construction, operation 
and maintenance of the Project. 
6.2.4 
MPL will continue to endeavour to purchase the land, the rights and 
other interests and the temporary use of land, as well as secure the 
removal of matters affecting the Order Land that may impede the 
Project, by agreement wherever possible. This approach of making 
the application for powers of compulsory acquisition in the Application 
for the DCO and, in parallel, conducting negotiations to acquire land 
by agreement, accords with paragraph 26 of the Guidance. 
6.2.5 
MPL's justification for seeking compulsory acquisition powers, in 
accordance with the provisions of the PA 2008, is to secure land, the 
temporary use of land, the permanent rights and other interests 
required to enable MPL to construct, operate and maintain the Project 
within a reasonable commercial timeframe. The inclusion of powers of 
compulsory acquisition in the DCO is sought in order to ensure that 
this can be achieved. The land and rights (including restrictive 
covenants) together with the land required for temporary use is no 
more than that is required to facilitate the Project, its construction and 
future maintenance. The necessary powers, together with powers to 
suspend, override and extinguish rights and other interests in or over 
land, are contained in Part 3 and Part 5 of the draft DCO which 
accompanies the Application. 
6.3 
The interaction between the Millbrook Power Project and the Rookery 
South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 
6.3.1 
There is an element of overlap between the authorised development 
in the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 
(promoted by Covanta Rookery South Limited) and the Project. 
However, there is no overlap between the generating station and 
waste recovery facility (Work Nos. 1 and 2 in the Rookery South 
(Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 and the Generating 
Equipment and Substation (Work Nos. 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 5) (for 
further details see Appendix 5 of the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2). 
6.3.2 
MPL and Covanta Rookery South Limited are currently discussing the 
terms of protective provisions and/ or an interface agreement that will 
enable the works permitted by the Rookery South (Resource 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project

33 
Recovery Facility) Order 2011 and the DCO to be carried 
concurrently or simultaneously without prohibiting or causing any 
adverse impacts to the other project. 
6.3.3 
MPL has included protective provisions in the DCO for the benefit of 
Covanta Rookery South Limited. The draft protective provisions are 
set out in Part 6 of Schedule 10 of the DCO. 
6.3.4 
MPL also proposes to amend the Rookery South (Resource 
Recovery Facility) Order 2011 to include protective provisions for the 
benefit of the MPL. The protective provisions will ensure that Covanta 
Rookery South Limited cannot use the powers in the Rookery South 
(Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 to: 
(a) 
prevent the Applicant from accessing the Generating 
Equipment Site or the Substation Site;  
(b) 
access or carry out works to the Generating Equipment Site 
or the Substation Site; and  
(c) 
interfere with, override or extinguish any rights acquired by 
the Applicant for the Electrical Connection and/or Gas 
Connection. 
6.3.5 
This provision is required to ensure that there is no impediment to the 
construction or operation of the works permitted by the DCO.  
6.4 
Compulsory Acquisition of freehold     
6.4.1 
The intended purpose for which land is subject to proposed powers of 
compulsory acquisition in Article 19 of the DCO and the status of 
negotiations with owners and occupiers is summarised in Table 2 
below. This is described by reference to the numbered works set out 
in Schedule 1 to the DCO and shown on the Works Plan (Document 
Reference 2.6) and by plot number as referenced in the Book of 
Reference and Land Plans (Document References 4.3 and 2.5 
respectively).  
6.5 
Compulsory Acquisition of / Creation of New Rights (including restrictive 
covenants)  
6.5.1 
A number of rights (including restrictive covenants) are sought to 
facilitate MPL and all persons authorised on its behalf to construct, 
use and maintain at all times both, during and post construction 
periods, the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection. The rights and restrictive covenants are set out in Table 
1.  Routes have been chosen to minimise adverse impacts on third 
party land.

6.5.2 
The intended purpose for which new rights (including restrictive 
covenants) are sought under Article 22 of the DCO and the status of 
negotiations with owners and occupiers is summarised in Table 2 
below. This is described by reference to the numbered works set out 
in Schedule 1 to the DCO and shown on the Works Plan (Document 
Reference 2.6) and by plot number as referenced in the Book of 
Reference and Land Plans (Document References 4.3 and 2.5).  
6.5.3 
There is a need to impose restrictive covenants in relation to new 
rights required in connection with the Project. 
6.5.4 
Planning Inspectorate guidance in Advice Note 15 concerning the 
drafting of DCOs (paragraphs 26.1-26.3) advises that it may be 
appropriate to include a power to impose restrictive covenants over 
part of the land which is subject to compulsory acquisition or use 
under the DCO. The guidance states that before deciding whether or 
not such a power is justified the Secretary of State will need to 
consider issues such as proportionality; the risk that use of land 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
36 
above or below a structure could be sterilised if it has to be acquired 
outright in the absence of a power to impose restrictive covenants; or 
whether there is for example a policy of establishing a continuous 
protection zone for the infrastructure network which could be secured 
more efficiently with the benefit of this power. 
6.5.5 
The guidance states that the power to impose restrictive covenants 
over land above a buried cable or pipe, or where a slope contains 
artificial reinforcement has been granted in DCOs, and cites article 20 
of the M1 Junction 10A (Grade Separation) Order 2013 and article 22 
of the Network Rail (Norton Bridge Area Improvements) Order 2014 
as examples. The guidance advises that in order to enable the 
Secretary of State to consider whether the imposition of restrictive 
covenants is necessary for the purposes of implementing an NSIP 
and appropriate in human rights terms, applicants should be prepared 
to fully explain and justify the need for including such powers. 
6.5.6 
MPL has had regard to this guidance in preparing its DCO. Article 22 
includes power to impose restrictive covenants in relation to land over 
which new rights are acquired. MPL considers the imposition of such 
a power to be justified and proportionate in the circumstances of this 
case, in order to protect and preserve the integrity of the Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection. These restrictions are required to 
protect the apparatus from becoming exposed, damaged or built over; 
preventing operations which may obstruct, interrupt or interfere with 
apparatus and the exercise of new rights required; ensure that access 
for future maintenance can be facilitated; in the interests of safety of 
persons using or present on the subject land; and to ensure that land 
requirements are minimised so far as possible. Use of the land would 
be sterilised if the land above the pipes or cables had to be acquired. 
In the absence of such a power it is submitted that this is justifiable to 
protect the Project and its operation. Similar powers have been 
granted in the context of NSIP gas fired power stations including the 
Meaford Gas Fired Generating Station Order 2016 (article 18) and the 
Wrexham Gas Fired Generating Station Order 2017 (article 18). 
6.6 
Temporary use of land pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 of the DCO    
6.6.1 
Temporary use of land pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 is required in 
order to facilitate the use of land by MPL and all persons authorised 
on its behalf during the construction period and maintenance period 
of the Project. 
6.6.2 
The intended purpose, for which temporary use is sought pursuant to 
Articles 28 and 29 of the DCO, is set out in Schedule 8 of the DCO 
and shown coloured "yellow" on the Land Plans (Document 
Reference 2.5). Schedule 8 of the DCO refers to the numbered works 
set out in Schedule 1 to the DCO and shown on the Works Plan 
(Document Reference 2.6) and to the plot numbers as referenced in 
the Book of Reference and Land Plans (Document References 4.3 
and 2.5 respectively).  The status of negotiations with owners and 
occupiers is summarised in Table 2 below. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57

6.6.3 
Where MPL is seeking either land or new rights over land, then 
temporary use of such land is also sought (this is provided for in 
Articles 28 and 29). As such, these parcels are shown as pink or blue 
in accordance with the above conventions but are also subject to 
Articles 28 and 29 of the DCO, in the same way as for "yellow" land. 
The reason for seeking temporary use powers over this land as well, 
is that it allows the Applicant to enter on to land for particular 
purposes (including site preparation works) in advance of any vesting 
of the relevant land/rights.

June 2017, the landowners were successfully 
contacted. Discussions are taking place 
between the landowners and MPL's agents, 
Cater Jonas, and formal offers were issued by 
Carter Jonas on 22 September 2017. No

Mr Hughes on 9th September 2017 to discuss 
the timing of the project and any impacts on 
the landowner. An updated offer has been 
issued by Carter Jonas on behalf of MPL on 
22nd September 2017 following completed 
assessments 
that

6.7 
Alternatives to Compulsory Acquisition   
6.7.1 
The Project requires the acquisition of land and the acquisition 
of/creation of rights (including restrictive covenants) to secure the 
land and rights (together with the areas of land to be used by MPL in 
relation to the Project) needed to provide the Power Generation Plant, 
the Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection. Accordingly, there 
is no alternative but to seek to acquire land, the temporary use of land 
and the acquisition of/creation of rights to allow the Project to be 
constructed, operated and maintained.  
6.7.2 
As set out in Chapter 5 of the ES and the Consultation Report 
(Document References 6.1 and 5.1 respectively) MPL has studied 
various alternatives at relevant stages prior to the making of the 
Application. These are set out in summary below. 
6.7.3 
The ES explains further the studies made of: 
(a) 
Alternative development sites;  
(b) 
Alternative technologies for electricity generation; 
(c) 
Alternative options for the Gas Connection; and 
(d) 
Alternative options for the Electrical Connection. 
6.7.4 
The Consultation Report explains further how community and 
statutory consultees have influenced considerations as to alternative 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
43 
layouts for the Power Generation Plant and alternative options for the 
Electrical Connection and the Gas Connection.  
6.7.5 
As to alternative development sites, a range of sites around the UK 
have been studied to ascertain their suitability to support power 
generation plants of the Project's nature. The key factors which were 
considered necessary in a site were broadly four-fold: technical (e.g. 
the size of the site and the proximity to appropriate gas and electrical 
connection points), environmental, economic, and whether the 
proposals would be in line with local planning policy. On such basis 
the Project Site was considered suitable: 
(a) 
it is of sufficient size and of a suitable shape to 
accommodate the Project and is available to MPL; 
(b) 
it has good accessibility;  
(c) 
the location of the Power Generation Plant is on previously 
developed land and constructing and operating the Project 
on it would be compatible with the development plan;  
(d) 
it avoids environmentally sensitive areas; and 
(e) 
local adverse and environmental impacts are capable of 
being minimised to an acceptable degree when considered 
in the context of the wider public benefits of the Project. 
6.7.6 
As to alternative technologies for electricity generation, three 
technology options were originally considered for the Power 
Generation Plant operating as a peaking plant: OCGT plant, CCGT 
plant and RGE plant. The potential for using CHP opportunities using 
these technologies was also considered. These alternatives were 
considered from environmental, technical and economic perspectives 
and it was found that a OCGT plant would likely perform better 
economically and with short start-up times (paying due regard to the 
Capacity Mechanism, the likely market regime), and lower impacts in 
respect of water usage, visual impact, noise and land take. 
6.7.7 
As to alternative options for the Gas Connection, the Project Scoping 
Report described a gas connection ‘Opportunity Area’, to the south 
and east of the Generating Equipment Site, somewhere in which a 
new underground gas Pipeline and AGI would be developed. 
Following publication of the Scoping Report, further studies refined 
this Opportunity Area such that there were two remaining gas 
connection route corridor options presented in the PEIR and formally 
consulted upon in 2014. A preferred gas connection route and AGI 
location were also presented within the more southerly route corridor 
option at that consultation stage. Based on further refinement and 
feedback received during statutory consultation, this has been 
narrowed down further to one option which was presented in the 
PEIR and formally consulted upon in 2017. This option was selected 
because it is shorter (and therefore less expensive and less 
damaging to agricultural land) and it also avoids crossing the midland 
mainline railway line.

6.7.8 
As to alternative options for the Electrical Connection, the Scoping 
Report for the Project described an electrical connection opportunity 
area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Following publication of 
the Scoping Report, further studies were undertaken to refine the 
available options. Studies undertaken up to statutory consultation and 
feedback received during the statutory consultation determined that 
the most suitable location for the Substation was within Rookery 
South Pit, adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. However, a 
number of options still existed on the best way to connect the 
substation to the existing NETS. These included the use of an 
overhead line connection requiring up to 6 additional pylons. 
Following further refinement studies and feedback received during 
statutory consultation, it has been determined, however, that the most 
appropriate method of connecting into the NETS would be via 
underground cables and two SECs.  
6.7.9 
MPL therefore considers that all reasonable alternatives have been 
considered prior to the making of the DCO Application and such 
consideration has included reasonable factors at relevant stages, 
such as consultee comments, technical feasibility, the anticipated 
market regime, and the minimisation of environmental and visual 
impacts and land take.  
6.8 
Availability of Funds for Compensation  
6.8.1 
The Funding Statement (Document Reference 4.2) confirms that MPL 
has the ability to procure the financial resources required for the 
Project, including the cost of acquiring any land and rights and the 
payment of compensation, as applicable.  
6.8.2 
MPL therefore considers that the Secretary of State can be satisfied 
that the requisite funds for payment of compensation will be available 
at the appropriate time.

Compelling Case 
7.1.1 
A Planning Statement (Document Reference 10.1) accompanies the 
DCO Application. In addition to the information set out above, the 
Planning Statement explains how the Project:- 
(a) 
meets an urgent need for new energy infrastructure;  
(b) 
is a form of economic development that is suitable in its local 
context; 
(c) 
minimises or mitigates adverse landscape and amenity 
impacts to an acceptable degree; 
(d) 
minimises or mitigates adverse environmental impacts to an 
acceptable degree;  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons

(e) 
is compliant with NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS 
EN-5 and in accordance with the other decision-making 
factors specified in Section 104 of the PA 2008.  
7.1.2 
The Planning Statement (Document Reference 10.1) provides an 
extensive review of these matters, which is summarised in the 
subsequent paragraphs of this section.  
7.2 
The Urgent Need for New Gas Fired Power Station Infrastructure  
7.2.1 
The urgent need for flexible gas fired power generating stations is 
acknowledged in recent policy of government at all levels, such as 
within NPS EN-1, the National Infrastructure Plan 2014 (HM 
Treasury, 2014) and the Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012). 
7.2.2 
National Policy Statements acknowledge the substantial national 
need for gas generation infrastructure to respond to changes in 
supply and demand and to replace the capacity that will be lost 
through the closure of existing large coal plants, to which the Project 
will directly contribute.  
7.2.3 
Gas-fired generating stations are very well suited to meeting ‘peak’ 
load demands as they can be specified with very reliable, flexible 
technology. Peaking plants operate for up to 2,250 hours per year 
and help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity demand 
and also help to support the grid at times when intermittent renewable 
sources cannot generate electricity. The chosen technology for a 
peaking plant should maximise reliability for an intermittent pattern of 
usage, and short start-up time. 
7.2.4 
With the substantial recent and forecast increases in intermittent 
sources on the grid, ‘peaking’ plants have a valuable role in ‘evening 
out’ the power supply to the grid and thus complementing renewable 
sources, as supported by the National Policy Statements. 
7.2.5 
In the fifth Annual Energy Statement (AES) (2014), DECC reiterated 
the need to build new power generation infrastructure and 
acknowledged the need for gas to continue to feature strongly in the 
energy mix, stating at paragraph 41 “to ensure the UK has a secure 
supply of electricity into the next decade, the Government is 
introducing a Capacity Market, which will drive new investment in gas 
and demand side capacity to help keep the lights on, as well as 
getting the best out of our existing generation fleet as we transition to 
a low carbon electricity future.”   
7.2.6 
Accordingly it can be seen that the Project, being a gas fired OCGT 
generating station with integral grid connections, can contribute to the 
immediate and medium term needs for flexible, reliable, peak load 
power generation and facilitate the transition to a low carbon 
economy. It therefore makes a material contribution to attaining UK 
energy policy objectives.

7.3 
Economic development considerations 
7.3.1 
NPS EN-2 notes that “Fossil fuel generating stations have large land 
footprints and will therefore only be possible where the applicant is 
able to acquire a suitably-sized site” (NPS EN-2, paragraph 2.2.2). It 
is also notes that “Applicants should locate new fossil fuel generating 
stations in the vicinity of existing transport routes wherever possible.” 
These factors, along with consideration of the nature and intensity of 
neighbouring land uses and the proximity of grid connections to 
minimise construction effects on the surrounding area, have been 
taken into account in selecting the site (see the alternatives section at 
paragraph 6.7 above).  
7.3.2 
The Project site is within Rookery South Pit, which is a disused 
former clay extraction pit of approximately 95 ha. The area has been 
identified as being potentially suitable for energy infrastructure. 
Further, the area has a well-developed road network for access to the 
Project Site and is located in close proximity to the National Electricity 
Transmission System and the gas National Transmission System. 
7.3.3 
The Environmental Statement, Chapter 14 (Document Reference 6.1) 
deals with the socio economic impacts of the Project and its findings 
are summarised below:  
(a) 
During construction and decommissioning the Project will 
have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of 
the area through both employment creation (up to 150 jobs 
during the 22 month construction period) and capital 
expenditure and worker spending in the local economy.  
(b) 
During operation the Project is anticipated to bring slight 
beneficial effects to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site 
through the generation of jobs (up to 10 full time equivalent 
permanent jobs during operation as well as other contracts 
(e.g. maintenance) which would be offered locally where 
possible) and investment of staff from e.g. spending their 
wages locally. 
(c) 
No likely significant impacts are predicted on tourism and 
community infrastructure as a result of the construction and 
operation of the Project from visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts, given that assessments 
in Chapters 11, 7, 12 and 6 respectively have concluded that 
there will be no likely significant effects arising from these 
areas on tourism or community assets. 
(d) 
There are no likely significant effects when the Project is 
considered cumulatively with other projects, including the 
Covanta Resource Recovery Facility.   
7.3.4 
The CHP Statement contained in the Environmental Statement 
Appendix 5.1 (Document Reference 6.2) explains the considerations 
that have been given to CHP at relevant stages of the evolution of the 
Project and concludes that exporting heat is technically unfeasible for 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
47 
OCGT technology and that there is no regional market for heat in this 
location, no potential future heat requirements in the area that would 
match the unpredictable operational pattern of a peaking power 
station can be identified, and the intermittent operation is inherently 
unsuitable for the likely continuous or regular demands of heat users.  
7.3.5 
In conclusion, it is considered that the Project has been sited, laid out 
and designed with appropriate regard to NPS policies and relevant 
economic development considerations. 
7.4 
Conclusion on the case for the Project  
7.4.1 
The urgent need for energy generation, including gas fired generating 
stations and unabated gas and peaking plants, are provided in NPS 
EN-1 and the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014). The 
Project would contribute materially to meeting this need. 
7.4.2 
Due regard has been paid to all relevant and important 
considerations. These include the findings of community and statutory 
consultation processes which, as documented in the Consultation 
Report (Document Reference 5.1), have influenced considerations as 
to the design and siting of the Project. Local economic development 
and environmental policy designations have been considered in the 
design, siting and mitigation proposals within the Project.  
7.4.3 
The Project is in line with the relevant National Policy Statements, 
being NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5. 
Considerations as to siting, Habitats and Species Regulations, 
alternatives, Good Design, consideration of Combined Heat and 
Power, grid connection, safety, health, nuisance and security have 
been given due consideration as demonstrated in the Environmental 
Statement (Document Reference 6.1) and its appendices (Document 
Reference 6.2 to 6.4), the Design and Access Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2), the Planning Statement (Document Reference 
10.1), and the Grid Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1). 
The Environmental Statement has also assessed all relevant likely 
significant environmental effects and has proposed appropriate 
mitigation wherever feasible (Document Reference 6.1). These are to 
be secured through compliance with various submitted documents 
and further approvals such as under the proposed requirements 
attached to the DCO (Document Reference 3.1). 
7.4.4 
As such, it is considered that there are no relevant matters that give 
rise to adverse impacts sufficient to outweigh the identified benefits of 
the Project. 
7.4.5 
MPL has maintained dialogue throughout the pre-application period 
with local authorities, political representatives and other consultees 
and regulators, and will continue to do so at all relevant stages prior 
to the operation of the Project, if the DCO is made. 
7.4.6 
It is considered that there are no international obligations that would 
be breached if the DCO were made in the terms proposed.

7.4.7 
In conclusion and in line with the factors set out in Section 104 of the 
PA 2008 there is a compelling case in the public interest for the DCO 
to be made in the terms proposed and in the absence of sufficient 
indications to the contrary.

Ordinary Water Course Consent  
8.4.6 
A consent under the Land Drainage Act 1991, as amended by the 
Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (ordinary water course 
consent), may be required for crossing watercourses during 
construction of the Gas Connection, for works to the watercourses / 
drains bordering Rookery Pit. An application would be made by the 
contractor prior to commencement of construction as appropriate. 
Permit to emit CO2 
8.4.7 
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 
require any operator that carries out a 'regulated activity' to have a 
permit. Regulated activities include the combustion of fuels. The 
application for this permit will be progressed in parallel with the 
Environmental Permit application. 
9. 
HUMAN RIGHTS  
9.1 
The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated into UK law the European 
Convention on Human Rights (the "Convention"). The Convention includes 
provisions in the form of Articles, the aim of which is to protect the rights of the 
individual.  
9.2 
The following Articles of the Convention are relevant to the Secretary of 
State's decision as to whether the DCO should be made so as to include 
powers of compulsory acquisition: 
9.2.1 
Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention  
(a) 
this protects the right of everyone to a peaceful enjoyment of 
possessions and provides that no one can be deprived of 
their possessions except in the public interest and subject to 
the relevant national and international laws and principles.  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
53 
9.2.2 
Article 6 
(a) 
this entitles those affected by the powers sought in the DCO 
to a fair and public hearing of any relevant objections they 
may have to the granting of those powers. This includes 
property rights and can include opportunities to be heard in 
the decision making process.  
9.2.3 
Article 8 
(a) 
this 
protects 
private 
and 
family 
life, 
home 
and 
correspondence. No public authority can interfere with these 
rights except such as in accordance with the law and is 
necessary in the interest of national security, public safety or 
the economic well-being of the country.  
9.2.4 
The Secretary of State, as the decision maker, is under a duty to 
consider whether the exercise of powers interacts with the rights 
protected by the Convention.  
9.2.5 
The DCO has the potential to infringe the rights of persons who hold 
interests in land within the Order Limits under Article 1 of the First 
Protocol. Such an infringement is authorised by law so long as: 
(a) 
the statutory procedures for making the DCO are followed 
and there is a compelling case in the public interest for the 
inclusion of powers of compulsory acquisition in the DCO; 
and 
(b) 
the interference with the convention right is proportionate.  
9.2.6 
In preparing the Application, MPL has considered the potential 
infringement of the Convention rights in consequence of the inclusion 
of compulsory acquisition powers within the DCO and has sought to 
minimise the amount of land over which it requires powers of 
compulsory acquisition. MPL considers that there would be a very 
significant public benefit arising from the grant of the DCO. The 
benefit is only realised if the DCO is accompanied by the grant of 
powers of compulsory acquisition. MPL has concluded on balance 
that the significant public benefits outweigh the effects upon persons 
who own property within the Order Land. For those affected by 
expropriation or dispossession, compensation is payable in 
accordance with the statutory compensation code.  
9.2.7 
In relation to Article 6, there has been opportunity to make 
representations regarding the preparation of the Application. In 
accordance with Part 5 of the PA 2008, MPL has consulted with 
persons set out in the categories contained in Section 44 of the PA 
2008, which includes owners of land within the Order Limits and 
those who may be able to make claims either under Sections 7 and 
10 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 in respect of injurious 
affection or under Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973. Also, 
the beneficiaries of rights overridden by the exercise of powers in the 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Statement of Reasons 
 
 
86565416.6\cb57 
54 
DCO would be capable of making claims under Section 10 of the 
Compulsory Purchase Act 1965.  
9.2.8 
Furthermore, representations can also be made in response to any 
notice given under Section 56 of the PA 2008 for consideration at 
examination of the Application by the ExA and in any written 
representations procedure which the ExA decides to uphold or at any 
compulsory acquisition hearing held under Section 92 of the PA 2008.  
9.2.9 
Should the DCO be made, any person aggrieved may challenge the 
DCO in the High Court if they consider that the grounds for doing so 
are made out pursuant to Section 118 of the PA 2008.  
9.2.10 In relation to matters of compensation for land to be acquired, 
affected persons have the right to apply to the Upper Tribunal (Lands 
Chamber), which is an independent judicial body to determine the 
compensation payable.  
9.2.11 For the above reasons, any infringement of the Convention rights of 
those whose interests are affected by the inclusion in the DCO of 
powers of compulsory acquisition, is proportionate and legitimate and 
is in accordance with national and European law. For the reasons set 
out in Sections 6 and 7 of this Statement, MPL considers that there is 
a compelling case in the public interest for the exercise of such 
powers of compulsory acquisition. MPL considers that it would, 
therefore, be appropriate and proportionate for the Secretary of State 
to make the DCO, including the grant of compulsory acquisition 
powers.

CONCLUSIONS 
11.1 
MPL submits, for the reasons explained in this Statement, that the inclusion of 
powers of compulsory acquisition in the DCO for the purposes of the Project 
meets the conditions of Section 122 of the PA 2008 as well as the 
considerations in the Guidance.  
11.2 
The acquisition of land and rights (including restrictive covenants) and the 
temporary use of land, together with the overriding of interests, rights and 
restrictive covenants and the suspension or extinguishment of private rights is 
no more than is reasonably required to facilitate or is incidental to the Project.  
11.3 
Furthermore, the land identified to be subject to compulsory acquisition is no 
more than is reasonably necessary for that purpose and is proportionate, as is 
shown in the DCO (Document Reference 3.1), the Works Plan (Document 
Reference 2.6) and other information both in this Statement and in other 
document accompanying the Application.  
11.4 
The need for the Project, suitability of the Order Limits and the support for 
such projects in NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5 
demonstrate that there is a compelling case in the public interest for the land 
to be acquired compulsorily.  
11.5 
All reasonable alternatives to compulsory acquisition have been explored. 
Given the national and local need for the Project and the support for it found in 
policy, as well as the suitability of the Order Land (for the reasons outlined 
above), compulsory acquisition of the land and rights and the temporary use of 
land, together with the overriding of interests, rights and restrictive covenants 
and the suspension or extinguishment of matters affecting the Order Land 
identified by MPL for the Project is justified.  
11.6 
The proposed interference with the rights of those with an interest in the Order 
Land is for a legitimate purpose, namely the Project, and is necessary and 
proportionate to that purpose. MPL considers that the very substantial public 
benefits to be derived from the proposed compulsory acquisition of the Order 
Land would decisively outweigh the private loss that would be suffered by 
those whose land is to be acquired.  
11.7 
MPL has set out clear and specific proposals regarding how the Order Land 
will be used.

11.8 
The requisite funds are available to meet any costs of land acquisition and 
compensation payable as a result of the use of powers of compulsory 
acquisition.  
11.9 
The purpose of the powers of compulsory acquisition for the Project in the 
DCO is entirely legitimate and justifies interfering with the rights of those 
persons with an interest in the land proposed to be acquired.
