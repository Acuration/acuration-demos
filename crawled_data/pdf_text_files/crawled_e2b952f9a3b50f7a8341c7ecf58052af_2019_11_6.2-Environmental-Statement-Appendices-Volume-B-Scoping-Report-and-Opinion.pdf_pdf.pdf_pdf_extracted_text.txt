Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping 
Report for the Abergelli Power Project (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project’) 
which sets out the proposed scope and content of the EIA to support the 
Development Consent Order (DCO) Application and the method by which it 
is intended to be carried out. The report has been prepared by Orbis Energy 
Limited on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited (APL). 
1.1.2 
The Project as shown on Figure 1 would comprise:  
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by 
natural gas and capable of providing an electrical capacity of up to 
299 Megawatts (MW) comprising:  
 
The 
Generating 
Equipment 
including 
the 
Gas 
Turbine 
Generators and Balance of Plant which are located on the 
Generating Equipment Site;  
 
A new purpose built Access Road either from the Rhyd-y-pandy 
Road to the north (Access Road – Option 1) or the B4489 to the 
west (Access Road – Option 2) to the Generating Equipment 
Site; and  
 
During construction a temporary construction compound (the 
Laydown Area).   
 
A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from either the National Transmission System (NTS) or 
the Local Transmission System (LTS), which is located within the 
Gas Opportunity Area; and 
 
A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) for distribution to homes and businesses which is located 
within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area. 
1.1.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.   
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are 
all integral to the generation of electricity and together are referred to as the 
‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  
1.1.5 
The Project would be situated on farmland located north of Swansea in the 
City and County of Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The approximate 
centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference is 265284, 201431. 
1.1.6 
The Project is described in more detail in Section 3, including the options 
currently under consideration for the Access Road, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection.   
1.2 
Need for and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
There is considerable national need for this type of development, 
acknowledged at all levels of Government policy. National planning policy 
supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the current ageing 
and inevitable closure of older coal fired power plants and the likely increase 
in demand for electricity over the coming decades.  
1.2.2 
The overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1)1 states 
that ‘gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – 
providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon 
generation and to maintain security of supply’ (paragraph 3.6.2).  
1.2.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project provide back-up 
to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which 
is an increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired 
power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity 
power generation.   
1.2.4 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to the 
nature of the electricity generation mix on the NETS. There is therefore a 
clear and significant requirement for further capacity to meet the projected 
need for reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated gas fired peaking plant 
such as the Project could allow for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to 
the NETS, thus playing a role in meeting the energy requirements of the UK 
going forward.   
1.3 
The Applicant 
1.3.1 
The Project Applicant is Abergelli Power Limited (APL). APL is an energy 
development company established for the Project by Watt Power Limited 
(WPL).  
1.3.2 
WPL has been established to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to 
support the UK Government drive to a low carbon economy. Stag Energy 
provides the resources through a management services agreement with 
WPL. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth 
of experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW 
of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of 
which 2,500 MW was delivered in the UK.

WPL currently has two other 299 MW projects being brought forward through 
the planning process. They are Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk) and Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South 
Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk). Both projects are now in the pre-
examination phase following acceptance of the DCO Applications by the 
Planning Inspectorate. 
1.3.4 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to the Gateway Storage Company 
Ltd, which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage facility in the 
East Irish Sea. The project has been consented by the UK Government, the 
Marine Management Organisation and the local planning authority (Barrow-
in-Furness Borough Council, Cumbria). Further information on the project is 
available at www.gatewaystorage.co.uk. 
1.3.5 
WPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. APL recognises the need to 
balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and concerns of 
energy projects and believes this can be responsibly delivered at a local 
level. The Project and supporting infrastructure will be designed and 
developed to high quality, safety and environmental standards.

1.4 
The Consenting Regime and EIA Process 
The Planning Act 2008 
1.4.1 
In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is 
considered to be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under 
the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) if its generating capacity is more than 50 
MW. As the proposed Power Generation Plant would have a generating 
capacity of at least 50 MW, and up to 299 MW, it would be classified as a 
NSIP under Section 14(1)a and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008. Under Section 
31 of the PA 2008, development consent is required for development that is 
or forms part of a NSIP and therefore a DCO Application will be made to the 
Secretary of State (SoS).   
Requirement for an EIA and Notification under Regulation 6(1)(b)  
1.4.2 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the EIA Regulations)2 and regulation 5(2)(a) of The Infrastructure 
Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 20093 
impose procedural requirements, in particular, the carrying out of EIA in 
relation to DCO Applications. All development in Schedule 1 (Schedule 1 
development) requires EIA to be carried out. Development in Schedule 2 
(Schedule 2 development) requires an EIA to be carried out if the project is 
likely to have significant effects on the environment.

1.4.3 
The Project has been identified as a Schedule 1 development and therefore 
the Applicant intends to carry out an EIA for the Project in accordance with 
the EIA Regulations.  The findings of the EIA will be summarised in an 
Environmental Statement (ES) which along with the scoping opinion will be 
submitted alongside the DCO Application.   
Consultation Strategy  
1.4.4 
A consultation strategy will be implemented in accordance with Sections 42, 
47 and 48 of PA 2008 and its associated secondary legislation which will 
allow the local community, statutory consultees and interested parties, 
including persons with an interest in any land that is affected by the DCO 
Application, to comment on and input into the planning and development 
process. All representations made during the consultation process will be 
considered carefully and APL will have regard to all relevant responses prior 
to submission of the DCO Application. The outputs generated from the 
formal statutory consultation will be summarised in a consultation report, 
submitted alongside the DCO Application.  
1.4.5 
A Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) will be agreed with the City 
and County of Swansea Council before being published. The SoCC will set 
out how APL intends to consult with the local community in accordance with 
Section 47 of the PA 2008 throughout the preparation of the DCO 
Application.   
1.4.6 
APL has already commenced some preliminary discussions with various 
departments of City and County of Swansea Council and, where relevant, 
the outcome of these consultations has informed this report.   
1.5 
Purpose of the Scoping Report 
1.5.1 
This Scoping Report represents APL’s formal notification to the SoS under 
regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations. The report sets out the proposed 
scope and content of the EIA to support the DCO Application and the 
method by which it is intended to be carried out.   
1.5.2 
On behalf of the SoS, the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) is requested to 
acknowledge the regulation 6 notification and confirm that the Project is an 
EIA development in accordance with regulation 4(2)(a) of the EIA 
Regulations. In addition, PINS is requested to provide a Scoping Opinion on 
the possible significant environmental effects of all elements of the Project, 
the proposed methodologies to assess the impacts, and the proposed 
structure of the Environmental Statement (ES) (as presented in Sections 4 
and 5 of this report). 
1.5.3 
PINS and consultees are also invited to highlight any additional issues that 
they believe should be addressed within the EIA, and to identify any sources 
of information that may be of interest to APL and the EIA team.

2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 and Policy 
Context 
2.3.1 
The Project is categorised as a NSIP and will be examined by PINS with the 
decision on the DCO Application made by the SoS under the regime 
established by the PA 2008 as described in Chapter 1.   
2.3.2 
As set out in NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy), 
‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-specific energy NPS, 
provides the primary basis for decisions’ (Paragraph 1.1.1). The decision-
maker ‘should start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to 
applications for energy NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2) and on the basis that the 
urgent national need for such projects is settled.   
2.3.3 
Decisions must also be taken by the SoS having regard to the local impact 
reports and any other matters which the SoS ‘thinks are both important and 
relevant to its decision’ (Section 104 of the PA 2008), which may include 
Planning Policy Wales, Development Plan Documents (DPDs) or other 
documents in the Local Development Framework (LDFs).  
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
PA 2008 required new policy to inform decisions on NSIPs in England and 
Wales. Policy for such infrastructure is set out in National Policy Statements 
(NPS). Those that are potentially relevant to the consideration of the DCO 
Application are:  
 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1);  
 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2) 10;   
 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines11; and   
 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure12.

Local Planning Policy 
The City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (UDP)14 
2.6.1 
The City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (UDP) was 
adopted on 10th November 2008. It is the most up to date Development Plan 
covering the administrative area within the City and County of Swansea and 
is used in the determination of planning applications. The UDP sets out a 
range of policies and proposals relating to future development, and deals 
with the use and conservation of land and buildings within the City and 
County up to 2016.   
2.6.2 
Its purpose is to promote sustainable development, protect the environment, 
facilitate regeneration and support community planning by ensuring that 
sufficient land is available for all development needs (for housing, industry 
etc.) and that the allocations are well located in terms of environmental, 
social and economic aspirations.   
2.6.3 
The UDP has allocated the land within the Project Site for coal (R2) as well 
as sand and aggregate resource management (R4).   
Swansea Local Development Plan 
2.6.4 
The Unitary Development Plan (UDP) is to be replaced within the next few 
years by the Swansea Local Development Plan (LDP). The Preferred 
Strategy was published in July 201315 for consultation. The Local 
Development Preferred Strategy is a strategic level planning document that

Project Description 
3.1 
Project Site 
3.1.1 
The Project Site would be situated on pastoral fields north of Swansea in the 
City and County of Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 
m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The farmland is 
currently used for sheep and horse grazing as well as horse training and 
breeding. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses National 
Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station. In addition areas within the Project Site have in the past, been 
subject to a variety of permissions for mineral extraction, inert landfill and 
other commercial activities.   
3.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site would be located primarily within fields 
used for grazing bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and 
defunct hedgerows with substantial gaps in them. There is an existing farm 
road at the northern end of Access Road – Option 1. The Generating 
Equipment Site and Laydown Area are divided into two areas by a soft 
surface horse training track known as ‘the gallops’ with a block of 
broadleaved woodland to the east classified as Ancient Woodland and a Site 
of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). There are also further blocks 
of woodland to the west where Access Road – Option 2 is located. The land 
within the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m above 
Ordnance Datum (AOD) and gently slopes down towards the south. 
3.1.3 
The Gas Connection would lie within the Opportunity Area identified on 
Figure 1 and would either be located to the north, northwest or south of the 
Generating Equipment Site crossing grazing fields bound by hedgerows and 
ditches as well as a public footpath. The fields are interspersed by small 
deciduous copses, some of which are classified as Ancient Woodland and 
SINCs to the north, northeast and northwest of the Generating Equipment 
Site, as identified on Figure 3.   
3.1.4 
The Electrical Connection would lie within the Opportunity Area identified in 
Figure 1 and would be located to the southwest of the Generating Equipment 
Site passing through grass fields and the Aber-gelli-fach plantation which is 
partially designated as a SINC.   
3.1.5 
The Project Site would be accessed from Junction 46 of the M4 either from: 
the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road; or from the west via the B4489 as 
shown on Figure 2.  
Surrounding Area 
3.1.6 
The area surrounding the Project Site is rural with a substantial amount of 
utilities infrastructure in the area. A gas NTS Pipeline, and water pipelines 
cross the Project Site and there is also a network of electricity pylons which 
lead to and from National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations to the 
southwest of Abergelli Farm. Furthermore a Water Treatment Works is 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

located immediately to the northwest while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park is 
located to the east of Project Site.   
3.1.7 
The closest residential dwellings to the Project Site are:  
 
Abergelli Farm, located within the Project Site;  
 
Abergelli fawr, located within the Project Site;  
 
Cefn-betingau approximately 400 m to the west; and  
 
Maes-eglwys approximately 176 m to the southwest.   
3.1.8 
Within the Project Site there is a small landfill and the remains of Aber-gelli 
Colliery, both of which are located north of Abergelli Farm.  
3.1.9 
Other features of the area include a number of existing public footpaths, 
bridleways and tracks located in and around the Project Site, linking it to the 
wider area. In addition within the Project Site there are a number of springs 
with their associated streams and drainage ditches which discharge into the 
Afon Llan. 
3.2 
Description of the Project  
3.2.1 
The elements of the Project are described below. The description is based 
on a ‘Rochdale Envelope’ approach (i.e. a single project with a range of 
parameters). The scope of each of the technical assessments described in 
Chapter 5 has been based on the parameters provided below. Assessing a 
worst case realistic configuration from within the parameters enables an 
assessment of the ‘worst case’ likely significant environmental effects within 
each technical assessment. Each technical chapter within the PEIR and ES 
will identify which parameters represent the ‘worst case’ for that topic. It is 
acknowledged that the parameters may be refined during the design process 
for the Project and following consultation. If this occurs the modified 
parameters will be described and taken into account within the PEIR and ES 
as appropriate.   
3.3 
Power Generation Plant 
3.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be designed as a peaking plant fired by 
natural gas supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the 
Power Generation Plant to the existing NTS. It would have a capacity of up 
to 299 MW (enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes).  
3.3.2 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment would operate for up to 1,500 
hours per year. Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a 
‘stress event’. This occurs when there is a surge in demand for electricity 
associated with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the 
country boil kettles following the end of a popular television programme) or 
where there is a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which 
are constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking plants also help 
to ‘balance out’ the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy

sources, such as wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to 
their intermittent operation and reliance on weather conditions.  
3.3.3 
Given these parameters, it has been determined that a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) plant is the preferred and most appropriate technology 
choice for the Project.   
SCGT Plant 
3.3.4 
There are several alternative types of SCGT plant available to generate up 
to 299 MW. SCGT plants often use aero-derivative gas turbines (i.e. turbines 
derived from aeronautical applications), primarily because of their suitability 
for frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability 
maintenance techniques. For the aero-derivative case, APL envisages using 
three, four or five individual aero-derivative turbine generators to achieve 
299 MW.   
3.3.5 
However, ‘industrial’ type gas turbines can also be used which are typically 
larger and often more suited to longer operational hours. They offer similar 
efficiency but less fast loading flexibility. Industrial gas turbines differ from 
aeronautical designs in that the casings, rotors and blading are of heavier 
construction. For the industrial gas turbine case, it is anticipated that one or 
two individual industrial gas turbine generators will be used to achieve 299 
MW.   
3.3.6 
The main equipment in a SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising the 
following components:  
 
Inlet air filter; 
 
Air compressor; 
 
Combustion chamber; 
 
Power turbine(s); and  
 
Exhaust silencer.   
3.3.7 
Air on entering the gas turbines, would be compressed and natural gas 
injected into the air. The natural gas would then burn in the combustion 
chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would then expand 
across the blades of the gas turbine driving the electrical generators to 
produce electricity.   
3.3.8 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process would then be 
released to the atmosphere via between one and five stacks (chimneys). 
The stack(s) would contain equipment which will reduce emissions released 
to the atmosphere.   
3.3.9 
A stack height sensitivity study will be undertaken for the Project to 
determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generators, 
required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air 
quality targets. This height would apply to all technology choices, as 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

discussed above, and would not be dependent on the number of units 
present at the Generating Equipment Site.  
3.3.10 The DCO Application will therefore be flexible enough using the Rochdale 
Envelope approach to allow APL to achieve a 299 MW project by building 
between one to five Gas Turbine Generators, with up to five exhaust gas flue 
stacks. Figure 4 shows a simple schematic of SCGT operation. 
Figure 4: Schematic of SCGT Operation  
 
Laydown Area 
3.3.11 A temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site 
as shown in Figure 1. It is not proposed that land would be required for a 
permanent maintenance/laydown area during operation.  
Access Road 
3.3.12 A new purpose built Access Road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site. Two options are being considered for access to the 
Generating Equipment Site from Junction 46 of the M4. Access Road - 
Option 1 is from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the existing 
access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm which would need to be 
extended to the Generating Equipment Site, as shown on Figure 1.   
3.3.13 Access Road - Option 2 is from the west via the B4489, along the access 
road to National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and then along a purpose built Access Road to be 
constructed, across undeveloped land to the Generating Equipment Site as 
shown on Figure 1.

Dimensions 
3.3.14 The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be in the order 
of 6 ha. The Generating Equipment may be sited in a number of locations 
within the wider Generating Equipment Site depending on its final design. 
The Generating Equipment Site may also be reduced in size during the 
design process with any changes acknowledged in the PEIR and/or ES.   
3.3.15 Table 3.1 provides indicative dimensions for the main plant items which 
would be present at the Generating Equipment Site.

Construction, Operational and Decommissioning Timescales 
3.3.16 Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months. The main works associated with the construction phase would be 
the removal of hardstanding, excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations, potential piling (if required) and the laying of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections.  
3.3.17 The Power Generation Plant would be designed to have an operational life 
of 25 years, after which time it would be decommissioned or re-powered 
depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy mix at the time. 
For the purposes of the EIA, it would be assumed that the Power Generation 
Plant would be decommissioned.   
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 15 
 
 
3.3.18 Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation Plant 
items and restoration of the Project Site to a similar condition compared to 
before the construction of the Project. This process would also take 
approximately 22 months. It is likely that some underground structures, 
including the Gas and Electrical Connections (if an underground Electrical 
Connection is implemented) may be capped and left in situ to avoid any 
adverse environmental impacts associated with their removal. Due regard 
would be paid to all best practice guidelines and legislation on 
decommissioning of projects which are relevant at the time of the 
decommissioning activities. Where possible, items of plant would be 
recycled or reused.   
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CCS) 
3.3.19 At up to 299MW, the Project would be below the threshold set out in 
Directive 2009/31/EC24 and National Policy Statement EN-1 and EN-2 for 
when operators of combustion plants are required to have assessed the 
feasibility of: a storage site, transport facilities and economic considerations 
of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a result of the 
combustion process. Therefore it is not considered necessary to assess the 
viability of CO2 capture or include it further in this report.   
3.4 
Gas Connection  
3.4.1 
The Gas Connection would be in the form of a new underground gas 
pipeline connection (the Pipeline) and above ground installation (AGI) and is 
required to connect the Generating Equipment to the existing high pressure 
NTS or the LTS HP Pipeline in order to provide a reliable supply of fuel.   
Gas Connection Opportunity Area  
3.4.2 
A Gas Connection Feasibility Study was undertaken in March 2014 to define 
and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating Equipment 
to a suitable source of fuel gas. This identified Feeder 28 of the NTS or a 
nearby LTS HP Pipeline as possible connection points. The location of these 
in relation to the Project Site is shown on Figure 1.   
3.4.3 
At present, investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the 
NTS or LTS HP Pipelines are still ongoing. It is anticipated that the Gas 
Connection would be situated within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area 
which extends north and south from the Generating Equipment Site as 
shown on Figure 1. The Gas Connection Opportunity Area comprises large 
pastoral fields bounded by hedgerows and ditches which slope down 
towards the south and are interspersed by areas of woodland (some of 
which are classified as Ancient Woodland and SINCs) and areas of wet 
grassland (some of which are designated as SINCs) as shown on Figure 3. 
There are also a group of springs to the north of Aber-gelli fawr which feed

into Afon Llan close to the LTS HP Pipeline. The feeder for the NTS which 
feeds into and out of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station crosses through 
the Project Site between the Gas Compressor Station and Abergelli Farm.   
3.4.4 
Specific connection options will be explored and further refined to a single 
Gas Connection Route prior to submission of the DCO Application. Due 
regard will be paid to relevant factors including environmental, planning, 
safety, engineering and constructability. Further details of the options being 
considered will be provided to consultees when they are available and the 
selected option will be assessed in the PEIR and ES that will be submitted in 
support of the DCO Application.   
Connection to the NTS or LTS HP Pipeline 
3.4.5 
Connection of the Pipeline to the NTS or LTS HP Pipeline would require two 
Above Ground Installations (AGIs) to be installed which will include: a 
Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC) facility, which would be owned by 
National Grid Company (NGC); and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) which will be 
owned by APL. 
3.4.6 
The MOC (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain: 
 
Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.7 
The PTF (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain:  
 
PIG launching facility; 
 
Emergency control valve (possible); 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and  
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.8 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at a PTF on the Generating 
Equipment Site. A further facility known as the Gas Receiving Facility (GRF) 
would be situated downstream of the PTF within the Generating Equipment 
Site. The PTF would contain the following equipment:  
 
PIG receiving facility;  
 
Emergency control valve (possible); and  
 
Isolation valves.  
3.4.9 
The GRF would contain the following equipment:

3.4.10 The PTF and GRF would be sited close to each other and if possible they 
will be joined on a single plot.   
3.5 
Electrical Connection  
3.5.1 
The Electrical Connection will comprise all the necessary elements to enable 
power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS such as 
new electrical circuits (either in the form of an underground cable or 
overhead line). 
3.5.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Project Site in March 
2014 in order to define and evaluate the options available for connecting the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS. The most suitable point of connection is 
currently anticipated to be a cable terminal chamber on the Gas Insulated 
Switchgear (GIS) circuit at the point where the underground cable or 
overhead line emerges to facilitate its connection into the NETS.   
3.5.3 
If the connection is via an underground export cable then a Sealing End 
Compound (SEC) would be required. It is possible that the SEC would be 
required off site from the Generating Equipment Site depending on the 
configuration of the Electrical Connection.   
Electrical Connection Opportunity Area (Underground or Overhead) 
3.5.4 
Specific route corridor options for the Electrical Connection have not been 
identified at present, with options being investigated within an area referred 
to as the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area to the southwest of the 
Generating Equipment Site as shown on Figure 1.   
3.5.5 
The area comprises gently sloping pastoral land grazed by sheep and 
horses with areas of wet grassland to the east and scrub and deciduous 
woodland to the west. Some of these areas are designated as SINCs with 
areas of the woodland also classified as Ancient Woodland, as shown on 
Figure 3. The field boundaries are delineated by fences with defunct 
hedgerows and drainage ditches. The nearest residential properties to the 
Electrical Connection Opportunity Area are Lletty Morfil, Abergelli Farm and 
Maes-eglwys. There is one public right of way within the area which follows 
the boundary of the Felindre Gas Compression Station.   
3.5.6 
Two existing National Grid double circuit 400kV overhead lines are located 
on an approximate southwest-northeast alignment through the Project Site.   
3.5.7 
Specific connection options will be explored and further refined to a single 
Electrical Connection route prior to submission of the DCO Application. Due

regard will be paid to relevant factors including environmental, planning and 
feasibility. Further details of the options being considered will be provided to 
consultees when they are available and the selected option will be assessed 
in the PEIR and ES that will be submitted in support of the DCO Application.   
3.6 
Project Site Selection/Design Evolution 
3.6.1 
The choice of site for the Power Generation Plant has been carefully 
considered with various sites and a number of relevant factors looked at 
during this process in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of the NPS EN-1 and 
NPS EN-2. Key factors included in the selection of the Power Generation 
Plant Site are:  
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Electrical Connection point; 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Gas Connection point; 
 
It is in a developed setting dominated by the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and National Grid’s two 400kV electrical 
substations ; and 
 
It has a well-developed road network and access to the Project Site.  
3.6.2 
The final choice of the Gas and Electrical Connection routes would be 
selected following further consultation and a more thorough assessment of 
constraints and environmental impacts. 
3.6.3 
In terms of design evolution of the Project, the following technology options 
were originally considered for the 299 MW Power Generation Plant: SCGT 
plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; and Reciprocating Gas 
Engines (RGE) plant.   
3.6.4 
SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant at the Project Site based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations:  
 
Visual impact: SCGT plant require shorter stack(s) compared to 
CCGT plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the 
surrounding environment; 
 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is 
significantly lower than for a CCGT plant; 
 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant would 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE 
units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate 
up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
 
Financial: based on the current electricity market, it is essential that 
the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly 
cost effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance 
out the National Grid and meet changing demands of customers. 
SCGT plants are better suited to this type of operational regime; and  
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 19 
 
 
 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better 
suited to meeting variable demands.   
3.6.5 
The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also 
considered. However it is not technically or economically feasible with a 
SCGT peaking power station because the profile for the generation of 
electrical energy from the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the 
required heat demand profile of any potential customer.   
3.6.6 
A more detailed appraisal of the Project Site selection process and design 
evolution would be set out in the PEIR and ES.

Scope and Structure of the EIA 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This Chapter describes the proposed scope and structure for the EIA that 
will be undertaken to support the DCO Application in accordance with the 
EIA Regulations. The key output of the EIA process is ultimately the ES, 
which sets out the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The 
ES will enable PINS, consultees and the SoS to understand the anticipated 
environmental impacts and effects of the Project. 
4.1.2 
To allow for a precautionary approach, the assessments in the ES will be 
based on a realistic worst case scenario specific to each topic based on the 
Rochdale Envelope parameters as described in Chapter 3.     
4.2 
Overall ES Structure 
4.2.1 
Table 4.1 sets out the proposed structure of the ES. A number of supporting

(NRW), City and County of Swansea and PINS. 
This will draw on the Ecology chapter of the ES 
(described in Section 5.5 below). 
4.3 
Cumulative Assessment 
4.3.1 
In accordance with the EIA Regulations, the EIA will take into account other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site and will consider the 
cumulative impacts associated with these development in-conjunction with 
the Project. Developments considered within the cumulative assessment 
include those that are:  
 
In the process of being built; 
 
Permitted application(s) but not yet implemented; 
 
Submitted application(s) not yet determined; 
 
Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects; 
 
Projects identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging 
development plants – with appropriate weight being given as they 
move closer to adoption) recognising that information on the relevant 
proposals will be limited; and  
 
Projects identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) 
which set the framework for future development consents/approvals, 
where such development is reasonably likely to come forward.   
4.3.2 
At present, it is anticipated that the following developments will be 
considered as part of the cumulative assessment.   
 
Planning Application 2013/0795 – Installation of four 5 kW wind 
turbines 120.7 m to tip and associated infrastructure at Myle Coch 
Mawr;

 
Planning Application 2013/0135 – Installation of ground mounted 
array of solar panels, inverter substations and 2.4 m high fencing on 
land at Abergelli Farm.  This development would be located within the 
Gas Connection Opportunity Area on the Project Site. 
 
Planning Application 2013/1639 (Rhyd-y-pandy Solar Park) – 
Construction of 7 MW solar park consisting of installation of up to 
28,250 photovoltaic panels and up to six inverter/transformer cabins, 
a single control building and provision of security fencing.   
4.3.3 
Further to these individual planning applications, proposed development 
within the Swansea Vale Development Area will also be considered for 
assessment of any significant cumulative impacts. Swansea Vale is situated 
approximately 5 km from the Project Site and extends to some 190 ha south 
of a railway line and the M4.  
4.3.4 
In addition during the EIA other developments may be identified if more 
information becomes publicly available.   
4.3.5 
Any views on the inclusion of any particular cumulative scheme will be 
welcome as part of the Scoping Opinion.

Detailed Description of ES Impact Sections 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This chapter provides a description of the proposed EIA. It addresses each 
proposed ES technical chapter and describes the current understanding of 
the baseline conditions and assessment methodology for each discipline that 
will determine the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. 
Potential mitigation measures have also been identified where appropriate, 
although these will be set out in detail in the ES. Consultees are invited to 
comment on the methodologies within their scoping responses.  
5.1.2 
Although the sections below deal with the Project as a whole, it is anticipated 
that the ES technical chapters will be sub-divided allowing the assessment of 
effects during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases, 
description of mitigation measures and residual effects to be addressed 
separately for the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connections as well as together for the overall Project. Cumulative effects 
will be assessed for the Project as a whole.  
5.1.3 
The sections described are set out in the following list:  
 
Air Quality (5.3);  
 
Noise and Vibration (5.4);  
 
Ecology (5.5);  
 
Water Quality and Resources (5.6);  
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (5.7);  
 
Landscape and Visual (5.8);  
 
Traffic, Transport and Access (5.9);  
 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (5.10); and 
 
Socio-Economics (5.11). 
5.2 
Significance Criteria 
5.2.1 
The significance of environmental effects resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project will generally be categorised 
using a series of matrices. These will be developed to describe the 
sensitivity of receptors and resources which have the potential to be 
impacted by the Project and the magnitude of any impacts that are likely to 
arise. The sensitivity of receptors and resources and magnitude of impact 
will be cross-referenced to give an overall significance of effect for any 
potential impact. Where it is not possible to quantify impacts, qualitative 
assessments will be carried out, based on available knowledge and 
professional judgement. 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 25 
 
 
5.2.2 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of effects 
upon different environmental components, the assessments will generally 
follow the structure and use the terminology outlined below in Tables 5.1 to 
5.3. However for some sections, significance criteria may need to differ 
depending on the assessment methodology used. Each technical chapter of 
the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria used as well as 
defining what constitutes a significant impact and/or effect. 
5.2.3 
Potential mitigation measures described in the ES will include embedded 
mitigation through design/standard control measures (which will be used to 
produce an initial assessment of impact) and any further specific mitigation 
required (which will be taken into account to produce an assessment of 
residual impacts).

Air Quality 
Introduction 
5.3.1 
The air quality assessment will consider potentially significant air quality 
impacts 
and 
effects 
caused 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project on sensitive human and ecological receptors 
in and around the vicinity of the Project Site. Potential effects could include 
those that result from dust during construction and decommissioning and 
stack emissions during operation of the Gas Turbine Generators.

Baseline 
5.3.2 
Existing ambient air quality and baseline conditions will be reviewed using 
available air quality monitoring data and the most recent local authority 
publications published in accordance with their duties under the Environment 
Act 199525. The assessment will include particular consideration of: 
designated Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs); any relevant previous 
studies undertaken in the area; the location of sensitive receptors (including 
designated ecological sites and Morriston Hospital); and other significant 
sources of emissions. 
5.3.3 
The nearest AQMA is Swansea Air Quality Management Area 2010 which is 
in the Lower Swansea Valley encompassing the areas of Hafod, Sketty and 
Fforestfach26. It is approximately 4.5 km from the Project Site and has been 
declared primarily on the basis of traffic related NO2.  
5.3.4 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station is present within the Project Site and 
occasionally flares and therefore the emissions will be considered as part of 
the baseline conditions. Further consultation will be sought with The City and 
County of Swansea Council and National Resources Wales (NRW) to 
determine a definitive list of significant emission sources to consider as part 
of the air quality assessment.  
5.3.5 
The existing air quality concentrations at sensitive ecologically designated 
sites will be obtained from DEFRA27. The existing acid and nutrient nitrogen 
deposition rates will be obtained from the UK Air Pollution Information 
System (UK APIS).28  
5.3.6

Assessment 
5.3.9 
The assessment methodology will be agreed in consultation with the 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at City and County of Swansea Council 
and NRW.   
5.3.10 The emissions of dust during the construction and decommissioning phases 
of the Project will be assessed in accordance with ‘Guidance on the 
Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air Quality and the 
Determination of their Significance’ (IAQM, 2012)29 and the Department for 
Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 
Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality’ and the associated DMRB Screening Method, 
developed by the Highways Agency30. The significance of the potential 
impacts identified will be determined based on the sensitivity of the identified 
receptors within the potential zones of influence outlined in the IAQM 
Guidance.  
5.3.11 The air quality assessment for the operational phase will follow the 
Environment Agency documents ‘Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f): 
Air Emissions’31 and the Environment Agency Air Quality Modelling and 
Assessment Unit (AQMAU) ‘Air dispersion modelling report requirements (for 
detailed air dispersion modelling)’32. The conversion of NOx to NO2, as 
applicable for the protection of human health under the UK Air Quality 
Standards Regulations 201033, will adopt the approach outlined in the 
AQMAU Guidance Note ‘Conversion Ratios for NOx and NO2’ (2006)34.  
5.3.12 As a peaking plant, the operation of the Generating Equipment will be limited 
through the permitting regime to 1500 hours per annum. The assessment 
will, therefore, be based on the operation of the Generating Equipment, at 
full load, for 1500 hours per annum.  
5.3.13 The atmospheric emissions from the operation of the Generating Equipment 
will be quantified by obtaining information from relevant plant suppliers. 
Where two or more suppliers are being considered, a realistic worst case 
scenario will be used to ensure flexibility. However, only plant that meet 
national emissions limits will be considered.  
5.3.14 The atmospheric dispersion modelling will be performed using the 
Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC) Air Dispersion 
                                                                 
29 IAQM (2012)Guidance on the Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air Quality and the

Modelling Software (ADMS 5.0). An air dispersion model will be set up that 
considers the effects of terrain and buildings (as appropriate to the location 
of the Generating Equipment), together with the most recent available 
meteorological data covering a consecutive five year period (e.g. 2009 to 
2014, inclusive) in accordance with current guidance.  
5.3.15 The modelling assessment will estimate the mass concentration of NOx and 
CO at sensitive receptors using the emission limits as specified in Part 2 of 
Annex V to the IED. Initial screening runs will be undertaken to determine an 
acceptable stack height suitable for adequate dispersion based on predicted 
maximum short term and long term ground level concentrations. Detailed 
atmospheric dispersion modelling will then be undertaken on the basis of the 
selected stack height.  
5.3.16 The results of the detailed dispersion modelling will be presented as 
isopleths, and compared with background levels and relevant standards and 
guidelines (i.e. the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010). Direct 
comparison will be made between the long-term and short-term process 
contributions from the Generating Equipment, the predicted environmental 
concentrations of relevant substances (i.e. process contribution plus 
background levels) and the limits and objectives within the relevant Air 
Quality Standards Regulations 2010. Where appropriate, the significance of 
the potential impact will be determined using the criteria set out in the 
‘Development Control: Planning for Air Quality’ (EPUK, 2010) in conjunction 
with the Environment Agency Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f).   
5.3.17 The abatement of emissions will be discussed in relation to application of 
Best Available Techniques (BAT), in accordance with the Environment 
Agency Sector Guidance Note for Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01)35 and 
the UK’s position with regards to the on-going review of the EU IPPC 
Reference Document on BAT for Large Combustion Plants36. Should 
additional mitigation prove to be necessary, the severity of impact, frequency 
of emissions and the resultant environmental risk associated with any 
residual impact will be examined.  
5.3.18 Changes in air quality levels for NOx will be assessed with respect to ecology 
for the European and nationally designated habitat sites within 10 km of the 
Project Site (including, but not necessarily limited to, those identified above). 
The non-statutory habitat sites within 2 km of the Project Site will also be 
considered. An assessment of the increased deposition of both nutrient 
nitrogen and acid due to nitrogen will also be carried out at the statutory 
(both EU and UK) designated sites in accordance with the methodologies 
described in the Environment Agency AQMAU ‘AQTAG06 Technical 
Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate assessment for 
emissions to air’37.

5.3.19 It is considered that there would not be any noticeable odours associated 
with the operation of the Generating Equipment at or beyond the boundary of 
the Generating Equipment Site and therefore it is not considered necessary 
to undertake a detailed assessment of odour.   
5.3.20 The operation of the Gas and Electrical Connections would not produce any 
significant emissions and therefore these elements of the assessment during 
operation have been scoped out.  
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.3.21 An outline Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be 
drafted and appended to the ES which will set out best practice methods of 
limiting dust on site during construction and decommissioning.   
5.3.22 During operation, the Generating Equipment would operate as a peaking 
plant, with operations limited to 1,500 hours per year. This operating limit will 
be set out in the site permit and will not be exceeded. In addition, embedded 
mitigation measures will include: incorporating stack(s) of sufficient height to 
achieve adequate dispersal of pollutants; and using flue gas cleaning 
equipment if required to ensure that all emissions are within concentrations 
permitted by legislation and guidance.   
5.3.23 The need or otherwise for further, project specific mitigation measures will be 
addressed within the ES chapter. 
5.4 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
5.4.1 
In accordance with Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1, a noise and vibration 
assessment will consider potentially significant noise and vibration impacts 
and effects caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of 
the Project on Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) in and around the vicinity 
of the Project Site 
Baseline 
5.4.2 
The Project Site would be sited within pastoral fields interspersed by scrub 
and deciduous woodland in a rural area with the National Grid’s two 400kV 
electrical substations and Felindre Gas Compressor Station in the western 
extent of the Project Site. There are currently no sources of significant noise 
or vibration within close proximity to the Project Site other than that 
associated with nearby agricultural activities, Team Force Swansea Paintball 
Centre and a skip hire business as well as the M4 motorway approximately 
1.5 km to the south.  National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station are assumed to operate within agreed 
thresholds.   
5.4.3 
The closest NSRs within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau, Llwyncelyn and Felindre. In

addition there are also isolated dwellings and farmsteads outside of the 
settlements including but not exclusive to:  
 
Aber gelli fawr; 


Assessment 
5.4.4 
The assessment methodology will be agreed with the EHO at the City and 
County of Swansea Council.   
5.4.5 
Construction and decommissioning noise and vibration assessments of the 
Project will be undertaken following the guidance in British Standard (BS) 
522838. The assessment will be undertaken as a desk study and shall 
involve:  
 
Identification of construction and decommissioning activities that 
produce significant noise and vibration;   
                                                                 
38 British Standards Institute (2009) BS 5228-1: Code of practice for noise and vibration control on 
construction and open sites

Doc Ref: Orbis P1079/04/01 Rev 05 
Page No: 34 
 
 
 
Identification 
of 
NSRs 
within 
100 
m 
of 
construction 
and 
decommissioning activities; and 
 
Prediction of noise and vibration using the methodology contained 
within BS5228.  
5.4.6 
The exact construction and decommissioning methodologies are unlikely to 
be defined until the construction contractor is appointed, which is likely to be 
after the submission of the DCO Application. However, in the absence of this 
information, an outline construction programme will be developed based on 
knowledge and experience of other similar developments. Additionally, the 
typical make up of construction equipment at each stage of the project 
programme will be ascertained in the same way. For ground improvement 
works (e.g. piling) the noise and vibration assessment will pay due regard to 
the ground conditions at the Generating Equipment Site. Where 
uncertainties exist, realistic worst case assumptions will be used.  
5.4.7 
The quantification of impacts shall be undertaken by comparison with agreed 
project criteria or limits either from previous schemes and relevant guidance 
and standards such as BS5228, BS647239 and BS738540, or local legislative 
requirements. The desk study shall outline suitable measures for the 
mitigation of construction and decommissioning impacts, and an assessment 
of residual impacts and effects.   
5.4.8 
Operational noise will be assessed using the methodology from a 
combination of: BS414241; BS823342; and WHO Guidelines for Community 
Noise43. The likelihood of complaints about noise from industrial 
developments will be predicted using the following criteria from BS4142:  
 
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints;  
 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints are 
likely; 
 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance; and 
 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured background 
noise level then this is a positive indication that complaints are 
unlikely.  
5.4.9 
The guidance contained in BS8233 will also be used to assess the effects on 
indoor ambient noise levels in living rooms and bedrooms of NSRs when 
they are unoccupied.

5.4.10 The WHO ‘Guidelines for Community Noise’ provides health-based guidance 
on suitable noise levels intended to avoid or minimise community annoyance 
by noise. The guidance provides guideline noise levels for both indoor and 
outdoor areas.   
5.4.11 It is proposed that the study area for the noise assessment of operational 
effects shall be defined as the region within 1 km of the Project Site. All 
sensitive receptors, such as residential properties, hospitals, schools, etc. 
within the study area shall be identified in the assessment.  
5.4.12 A baseline noise survey will then be undertaken in the vicinity of the Project 
Site to establish the current baseline noise levels. The locations for the 
baseline noise survey (i.e. locations of the nearest NSRs) will be agreed in 
advance with the EHO.   
5.4.13 Following baseline noise measurements, a noise model will be produced 
using Cadna software (3-dimensional noise propagation software) which will 
model the measured baseline levels at NSRs, together with sound power 
levels of proposed plant (obtained from relevant suppliers). Where sound 
power levels for proposed plant are not available, suitable data will be 
substituted, although a realistic worst case scenario would always be 
considered. The noise model will highlight the main noise sources and the 
associated noise levels at the NSR locations. Contour plots will also be 
produced clearly showing noise levels at the Project Site, NSRs and 
surrounding areas.   
5.4.14 If the model shows that there is potential for a significant effect to be 
generated by noise from any of the NSRs, the level of required noise 
mitigation would be specified, and measures that could be used to achieve 
this level of mitigation will be incorporated into the model, to provide a ‘with 
mitigation’ scenario.  
5.4.15 The ES section will be compiled using the Institute of Acoustics (IoA) / 
Institute for Environmental Management (IEMA) draft document ‘Guidelines 
for Noise Impact Assessment’44.  
5.4.16 The operation of the Gas Connection is not anticipated to cause any 
significant increase in background noise or vibration and therefore this 
element has been scoped out of the assessment.   
5.4.17 Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has been scoped out as 
there would be no significant effects associated with the potential for a low 
level electrical hum emanating from an overhead line option, if one is 
required. In addition if a SEC is required, any low level electrical hum 
associated with the infrastructure will not be perceptible at the NSRs and 
therefore this has also been scoped out of the assessment.

Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.4.18 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting noise and vibration on site during 
construction and decommissioning.   
5.4.19 During operation, mitigation measures could include the use of silencers on 
the loudest plant items within the Generating Equipment.   
5.5 
Ecology 
Introduction 
5.5.1 
An ecology assessment will consider potentially significant impacts and 
effects caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project on ecological resources and receptors in and around the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
Baseline  
5.5.2 
The Project Site is predominantly on pastoral farmland, mostly agriculturally 
improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland and interspersed by 
woodland and scrub. Some of the marshy grassland qualifies as a Section 
42 habitat ‘purple moor-grass and rush pastures’ (under the Natural 
Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC)45) and is designated 
as SINCs. Furthermore areas of the woodland qualify as Section 42 habitat 
‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, some of which is also classified as 
Ancient Woodland and SINCs. The Ancient Woodland and SINCs are shown 
on Figure 3.  
5.5.3 
The fields are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by 
fences running along the line of defunct hedgerows with large gaps. There 
are numerous watercourses on site, mostly in the form of ditches or streams 
along field boundaries. There is a potential for bats, great crested newts, 
dormice, otters, water voles, reptiles, badger, woodland and farmland bird 
species and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to be located within these 
habitats. Full details of the habitats located within the Project Site and the 
potential for protected species and species of conservation importance are 
provided in Appendix A.   
5.5.4 
A desk based assessment (DBA) and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey was 
undertaken at the Project Site during Spring 2014 (see Appendix A). The 
purpose of the assessment and survey were to:  
 
Identify the main habitats present at the Project Site; 
 
Identify the sensitive ecological receptors (e.g. statutory designated 
sites) in the vicinity of the Project Site;

 
Assess the potential of the Project Site to support protected species; 
and  
 
Provide recommendations for further assessment works (e.g. Phase 
2 Protected Species Surveys).   
5.5.5 
The following European Sites are within 10 km of the Project Site:  


5.5.8 
Appendix A provides the full records of the protected species and species of 
conservation concern within 1 km of the Project Site. The main ecological 
value of the Project Site lies with the marshy grassland or ‘purple moor-grass 
and rush pastures’, ‘ponds’ and the ‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ 
which are all Section 42 habitats under the NERC Act and are located within 
SINCs. 
Assessment 
5.5.9 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 (paragraph 5.3.3) the Ecological Impact 
Assessment (EcIA) will provide an assessment of any potentially significant 
effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological 
or geological conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats 
and other species identified as being of principal importance for the 
conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore opportunities will be taken, where 
practicable, to conserve and enhance biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests. NPS EN-1 also requires that lighting effects will be 
considered on sensitive ecological receptors.   
5.5.10 Based on the results of the extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, the following 
Phase 2 protected species surveys are currently being carried out on and 
surrounding the Project Site. 
Bats 
5.5.11 A roped-access tree survey is being carried out for trees to be removed or 
modified that have been identified as having potential to support roosting 
bats. Where the potential for bats to roost in a surveyed tree is confirmed 
then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey will be carried out to 
confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the status of any roost 
present.   
5.5.12 In addition bat activity surveys are being carried out across the Project Site 
in accordance with the guidance provided by Hundt (2012)46 which involves 
walked transect routes carried out monthly between April and October and

an automated survey using static bat detectors. These surveys will 
determine the species of bats present on the Project Site as well as the 
spatial distribution and relative activity levels of these species.   
Great Crested Newts  
5.5.13 Preliminary pond surveys (Habitat Suitability Assessment) indicated that 
there are a number of ponds within 250 m of the Project Site which are 
potentially suitable for great crested newts. An additional four to six surveys 
are being undertaken between mid-March to mid-June to establish presence 
or absence and to estimate population size if great crested newts are found 
during the surveys. More detail on the methodology is provided in Appendix 
A. 
Dormouse 
5.5.14 A dormouse survey is being undertaken following a methodology based on 
those prescribed in best practice guidance (Bright et al, 2006)47. The surveys 
involve the use of dormouse boxes in areas of woodland and nest tubes in 
cluttered environments where boxes cannot be used. The survey is designed 
to detect the presence or absence of dormice.   
Otter and Water Vole 
5.5.15 A survey for water voles and otters along the banks of the water courses is 
being carried out in accordance with best practice guidelines (Chanin 
(2003)48 and Strachan et al., (2011)49 respectively). Signs that water voles 
may be present will be indicated by the presence of feeding remains, 
characteristic grass lawns, burrows, runs, footprints, latrines and droppings.  
Signs that otters may be present will be indicated by the presence of spraints 
and footprints. 
Reptiles 
5.5.16 A reptile survey is being carried out on the Project Site to establish the 
presence/absence of reptiles, the species present and the approximate 
population size. The survey uses artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to 
aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of their distribution and 
abundance, following good practice guidance, including that set out in the 
Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 200350) and Reptile Survey 
Guidance (Froglife, 199951).

Badgers  
5.5.17 All potential habitats within and surrounding the Project Site are being 
surveyed to search for and record characteristic signs of badger activity, 
including: setts, latrine pits, foraging holes, badger hair and paw prints 
following best practice guidance (Neal and Cheesman, 199652). Potential 
habitat includes areas of woodland, scrub and hedgerows. If the Gas 
Connection Route Corridor, once chosen, potentially requires the closure of 
any badger setts then a badger bait marking survey will be carried out 
between early September and mid-October.   
Breeding birds 
5.5.18 The breeding bird survey focuses on the farmland birds (occurring both 
within the Project Site and a buffer of up to 50 m). Their territories are being 
mapped using surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s Common 
Bird Census (CBC) methodology with an initial site visit carried out in mid-
April, followed by additional visits in May and June. 
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.5.19 The block of marshy grassland to the west of Abergelli Farm, will be 
surveyed for marsh fritillary butterflies following standard methods53 for 
walking transects during late May/June looking for adults and larval webs 
during mid-August to mid-September.   
5.5.20 A survey of Lepidoptera (notably moths) will be undertaken in the woodland 
within the Project Site in late spring and mid-summer. The survey will involve 
two night-time moth surveys using Skinner or Robinson moth traps fitted with 
mercury vapour bulbs. Any species hard to identify from external markings 
alone, and those requiring further confirmation, will be retained and 
dissected if necessary to ascertain their identity with the use of a 
stereoscopic microscope.   
5.5.21 Beetle assemblages in the woodland within the Project Site will be sampled 
using a method following the Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et al, 
2007)54 via hand searches, sweep netting and pitfall trapping. Subsequent 
laboratory identification will be required for many of the specimens collected.   
5.5.22 In order to determine the assemblage of aquatic invertebrates present on 
Project Site, the flowing ditches and ponds will be surveyed if a Water 
Framework Directive Report is required (refer to Section 5.6).   
5.5.23 Kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates will be undertaken at selected 
locations along ditches or streams. Furthermore the water chemistry status 
will be determined for watercourses by extracting a single water sample at 
three locations within as well as upstream and downstream of the Project

Site. Samples will be dispatched to a UKAS accredited laboratory for 
subsequent analysis.   
5.5.24 The national pond monitoring survey protocol will be adhered to for 
surveying ponds which involves timed netting and searches for invertebrates 
in summer (but may also cover spring and autumn).   
Invasive Species 
5.5.25 A walkover survey of the Project Site will be carried out to map all locations 
where Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are growing. This will be 
done within the period June - July when both species are most in evidence.  
Assessment 
5.5.26 Following the completion of the surveys, reports will be produced, detailing 
the extent to which the species are present, the likely impacts that the 
elements of the Project would have on the species and habitats and the 
potential mitigation measures that could be employed to reduce impacts to 
an acceptable level.   
5.5.27 The EcIA will be undertaken in accordance with the relevant guidance 
including the Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (Institute of 
Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM), 2006)55. The potential 
effects will also be assessed against and informed by national and local 
planning guidance including the PPW and TANs as well as National and 
Local Biodiversity Action Plans. Consultation will be undertaken with NRW 
and City and County of Swansea Council to identify any particular issues of 
concern.   
Habitats Regulation Assessment  
5.5.28 The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
56 require an assessment to be made as to whether the Project, either alone 
or in combination with other plans or projects could have a likely significant 
effect on European sites including SPAs, SACs and Ramsar Sites.  Within 
10 km of the Project Site lie Burry Inlet Ramsar Site and SPA; Carmarthen 
Bay and Estuaries SAC and Crymlyn Bog Ramsar Site and SAC.   
5.5.29 Consultation with the City and County of Swansea Council will determine the 
requirement for a screening exercise, in accordance with the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended). The screening 
exercise will identify any likely impacts of the Project upon the above 
European Sites, either alone or in combination with other plans and projects, 
and consider whether the impacts are likely to be significant.   
5.5.30 If screening concludes there may be likely significant effects on the special 
features for which the European Sites are classified or designated then a 
report will be provided with the DCO Application showing the European Sites

that may be affected together with sufficient information to enable the 
decision maker to make an appropriate assessment, if required.  If screening 
concludes there is no likely significant effect on a European Site sufficient 
information will be provided with the DCO Application in the form of a ‘No 
Significant Effects Report’ to allow the Competent Authority to assess and 
review the information and make its own determination that there are no 
likely significant effects and be satisfied there is no significant residual 
effect.   
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.5.31 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting effects on ecology and biodiversity during 
construction and decommissioning. If necessary, further, specific mitigation 
measures will include the consideration for provision of new habitat to 
suitably replace any habitat areas which would be permanently lost through 
development of the Project.   
5.6 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
5.6.1 
An assessment on the effects on water quality and resources will consider all 
of the potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
5.6.2 
The chapter will also provide a summary of the main issues and risks posed 
to and from flooding identified during the Flood Consequences Assessment 
(FCA) which will be submitted as a separate document as part of the DCO 
Application. The FCA will take the form of a qualitative assessment based on 
existing NRW data and consultation with the NRW and Lead Local Flood 
Authority (LLFA). Additionally, potential impacts on hydrogeology will be 
assessed as part of the chapter describing geology, ground conditions and 
agriculture (outlined in Section 5.7 of this Scoping Report). 
Baseline 
5.6.3 
The main watercourse that traverses the area is Afon Llan which flows in a 
south-westerly direction to the west and south of the Project Site, through 
Swansea into Swansea Bay. In addition, there are a number of ordinary 
watercourses in the form of springs, streams and drainage ditches within the 
Project Site that ultimately flow into Afon Llan. The location of Afon Llan is 
shown on Figure 2. 
5.6.4 
The streams, ponds and ditches within the Gas and Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Areas will be carefully considered during the process of 
identifying the Gas and Electrical Connection Route Corridors. The design 
process will aim to minimise crossings or interactions with water bodies 
where practical.

5.6.5 
Historical and current maps will be studied to identify abstraction points and 
licences in the area as well as the course of any former watercourses which 
may have been underground or culverted in the past.   
Assessment  
5.6.6 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 the assessment will account for the existing 
status of, and impacts of the Project on water quality, water resources and 
physical characteristics of the water environment including any potential 
eutrophication impacts. The assessment will be undertaken using a risk 
based approach to determine the level of potential impacts by using a 
Source-Pathway-Receptor 
model 
to 
identify 
which 
receptors 
could 
realistically be impacted by a given action. This will include any sources of 
pollution that have the potential to impact on surface water bodies.   
5.6.7 
All aspects of supply, demand and disposal of water and process effluents 
will be addressed for the construction, operational and decommissioning 
phases. Furthermore the disposal of surface water drainage and the process 
effluents will be discussed with a view to maximising the opportunities for 
water recovery and re-use as far as is practicable.   
5.6.8 
Potential discharge locations for site surface waters and process waste 
waters will be identified and a site drainage plan, which may incorporate a 
sustainable drainage system (SuDS) will be discussed at a high level.   
5.6.9 
There are not anticipated to be any significant impacts on key water bodies 
resulting from the Project through physical works to them. It is also not 
anticipated that water will be directly abstracted or discharged to or from any 
of these sources during construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Power Generation Plant.   
5.6.10 Where projects are away from, or unlikely to interact with any water courses, 
it is likely that a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report will be scoped 
out. However, if NRW does require the inclusion of a WFD Report, it would 
form an Appendix to the ES. 
5.6.11 During construction of the Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection (if 
in the form of an underground cable), best working methods will be utilised at 
all water crossings to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on flow or 
drainage and that no contamination is allowed to enter the water bodies. 
Effects during operation and decommissioning are unlikely to occur or be 
significant and therefore have been scoped out.   
5.6.12 If an overhead line is used for the Electrical Connection, there will be no 
need for any permanent water crossings or interaction with water bodies of 
any kind. However any temporary water crossings required during 
construction will be assessed.

Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.6.13 Mitigation measures will be designed in accordance with BS603157, 
BS800458, as well as CIRIA C64959 and C64860. An outline CEMP will be 
drafted and appended to the ES which will set out best practice methods of 
limiting impacts on water quality and resources during construction and 
decommissioning. Measures would include: siting stockpiles a minimum 
distance from watercourses to avoid pollution runoff; and adhering to best 
practice working guidelines to avoid spillages near watercourses. 
5.6.14 Where the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection (in the form of an 
underground cable or construction vehicles during installation of overhead 
lines) would cross a water body, various crossing techniques would be 
considered. These may include trenchless techniques such as horizontal 
directional drilling, particularly for larger water bodies, or temporary bunding 
and over-pumping where flows are lower. 
5.6.15 Additionally, during construction, operation and decommissioning, silt traps 
and oil interceptors would be placed in drains on site. No untreated surface 
or waste waters would be allowed to drain into water bodies during 
construction, operation or decommissioning. SuDS would be used if found to 
be required. 
5.6.16 During all phases of the Project all aqueous process effluents would be 
discharged via the plant drainage systems in accordance with NRW limits. 
The use of biocides would be optimised to ensure that the least amount 
possible is required.   
5.6.17 All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored would 
be surrounded by an impermeable bund sized to contain 110% of capacity. 
In addition multiple tanks or drums would be within bunds sized to contain 
the greater of 110% of the capacity of the largest tank or 25% of the total 
tank’s contents.   
5.6.18 During operation, NRW would set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the Power Generation Plant under an Environmental 
Permit. The need, or otherwise for further, specific mitigation measures will 
be determined through the EIA process.  
5.7 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture 
Introduction  
5.7.1 
An assessment on the effects of geology, ground conditions and agriculture 
will consider potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project. It will also detail 
the baseline conditions in terms of ground and groundwater contamination

and the risks posed to human health particularly in relation to future site 
users.   
Baseline 
5.7.2 
The Project Site is located in an area where the geology is characterised by 
boulder clay and the underlying Grovesend Beds, Upper Carboniferous 
sandstones and thin coals61. These are overlain by glacial sand and gravel, 
alluvium and some peat. Overlying this geology are raw gley and brown 
soils. There are no aquifers or groundwater protection zones in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
5.7.3 
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding the 
Project Site is grade 4 (poor quality agricultural land)62 and is dominated by 
improved grassland fields used for grazing sheep and horses. In addition 
within the Project Site, are located a disused coal mine, a landfill as well as 
small areas of marshy grassland and woodland copses interspersing the 
improved grassland to the north and east.  
Assessment  
5.7.4 
The assessment will be underpinned by the DEFRA/EA publication 
Contaminated Land Report 11, 2004, ‘Model Procedures for the 
Management of Land Contamination’63 and associated subsequent 
guidance.  
5.7.5 
The assessment approach will be undertaken with a clear understanding of 
the following:  
 
Previous land uses – through a review of historical maps;   
 
Underlying ground conditions – thorough review of BGS maps, a 
review of previous site investigations (where available) and by 
undertaking geotechnical investigations where deemed necessary; 
and 
 
Existing physical baseline conditions through a site walkover survey 
and review of a Landmark Envirocheck Report.   
5.7.6 
The Landmark Envirocheck Report (or equivalent) will identify groundwater 
vulnerability, sites designated for geological importance, details of any 
previous pollution events, details of landfills, waste management sites and 
Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) sites within the Project Site 
and surrounding area.   
5.7.7 
A conceptual site model approach will be used to assess the risks posed by 
contaminants to sensitive receptors using a Source-Pathway-Receptor 
model, based on the following:

 
Source – potential source of contamination; 
 
Pathway – means by which contamination can reach and impact upon 
a receptor; and  
 
Receptor – that which may be adversely affected by the presence of 
contamination.   
5.7.8 
Desk studies will identify potential environmental and geotechnical liabilities 
associated with the Project, including an assessment of potential impacts of 
previous uses of the Project Site and surrounding area. This will enable the 
identification of any potential environmental and geotechnical risks, and the 
design of a focussed and cost efficient intrusive investigation (if required).   
5.7.9 
In undertaking the desk studies, all available information on the Project Site 
and surrounding area will be reviewed to establish local ground conditions 
and the environmental settings. Furthermore, consultation will be held with 
the City and County of Swansea Council and the NRW to obtain any other 
environmental records available for the Project Site, and to further refine the 
assessment methodology.   
5.7.10 A site walkover will be undertaken of the Project Site and immediate 
surrounding areas. This will help ensure all potential source, pathway and 
receptor linkages for potential contamination issues have been identified.  
5.7.11 Based on the findings of the desk studies, site walkovers and preliminary risk 
assessment, recommendations will be provided for any further intrusive 
investigation work required to satisfy current standards and guidance and fill 
any data gaps identified to fully inform the assessments of environmental 
and geotechnical risks or liabilities.   
5.7.12 Using the information obtained, suitable remediation strategies will be 
developed to render the Project Site ready for development. These will 
include estimates of the types and volumes of waste material that will need 
to be removed from the Project Site prior to development.   
5.7.13 Additionally, an assessment will be made of the amount of agricultural land, 
if any, that may become sterilised by the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
Should an overhead Electrical Connection be considered, the same 
methodology will be used, although it is considered likely that the potential 
impact on geology, ground conditions and agriculture would be significantly 
less than for a buried connection.   
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.7.14 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Embedded mitigation measures would include adherence 
to good practice guidelines and could potentially involve the following:  
 
Any additional soil materials that are to be imported to the Project 
Site would be required to have certification of their chemical 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

concentrations to ensure that contaminative materials are not being 
introduced to the area; 
 
In order to further limit disturbance, the site access tracks would be 
constructed first to allow movement of vehicles around the Project 
Site on areas of soft-standing;   
 
Any vegetation, topsoil and subsoil would be removed to expose a 
suitable sub-grade. Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for 
reuse would be stockpiled on impermeable liners;  
 
Soils which are to be reused onsite would be tested for contamination 
and geotechnical suitability. This would form part of a site waste 
management strategy which would be drafted prior to construction 
and would focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of waste spoil;  
 
Surface water, perched waters or groundwater from dewatering 
operations would not be discharged to surface water bodies, foul or 
surface water drains without the appropriate consents from the local 
water or sewage company and / or NRW. The disposal of this effluent 
would be the responsibility of the principal construction contractor. If 
necessary, this water would be tanked off-site for disposal at a 
suitable facility;   
 
All foundations would be appropriately specified to resist chemical 
attack from soils or groundwater; and  
 
Foundations would also be designed so as not to present a 
preferential pathway for contaminant migration, if present at the 
Project Site.   
5.8 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
Introduction 
5.8.1 
A landscape and visual impact assessment will consider potentially 
significant impacts and effects caused by construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. The assessment will establish:  
 
A clear understanding of the Project Site and its wider landscape 
setting, identifying the landscape character, resources, value and 
sensitivity to the development;  
 
An assessment of the composition, character and aesthetic value of 
views from visual receptors including occupiers of residential 
properties and people using amenity landscapes, and the sensitivity 
of views;   
 
The nature of the different development scenarios and mitigation 
measures; and

 
The likely significant direct and indirect effects of the Project on the 
landscape resource (i.e. landscape elements and character) and on 
visual receptors.  
Baseline  
5.8.2 
The Project Site is located within an area of lowland rolling farmland known 
locally as the ‘Welsh Gower’. It is within an essentially rural landscape, criss-
crossed by networks of minor roads, overhead wires on steel pylons and 
other utilities infrastructure.   
5.8.3 
The Welsh Gower was historically part of the Lordship of Gower, but is now 
separated physically and perceptibly from the historic area. It consists largely 
of moorland, with any settlements of size - Craig Cefn Parc and 
Pontarddulais - on the southern fringes. Economic activity is confined largely 
to upland farming and forestry, although there is a commercial fishery and 
two large reservoirs to the north of the Project Site. The area also contains 
extensive evidence of human exploitation and occupation over millennia, 
with a proliferation of cairns and earthworks, evidence of a Roman fort and 
marching camps. 
5.8.4 
The area around the Project Site is rural in character, although there is a 
large amount of utilities infrastructure in the area due to its close proximity to 
Swansea. Gas and water pipelines cross the Project Site and there is also a 
network of electricity pylons southwest of Abergelli Farm, which lead to and 
from Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National Grid’s two 400kV 
electrical substations. Furthermore a Water Treatment Works is located 
immediately to the northwest while Cefn Betingau Solar Park is operational 
to the east of the Project Site.   
5.8.5 
Amongst this wider landscape, the Project Site is located within open gently 
sloping grass fields used for grazing sheep and horses interspersed by 
woodland copses, some of which are classified as Ancient Woodland as 
shown on Figure 3.   
5.8.6 
Residential receptors within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau and Llwyncelyn, Felindre. In 
addition there are also isolated dwellings and farmsteads outside of the 
settlements including but not exclusive to:  
 
Aber gelli fawr; 


Assessment  
5.8.7 
The assessment will be carried out in accordance to NPS EN-1 using the 
methodology set out in the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment

Institute 
and 
Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Management and Assessment, 3rd Edition, 2013)64 and Countryside Council 
for Wales / CADW (2007) ‘Guide to Good Practice on Using the Register of 
Landscapes of Historic Interest in Wales in the Planning and Development 
Process’65. It will include:  
 
A desk review of all relevant documents and landscape planning 
policy and guidance;   
 
A field survey to assess baseline landscape character and visual 
amenity;  
 
A description of the key features associated with the Project that 
have the potential to alter the characteristics of the landscape and 
visual baseline;  
 
Appropriate generic and site specific mitigation that is reasonable and 
possible;  
 
Assessment of the predicted significance of residual effects on the 
landscape resource / character and visual amenity and compliance 
with landscape policy; and

 
An assessment of cumulative impacts arising from the Project, in 
combination with other proposed large scale industrial developments 
in the locality.   
5.8.8 
Initially, a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan will be generated for the 
Power Generation Plant using specialist software. The ZTV will show a 
maximum theoretical visibility of the Power Generation Plant and any 
overhead line towers, should an overhead Electrical Connection by pursued 
across the surrounding area. The ZTV will be based solely on topography 
and the proposed height of the plant envelope, and any overhead line 
towers. No allowance will be made for intervening screening vegetation or 
buildings, although in practice this tends to have a substantial mitigating 
effect.   
5.8.9 
A review of all relevant landscape planning policy and LANDMAP (the 
national information system, devised by CCW (now NRW), for taking 
landscape into account in decision-making) will be undertaken. Particular 
attention will be paid to AONBs, popular tourist spots and viewpoints, and 
Public Rights of Way. The nearest AONB is the Gower which is remote from 
the Project Site and visually separated from the Project Site by intervening 
topography and therefore has been scoped out of the assessment.   
5.8.10 The Project will be discussed in detail including dimensions of the larger 
buildings, the stack heights, and any other ancillary infrastructure that may 
have an impact on the landscape character or visual amenity.  
5.8.11 To assist in the impact assessment, a site visit will be made by a qualified 
Chartered Landscape Architect, who will assess the study area in detail. 
Additionally, and following consultation with relevant stakeholders, a 
selection of photomontages will be taken from key sensitive viewpoints (e.g. 
residential receptors, designated ecological sites, cultural heritage assets 
and key rights of way). Suggested viewpoint locations of photomontages for 
consultation are:  
 
View north east from the Public Right of Way to the west of Maes-
eglwys; 
 
View south from the Public Right of Way junction south of 
Brynheulog; 
 
View east from the Public Right of Way junction north of Lletty Morfil 
Farm;  
 
View northeast from B4489 at the junction with the Public Right of 
Way close to Brynwhilhach; 
 
View north from the road and Public Right of Way junction at Pant-
lasau; 
 
View south from the Gower Way at Lower Lliw Reservoir;  
 
View north from Kilvey Hill in Swansea; and

 
View north from the A48 to the south of the M4. 
5.8.12 Photomontages will be produced with reference to ‘Photography and 
photomontage in landscape and visual impact assessment Landscape 
Institute 
Advice 
Note 
01/11’66. 
The 
photomontages 
will 
show 
a 
representation of how the Project would be viewed within the landscape and 
will be used to illustrate the potential impact of the Project.   
5.8.13 Given that the majority of the Gas Connection would be underground, the 
landscape and visual impact assessment for this element will focus solely on 
the impact of the AGI and the impacts and effects that will result from the 
construction phase.    
5.8.14 As for the Gas Connection, if the underground Electrical Connection is 
carried forward, then the LVIA for this element of the work will focus solely 
on the impacts resulting from the presence of a SEC, if required, and the 
impacts and effects that will result from the construction phase.   
5.8.15 If an overhead line is taken forward, the assessment will follow the standard 
LVIA methodology as described above, but will make reference to the 
Holford Rules where appropriate. 
Potential Mitigation Measures   
5.8.16 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Embedded mitigation measures would include the careful 
consideration of siting stockpiles and cranes to avoid detrimental impacts on 
the visual amenity of closest receptors.   
5.8.17 During operation, the main embedded mitigation measures would be the 
careful siting and arrangement of the: Power Generation Plant; AGI for the 
Gas Connection; and SEC for the Electrical Connection, if required. The final 
architectural design of the buildings and upstanding structures would be 
carefully considered to provide a high standard of visual amenity, given 
practical and economic constraints.    
5.8.18 Further, detailed mitigation measures could include the consideration for 
onsite or off-site screen planting to screen views of the Power Generation 
Plant.   
5.8.19 Due regard will be paid to NPS EN-1, EN-2, and EN-5 and the guidance they 
provide on ‘good design’ in relation to the Gas and Electrical Connections 
and include (to the extent relevant in the case of an underground connection 
for Gas and Electrical Connection):   
 
Avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of highest amenity 
value, by planning the general route of the line in the first place, even 
if total mileage is somewhat increased in consequence;

 
Avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest by 
deviation, provided this can be done without using too many angle 
towers, i.e. the bigger structures which are used when lines change 
direction;  
 
Other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp 
changes of direction and thus with fewer angle towers;  
 
Choose tree and hill backgrounds in preference to sky backgrounds 
wherever possible. Where a line has to cross a ridge, secure this 
opaque background as long as possible, cross obliquely when a dip 
in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross directly, 
preferably between belts of trees;  
 
Prefer moderately open valleys with woods where the apparent height 
of towers will be reduced, and views of the line will be broken by 
trees;  
 
Where country is flat and sparsely planted, keep the high voltage 
lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging 
routes, distribution poles and other masts, wires and cables, so as to 
avoid a concentration of lines or ‘wirescape’; and  
 
Approach urban areas through industrial zones, where they exist; and 
when pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes between 
the approach line, National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations 
and Felindre Gas Compressor Station carefully assess the 
comparative costs of undergrounding.   
5.9 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
Introduction 
5.9.1 
An assessment on traffic, transport and access effects will consider 
potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
5.9.2 
The main impacts of the Project on traffic, transport and access would occur 
during construction and decommissioning resulting from the movement of 
vehicles for the transport of construction or decommissioning personnel, 
equipment and materials to and from the Project Site. The transport of 
abnormal loads, which may lead to delays and cause inconvenience to other 
road users, would be timed following consultation with the relevant 
authorities to minimise disruption to the other road users.   
5.9.3 
Normal activities during operation would result in fewer traffic movements 
and would be associated with personnel required for operation and 
maintenance of the Project. As such, during operation no significant increase 
in traffic in the area of the Project Site is expected, and no effect on local 
traffic patterns and infrastructure would therefore be anticipated.

Baseline 
5.9.4 
There are two options being considered in regards to accessing the Project 
Site from Junction 46 of the M4. Access Road – Option 1 would be via the 
Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli 
Farm. Access Road – Option 2 is via the B4489, along the access road to 
the National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and then along an access road to be constructed as 
part of the Project, across undeveloped land to the Generating Equipment 
Site. Both options are shown on Figure 1. 
Assessment  
5.9.5 
The assessment will be undertaken in accordance with the ‘Welsh Transport 
Planning and Appraisal Guidance WeITAG67 and the Institute of 
Environmental Assessment’s (IEA) ‘Guidelines for the Environmental 
Assessment of Road Traffic’ (1993)68 in order to assess the likely significant 
impacts of the Project on the local road network.   
5.9.6 
Comparisons between existing traffic flows and estimates of likely traffic 
flows on potentially affected roads will be made to help establish whether 
significant effects are likely. This will take into account: the sensitivity of 
receptors and resources likely to be affected; any potential for disruption to 
local routes; and any changes in the composition of traffic. If considered 
necessary, traffic surveys will be undertaken which will further quantify the 
number of vehicle movements on the existing road network in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
5.9.7 
The majority of the proposed access routes are ‘main roads’ that do not have 
pavements for pedestrian use. Nonetheless, the traffic assessment will also 
take full account of the potential impact on pedestrians, and will ensure that 
pedestrians and other road users (cyclists and equestrians) are not cut off 
from amenity areas as a result of the works.   
5.9.8 
The assessment will consider the following: access and construction routes 
and the types of vehicles used; local highway and rail networks; existing 
traffic flows; current traffic generation; road traffic accident information; 
predicted traffic trends; local highway improvements and planned works; 
and, potential receptors. The full appraisal will be presented (if appropriate) 
in a Transport Assessment which will be accompanied by a draft 
Construction Traffic Management Plan. 
5.9.9 
Discussions will be held with the Highways Agency and the City and County 
of Swansea Council to identify any existing issues relating to traffic in the 
area. Information will also be sought on future development projects in the 
area that could give rise to a significant cumulative impact when considered 
in conjunction with the Project.

Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.9.10 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Opportunities for reducing traffic movements will be 
explored, such as car share schemes or shift working (i.e. not all 
construction traffic arriving at site at once).   
5.9.11 Details of the proposed measures to improve access by public transport, 
walking and cycling will be provided for the operational phase.

Cultural Heritage and Archaeology 
Introduction 
5.10.1 An assessment of the effects on cultural heritage and archaeological assets 
will consider potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
Baseline  
5.10.2 The Project Site is within an area of pastoral farmland which has evolved as 
a result of gradual enclosure of the uplands and foothills in the area. There is 
some evidence for enclosure in the pre-Norman period, and the process has 
continued through time into the second half of the 19th century. In addition 
there are some areas of unenclosed land and woodland (some which is 
classified as Ancient Woodland) remaining as shown on Figure 3.   
5.10.3 Also within the area there has been some industrial activity in the form of 
mining and tinplate works which took place in the 19th century. In the areas 
where industrial activity has taken place associated ribbon development 
occurs. In the rest of the area the settlement pattern is mainly dispersed with 
isolated dwellings. 
5.10.4 The following cultural heritage assets are located within 5 km of the Project 
Site:  
 
Clydach Upper Forge Scheduled Monument; 
 
Landore New Quay Scheduled Monument; 
 
Gwernllwynchwyth Engine House Scheduled Monument;

Assessment 
5.10.6 In accordance with NPS EN-1, the objectives of this assessment are to:  
 
Describe the survival and extent of any archaeological features that 
may 
be 
disturbed 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project;  
 
Provide an assessment of the importance of these assets;  
 
Assess the likely scale of any impacts on the cultural heritage and 
archaeological resource posed by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project;   
 
Outline suitable mitigation measures to prevent, reduce and where 
possible offset any significant adverse effects; and  
 
Provide an assessment of any residual effects remaining after 
mitigation.   
5.10.7 Initially, a Desk Based Assessment (DBA) will be undertaken, and will 
include the following detailed searches:   
 
The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments Wales 
which is the investigative body and national archive for the historic 
environment of Wales and hosts an online search facility (Coflein); 
 
Swansea Historic Environment Record (HER) (which includes records 
of any previous archaeological interventions within the Scheme 
Area). The HER will also include details of Registered Parks and 
Gardens, Listed Buildings and Registered Battlefields; 
 
Historic Mapping; and  
 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation.  
5.10.8 The DBA will be undertaken in accordance with ‘Standard and Guidance for 
Archaeological Assessments’ (Institute for Archaeologists, 2011)69.   
5.10.9 It is proposed that initially, searches are limited to 1 km from the Project Site 
for HER entries for archaeology as the Project will potential impact 
archaeology 
within 
the 
development 
footprint 
and 
the 
immediate 
surroundings. The 1 km Study Area provides the opportunity to better 
understand the context of any archaeology present within the development 
footprint. 
5.10.10 As part of the DBA, a site inspection will be undertaken of the Project Site to 
identify any previously unknown archaeological features and their condition.  
During the site inspection a detailed photographic record will be maintained 
and an assessment of the setting of the cultural heritage assets will be 
undertaken.

5.10.11 In order to gather baseline cultural heritage setting data, and to undertake an 
assessment of the potential impacts that the Project Site may have on the 
setting of any above ground remains, selected cultural heritage assets will 
be visited. This will follow an initial study making reference to the results of 
desk-based research, and the ZTV including searches of the records listed 
above. Assets will be visited where this initial study indicates potential for 
significant impacts. Both the asset and its surrounding area will be visited to 
identify locations that might be relevant to the asset’s setting.  
5.10.12 For the purposes of the setting study, the following cultural heritage assets 
will be considered:  
 
Scheduled Monuments;  
 
Listed Buildings;  
 
Registered Parks and Gardens; 
 
Registered Battlefields;  
 
World Heritage Sites; and 
 
Any other non-scheduled building which is considered to be important 
in terms of cultural heritage and archaeological significance.   
5.10.13 It is proposed that the search area for these cultural heritage assets will be 
limited to 5 km from the Project Site, as significant impacts on setting are 
unlikely to occur beyond 5 km. However, should significant impacts be 
identified at 5 km, then the search area will be expanded accordingly.   
5.10.14 The following factors are also considered to be relevant when assessing 
impacts upon setting:   
 
Visual dominance;   
 
Scale;   
 
Intervisibility;  
 
Vistas and sight lines;  
 
Movement and light; and  
 
Unaltered settings.  
5.10.15 The DBA will form the baseline data for the cultural heritage and 
archaeology section of the ES. The ES will discuss the nature and location of 
all cultural heritage and archaeological sites within the study area. Further to 
this, the ES will provide an assessment of the significance of any impacts to 
the cultural heritage and archaeology sites.   
5.10.16 At this stage, no intrusive investigations are proposed for cultural heritage or 
archaeological purposes, although this will be confirmed (or otherwise) 
based on the findings of the DBA, and in consultation with the City and 
Abergelli Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

County of Swansea Planning Archaeologist and representative of Cadw. 
Should intrusive investigations be necessary, their scope will be agreed with 
the Planning Archaeologist through a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI).   
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.10.17 Prior to construction, the nature and extent of archaeology present at the 
Project Site and surrounding areas will be established. However, should any 
archaeological remains be found during construction, work will be halted and 
advice sought from the Planning Archaeologist. Where necessary, 
recommendations will be made for a mitigation strategy to preserve in-situ or 
if not practicable to preserve by record any significant archaeological assets. 
The ES will also include a mitigation strategy for any significant impacts to 
listed buildings and other above ground assets.   
5.10.18 During operation, there may be an opportunity to provide screen planting, 
should the Project give rise to any adverse impacts on above ground 
heritage assets.    
5.11 
Socio-Economics 
Introduction  
5.11.1 An assessment on the effects on socio-economics resulting from the Project 
will be undertaken and reported in the ES. This will consider potentially 
significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project on socio-economic resources and receptors 
in and around the vicinity of the Project Site.   
5.11.2 At its peak, the construction and decommissioning workforces are expected 
to employ between 150 and 250 personnel. Subject to procurement rules it is 
anticipated that as many as possible of these workforces would be recruited 
locally.   
5.11.3 Operation of the Generating Equipment would require up to 15 full time staff 
over the lifetime of the Project working in shifts which means that less than 
15 people will be on site at any one time during normal operations. In 
addition there would be further indirect jobs for contracted engineering staff 
during regular maintenance shutdowns and maintenance of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections.   
5.11.4 The total capital cost of the Project is anticipated to be of the order of £200 
million. Up to approximately 35% of this will be construction, civils and 
fabrication work which would be open to tender from companies in the area. 
5.11.5 During construction and decommissioning, those workers from outside of the 
local area would require places to stay, and regular sustenance, delivering 
knock on benefits to local businesses and services. In addition the Project 
would also represent an additional income source to the local economy 
during the operational phase in terms of local employment and the use of 
local services and suppliers.

Baseline  
5.11.6 The area surrounding the Project Site has a long history of both mining and 
agriculture.   
5.11.7 The Project Site lies within the City and County of Swansea. It is located 
within the region of South West Wales. South West Wales has a resident 
population of approximately 685,000 and supports some 280,000 jobs in 
around 20,000 businesses, making it a major driver of the Welsh economy.  
It is a large and diverse region that contains a wide range of urban and rural 
places, 
with 
distinctive, 
though 
inter-connected, 
economies 
and 
communities. Within the region, Swansea forms the second largest City in 
Wales and the regional centre for South West Wales. The population of the 
City and County of Swansea is approximately 239,02370 which has been 
increasing steadily for nearly a decade. The County has a diverse character, 
covering an area of approximately 380 km2, and can be broadly divided into:  
 
The sparsely populated open moorlands of the north; 
 
The Gower Penisula and its hinterlands in the west; 
 
The urban settlements and communities that are generally spread 
along the main transport corridors into the City where the main 
populations reside; and  
 
The conurbation of Swansea City Centre and the urban waterfront.   
5.11.8 In 2011, 102,793 or 43% of residents aged between 16 to 74 were in 
employment which is comparable to 44.5% of the population of Wales71. The 
key sources of employment in the City and County of Swansea in 2011 
were:  
 
Wholesale and Retail Trade; Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motor 
Cycles at 17%; 
 
Human health and social work activities at 15%; 
 
Education at 11%; 
 
Manufacturing at 7%; and 
 
Construction at 7%. 
5.11.9 Swansea Bay is a popular tourist destination due to the sandy beaches of 
Gower, the Victorian seaside village of Mumbles and Wales’ Waterfront City 
with its Blue Flag marina.  The nearest tourist destination to the Project Site 
is the Team Force Swansea Paintball Centre approximately 50 m south of 
the Project Site.

Assessment Methodology  
5.11.10 In accordance with NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.12.3 the assessment will 
consider all relevant socio-economic impacts such as tourism, influxes of 
workers, and cumulative impacts.   
5.11.11 There is currently no established EIA methodology for the assessment of 
socio-economic impacts. To assess the socio-economic impacts the 
‘Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment’ (May 1994) 
produced by the Interorganizational Committee on Guidelines and Principles 
for Social Impact Assessment72, HM Treasury’s Green Book73 and the 
English Partnerships(EP) Additionally Guide74 will be used.  
5.11.12 The study area will extend to cover the immediate area of City and County of 
Swansea and the wider area of South West Wales, in order to assess the 
likely effects that may be experienced within the local community.   
5.11.13 The methodology for the socio-economic impact assessment will be based 
on the collection of a wide range of data and information from published 
materials, plus consultation with the local authority and key stakeholders. 
Key sources of information will include:  
 
Population characteristics (population dynamics);  
 
Community and institutional structures (employment, training, skills 
and qualifications, economic investment, business development and 
equal opportunities);  
 
Individual and family changes (perceptions of risk, attitudes towards 
the Project, social well-being); and  
 
Community resources (security, access to local amenities including 
Public Rights of Way (PRoWs)).  
Potential Project Enhancements 
5.11.14 During construction, operation and decommissioning, an effort will be made 
to use local goods and services, wherever possible.

Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
1 
18/06/2014 
1 
Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant on agricultural land 
within Abergelli Farm north of Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at 
National Grid Reference 265284, 201431).   
1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
1.3 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary 
ecological appraisal, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This 
preliminary survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats.  
1.4 
The preliminary ecological survey has identified two European designated sites within 10km, five 
statutory designated sites for ecology (four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR)) within 5km, and twenty-three non-statutory designated Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2km of the Survey Site boundary. Three of the 
SINCs are partially within the Survey Site boundary, and a further two are adjacent. Much of the 
woodland on the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. Direct impacts on SINCs 
and Ancient Woodland within and close to the Survey Site boundary could occur, depending on the 
final layout of the Power Generation Plant.     
1.5 
Three Section 421 habitats (‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, ‘purple moor-grass and rush 
pasture’ and ‘ponds’) are present within the Survey Site.  
1.6 
There is habitat in the Survey Site that has the potential to support European Protected Species 
(EPS) including bats, great crested newts Triturus cristatus, dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius 
and otter Lutra lutra.  There are also habitats suitable for nationally protected species such as 
reptiles and water voles Arvicola amphibius. Information on badgers is contained in a confidential 
version of this report.   
1.7 
The following surveys are recommended to inform the ecology baseline chapter of the 
Environmental Statement and full details are provided in Section 5: 
 
Extended Phase 1 habitat survey of inaccessible land at the south-west end of the Survey Site 
and new land that has been identified since the survey was carried out – an access route to 
the west of the site. 
 
A National Vegetation Classification (NVC) botanical survey of marshy grassland and 
woodland that may be affected within the Survey Site as well as any areas identified as SINCs 
within or adjacent to the site; 
 
A survey of invasive plant species within the Survey Site; 
 
Roped access survey of trees identified as having potential to support bat roosts and internal 
and external building inspections, where trees/buildings may be affected directly or indirectly 
by the Project. Inspection surveys should include surveys for barn owls. Subsequent dusk 
emergence / dawn return to roost surveys should be undertaken if roosting potential or 
evidence of roosting is found; 
 
Bat activity surveys including walked transects and automated bat detector surveys; 
 
A survey for otter and water vole along water courses within the Survey Site; 
 
Dormouse surveys in areas of woodland and scrub within the Survey Site; 
                                                      
1 Species referred to within The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) as species of 
principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales which are listed on the Natural Resources Wales 
website. The Welsh Assembly Government must take steps to “further the conservation” of these species under Section 
42 of the NERC ACT 2006.

Introduction 
Site Description 
2.1 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey Site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), in which the Project 
would be located, consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by 
horses. The Survey Site is contained within the red line boundary shown in Figure 1 and is centred 
at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest town is Felindre, which is located 
approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.   
2.2 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and areas around 
the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey 
Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional patches of 
woodland.

The Survey Site boundary is shown on Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b (photographs of the Survey Site 
are found in Appendix 2).  
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation 
Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed 
to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal generating station to the 
existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This preliminary 
ecological survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is presently intended for submission, as 
an integral part of the Development Consent Order (DCO) Application. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
BSG Ecology was commissioned to undertake a preliminary ecological appraisal of the Survey Site 
within which the Project would be located. The main aims of this report are to: 
 
present the findings of the desk study and site surveys; 
 
assess the potential for the Survey Site to support protected or otherwise notable species; 
 
set out the legislative and/or policy protection afforded to any habitats present or any species 
potentially associated with the Survey Site; and 
 
provide recommendations for any further surveys necessary to inform a subsequent ecology 
chapter for an Environmental Statement for the site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European designated 
sites was requested from within 10 km with information on national statutory designated sites was 
requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the Survey Site boundary and 
information regarding non-statutory designated sites and records of protected2 or notable species 
(particularly those identified as priority or Section 42 species and/or of local conservation 
importance or LBAP3 species) was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from 
the Survey Site boundary. Information on locally designated Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary was requested from the Swansea 
Council Ecologist. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic Information 
for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the area were 
also reviewed. 
Field Survey 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
The initial field survey was undertaken by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM 
on 24 February 2014. The Project Site boundary and therefore the Survey Site was subsequently 
extended after a design review, and a second field survey was carried out by Stephanie Boocock 
MCIEEM on 14 April 2014 of the additional area. Habitats within the Survey Site, and up to at least 
50m from the Survey Site boundary, were identified and described following standard JNCC Phase 
1 Habitat Survey methodology as detailed in the Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). 
This uses a system of codes to describe different habitat types based on the dominant vegetation 
present, which are recorded by means of habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this 
report follow The New Flora of British Isles (Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
The survey was extended to give particular consideration to the potential of the habitats present to 
support protected species or species of local conservation importance; recorded as incidental 
information as part of the target notes. 
3.4 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site.  They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual.   
3.5 
Weather conditions during both surveys were clear and largely dry. 
Habitat Suitability Index 
3.6 
During the February field survey a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment (Oldham et al., 2000) 
of all ponds/water bodies within a 500m radius of the Survey Site (where access was possible) was 
undertaken. In the case of this survey, a wider buffer than 250m was used because of the high 
number of ponds within 250 and 500m of the Survey Site. The additional information collected is 
useful to provide context of how ponds within or in proximity to the Survey Site may connect with 
habitat available for newts in the surrounding landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the 
assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.7 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a great crested newt Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) score to be derived for each pond by 
applying the scoring system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008). The 
suitability index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond; these

include features such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are 
then used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being 
the least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in 
one of five categories defining its suitability for great crested newts as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8 
 
= excellent 
Tree Assessment 
3.8 
All the trees on site were examined for their potential to support roosting bats, graded according to 
the scale provided in the Bat Conservation Trust survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012), and summarised 
in Table 1 below.  Those that were rated Category 2 and above were described and their locations 
recorded on a GPS.

Limitations to Methods 
3.9 
Although records secured through the desk study and supplied by third parties provide useful 
background information for initial ecological assessment, they often comprise individual records 
supplied by members of the public or are the result of ad hoc surveys. The data trawl information 
can therefore help to inform the likelihood of a particular species being present in the area, but 
should not be relied upon to definitively determine presence or absence of individual species. 
3.10 
The first site visit was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year (February) for a survey of this type, 
being outside the main growing season, when the greatest variety of plants is in evidence.  
However the habitats on site are readily identifiable to an experienced botanist, and those that 
require further survey work in order to confirm their quality have been identified.  In addition, a 
robust assessment of the Survey Site’s potential to support protected species could also be made. 
Therefore, it is considered that the timing of the survey in this instance is not a significant constraint 
with regard to the findings of this assessment. The second survey on the 14th April was undertaken 
at a time when most plant species are evident and was less constrained in this respect. 
3.11 
Most parts of the Survey Site were accessed and surveyed. Some of the ponds outside of the 
Survey Site could not be accessed (see Figures 2a and 2b) as they were located on private land 
and access was denied to a number of them. Ponds within 250-500m of the Survey Site, where 
accessible, were inspected to gather contextual information and enough have been inspected to 
allow suitable additional background information to be gathered.  
3.12 
The extreme south-west end of the Survey Site could not be surveyed as the land here is in a 
separate ownership and access had not been granted by land owners at the time of survey.  The 
route of the access track (that leads west to the B4489) was added to the Survey Site boundary 
after the April Phase 1 visit, so this was also not included in the survey. A recommendation has 
been made below to survey the remainder of the Survey Site as soon as access has been granted.

Results and Interpretation 
4.1 
In this section the results of the desk study and fieldwork are brought together. The implications of 
these results are then considered.  
4.2 
Figures 1a (the northern part of the site) and 1b (the southern part of the site) illustrate the results 
of the extended Phase 1 habitat survey.  Numbers on the map and in the text below can be cross-
referenced with Target Notes (TN) in Appendix 1.  Photographs of the site can be found in 
Appendix 2.  Figures 2a (the northern part of the site) and 2b (the southern part of the site) 
illustrate areas of the site that support, or have the potential to support, protected species. 
Designated Sites 
Statutory 
4.3 
There are two Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)4 designated under the EC Habitats Directive 
within 10km. One of these, Camarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, has has been afforded multiple 
designations and is referred to under the umbrella term European Marine Site (EMS)5 which 
comprises the SAC, and is also split into two Special Protection Areas (SPA)6 and two Ramsar 
Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar)7 the details of each designation are provided 
below. There are also four statutory protected Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR) within 5km of the Survey Site. These are described in Table 2 below.

4 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive. Article 3 
of the Habitats Directive requires the establishment of a European network of important high-quality conservation sites 
that will make a significant contribution to conserving the 189 habitat types and 788 species identified in Annexes I and II 
of the Directive (as amended). 
5 The term 'European Marine Site' (EMS) (as defined by the Habitats Regulations) refers to those marine areas that area 
both Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs). For management advice see 
http://www.severnestuary.net/asera/docs/Regulation%2033%20Advice.pdf 
6 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) are strictly protected sites classified in accordance with Article 4 of the EC Birds 
Directive, which came into force in April 1979. They are classified for rare and vulnerable birds (as listed on Annex I of 
the Directive), and for regularly occurring migratory species. 
7 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

 Non-statutory 
4.5 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in Table 3 below and their locations are shown on Figure 3.  Three SINCs lie 
partially within the Survey Site boundary. Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which 
includes three fields that lie within the north-east corner of the Survey Site.  Warn Garn Wen is also 
an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the western boundary of 
the Survey Site.  Llety Morfil SINC is a collection of three areas of ancient woodland  with some 
areas of marshy grassland, that includes the woodland on the eastern boundary of the site and at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site.   
4.6 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary.  Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent to the 
southern tip of the proposed access route.   
4.7 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland (See Figure 
3).

Habitats 
4.8 
The Survey Site is roughly an ‘L’ shape, with the majority of the Survey Site running approximately 
north-south and the foot of the ‘L’ branching off to the south-west around either side of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The topography 
drains the land to the south with the highest elevation in the Survey Site along the northern 
boundary (approximately 140m above ordnance datum (aod). The land slopes away to the south 
and the lowest elevation is around the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 
400kV electrical substations (approximately 80m aod). The land is predominantly pastoral 
farmland, mostly agriculturally improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland.  The fields 
are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by fences with occasional trees, scrub 
and one defunct hedgerow.  There are numerous water courses on site, mostly in the form of 
ditches along field boundaries, but also four streams; one which runs along the eastern boundary 
of the Survey Site; another that runs north-west from the woodland in the eastern part of the site; a 
stream that runs through the marshy grassland to the west; and another around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. There is a small 
woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and the land around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations is also largely wooded. 
There are also copses and stands of mature trees around the edges of the marshy grassland in the 
north-western part of the site, as well as along field boundaries in the northern part of the site. 
Improved grassland 
4.9 
The majority of the land on site is agriculturally improved grassland (Photo 1, 2a).  This was all 
grazed short when surveyed, and consists of abundant perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, and 
varying quantities of common grassland herbs such as white clover Trifolium repens, common 
mouse ear Cerastium fontanum, and dandelion Taraxacum fontanum agg.   
Marshy grassland 
4.10 
There are marshy grassland fields at TN3, TN3a, TN4a, TN5, TN9a, TN13a and TN21a and a 
block of marshy grassland at the southern end of the Survey Site.  Although all fit within the same 
Phase 1 category, the habitats in these fields vary across the Survey Site.  The field at TN3 (Photo 
2) had a short, close-grazed sward when surveyed.  It has numerous tussocks of soft rush Juncus 
effusus and frequent sedge species.  These include common sedge Carex.nigra and glaucous 
sedge C. flacca.  Other species noted include creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, a cinquefoil 
Potentilla sp., creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens and sharp-flowered and/or jointed rush 
Juncus actutiflorus / J. articulatus.  
4.11 
The field at TN5 (Photo 3) was also grazed extremely short, when surveyed, to the point where 
individual species are difficult to distinguish.  Soft rush is frequent, along with purple-moor grass 
Molinia caerulea, sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and a sedge species (not possible to identify to 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
species level).  Heather Calluna vulgaris and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus plants are occasional and 
there are patches of sphagnum moss Sphagnum sp. present. 
4.12 
The fields marked TN3a, TN4a and TN13a, are wet semi-improved grassland, with marshy species 
such as lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula, sedges, soft rush and water figwort Scrophularia 
aquatica. 
4.13 
The fields marked TN20 all have over 25% soft rush which places them in the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category, but the intervening grassland is agriculturally improved, with abundant perennial rye-
grass and frequent white clover.  The fields marked TN21 and TN22 (Photo 4) have a much higher 
cover of soft rush - approximately 75% in TN21 and 100% in TN22 and intervening species are 
more typical of wet grassland, such as creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, creeping buttercup and 
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus.   
4.14 
Areas of purple-moor grass dominated vegetation, which also falls into the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category are present at TN14 (Photo 5), TN9a and TN21a where the purple moor grass is 
dominant with very occasional cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather plants in evidence and 
scattered willow Salix sp. scrub. At TN9a additional species recorded include soft rush, bracken, 
common haircap moss Polytrichum commune, unidentified sphagnum moss, heather, cross-leaved 
heath and bilberry along the margins with some birch and willow regeneration in small scattered 
copses. TN21a (Photo 4a) is a large field which is superficially similar to that at TN9a but appears 
to have been managed.   Purple moor-grass is not as dominant with numerous patches of bare 
earth and young ling and cross-leaved heath plants.  In addition hare’s-tail cotton grass Eriphorum 
vaginatum, (Photo 1a) deergrass Trichophorum germanicum and lousewort Pedicularis sp. are 
common. 
Semi-improved Grassland 
4.15 
The field to the south of the woodland at TN10 appears to be slightly less agriculturally improved, 
having a lower cover of perennial rye-grass, and a wider range of grasses such as Yorkshire fog, 
crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus and creeping and common bent Agrostis capillaris.  The field 
is nevertheless species-poor. There are also two species-poor semi-improved fields in the north-
east corner of the site (TN3a, TN13a, Photo 3a). 
Woodland and scrub 
4.16 
There is a block of broadleaved woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site at TN10.  
The western end is on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground 
flora including species such as Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear and creeping buttercup.  The 
trees here are small to medium-stemmed with very little understory, and include birch Betula 
pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur.  
The hill slopes down steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of 
woodland.  Here the tree species composition is similar but the understorey is much thicker with 
bramble predominating.  On wetter areas, where the bramble thins out, carpets of opposite-leaved 
golden-saxifrage Chrysosplenium oppositifolium are present.  There are also extensive areas of 
purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with sphagnum moss species also present. 
4.17 
To the north of this woodland there is a thin strip of deciduous woodland running along the banks of 
a stream running north to south at TN42. The species composition includes occasional birch, 
willow, ash and holly. There is an understory made up largely of gorse with bramble scrub and soft 
rush grading into improved grassland to the east.   
4.18 
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland is present at the south-west end of the 
Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations.  This forms a strip to the south and a more continuous block to the north of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The woodland is 
generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow species frequent along with pedunculate 
oak, birch and holly.  The trees are growing close together and are generally small-stemmed and 
straggly.  The understorey is dense bramble and ground flora was largely absent when surveyed, 
although where the woodland opens out, for example around the margins of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations, soft-rush dominated 
marshy grassland is present.

There are also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the 
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site. At TN6a there is a small 
wooded spur with tree species including oak, birch, holly, hawthorn and an understorey dominated 
by brambles and including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent, Yorkshire fog, soft rush, hard fern 
Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern Dryopteris affinis, and bracken Pteridium aquilinum.  AtTN23a 
there is a wooded copse comprised of young birch and willow with an understorey of bramble 
scrub.  The ground flora incudes nettle, lady fern Athyrium filix-femina, scaly male fern Dryopteris 
affinis and wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum. A continuous area of scrub is present to 
the south of the woodland at TN10 and around the pond at TN15.  These areas are quite wet and 
include willow species (including grey and goat willow Salix cinerea, S. caprea), alder and bramble.  
At TN15 the scrub merges into stands of purple moor grass that are present around the pond. 
There are also blocks of scrub to the south of Abergelli Farm, along the stream that runs along the 
eastern boundary, at the northernmost point of the Survey Site, and within the marshy grassland to 
the west.  Scattered scrub (mostly common gorse Ulex europaeus) is present along some fence 
lines, and there is a bramble scrub-covered bund at TN4.   
4.20 
Many of the trees within the Survey Site are along site boundaries and are remnant hedgerow 
stools, as described in the section below. 
Boundary features 
4.21 
All boundaries on site are fences, except one length of species-poor hedgerow running north of 
Abergelli Farm.  The fences often run along the line of defunct hedges (Photo 1).  These generally 
take the form of a degraded stone-faced hedge banks, with occasional small sections of overgrown 
hedge.  The overgrown hedges include mature standard trees, large coppice stools and clumps of 
bramble and gorse scrub.  Species present include pedunculate oak, holly, birch, ash Fraxinus 
excelsior, hazel Corylus avellana and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. 
4.22 
Some of the fields on site have overgrown margins where the vegetation is less trampled and 
grazed along the fence line.  For example the northern boundary of the improved field to the north 
of the field marked TN3 has a ditch lined with purple moor-grass and gorse, and further east along 
this boundary fence bracken is frequent.  The western boundary of the field marked TN22 has 
purple moor-grass and heather growing along the fence.   
Water Courses 
4.23 
There are numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These are mostly ditches along 
field boundaries (TN22a, Photo 5a), but there is also some larger streams. The block of marshy 
grassland to the west is criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with marshy 
bases when visited in April.  There is also a stream that runs through this block of land – this is 
shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks.  Another stream (Photos 8, 9 
and 6a) runs south-east through the Survey Site and splits into smaller tributaries through the 
woodland at TN10. There are also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations.  All features that were 
visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet weather preceding the 
survey. Aquatic vegetation is not apparent in any of the water courses, but marginal vegetation 
includes frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse and bramble.   
Water Bodies 
4.24 
There are four water bodies within the Survey Site. The pond at TN15 (Pond17 – see 4.39) is 
approximately 10m in diameter, shallow, and completely covered in an unidentified sedge species.  
It has a small tree-covered island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small willow and alder trees.  
The surrounding vegetation is dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional heather and cross-
leaved heath plants, with densely growing small trees and scrub (grey willow, bramble and alder).  
A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This was not apparent amongst the 
scrub, but there were small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within purple moor 
grass in this area. 
4.25 
A small pond is present at TN19 (P18 – see 4.39) adjacent to an electricity pylon.  The pond is 
approximately circular and 5m in diameter.  It is in woodland and completely surrounded by small 
saplings.  There was no evidence of marginal or emergent aquatic vegetation when surveyed. 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
4.26 
Two ponds are also present immediately to the west of TN30a (Ponds 11 and 12).  Pond 12 is 
approximately 10m in diameter, open and unshaded with both aquatic and marginal vegetation 
present.  It appears to be an extension of two field drains that meet at this point.  Pond 11 is a 
small wet depression containing no vegetation. 
Invasive Species 
4.27 
Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica was noted on at least two locations on the block of land to 
the west of the road that runs through the site.  At Target Note 15a several stands of the species 
were noted on an embankment to a large raised area.  At Target Note 18a a stand of the species 
was noted on a bend in the stream. There are also several stands of this species growing on the 
edge of the road that leads into Abergelli Farm from the west. These extend just beyond the 
western site boundary and into the Survey Site. 
4.28 
Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera was also noted in two areas.  Abundant seedlings of the 
species were noted in the wooded copse at Target Note 23a and on an area of deciduous 
woodland at Target Note 28a.  
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
4.29 
This section presents the protected species records provided by SEWBReC along with any 
evidence of the species, or potential for it to be present gathered during the field survey.  Where 
relevant it also evaluates the potential for the Survey Site to support Section 42 species identified 
within the desk study area.  The legislation and policy relevant to each species or species group is 
described in Appendix 6. 
Bats 
4.30 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site in the records’ approximately 1 km to the 
south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.31 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule Nyctalus noctula, 
and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. There were also unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and records 
where the bat species was not specified. 
4.32 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.   
4.33 
There are a number of buildings associated with Abergelli Farm that fall within the Survey Site.  
These are all situated along the road that runs between the Water Treatment Works to the north of 
the Survey Site and Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations to the south.   Abergelli Farm consists of a rendered brick-built building (Photo 26) with 
a tiled pitched roof.  It has overhanging eaves with wooden soffits.  The associated stable block 
(Photo 27) is of the same construction with an ‘L’-shaped footprint.  Opportunities for roosting bats 
are fairly limited as the buildings appear to be in good condition, although gaps in the woodwork 
around the eaves would allow entry into the soffits. 
4.34 
At TN4 is a small concrete bunker (Photo 31) within an area of waste land.  It is formed of 2 m high 
brick walls with a flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south 
elevation and a 30 cm x 30 cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  This has some potential to 
support roosting bats. 
4.35 
Immediately to the north (Photo 29) and south (Photo 28) of Abergelli Farm are large barns 
constructed of corrugated metal and asbestos.  Potential for roosting bats in these buildings is low.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
13 
18/06/2014 
There are also two brick-built sheds with corrugated metal/asbestos pitched roofs (Photo 30) 
adjacent to the northern barn which may have greater potential to support bats, having some gaps 
in the brickwork that could allow entry in to the buildings. 
4.36 
Further south, to the south of TN25a, is a pair of houses set within plots of hard-standing and 
amenity grassland.  These are newly built and in good condition with no opportunities for roosting 
bats. 
4.37 
There are 21 trees on or within 50 m of the Survey Site that have the potential to support roosting 
bats.  Of these two have been classed as Category 1 (with definite suitable features that may 
support larger roosts of bats – see Table 1), and the remainder are Category 2 (with some limited 
roost features – see Table 1).  The locations of the trees (T1-21) are illustrated in Figures 2a and 
2b and full details of the trees are provided in Appendix 3.   
4.38 
The northern end of the Survey Site offers limited foraging and commuting potential for bats.  The 
boundaries are fences and short sections of remnant hedgerows and the fields are closely grazed.  
The block of marshy grassland, woodland and scrub to the west of the road that runs through the 
Survey Site, and the wooded stream that runs along the eastern boundary offer more potential, and 
both areas have good wooded connections with a network of hedgerows, tree-lines and marshy 
pastures off-site.  The damp wooded area around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electrical substations at the south-west end of the Survey Site also offers 
foraging potential and connects to off-site blocks of woodland to the north and south that may be 
good habitat for bats. 
4.39 
It is concluded that the Survey Site is likely to have moderate value for bats.  There are a few 
potential roosting opportunities, and some  areas (woodland and marshy grassland) of the Survey 
Site which offer foraging opportunities, but the Survey Site as a whole does not have good linear 
commuting features and the majority of the habitats (tightly grazed improved grassland) are of low 
foraging value. 
Great crested newt  
4.40 
There were no records for great crested newts provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey 
Site. 
4.41 
Nineteen ponds have been identified within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two were identified within the Survey Site boundary (Pond 
17 turned out to be a single pond when surveyed) and eight within 250 m of the Survey Site. An 
additional two on-site ponds (Ponds 11 and 12) were found during a reptile survey on 21 May 2014 
in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site that had not previously been seen 
during any other survey, as well as one within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first 
February Phase 1 survey (Pond 18). An HSI assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that 
were accessible within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit.  
This included the two on-site ponds (P17 and P18); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site 
boundary (P16); and the remainder are those ponds within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary for 
which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). Figures 2a and 2b shows which ponds were 
surveyed and which were inaccessible, either on private land or not accessible given the presence 
of horses8. 
4.42 
Table 4 below summarises the results of the HSI, and Appendix 4 gives more detailed results.

4.43 
The Survey Site lies in a part of the country where the distribution of great crested nested newts is 
patchy, with the species largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this might reduce the 
probability that great crested newts would be present on site, it does not rule out their presence.  
There are a number of ponds in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their 
terrestrial phase, including old hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey 
Site.  Those ponds surveyed, whilst most did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, do have 
potential to provide breeding habitat for great crested newts and the possible presence of the 
species on site should be considered further. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within 
the grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate). 
 
Dormouse 
4.44 
SEWBReC did not provide any records of dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius. The woodland 
areas on the eastern boundary, at the south-west end and within the marshy grassland in the 
north-west of the Survey Site do not provide optimum dormouse habitat although they are suitable 
for the species. Most of the woodland consists of relatively immature trees with little hazel 
understorey, limited foraging opportunities for this species and a lack of connectivity in the canopy. 
However, these areas of woodland have good connections to a complex of woodland and thick 
hedgerows to the west, south and east, and consequently could potentially form part of a wider 
network of dormouse-supporting habitat. There are a number of recent examples of dormouse 
occurring in sub-optimal habitat, such as coniferous plantation and species-poor hedges, in south 
and mid-Wales and their presence should not be ruled out if the habitat is sub-optimal but still has 
clear potential to support the species, as in this case. 
4.45 
Figures 2a and 2b illustrate which areas of the Survey Site have the highest potential to support 
dormouse. 
Otter 
4.46 
There are a number of water courses on site, most of which are ditches, but also a small stream 
running from north-west to south-east along the centre and eastern flank of the Survey Site and 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter 
within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 and 2013. The closest record to the 
Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west from the River Llan.  At its closest point the River Llan is 
approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, and it links to the Survey Site 
via the stream running through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  None of the water 
courses on site are likely to provide good foraging opportunities because of their size, but they may 
offer lying up sites for otter, and it is possible that individuals might use the water courses to 
commute along from time to time. 
Water Vole 
4.47 
No evidence of water voles was noted along the water courses on site when surveyed in February 
and April, although February is a time of low activity for the species, when field signs may not be 
evident.  The water courses that were visited in February all had flowing water in them when 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
15 
18/06/2014 
surveyed, following a prolonged period of extremely wet weather during the winter.  It is likely that 
many of these are usually dry or hold only a small amount of water and this was confirmed during 
the April survey. As such they do not provide good habitat for water voles. The stream that runs 
along the eastern boundary of the site; however, does provide suitable habitat for water vole, 
particularly at TN41-43. At TN43, a number of vole tunnels and holes were seen along the western 
side of the bank in long tussocks of grass, although it was not possible to ascertain which species 
had made them.   
4.48 
Water voles have been present in the vicinity: SEWBReC provided three records of water vole from 
the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River is 
hydrologically linked to the Survey Site (see otter section above), so it is possible, if any of the 
water courses retain water, particularly those linked to the River Llan, that water voles could be 
present on site.  
Reptiles 
4.49 
There were 12 records of reptiles provided by SEWBReC, between 1998 and 2010. These 
included records of all the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara, and slow worm Anguis fragilis. The closest record is of a common 
lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the 
south-west side of tinplate workings near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the 
southwest of the Survey Site boundary. 
4.50 
There are several areas of the Survey Site that provide suitable habitat for common reptile species 
(see Figures 2a and 2b).  This includes areas of marshy grassland to the south of the Survey Site, 
mounds of wood to the south of the woodland at TN10 (Photo 11), scrubby woodland fringes 
(Photo 12) and overgrown field margins either along remnant hedge banks or ditch banks. In 
addition a common lizard was seen during the April Phase 1 survey in the marshy grassland area 
in the north-west of the site and this area is particularly suitable for reptiles providing high quality 
habitat for foraging, sheltering and basking. 
Badger 
4.51 
Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
Birds 
4.52 
During the Phase 1 survey a number of common woodland and farmland bird species were 
recorded and these are listed in Appendix 5. The trees and woodland on site may provide nesting 
habitat for a range of common bird species.  The marshy grassland on site could also provide 
nesting habitat for ground-nesting bird species. The Survey Site does not appear to be of particular 
importance for wintering birds with no notable aggregations of common species or any rarer 
species recorded during the walkover survey, except for a red kite Milvus milvus seen in flight over 
the Survey Site (see below) in both February and April.  
4.53 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata, northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus and 
skylark Alauda arvensis. The closest of these records are located at the tinplate workings site near 
to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site boundary.  There 
was one record of curlew, located at the Lliw reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
 
Schedule 1 Birds 
4.54 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl Tyto alba. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the 
west of the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south 
west near Penllergaer Woods in 2000.  It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the 
Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, although no trees were found that appear, from a 
ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy 
fields at the southern end of the Survey Site, although probably sub-optimal, could provide habitat 
for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) given the thick, tussocky structure of 
some parts of the sward. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site provides 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
16 
18/06/2014 
optimal foraging habitat for barn owls due to its extensive areas of tussocky grassland that may 
support breeding field voles Microtus agrestis, their preferred prey species. 
4.55 
A red kite was noted circling above the field at TN3 and also over Abergelli Farm.  Red kites 
generally breed in valley woodlands of which there is extensive habitat to 2-3 km to the east and 
west of the Survey Site.  It is considered likely that the Survey Site is part of a much wider area of 
potential foraging habitat for the species. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red kite between 1999 
and 2013. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 terrestrial invertebrate species. The species 
recorded are marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth 
Hemaris tityus, and small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty-nine of the records are of 
marsh fritillary; the closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site 
boundary in 2009. This location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well 
as the closest of the five small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee 
hawk-moth record. 
4.2 
The marshy grassland to the west provides suitable habitat for marsh fritillaries, although the food 
plant devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis was not noted in any quantity during the April survey.  
Of the other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for 
narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus, which largely relies on devil’s bit scabious, like 
marsh fritillary. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers to 
bask and no areas where its usual food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is found in any 
quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola spp.) as its foodplant and violets 
have not been recorded during either Phase 1 survey (the April survey was well timed to record 
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species is present.  
4.3 
Other habitats that may be suitable for diverse assemblages of terrestrial invertebrates include the 
areas of broad-leaved ancient woodland at Target Note 10, for example, which represents a fairly 
extensive area of semi-natural habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates, 
particularly Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera); which are both strongly 
represented in wooded habitats.   
Aquatic Invertebrates 
4.4 
No records of Section 42 aquatic invertebrate species were provided by SEWBReC, and it is 
unlikely that any of the ponds on or close to the site support unusual or diverse assemblages of 
aquatic invertebrates.

Recommendations 
5.1 
For the purposes of this report it has been assumed at this stage that direct impacts will potentially 
occur across the Survey Site, and that indirect impacts will need to be considered beyond this, 
within the ‘zone of influence’ that will vary dependent on the receptor (habitat, protected species, 
designated site) concerned.  The recommendations presented below are based on preliminary 
assumptions of the potential impacts and the corresponding requirement to confirm presence / 
absence, and where present the distribution and abundance of protected and otherwise notable 
species or habitats that may occur within the Survey Site and a zone of influence surrounding it. 
Statutory Designated Sites  
5.2 
Nant Y Crimp SSSI, Penplas Grasslands SSSI and Cadle Heath LNR are located within 5 km of the 
Survey Site boundary. These sites are designated for their habitat interest and as all are over 2 km 
from the Survey Site, direct impacts resulting from the development are considered unlikely.  Nant 
Y Crimp SSSI also has a colony of marsh fritillary butterflies. The larval food plant (devil’s-bit 
scabious) for this species was found in small patches in the western area of marshy grassland 
during the Phase 1 survey, so this species may be present.  However this assessment will need to 
be reviewed once a botanical survey (see below) of the western block of marshy grassland has 
been carried out.  
 
Habitat Regulations Assessment 
5.3 
Consultation with the Planning Authority, Natural Resources Wales and PINS will determine the 
requirement for a screening exercise (under the Habitat Regulations) that considers the proximity 
of potentially sensitive ecological receptors (notably European protected sites, but potentially 
extended to SSSIs) within a search area that may extend to or beyond a 5 km radius of the Survey 
Site (for example, Camarthen Bay and Estuary SAC, Crymlyn Bog SAC, SPA and Ramsar, and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar all lie within 10 km of the Survey Site), and whether these could be 
affected by CO, NOX and NO2 emissions as well as nitrogen and acid deposition. 
5.4 
The requirement for further surveys or desk based investigation will be determined following review 
of the scoping opinion (and consultation) on this matter. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites  
5.5 
Three SINCs lie partially within the site boundary and could therefore be directly affected by the 
proposed development.  Indirect impacts could also potentially occur on those sites lying adjacent 
or close to the boundary.   
5.6 
The woodland on site that falls within Llety-Morfil SINC and the southern part of Waun Garn Wen 
SINC is also designated as Ancient Woodland and as such is irreplaceable.  Direct impacts on this 
resource may therefore also occur as a result of the proposals. 
Habitats 
5.7 
The marshy grasslands within the Survey Site potentially qualify as a Section 42 habitat ‘purple 
moor-grass and rush pastures’.  The area to the west of Abergelli Farm is also a SINC.  These 
habitats require a NVC botanical survey at an appropriate time of year (June/July) to establish their 
ecological value and inform the level of mitigation required to compensate if they are to be lost or 
modified as a consequence of the Project. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the site is 
potentially of high ecological value, and this needs to be confirmed through botanical and other 
Phase 2 survey work.  The semi-improved grasslands in the north-east corner of the site, whilst not 
having obvious high botanical value, are included within a larger SINC.  As such it is recommended 
that a botanical survey is carried out on these areas to establish their value in the wider context of 
the SINC, and therefore the likely mitigation that would be required for their loss. 
5.8 
‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ is also a Section 42 habitat. The woodland on site all falls 
into this category and the majority of the resource also falls within a SINC and is designated as 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
18 
18/06/2014 
Ancient Woodland.  A botanical survey of these areas in spring/early summer when the ground 
flora is in evidence would allow an evaluation of their ecological value to be made.  
5.9 
There are no other habitats on site of high intrinsic ecological value.  The improved grassland 
habitat is common and widespread in south Wales and of minimal ecological value. In addition, all 
(bar one species poor example) of the hedgerows on the Survey Site are defunct. 
Invasive species 
5.10 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam have both been noted on the Survey Site.  It is 
recommended that a walkover survey of the Survey Site is carried out once access is available to 
all areas, including the proposed access route to map all locations where these species are 
growing.  This should be done within the period June - July when both species are most in 
evidence.  
5.11 
If work is to take place in any areas where these species are present, a Management Plan will 
need to be drawn up detailing the methods that will be used to remove these species under 
controlled conditions as detailed by the Environment Agency (The Knotweed Code of Practice 
2003 and guidance on Environment Agency website). 
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
Bats 
Trees and Buildings 
5.12 
Twenty one trees within the Survey Site have been identified as having potential to support 
roosting bats.  If these trees are to be removed or modified, it is recommended that a roped-access 
tree survey is carried out in order to confirm whether any of the features initially identified support 
roosting bats or have the potential to do so.  Where the potential for bats to roost in the tree is 
confirmed then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey may need to be carried out to 
confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the status of any roost present. If a bat roost 
is confirmed, either through emergence/re-entry survey or through roped-access survey a 
European Protected Species (EPS) Licence is likely to be required before the tree can be felled.  
5.13 
It is recommended that all buildings to be directly or indirectly affected by the Project (if any) should 
be inspected for signs of roosting bats and features with the potential to support roosting bats, 
where access allows. 
5.14 
If signs of roosting bats or features with the potential to be used by roosting bats are identified 
during these inspection surveys, further survey in the form of dusk emergence/ dawn re-entry 
surveys may be required. The level of survey effort required will depend on the potential that the 
building or tree has been assigned in these initial inspection surveys. These further surveys (if 
required) should be undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance (Hundt, 2012) at 
a time of year when breeding roosts may be present (i.e. between mid-May and mid-August). 
Activity Survey 
5.15 
The areas of marshy grassland, woodland and streams on site potentially provide good foraging 
habitat for bats.  It is recommended that bat activity surveys are carried out in order to inform an 
assessment of the Survey Site’s value for bats and to guide the evolution of the Project and 
mitigation accordingly.  Following the guidance provided in Hundt (2012), this would involve two 
walked transect routes (given the size of the Survey Site) carried out monthly between April and 
October, as specified in the guidelines.  An automated survey using four static bat detectors (two 
per transect route) recording for at least three nights would also be carried out. Rather than 
deploying detectors at four locations every month, it is recommended that surveys are carried out 
at four locations for three months and another four locations for the other four months so that half 
the locations would be surveyed in April, June, August and October and the other four in May, July 
and September. This would increase the spatial coverage of the Survey Site but ensure that 
sampling was undertaken at each location in spring, summer and autumn to allow a robust 
seasonal comparison to be made.

Great Crested Newt 
5.16 
The presence of four ponds on site with several more in the vicinity of the Survey Site, and the 
occurrence of suitable terrestrial habitat on site indicate that great crested newts could potentially 
be using the Survey Site. This should be established through further targeted survey work. 
5.17 
Section 5.4 of the GCN Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001) recommends that: 
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
5.18 
Natural England guidance(2001) is further developed in the GCN Method Statement which states 
that:  
‘The decision on whether to survey depends primarily on how likely it is that the development would 
affect newts using those ponds. For developments resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss 
at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, carefully consider whether a survey is 
appropriate.…. normally appropriate only when all of the following conditions are met: 
1. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population,  
2. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority available 
locally,  
3. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
4. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
5.19 
The second piece of guidance, which supersedes the first, specifies that all four conditions should 
be met for surveys to be required of ponds beyond 250m of the Survey Site boundary.  In this case, 
condition 1. is not met as there is no indication from desk study data or the HSI assessment that 
any of the ponds is likely to support a large population of GCN or that they provide particularly 
suitable habitat (condition 2.) with no ponds within 250m of the Survey Site recording better than an 
‘average’ score on the HSI assessment.  
5.20 
As a consequence, it is recommended that all ponds within 250m (not 250-500m) would need to be 
further surveyed. This would initially involve four surveys within the period mid-March to mid-June 
to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during mid-April to mid-May), with an 
additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population size if newts are found during 
the first four surveys.   
 
Dormouse 
5.21 
If the woodland on the Survey Site is to be removed, damaged or significantly modified, it is 
recommended that dormouse surveys are carried out with the aim of establishing whether the 
species is present on site, and therefore whether a EPS Licence will be required before woodland 
can be cleared or significantly modified. It is recommended undertaking a dormouse survey, 
following methods based on those prescribed in best practice guidance (Bright et al. 2006). The 
surveys will involve the use of dormouse boxes in areas of woodland and nest tubes in cluttered 
environments where boxes cannot be used. The survey will be designed to detect the presence or 
absence of dormice rather than to provide an abundance estimate or monitor a population of the 
species. Surveys would be carried out monthly during April-November. 
 
Otter and Water Vole 
5.22 
Otter usage of the Survey Site is likely to be occasional although there are suitable resting/lying up 
places present along the eastern stream corridor within the Survey Site.  Mitigation measures to 
avoid potential killing or injury to individuals during the construction and decommissioning phases 
should be considered, for example covering open workings overnight.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
20 
18/06/2014 
5.23 
A survey for water voles along the banks of the water courses on site should be carried out as a 
precautionary measure to establish whether the species is likely to be present on site and to design 
mitigation accordingly.  This would involve one visit and should be carried out ideally in spring 
when field signs are likely to be most in evidence but the vegetation has not grown up to obscure 
them. It will also be possible to carry out additional checks for signs of otter at the same time as the 
water vole survey, for completeness. The survey would be carried out in accordance with best 
practice guidelines (Chanin (2003) and Strachan et al., (2011), respectively). 
 
Reptiles 
5.24 
A reptile survey should be carried out on the Survey Site to establish the presence/absence of 
reptiles, the species present and the approximate population size. The survey will be conducted 
using artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of 
their distribution and abundance, following good practice guidance, including that set out in the 
Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance (Froglife, 
1999). This requires a minimum of seven visits conducted at an appropriate time of year (either 
spring/early summer and/or late summer/early autumn) during suitable weather conditions. 
 
Badger 
5.25 
 Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
 
Breeding Birds 
5.26 
Breeding bird surveys of the Survey Site should be carried out with the aim of establishing the 
ecological value of the breeding bird population and to inform mitigation measures. Farmland birds 
(occurring both within the Survey Site and a buffer of up to 50m) would be the main target of the 
survey. Territory mapping surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s Common Bird 
Census (CBC) methodology will be undertaken.  These would be conducted on three occasions 
during the breeding season.  It is recommended that an initial visit is carried out in mid-April, 
followed by additional visits in May and June. 
5.27 
The Phase 1 survey was partly conducted in winter with an experienced ornithologist (Matt Hobbs) 
part of the survey team. As there was no evidence of notable aggregations of common species or 
habitat that may support rarer species it is considered that there is no justification for carrying out 
targeted wintering bird surveys.  
Barn owls 
5.28 
It is recommended that all buildings and mature trees on site to be directly or indirectly affected by 
the Project (if any) should be inspected for signs of roosting or nesting. Signs to be searched for 
include: nest debris, barn owl pellets, white splashes from barn owl droppings and live or dead barn 
owls themselves (Barn Owl Trust, 2012). Barn owl roost inspections can be conducted all year 
round. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
5.29 
The block of marshy grassland to the west, provides potential habitat for marsh fritillary butterflies 
due to the presence of their food plant, devil’s-bit scabious. As such a survey of adults during late 
May/June and also the larval webs should be carried out in mid-August to mid-September. Both 
surveys would involve walking transects over the marshy grassland, the former noting adult marsh 
fritillary butterflies and the latter checking all patches of the food plant for larval webs and larvae 
and following standard methods9. 
5.30 
The woodland at Target Note 10, for example represents a fairly extensive area of semi-natural 
habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates; which are both strongly represented in 
wooded habitats.  If the woodland at TN10 is to be affected by the Project it is proposed that further 
survey will be appropriate that targets both Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera).

Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
A moth survey should also be undertaken of the marshy grassland area in the north-west of the 
site. 
5.31 
Survey of Lepidoptera should involve two night-time moth surveys to be undertaken in late spring 
and mid-summer. Trapping using Skinner or Robinson moth traps fitted with mercury vapour bulbs 
is most suitable in terms of attracting an extensive and variable moth fauna. Lights should be 
switched on at dusk and remain lit until dawn the following day.  The traps should be checked 
periodically throughout the night to log any new arrivals.  Any species hard to identify from external 
markings alone, and those requiring further confirmation, should be retained and dissected if 
necessary to ascertain their identity with the use of a stereoscopic microscope. 
5.32 
For beetles, a method should be developed that follows Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et 
al., 2007) to sample beetle assemblages directed at woodland habitats, via hand searches, sweep 
netting and pitfall trapping. To align with the Lepidoptera surveys, this can be undertaken in late 
spring/early summer and mid/late summer/early autumn. Subsequent laboratory identification will 
be required for many of the specimens collected. 
5.33 
Analysis of the results should use the ISIS protocol to determine whether any broad or specialist 
assemblage types of Lepidoptera and / or Coleoptera are present. Consideration should also be 
given to any rare, scarce or nationally threatened species present, including Section 42 species.  
Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.34 
On the assumption that watercourses will be affected by the Project, it may be appropriate to 
undertake an assessment of water quality, compliant with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). A 
main aim of the WFD is to prevent deterioration in the status of aquatic ecosystems, protect them 
and improve the ecological condition of waters. The requirement for such an assessment would be 
driven in consultation with Natural Resources Wales. Should such an assessment be required it 
may be appropriate to assess the ecological quality and surface water chemistry of watercourses to 
be affected. 
5.35 
To determine ecological quality kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates should be undertaken at 
selected locations along the ditch / stream, and the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) 
score applied to inform an assessment of water quality and species present. This survey is best 
undertaken in spring or autumn in swift flowing waters, or in summer in stationary ditches or those 
with a slow flow. All macro-invertebrates should be identified to species level in order to determine 
the presence of any scarce or nationally notable species. 
5.36 
To determine water chemistry status a single water sample should be extracted at three locations; 
within the Survey Site and upstream and downstream of this. Samples should be dispatched to a 
UKAS accredited laboratory for subsequent analysis, to cover a standard range of parameters 
including: Biological Dissolved Oxygen, Total Suspended Solids, nutrient composition (e.g. nitrite 
as nitrogen, total oxidised nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorus), hardness, 
calcium, alkalinity, conductivity and pH. 
5.37 
The condition of the watercourse can subsequently be analysed by recording and comparing the 
aggregated number of taxa, and average score per taxon from the sampling points along the 
watercourse within, upstream and downstream from the Survey Site. The statistical model (RICT) 
developed for WFD classification would be used to calculate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) 
that compares observed with expected results for a watercourse of the same type. The EQR is 
then used to identify the Biological Status of the watercourse which is separated into five bands 
(Bad to High) required by the WFD. 
5.38 
It may also be necessary to undertake invertebrate surveys of any ponds that are likely to be 
affected by the development proposals. These are likely to involve surveys of aquatic beetles in 
June and August 
Un-surveyed Land 
5.39 
There are a number of small parcels of land that have not yet been surveyed in the southern part of 
the site. These are indicated on Figure 1b and will be surveyed once access has been arranged. 
The Phase 1 report will be updated once these surveys are complete.

Appendix 1: Target Notes 
February Survey 
1. A spring running into a wet ditch.  The ditch has a muddy base with sweet-grass Glyceria sp. and soft rush 
the dominant plant species.  Frog spawn was present. 
2. A wet ditch fenced on either side.  The ditch meets a spring which runs into it flowing southwards.  The 
ditch has steeply sloping grassy banks, is open and unshaded with great willow herb Epilobium hirstum and 
soft rush present.  A newly planted hedge runs along the south side – gapping up a defunct hedge.  Also, 
occasional large coppices of holly were recorded. 
3. Marshy grassland with abundant soft rush.   The sward is grazed very short by horses. Frequent patches 
of sedge species were recorded including common sedge and glaucous sedge.  Other species noted include 
sharp-flowered rush and/or jointed rush (difficult to separate in winter and when closely grazed), cinquefoil 
species, daisy and creeping bent.   
4. A small concrete bunker with wasteland area.  The concrete bunker is formed of 2m high brick walls with a 
flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south elevation and a 30cm x 
30cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  No evidence of bats was recorded. The surrounding land is 
compacted course aggregate which is becoming colonised with common grassland species.  There is an 
earth bund around the south-east and north-east boundary, topped with dense bramble and gorse scrub. 
5. An area of marshy grassland which is very closely grazed.  Occasional heather and bilberry plants and 
patches of sphagnum moss were recorded. Purple moor grass is frequent and forms dominant tussocks at 
the north end of the field.  Other species include sheep’s fescue and a sedge species.   
6. An area of marshy grassland dominated by soft rush.  The field was not entered as it is outside the 
ownership boundary, but inspection from the roadside suggests that rushes are interspersed with 
agriculturally improved grassland. 
7. A wet ditch running through the middle of the field containing fast flowing water with orange discolouration. 
The ditch is overgrown with bramble and joins another ditch on its eastern boundary, which is lined with 
purple moor grass, greater willowherb, and soft rush.  The surrounding field is agriculturally improved with 
patches of soft rush. 
8. A derelict stone farmhouse with only the bottom halves of walls still present.  Patches of rubble and 
overgrown vegetation are present, which may provide good habitat for reptiles. 
9. A stream lined with trees, which is fast-flowing with a stony substrate. 
10. An area of broadleaved woodland.  The western end is on a hill, which slopes steeply down to the east.  
This end (delineated by a stream running north-south) is dry with widely spaced trees and a grazed 
grassland ground flora (Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear, and creeping buttercup were the most prominent 
species) and very little understorey was noted.  The eastern end is much wetter, with carpets of opposite-
leaved golden-saxifrage, extensive areas of purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with some sphagnum 
moss species.  The understorey is thicker here and is predominantly bramble.   Tree species include birch, 
crab-apple, holly and pedunculate oak.  Most specimens are small-medium in size. 
11 and 12. These Target Notes relate to evidence of badger activity and are provided in a confidential 
version of this report. They are also omitted from Figures. 
13. A ditch along a line of small-medium trees (beech, holly, pedunculate oak) and a fence. Bilberry is 
growing along the fence. 
14. A marshy grassland field with abundant soft rush tussocks.  The area indicated by this target note is 
dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional cross-leaved heath and scattered small trees/scrub.  
15. A shallow pond (less than 10cm deep), approximately 10m in diameter, completely covered in a sedge 
species (only dead leaves were evident so identification was not possible) and with a small tree-covered 
island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small trees.  The surrounding vegetation includes purple moor-
grass with occasional heather and cross-leaved heath and densely growing small trees and scrub (willow 
species, bramble and alder.  A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This consisted of 
small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within marshy (rushes, purple moor grass) vegetation. 
16.  A strip of land around the gas station, which is higher than the surrounding land.  There is a gravel strip 
immediately surrounding the boundary fence then a steep slope covered in soft-rush dominated grassland.  
At the base of the slope is a mosaic of marshy rush-dominated grassland with dense bramble scrub and wet

woodland.  The woodland consists of closely spaced, small and straggly trees composed largely of holly, 
pedunculate oak, birch, willow and alder.     
17. A patch of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  Small patch of bulrush were found 
towards centre of field.  The field is surrounded by encroaching scrub and straggly woodland. 
18.  An area of wet woodland with dense bramble understorey.  The species present and structure are as for 
Target Note 16.  Wet underfoot. 
19. A small pond within woodland fed by a stream.  No emergent/marginal vegetation was in evidence and 
the pond is surrounded by small saplings. 
20. Marshy grassland fields consisting of more than 25% soft rush.  The intervening grassland is 
agriculturally improved, including perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, common mouse-ear and white clover 
Trifolium repens.   
21. An area of marshy grassland with approximately 75% soft rush cover. The intervening grassland is semi-
improved. 
22. An area of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  The western boundary fence has 
heather and purple moor-grass growing along it.

Appendix 6: Summaries of Relevant Legislation, Policy and Other 
Instruments 
National Planning Policy  
6.2 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 5 provides Welsh Assembly Government advice about how the land 
use planning system in Wales should contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and 
geological conservation.   
6.3 
It follows that the TAN provides guidance to local planning authorities on: the key principles of 
positive planning for nature conservation; nature conservation and Local Development Plans; 
nature conservation in development management procedures; development affecting protected 
internationally and nationally designated sites and habitats; and, development affecting protected 
and priority habitats and species. 
6.4 
Planning considerations with regard to habitats and species are of greatest relevance to the 
Abergelli Farm proposal.  For a full account, the TAN should be referred to, but some of the key 
principles are summarised as follows: 
i. 
When dealing with cases where a European protected species of plant or animal may be affected, 
a local planning authority needs to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive in the 
exercise of its functions. 
ii. 
The TAN refers to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which makes it an offence 
(with certain limited exceptions and in the absence of a licence) to intentionally to kill, injure or take 
any wild bird, or to damage, take or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is being built or 
in use, or to take or destroy its eggs.  Further offences apply to species listed under Schedule 1 of 
the Act. 
iii. 
The above Act also affords protection to wild animals of the species listed in Schedule 5, and to 
wild plants listed in Schedule 8, most of which are not European protected species.  Actions that 
are likely to result in an offence are identified; 
iv. 
With regard to badger, Meles meles, the TAN refers to the provisions of the Protection of Badgers 
Act, 1992; 
v. 
The TAN makes reference to Sections 40 and 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006, which place a duty on the Welsh Assembly Government to have regard to 
the purpose of conserving biodiversity (see Section 1.10 of this report); 
vi. 
In section 2.4 it is noted that when deciding planning applications that may affect nature 
conservation, local planning authorities should protect wildlife and natural features in the wider 
environment, with appropriate weight attached to priority habitats and species in Biodiversity Action 
Plans; 
vii. 
When determining planning applications, planning authorities should ensure that all material 
considerations are taken into account, that decisions are informed by adequate information about 
the potential effects of development on nature conservation, and that the range and population of 
protected species is sustained; 
viii. 
Planning applications should demonstrate a step-wise approach to avoid harm to nature 
conservation, minimise unavoidable harm by mitigation measures, offset residual harm by 
compensation measures and look for new opportunities to enhance nature conservation. 
UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework 
6.5 
The Environment Departments of all four governments in the UK work together through the Four 
Countries Biodiversity Group.  Together they have agreed, and Ministers have signed, a framework 
of priorities for UK-level work for the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Published on 17 July 
2012, the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework' covers the period from 2011 to 2020.  
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
41 
18/06/2014 
6.6 
Most work which was previously carried out under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) is now 
focussed in the four countries of the UK through the new framework.  The UK BAP partnership no 
longer operates but includes detailed Action Plans for priority habitats and species, which are still in 
use and of relevance. The list of priority habitats and species included within the UK BAP list is 
equivalent to the list of Section 42 habitats and species.  
6.7 
The UK BAP is supported by a series of Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAPs), usually set up on 
a local authority administrative boundary basis. Each LBAP identifies those habitats and species 
considered to be most important in that area (usually referred to as priority habitats and species). 
Commonly, an LBAP will identify a number of habitats and species for which “action plans” have 
been prepared. The Swansea LBAP is was created in 2005 but is unavailable as it is under review. 
Wildlife Legislation 
6.8 
Legislation of most relevance to this assessment includes the following: 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006  
6.9 
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty 
which public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public 
authority must, in exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper 
exercise of those functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority 
includes local authorities and local planning authorities. 
6.10 
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living 
organism or type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”. 
6.11 
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the 
living organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal 
importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list 
that was found in Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act). 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way 
Act 2000) 
Protection afforded to birds 
6.12 
Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) prohibits the intentional killing, injuring or 
taking of any wild bird and the taking, damaging or destroying of the nest (whilst being built or in 
use) or eggs.  Section 1 also prohibits disturbing any bird listed on Schedule 1 of the Act whilst at 
or near the nest and prohibits disturbing the dependent young of such birds. 
Protection afforded to other animals 
6.13 
Species listed on Schedule 5 that may be of relevance to this site include GCNs, bats, otter, water 
vole and all species of reptiles.  The places of shelter used by otter and water vole are protected, 
but reptiles are protected from killing and injury only. 
Protection afforded to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
6.14 
Section 28 allows for the creation of SSSIs by the government (through Natural Resources Wales 
in Wales) where Natural Resources Wales (NRW) “is of the opinion that any area of land is of 
special interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features.” 
6.15 
Section 28G specifies the duty of specific public authorities (including local authorities) to further 
the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is designated and 
also to notify NRW of operations likely to damage such features in order that NRW may consent to 
or refuse permission for such operations.

The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
6.16 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species (Amendment) Regulations 2012 consolidates the 
various amendments that have been made to the Regulations. The original (1994) Regulations 
transposed the EC Habitats Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) into national law. 
6.17 
“European protected species” (EPS) are those which are present on Schedule 2 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. They are subject to the provisions of 
Regulation 41 of those Regulations. All EPS are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended). Taken together, these pieces of legislation make it an offence to: 
a) Intentionally or deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal included amongst these 
species; 
b) Possess or control any live or dead specimens or any part of, or anything derived from a these 
species; 
c) Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species; 
d) Deliberately take or destroy the eggs of such an animal; or 
e) Intentionally, deliberately or recklessly damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of 
such an animal, or obstruct access to such a place. 
6.18 
For the purposes of paragraph (c), disturbance of animals includes in particular any disturbance 
which is likely— 
a) to impair their ability— 
I. 
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
II. 
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or migrate; or 
6.19 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which they belong. 
6.20 
Although the law provides strict protection to these species, it also allows this protection to be set 
aside (derogated) through the issuing of licences. The licences in England are currently determined 
by NE for development works. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulations (2012), a 
licence can only be issued where the following requirements are satisfied: 
a) The proposal is necessary ‘to preserve public health or public safety or other imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature and 
beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment’; 
b) ‘There is no satisfactory alternative’; and 
c) The proposals ‘will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species 
concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range’. 
6.21 
EPS that may be relevant to this proposal include GCNs, bats, dormouse and otter. 
Invasive Species Legislation 
6.22 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are both listed on Part 2, Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  Section 14 of the Act states that it is an offence for a 
person to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any species listed on Part2, Schedule 9.  The 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 contains a number of legal provisions concerning ‘controlled 
waste’.  Any soil or plant material contaminated with Japanese knotweed that is to be discarded is 
classified as controlled waste.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Background 
1.1 
On 26 June 2014, the Secretary of State (SoS) received the 
Scoping Report submitted by Abergelli Power Limited under 
Regulation 8 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2263) (as amended) (the EIA 
Regulations) in order to request a scoping opinion for the proposed 
Abergelli Power Project (‘the Project’). This Opinion is made in 
response to this request and should be read in conjunction with 
the applicant’s Scoping Report. 
1.2 
The applicant has formally provided notification under Regulation 
6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations that it proposes to provide an ES in 
respect of the proposed development. Therefore, in accordance 
with Regulation 4(2)(a) of the EIA Regulations, the proposed 
development is determined to be EIA development. 
1.3 
The EIA Regulations enable an applicant, before making an 
application for an order granting development consent, to ask the 
SoS to state in writing their formal opinion (a ‘scoping opinion’) on 
the information to be provided in the environmental statement 
(ES).   
1.4 
Before adopting a scoping opinion the SoS must take into account: 
(a) the specific characteristics of the particular development; 
(b) the specific characteristics of the development of the type 
concerned; and 
(c) environmental 
features 
likely 
to 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
development’. 
(EIA Regulation 8 (9)) 
1.5 
This Opinion sets out what information the SoS considers should 
be included in the ES for the proposed development. The Opinion 
has taken account of:  
i 
the EIA Regulations  
ii 
the nature and scale of the proposed development  
iii 
the nature of the receiving environment, and 
iv 
current best practice in the preparation of environmental 
statements.  
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project

1.6 
The SoS has also taken account of the responses received from 
the statutory consultees (see Appendix 2 of this Opinion). The 
matters addressed by the applicant have been carefully considered 
and use has been made of professional judgement and experience 
in order to adopt this Opinion. It should be noted that when it 
comes to consider the ES, the SoS will take account of relevant 
legislation and guidelines (as appropriate). The SoS will not be 
precluded from requiring additional information if it is considered 
necessary in connection with the ES submitted with that 
application when considering the application for a development 
consent order (DCO).  
1.7 
This Opinion should not be construed as implying that the SoS 
agrees with the information or comments provided by the 
applicant in their request for an opinion from the SoS. In 
particular, comments from the SoS in this Opinion are without 
prejudice to any decision taken by the SoS (on submission of the 
application) that any development identified by the applicant is 
necessarily to be treated as part of a nationally significant 
infrastructure project (NSIP), or associated development, or 
development that does not require development consent. 
1.8 
Regulation 8(3) of the EIA Regulations states that a request for a 
scoping opinion must include:  
(a) ‘a plan sufficient to identify the land; 
(b) a brief description of the nature and purpose of the 
development and of its possible effects on the environment; 
and 
(c) such other information or representations as the person 
making the request may wish to provide or make’. 
(EIA Regulation 8 (3)) 
1.9 
The SoS considers that this has been provided in the applicant’s 
Scoping Report. 
The Secretary of State’s Consultation 
1.10 The SoS has a duty under Regulation 8(6) of the EIA Regulations 
to consult widely before adopting a scoping opinion. A full list of 
the consultation bodies is provided at Appendix 1. The list has 
been compiled by the SoS under their duty to notify the consultees 
in accordance with Regulation 9(1)(a). The applicant should note 
that whilst the SoS’s list can inform their consultation, it should 
not be relied upon for that purpose.

1.11 The list of respondents who replied within the statutory timeframe 
and whose comments have been taken into account in the 
preparation of this Opinion is provided at Appendix 2 along with 
copies of their comments, to which the applicant should refer in 
undertaking the EIA. 
1.12 The 
ES 
submitted 
by 
the 
applicant 
should 
demonstrate 
consideration of the points raised by the consultation bodies. It is 
recommended that a table is provided in the ES summarising the 
scoping responses from the consultation bodies and how they are, 
or are not, addressed in the ES. 
1.13 Any consultation responses received after the statutory deadline 
for receipt of comments will not be taken into account within this 
Opinion. Late responses will be forwarded to the applicant and will 
be made available on the Planning Inspectorate’s website. The 
applicant should also give due consideration to those comments in 
carrying out the EIA.

2.0 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT 
Introduction 
2.1 
The following is a summary of the information on the proposed 
development and its site and surroundings prepared by the 
applicant and included in their Scoping Report. The information 
has not been verified and it has been assumed that the 
information provided reflects the existing knowledge of the 
proposed development and the potential receptors/resources. 
The Applicant’s Information 
Overview of the proposed development 
2.2 
The proposed development would comprise a new Power 
Generation Plant, capable of providing an electrical capacity of up 
to 299MW. It would be fuelled by natural gas and connected to the 
National Grid. The proposal would be located on pastoral fields at 
Abergelli Farm, to the north of Swansea, in the City and County of 
Swansea, South West Wales.  
2.3 
The proposed development would comprise the following principal 
components (Section 1.1.2 of the Scoping Report):  
 
Generating equipment, including gas turbine generators and 
balance of plant (Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT)); 
 
New purpose built access road; 
 
A temporary construction compound (laydown area); 
 
New gas connection;  
 
New electrical connection. 
 
Description of the site and surrounding area  
The Application Site 
2.4 
The application site is located within an area of lowland farmland 
known locally as the ‘Welsh Gower’; approximately 1km south of 
Felindre, 760m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4km north of 
Llangyfelach. Swansea lies approximately 5km to the south of the 
site. The site is roughly an ‘L’ shape and approximately 150ha in 
total, including the power generation plant site, and the electrical 
and gas connection opportunity areas. Three residential dwellings, 
Abergelli Farm, Abergelli fawr, and Lletty Morfil Farm are located 
within the site boundaries, as shown on Figure 2. 
   
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
5 
2.5 
The Scoping Report identifies that the land is currently used for 
sheep and horse grazing, along with horse training and breeding.  
Most of the farmland is agriculturally improved grassland and 
classified as Grade 4 agricultural land; but also contains significant 
areas of marshy grassland and scattered woodland and scrub. The 
fields are largely bound by fences, with one section of species-poor 
hedgerow running north of Abergelli Farm.  
2.6 
A gas Nation Transmission System (NTS) Pipeline and water 
pipelines cross the site, while the western part of the site 
encompasses two National Grid 400KV electrical substations and 
Felindre gas compressor substation. Areas of the site have been 
previously subject to various permissions for mineral extraction, 
inert landfill and other commercial activities.   
2.7 
The Afon Llan flows in a south-westerly direction to the west and 
south of the site. The site is primarily within EA Flood Zone 1, 
although a small area to the south east of the site appears to lie 
within Zones 2 and 3. A number of springs issue on the site, with 
their associated drainage ditches and streams running along the 
field boundaries and discharging into the Afon Llan. Four water 
bodies have been identified within the survey site (see Appendix 
A: Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, paragraphs 4.24, 4.25 and 
4.26). Numerous public footpaths, bridleways and tracks run 
through the site.  
2.8 
The geology of the site is characterised by boulder clay and the 
underlying Grovesend Beds, Upper Carboniferous sandstones and 
thin coals; overlain by glacial sand and gravel, alluvium and peat. 
The geology is overlain by raw gley and brown soils.  
2.9 
The Scoping Report states that the land within the power 
generation plant site (See figure 1: Project Site Plan) is 
approximately 90m Above Ordnance Datum (AOD), gently sloping 
downwards in a southerly direction. The wider application site also 
appears to be gently sloping.  
2.10 Three Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) lie 
partially within the site (Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands, Warn 
Garn Wen and Llety Morphil). A further two SINCs are adjacent to 
the site, with Rhos Fawr SINC to the north, and Felindre 
Grasslands SINC to the south. The majority of woodland within the 
site is designated as Ancient Woodland.  
2.11 There is potential habitat on the site to support European 
Protected Species, including bats, great crested newts, dormice 
and otters. The site could also support Barn Owls (Schedule 1 
species) and nationally protected species, including reptiles, 
badgers and water voles. Breeding birds may also use the site. 
Figures 2a and 2b of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal illustrate 
the areas on and around the site which have the potential to 
support protected species.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
6 
2.12 Following the results of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, further Phase 
2 protected species surveys are currently being carried out. 
2.13 The invasive species Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam 
are present on the site.  
The Surrounding Area 
2.14 The area surrounding the application site is rural, but with a 
substantial amount of utilities infrastructure. A water treatment 
works is located immediately to the northwest, with the Cefn 
Betingau Solar Park to the east. A network of electricity pylons, to 
the south west of Abergelli Farm, link to the National Grid 
electrical substations. The surrounding habitats are similar to 
those on site, with areas of improved and marshy grassland 
interspersed with areas of woodland.  
2.15 The closest Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) are the settlements 
of Morriston, Pant-lasau, Llwyncelyn and Felindre, all within 1km 
of the site. The Scoping Report also identifies 19 isolated dwellings 
and farmsteads outside of these settlements but within 1km of the 
site.  
2.16 The following nature conservation sites have been identified within 
10km of the site: 
 
Nant Y Crimp Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) – 
approximately 2.5km from the site.  
 
Penllergaer Railway Cutting SSSI – approximately 2.8km from 
the site.  
 
Penplas Grasslands SSSI – approximately 3.2km from the site. 
 
Glais Moraine SSSI – approximately 4km from the site. 
 
Cadle Heath Local Nature Reserve (LNR) – approximately 
4.5km from the site.  
 
Camarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation 
(SAC) – approximately 7.2km from the site.  
 
Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar – approximately 7.3km from the 
site.  
 
Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar (within 
the boundary of the Camarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC) – 
approximately 9.7km from the site. 
 
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
7 
2.17 The Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar have been designated for their 
avian assemblage, including wintering oystercatcher, northern 
pintail, common redshank and red knot. The Camarthan Bay and 
Estuaries SAC is designated for a number of Annex I habitats, 
including sandbanks, estuaries, mudflats, sandflats; while the 
Crymlyn Bog SAC is designated for Annex I habitats including 
transition mires and quaking bogs, calcareous fens and alluvial 
forests. 
2.18 There are 23 SINCs within 2km of the site. The locations and 
details of these features are identified in paragraph 4.7 of the 
Preliminary Ecological Appraisal.  
2.19  The Scoping Report identifies 17 Scheduled Ancient Monuments 
(SAMs), a Grade I listed building, 7 Grade II* listed buildings, 
three Grade II Registered Parks and Gardens and 2 Conservation 
Areas within 5km of the site. The locations of these features are 
identified on Figure 3 of the Scoping Report. In addition, 47 Grade 
II listed buildings are located within 5km of the site.  
2.20 The nearest Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) is Swansea Air 
Quality Management Area 2010, located in the Lower Swansea 
Valley, approximately 4.5km from the site. It has been declared 
primarily on the basis of traffic related nitrogen dioxide (NO2).   
Description of the proposed development  
2.21 The proposed development would operate as a SCGT peaking 
plant, fuelled by natural gas and capable of producing electricity 
up to 299MW. To achieve 299MW, between one and five gas 
turbine generators would be built, with up to five exhaust gas flue 
stacks.  
2.22 The gas turbine generators would comprise the following 
components:  
 Inlet air filter; 
 Air compressor; 
 Combustion chamber; 
 Power turbine(s); 
 Exhaust silencer. 
2.23 On entering the gas turbine(s), air would be compressed and 
natural gas injected into the air. The natural gas would then burn 
in the combustion chamber, before expanding across the blades of 
the gas turbine, driving the electrical generators to produce 
energy.

2.24 The waste gases and heat would then be released into the 
atmosphere via between one and five stacks. The stack(s) would 
contain equipment to reduce the emissions released into the 
atmosphere.  
2.25 In order to adequately disperse emissions and to meet legislative 
air quality targets, a study would be undertaken to determine the 
minimum height of the stack(s). 
2.26 The maximum area for the generating equipment site would be 
approximately 6ha. Depending on its final design, the generating 
equipment may be sited in a number of locations within this area 
(see Scoping Report, Figure 1: Project Site Plan). The detailed 
dimensions of the main plant items, which would be present in the 
generating equipment site, are stated in paragraph 3.3.15 of the 
Scoping Report. These figures indicate that the tallest element of 
the proposal (the stack(s)) would be a maximum of 60m in height. 
2.27 The new gas connection would connect the generating equipment 
to a suitable fuel source, and would comprise a new underground 
gas pipeline connection and two above ground installations. The 
gas connection would be situated within the Gas Connection 
Opportunity Area as identified on Figure 1: Project Site Plan; with 
the exact location not yet decided. Termination of the gas 
connection would be at a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) Trap 
Facility (PTF) on the generating equipment site; incorporating a 
PIG receiving facility, emergency control valve (possible) and 
isolation valves.  
2.28 The new electrical connection would comprise new electrical 
circuits (either in the form of an underground cable or overhead 
line) to allow power to be exported from the generating equipment 
to the National Grid. The electrical connection would be situated 
within the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area as identified on 
Figure 1: Project Site Plan; with the exact location not yet decided.  
2.29 The final choice of the gas and electrical connection routes would 
be decided following further consultation and more thorough 
assessments of constraints and environmental impacts.  
2.30 To accommodate the storage of plant and equipment during the 
construction phase, a temporary laydown area would be provided 
adjacent to the generating equipment site store. It is not proposed 
to allocate any land for this purpose beyond the construction 
phase. The exact location of the laydown area is not identified 
within the Scoping Report.

Alternatives  
2.31 The following technology options were also considered for the 
generator plant: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and 
Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant. SCGT was considered the 
most suitable technology choice for environmental, technical and 
financial reasons, as detailed in paragraph 3.6.4 of the Scoping 
Report. 
Proposed access  
2.32 The proposal site would be accessed from Junction 46 of the M4, 
via one of two routes currently being considered. Access Road 
Option 1 would be from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road, 
following the access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm. 
Access Road Option 2 would be from the west via the B4489, 
along the access road to the National Grid electrical substations 
and then via a new access road to be constructed as part of the 
proposal. Both access options are illustrated on Figure 1 of the 
Scoping Report: Project Site Plan.  
Construction  
2.33 Construction and commissioning of the project would take 
approximately 22 months.  
2.34 The main works would be the removal of hard standing, 
excavation and site levelling for new foundations, piling (if 
required) and the laying of the gas and electricity connections.   
2.35 Construction is expected to employ between 140 and 250 workers.  
2.36 A construction programme has not been included in the Scoping 
Report. The Scoping Report states that the ES will provide details 
of the construction programme, including construction activities, 
methods 
and 
working 
hours. 
An 
outline 
Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) would be drafted and 
appended to the ES, providing details of specific mitigation 
measures required to reduce the construction related impacts.  
Operation and maintenance 
2.37 Once operational, the proposed development would generate up to 
15 full time jobs, with staff working in shifts.  
2.38 The generating equipment would operate for up to 1,500 hours 
per year.  
2.39 The power generation plant would have an operational life of 25 
years, after which time it would be decommissioned or re-
powered.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
10 
Decommissioning 
2.40 Decommissioning of the project would involve the removal of all 
power generation items, and the restoration of the site to a similar 
condition as before the development took place. This process 
would take approximately 22 months.  
2.41 Some underground structures, such as the gas and electrical 
connections, may be left in situ for the purpose of avoiding any 
adverse environmental impacts arising from their removal. Where 
possible, items would be reused or recycled.  
2.42 The decommissioning phase is expected to employ between 140 
and 250 workers. 
The Secretary of State’s Comments  
Description of the application site and surrounding area  
2.43 In addition to detailed baseline information to be provided within 
topic specific chapters of the ES, the SoS would expect the ES to 
include a section that summarises the site and surroundings. This 
would identify the context of the proposed development, any 
relevant designations and sensitive receptors. This section should 
identify land that could be directly or indirectly affected by the 
proposed development and any auxiliary facilities, landscaping 
areas and potential off site mitigation or compensation schemes. 
2.44 The ES should include a clear description of the application site 
which is to be the subject of the DCO, including detailed land 
levels, existing vegetation species, hard surfaces and the location 
of existing buildings. The ES should confirm if the application site 
has been previously developed, and if so, whether it has been 
subject to any remediation works.                      
2.45 The Scoping Report did not detail whether any areas of the site 
are at risk from flooding. EA data indicates that an area to the 
south west of the application site is within EA Flood Zones 2/3. 
The SoS notes that the ES is to contain a Flood Consequences 
document. This document should include a description of which 
areas of the site are at risk from flooding and the exact locations 
of all water courses on site, including springs, streams and 
drainage ditches.                                                                                                
Description of the proposed development  
2.46 The applicant should ensure that the description of the proposed 
development that is being applied for is as accurate and firm as 
possible as this will form the basis of the environmental impact 
assessment. It is understood that at this stage in the evolution of 
the scheme the description of the proposals and even the location 
of the site may not be confirmed.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
11 
The applicant should be aware however, that the description of the 
development in the ES must be sufficiently certain to meet the 
requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA 
Regulations and there should therefore be more certainty by the 
time the ES is submitted with the DCO.  
2.47 If a draft DCO is to be submitted, the applicant should clearly 
define what elements of the proposed development are integral to 
the NSIP and which is ‘associated development’ under the Planning 
Act 2008 (PA 2008) or is an ancillary matter.   
2.48 Any proposed works and/or infrastructure required as associated 
development, or as an ancillary matter, (whether on or off-site) 
should be considered as part of an integrated approach to 
environmental assessment.  
2.49 The SoS recommends that the ES should include a clear 
description of all aspects of the proposed development, at the 
construction, operation and decommissioning stages, and include: 
 
Land use requirements; 
 
Site preparation; 
 
Construction processes and methods; 
 
Transport routes; 
 
Operational requirements including the main characteristics 
of the production process and the nature and quantity of 
materials used; 
 
Maintenance activities including any potential environmental 
impacts; 
 
Emissions - water, air and soil pollution, noise, vibration, 
light, heat, radiation. 
2.50 The environmental effects of all wastes to be processed and 
removed from the site should be addressed. The ES will need to 
identify and describe the control processes and mitigation 
procedures for storing and transporting waste off site. All waste 
types should be quantified and classified.  
2.51 The area identified on Figure 1 of the Scoping Report as ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’ appears to be referred to as ‘Generating 
Equipment Site’ in other parts of the Scoping Report, for example 
in paragraph 3.3.11. To ensure clarity, it is requested that this 
area is consistently referred to by the same description.  
 
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
12 
2.52 When considering Figure 3 of the Scoping Report: Indicative 
Environmentally Sensitive Receptors, the SoS notes that due to 
the chosen colours, it is difficult to distinguish the Scheduled 
Monuments from some other features (e.g. SINCs, water bodies 
and LNRs). The ES should ensure to provide clearly distinguishable 
colours/symbols on all maps and figures, in order to ensure that 
specific features can be easily identified. 
Alternatives  
2.53 Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations requires that the 
applicant provides ‘An outline of the main alternatives studied by 
the applicant and an indication of the main reasons for the 
applicant’s choice, taking into account the environmental effects’ 
(See Appendix 3). The SoS welcomes the consideration of 
alternative technology choices included in the Scoping Report 
(paragraph 3.6.4) and recommends these details are included in 
the ES. In addition, the ES should also provide details of other 
locations considered for the Power Generation Plant.  
Flexibility  
2.54 The applicant’s attention is drawn to Advice Note 9 ‘Using the 
‘Rochdale 
Envelope’ 
which 
is 
available 
on 
the 
Planning 
Inspectorate’s website and to the ‘Flexibility’ section in Appendix 3 
of this Opinion which provides additional details on the 
recommended approach.  
2.55 The SoS notes, from the comments in paragraph 3.3.14 of the 
Scoping Report, that the detailed design and location of the power 
station is still being developed. The applicant should make every 
attempt to narrow the range of options and explain clearly in the 
ES which elements of the scheme have yet to be finalised and 
provide the reasons. At the time of application, any proposed 
scheme parameters should not be so wide ranging as to represent 
effectively different schemes. The scheme parameters will need to 
be clearly defined in the draft DCO and therefore in the 
accompanying ES. It is a matter for the applicant, in preparing an 
ES, to consider whether it is possible to robustly assess a range of 
impacts resulting from a large number of undecided parameters. 
The description of the proposed development in the ES must not 
be so wide that it is insufficiently certain to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA 
Regulations. 
2.56 It should be noted that if the proposed development changes 
substantially during the EIA process, prior to application 
submission, the applicant may wish to consider the need to 
request a new scoping opinion. 
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
13 
Proposed access 
2.57 The ES should detail the proposed access routes for both 
construction and operational traffic. 
Construction  
2.58 The Secretary of State notes that no information has been 
provided in the Scoping Request regarding the size and exact 
location of the temporary laydown area. Whilst is it appreciated 
that this information may not be available at this stage in the 
evolution of the project, applicants are reminded that this 
information will be required in the ES. 
2.59 The SoS considers that information on construction including: 
phasing of programme; construction methods and activities 
associated with each phase; siting of construction compounds 
(including on and off site); lighting equipment/requirements; and 
number, movements and parking of construction vehicles (both 
HGVs and staff) should be clearly indicated in the ES.  
Operation and maintenance 
2.60 Information on the operation and maintenance of the proposed 
development should be included in the ES and should cover but 
not be limited to such matters as:  the number of full/part-time 
jobs; the operational hours and if appropriate, shift patterns; the 
number and types of vehicle movements generated during the 
operational stage. 
Decommissioning 
2.61 In terms of decommissioning, the SoS acknowledges that the 
further into the future any assessment is made, the less reliance 
may be placed on the outcome. However, the purpose of such a 
long term assessment is to enable the decommissioning of the 
works to be taken into account in the design and use of materials 
such that structures can be taken down with the minimum of 
disruption. The process and methods of decommissioning should 
be considered and options presented in the ES. The SoS 
encourages consideration of such matters in the ES. 
2.62 The Scoping Report (paragraph 3.3.17) indicates that the design 
life of the power generation plant is 25 years. The SoS 
recommends that the EIA covers the life span of the proposed 
development, 
including 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning.

3.0 EIA APPROACH AND TOPIC AREAS 
Introduction 
3.1 
This section contains the SoS’s specific comments on the approach 
to the ES and topic areas as set out in the Scoping Report. General 
advice on the presentation of an ES is provided at Appendix 3 of 
this Opinion and should be read in conjunction with this Section.  
3.2 
Applicants are advised that the scope of the DCO application 
should be clearly addressed and assessed consistently within the 
ES.  
Environmental Statement (ES) - approach 
3.3 
The information provided in the Scoping Report sets out the 
proposed approach to the preparation of the ES. Whilst early 
engagement on the scope of the ES is to be welcomed, the SoS 
notes that the level of information provided at this stage is not 
always sufficient to allow for detailed comments from either the 
SoS or the consultees.  
3.4 
The SoS would suggest that the applicant ensures that appropriate 
consultation is undertaken with the relevant consultees in order to 
agree wherever possible the timing and relevance of survey work 
as well as the methodologies to be used. The SoS notes and 
welcomes the intention to finalise the scope of investigations in 
conjunction with on-going stakeholder liaison and consultation 
with the relevant regulatory authorities and their advisors. 
3.5 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas 
should be identified under all the environmental topics and should 
be sufficiently robust in order to undertake the assessment. The 
extent of the study areas should be on the basis of recognised 
professional guidance, whenever such guidance is available. The 
study areas should also be agreed with the relevant consultees 
and, where this is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the 
ES and a reasoned justification given. The scope should also cover 
the breadth of the topic area and the temporal scope, and these 
aspects should be described and justified. 
Matters to be scoped out 
3.6 
The applicant has identified in the relevant sections of the Scoping 
Report the matters proposed to be ‘scoped out’. These include:  
 
Operational Air Quality Emissions of the Gas and Electrical 
Connections 
 
Operational Noise and Vibration Impacts of the Gas 
Connection 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
15 
 
Operational Noise Impacts of the Electricity Connection 
 
Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report (pending NRW 
agreement)  
 
Drainage / water quality impacts of the gas and electricity 
connections during the operational and decommissioning 
phases. 
 
Visual impacts upon the Gower AONB 
3.7 
Matters are not scoped out unless specifically addressed and 
justified by the applicant, and confirmed as being scoped out by 
the SoS.   
3.8 
It is stated within the Scoping Report that it is not intended to 
include the operational air quality emissions of the gas and 
electrical 
connections 
as 
these 
sections 
of 
the 
proposed 
development would not produce any significant emissions during 
the operational phase of the development; the SoS agrees that 
these impacts can be scoped out of the assessment.  
3.9 
Within the Scoping Report it is stated that it is not intended to 
include the operational noise or vibration impacts of the gas 
connection as this aspect of the proposed development would not 
produce any significant noise or vibration emissions during the 
operational phase; the SoS agrees that these impacts can be 
scoped out of the assessment.  
3.10 It is stated within the Scoping Report that it is not intended to 
include the operational noise impacts of the electrical connection 
as this aspect of the proposed development would not produce any 
significant noise emissions during the operational phase. The SoS 
recommends that further justification be provided by the applicant 
for scoping out these potential effects, the SoS draws the attention 
of the applicant to the comments made by NRW in this respect.  
3.11 Within the Scoping Report it is stated that the need for a Water 
Framework Directive Report has been scoped out of the 
assessment, pending agreement from NRW, as the development is 
not predicted to have any significant effects on any key water 
bodies.  The SoS agrees that providing NRW indicates that no 
Water Framework Directive Report will be required for this 
development the provision of this report can be scoped out of the 
assessment.  
3.12 It is stated within the applicants scoping report that any impact on 
drainage or water quality caused by the gas or electrical 
connections during the operational and decommissioning phases of 
the development will be scoped out of the assessment, as no 
significant drainage or water quality impacts are predicted to occur 
as a result of the presence of the connections during these phases 
of the proposed development.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
16 
The SoS recommends that the applicant provides further 
information regarding the potential for any below ground 
connections to form pathways for the transport of pollutants which 
may result from previous use of the land. NRW noted that at least 
part of the site was previously used as landfill.  
3.13 Within the Scoping Report it is stated that visual impacts of the 
proposed development on the Gower Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB) will be scoped out of the assessment as the site is 
visually separated from the AONB by topography. The SoS expects 
that the ES should contain confirmation that the stacks required as 
part of the development, which will be up to 60m in height, will 
not be visible from the AONB. On the basis of providing such 
confirmation, the SoS agrees that these impacts may be scoped 
out of the assessment.  
3.14 Whilst the SoS has not agreed to scope out certain topics or 
matters within the Opinion on the basis of the information 
available at the time, this does not prevent the applicant from 
subsequently agreeing with the relevant consultees to scope 
matters out of the ES, where further evidence has been provided 
to justify this approach. This approach should be explained fully in 
the ES.        
3.15 In order to demonstrate that topics have not simply been 
overlooked, where topics are scoped out prior to submission of the 
DCO application, the ES should still explain the reasoning and 
justify the approach taken. 
National Policy Statements (NPSs) 
3.16 Sector specific NPSs are produced by the relevant Government 
Departments and set out national policy for nationally significant 
infrastructure projects (NSIPs). They provide the framework within 
which the Examining Authority will make their recommendations to 
the Secretary of State and include the Government’s objectives for 
the development of NSIPs.  
3.17 The relevant NPSs [EN-1, EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5] for the proposed 
development set out both the generic and technology-specific 
impacts that should be considered in the EIA for the proposed 
development. When undertaking the EIA, the applicant must have 
regard to both the generic and technology-specific impacts and 
identify how these impacts have been assessed in the ES.  
3.18 The Secretary of State must have regard to any matter that the 
Secretary of State thinks is important and relevant to the 
Secretary of State’s decision. This could include the draft NPS if 
the relevant NPS has not been formally designated. 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
17 
Environmental Statement - Structure  
3.19 Section 4.2 of the Scoping Report sets out the proposed structure 
of the ES on which the applicant seeks the opinion of the SoS.  
3.20 The SoS notes that from the ES structure table (Scoping Report 
Table 4.1) that the EIA would cover a number of assessments 
under the broad headings of:  
 
Air Quality 
 
Noise and Vibration 
 
Ecology  
 
Water Quality and Resources 
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture  
 
Landscape and Visual 
 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology; and 
 
Socio-Economics  
3.21 The SoS recommends that the ES should include a description of 
how waste generated by the proposed development will be dealt 
with.  The SoS also recommends that the potential impacts of 
electric and magnetic fields are addressed within the ES. The SoS 
draws the applicant’s attention to the comments of Public Health 
England on this subject.  
Topic Areas  
 Air Quality (see Scoping Report Section 5.3)  
3.22 The nearest Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) is Swansea 
AQMA; it lies approximately 4.5 km from the Project Site and has 
been declared primarily on the basis of traffic related nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2). The SoS considers that adverse change to air 
quality should be assessed in relation to compliance with European 
air quality limit values and any impact upon AQMAs. 
3.23 The SoS considers that the site lies within a sensitive area that 
includes nationally and European-designated wildlife sites. Within 
10 km of the site there are twenty SSSI’s, 1 SPA , 2 SAC’s, 1 
National Nature Reserve and 23 SINC’s, the potential impacts on 
which should be carefully assessed. There is the need to consider 
potential related effects due to an increase in airborne pollution 
including 
fugitive 
dust 
especially 
during 
site 
preparation, 
demolition and construction.  
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
18 
3.24 The ES should also include an assessment of potential air quality 
impacts on the Lower Lliw Reservoir as a result of both deposition 
and affected rainfall. The SoS notes the comments of Dwr Cymru 
(Welsh Water) in this respect. 
3.25 The air quality assessment should use the APIS critical load 
function tool in order to calculate acid deposition process 
contributions/exceedances. The SoS draws attention to the 
comments of NRW in this respect. 
3.26 The assessment should take account of the air emissions from the 
proposed development and emissions related to vehicular 
movements associated with the proposal. The SoS recommends 
that the implications of stack height and dispersion of the 
discharge be clearly explained within the ES. 
3.27 The SoS recommends that the applicant agrees all modelling 
receptor locations with the City and County of Swansea and also 
that the applicant consults the City and County of Swansea 
regarding the proposed data inputs for the air quality model.   
3.28 The SoS recommends that the applicant agrees which pollutants 
are to be modelled and the meteorological data to be used with 
the City and County of Swansea.  
3.29 The SoS recommends that dispersion modelling considers a range 
of possibilities and seeks to ensure that the ‘worst case’ scenario is 
assessed, for example the ‘worst case’ may occur as a short term 
impact. There are a number of residential receptors within 1 km of 
the project site and suitable receptor locations for modelling 
purposes should be agreed with the relevant local authority and 
NRW. This may need to extend to densely populated areas just 
outside of the proposed study area. The SoS notes the comments 
of NRW in relation to the village of Llangyfelach in this respect.   
The SoS recommends that the applicant consider extending the 
proposed air quality study area to incorporate this village.    
3.30 The SoS recommends that air quality and dust levels are 
considered not only on site but also off site, including along access 
roads, local footpaths and other public rights of way. Consideration 
should also be given to appropriate mitigation measures and to 
monitoring dust complaints. 
3.31 The SoS recommends that the applicant works toward submitting 
their Environmental Permit application at least six months prior to 
the submission of their DCO application.  
Noise and Vibration (see Scoping Report Section 5.4) 
3.32 The SoS welcomes that the noise and vibration assessment 
methodology will accord with NPS EN-1 and will be agreed with the 
appropriate EHO at the City and County of Swansea.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
19 
The SoS notes the intention for noise monitoring locations for the 
baseline assessment to be agreed with the local EHO but draws 
attention to the comment from NRW that the discussion on noise 
monitoring also needs to be communicated to NRW with particular 
reference to an A1 EPR permit which will include noise conditions.  
3.33 The SoS draws attention to the comments of NRW regarding the 
requirements of the Environmental Noise Directive, and the 
Environmental Noise (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, 
which have introduced a ‘Noise Action Plan for Wales.’ This covers 
industrial noise sources, impacts on designated Quiet Areas and 
the impact of creeping background, and should be taken into 
consideration by the applicant.   
3.34 The SoS recommends that information be provided on the types of 
vehicles and plant to be used during the construction phase. Noise 
impacts on people should specifically be addressed and in 
particular any potential noise disturbance at night and other 
unsocial hours such as weekends and public holidays. 
3.35 The SoS welcomes that the CEMP will set out best practice 
methods of limiting noise and vibration on site during construction 
and decommissioning.  
3.36 The SoS recommends that the noise and vibration assessment 
takes account of traffic movements along access routes during the 
construction phase.   
3.37 The noise assessment should accurately identify the proximity of 
the 
identified 
noise 
sensitive 
receptors 
to 
the 
proposed 
development. With regards to the operational noise assessment, 
this should cover all modes of operation of the proposed 
development. The applicant’s attention is drawn to NRW’s 
comments in these respects. 
Ecology (see Scoping Report Section 5.5) 
3.38 The SoS recommends that surveys are thorough, up to date and 
take account of other development proposed in the vicinity.  The 
SoS notes the comments from NRW in support of the proposed 
further species surveys as proposed in the Phase 1 Habitat 
Survey; these surveys should follow best practice, current 
guidelines and be carried out by suitably qualified ecologists at 
appropriate times of the year. These should include surveys for 
otter in accordance with the recommendations of NRW. The SoS 
notes that the proposed development is within 10km of three 
European sites: Burry Inlet Ramsar Site and SPA, Carmarthen Bay 
and Estuaries SAC and Crymlyn Bog Ramsar Site and SAC. 
3.39 The SoS directs the applicant to the comments of the City and 
County of Wales regarding the Afon Llan and its links to the 
Loughor Estuary / Burry Inlet.

The SoS recommends that the assessment considers any potential 
impacts on the nature conservation sites in this area. The SoS 
welcomes that the assessment will be carried out in accordance 
with NPS EN-1 and that the results of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
have informed which Phase 2 protected species surveys will be 
carried out.   
3.40 The SoS notes the comments from NRW welcoming the re-
surveying of the locally significant habitats in Spring/Summer, and 
expects there to be discussions with the Planning Ecologist for the 
local planning authority with regards to sensitive siting of the 
development to mitigate impacts to nature conservation interests. 
The SoS recommends that the proposals should fully address the 
need to protect and enhance biodiversity. The assessment should 
cover habitats species and processes.  
3.41 The assessment should take into account air quality (including 
dust) and noise and vibration impacts, and cross reference should 
be made to these specialist reports. 
3.42 The SoS welcomes that the CEMP will set out best practice 
methods of limiting effects on ecology and biodiversity during 
construction and decommissioning and that further specific 
mitigation measures will include the consideration of the provision 
of new habitat to suitably replace any habitat areas that would be 
permanently lost through the development of the project.    
3.43 The SoS notes the comments of NRW regarding the presence of 
peat on site, and expects the ES to contain further clarification 
about the location of the peat and the impact of the proposed 
development upon it.  
3.44 The SoS notes the comments of NRW regarding the potential 
impact to local watercourses and recommends the maintenance of 
open watercourses with wide buffer strips in the design of the 
development.         
Water Quality and Resources (see Scoping Report Section 5.6) 
3.45 The SoS welcomes that the applicant intends to consult both NRW 
and the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) on the Flood 
Consequences Assessment. The SoS notes the comments of NRW 
that the assessment should include consideration of surface water 
drainage impacts and options for improving site surface water 
drainage to prevent localised flooding during extreme rainfall 
events. 
3.46 The SoS recommends that the applicant considers temporary 
attenuation ponds to allow adequate settlement of site generated 
run-off during the construction and decommissioning phases of the 
development.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
21 
The SoS draws the attention of the applicant to NRW’s comments 
that silt fencing, scour protection and Sedimats alone have been 
proven ineffective in this catchment due to its flashy nature.  
3.47 The SoS recommends that the applicant ensures that it can be 
demonstrated that the surface water disposal scheme would cause 
no harm to local watercourses upon discharge.   
3.48 The SoS welcomes that the CEMP will set out best practice 
methods of limiting impacts and on water quality and resources 
during construction and decommissioning. 
3.49 The SoS notes the concerns of NRW regarding how sewage and 
waste waters would be managed at the site, the SoS recommends 
that details of proposed discharges are provided within the ES.   
3.50 The SoS welcomes that during construction, operation and 
decommissioning silt raps and oil interceptors would be placed in 
drains on the site. 
3.51 The SoS notes the applicant’s intention to use SuDS if required 
and to minimise the amount of biocides used. 
3.52 The SoS welcomes that oil and chemical storage tanks and drum 
storage areas are to be surrounded by an impermeable bund sized 
to contain 110% of capacity. 
3.53 The SoS notes that NRW would set limits on the quantity of water 
that is discharged from the Power Generation Plant under an 
Environmental Permit.     
3.54 The SoS notes the concerns of NRW regarding cooling water, it 
should be stated within the ES whether any cooling water would 
be required and if so where it would be derived from and 
discharged to. 
3.55 The SoS notes the concerns of Dwr Cymru (Welsh Water) 
regarding the potential impact of the development on water 
quality within the Lower Lliw Reservoir.  It is recommended that 
the applicant assesses potential impacts on this reservoir including 
potential impacts from deposition and affected rainfall. 
3.56 The SoS recommends that the applicant consults Dwr Cymru 
regarding the 48” strategic water main that crosses the application 
site.   
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (see Scoping 
Report Section 5.7) 
3.57 The SoS welcomes that the assessment will follow the DEFRA / EA 
publication Contaminated Land Report 11, 2004 ‘Model Procedures 
for the Management of Land Contamination’. 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
22 
3.58 The SoS welcomes that the CEMP will include best practice 
methods of limiting impacts on the land during both construction 
and decommissioning. 
3.59 The SoS welcomes that any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable 
for reuse will be stockpiled on impermeable liners. 
3.60 The SoS welcomes that the foundations of the development will be 
designed so as not to present a preferential pathway for 
contaminant migration if present at the project site.  The SoS 
notes that this consideration should be extended to other works 
forming part of the development, including underground gas and 
electricity connections.     
3.61 The SoS draws the attention of the applicant to the comments of 
the Coal Authority indicating that the site is in a Development High 
Risk Area, as the site has been subject to past coal mining activity 
and is located within an area of surface coal resource.  
3.62 The SoS recommends that the applicant takes into consideration 
the location and stability of abandoned mine entries, the extent 
and stability of shallow mine workings, outcropping coal seams, 
unrecorded 
mine 
workings, 
hydrogeology, 
minewater 
and 
minegas.  
3.63 The SoS recommends that the applicant consider, if surface coal 
resources are present, whether prior extraction of the mineral 
resource is practical and viable. The applicant should also consider 
whether Coal Authority permission is required to intersect, enter, 
or disturb any coal or coal workings during site investigation or 
development work.        
Landscape and Visual (see Scoping Report Section 5.8) 
3.64 The SoS welcomes that the assessment will be carried out in 
accordance with NPS EN-1, using the methodology set out in the 
Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (3rd 
Edition, 2013). 
3.65 The SoS notes that there are a number of residential receptors 
within 1 km of the project site including those in the nearby 
settlements of Morriston, Pant-Iasau and Llwyncelyn, Felindre, 
there are also 19 isolated dwellings or farmsteads. National Grid’s 
two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station lie in the western extent of the project site. Team Force 
Swansea Paintball Centre and a skip hire business as well as the 
M4 motorway lie approximately 1.5 km to the south. 
3.66 The SoS welcomes the use of photomontages for key sensitive 
viewpoints. The SoS notes NRW’s offer to provide advice on 
selected viewpoints and recommends consultation with both NRW 
and the City and County of Swansea on selected viewpoints.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
23 
Consideration should also be given to potential views from Brecon 
Beacons National Park and the National Park Authority should be 
consulted about viewpoints, given that the proposed development 
includes stacks up to 60m in height.  
3.67 The SoS recommends that the applicant provides a description of 
existing landscape interests within and in the vicinity of the 
proposed development site.  
3.68 The SoS recommends that lighting impacts be considered in the 
ES.  
3.69 The SoS recommends that the applicant consider the inclusion of 
the following developments identified by the City and County of 
Swansea within the cumulative assessment: 
  Planning Application 2012/1221 Mynydd y Gwair Wind Farm 
- Installation of 16 wind turbines (maximum height to blade 
tip of 127 metres with a hub height of 80 metres), with a 
maximum generating capacity of 48MW, associated tracks 
and ancillary infrastructure (including permanent and 
temporary 
anemometer 
masts, 
electrical 
substation 
compound, hardstandings, transformers and underground 
cabling) and construction of new access track from A48 
(Bolgoed Road at Pontarddulais) (approximately 14.54km in 
length) incorporating improvements to 3.9km of existing 
road across Mynydd Pysgodlyn – Planning Permission March, 
2013   
  Planning Application 2006/0773 Felindre Business Park - 
Outline Planning Permission has been granted for a strategic 
business park for B1 and B2 uses to accommodate 
emerging industries, high tech manufacturing, high level 
services, ancillary uses, associated car parking, landscaping 
and access roads; and 
  Planning Application 2014/1022 Solar park consisting of 
47,000 solar panels with the installed capacity of 12.69 MW 
on land at Brynwhilach Farm.     
3.70 The SoS also recommends that the proposed sustainable urban 
village at Felindre is considered within the assessment.     
3.71 The SoS notes the comments of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 
with regard to the proposed development. It is recommended that 
the applicant takes into account any concerns raised by the 
relevant aerodrome license holders / operators. 
3.72 It is recommended that the applicant gives consideration to 
whether there would be any need for aviation warning lighting. 
The applicant should also seek the opinion of the local emergency 
services air support units. 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
24 
3.73 The SoS draws the attention of the applicant to the comments of 
National Grid Electricity Transmission Plc in regard to the four high 
voltage electricity overhead transmission line which lie within the 
proposed order limits. The applicant should note National Grids 
right of access to maintain, repair and inspect their asset, the 
need to maintain the statutory electrical safety clearances at all 
times and the requirement that no permanent structures are built 
directly beneath overhead lines.   
3.74 The SoS recommends that site staff should have an awareness of 
the Health and Safety Executive’s guidance in relation to working 
safely near existing overhead lines Guidance Note GS 6 ‘Avoidance 
of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines’.  Plant, machinery, 
equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any high voltage conductors when those conductors are 
in their worst conditions of maximum ‘sag’ and ‘swing’. 
3.75 The SoS recommends that where any landscaping is proposed, 
only slow and low growing species of trees and scrubs should be 
planted beneath and adjacent to the existing transmission line.  
The applicant should note that drilling and excavation work should 
not be undertaken if it has the potential to disturb or adversely 
affect the foundations of an existing tower.  
3.76 The SoS notes the comments of National Grid Gas Plc in regard to 
the three existing gas pipelines and associated equipment which 
lie in close proximity to the proposed order limits. The applicant 
should remain aware that National Grid has a Deed of Grant of 
Easement for each pipeline, preventing the erection of permanent 
or temporary buildings or structures, changes to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc. 
3.77 The SoS recommends that where construction traffic can not use 
existing roads it is agreed with National Grid at which locations 
construction traffic would cross any pipelines.  The applicant 
should also note that written permission is required from National 
Grid before any works can commence in the National Grid 
easement strip.  
3.78 The SoS recommends that the applicant takes note of National 
Grids requirements regarding the laying of cables across any 
pipeline as appropriate.   
3.79 The SoS recommends that the applicant has an awareness of the 
Health and Safety Executive’s guidance document HS(G) 47 
‘Avoiding Danger from Underground Services’ and National Grid’s 
specification for Safe Working in the vicinity of National Grid High 
Pressure gas pipelines and associated installations – requirements 
for third parties T/SP/SSW22. 
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
25 
3.80 The SoS notes that any excavations within 3m of a National Grid 
High Pressure Pipeline or within 10m of an above ground 
installation the exact depth and position of the pipeline will need to 
be confirmed on site under the supervision of a National Grid 
representative. 
3.81 The SoS notes the comments made by the Health and Safety 
Executive in relation to electrical safety, it is recommended that it 
is ensured that the proposed design and future operations are 
compliant with the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 and the 
Electricity, Safety, Continuity and Quality Regulations 2002 as 
amended.  
3.82 The SoS notes the comments of Network Rail in regard to the 
installation of any cables under or over the railway, any methods 
of electricity transmissions across Network Rail’s land or any 
access rights temporary or otherwise. Where applicable the 
applicant will be required to gain property agreements with 
Network Rail’s Easements and Wayleaves Team.       
Traffic, Transport and Access (see Scoping Report Section 5.9) 
3.83 The SoS welcomes that the assessment will be undertaken in 
accordance with the ‘Welsh Transport Planning and Appraisal 
Guidance 
(Wel 
TAG) 
and 
the 
Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Assessment’s (IEA) ‘Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment 
of Road Traffic’ (1993).     
3.84 The SoS welcomes that the CEMP will set out best practice 
methods 
of 
limiting 
impacts 
during 
construction 
and 
decommissioning. 
3.85 The SoS welcomes that opportunities for reducing traffic 
movements will be explored such as car share schemes or shift 
working. 
3.86 The SoS welcomes that proposed measures to improve access by 
public transport, walking and cycling will be provided for the 
operational phase.    
3.87 The SoS recommends that the applicant consults Network Rail’s 
Asset Protection Engineers if the development could result in 
abnormal loads using routes that include Network Rail assets such 
as level crossings / bridges etc.     
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (see Scoping Report Section 
5.10) 
3.88 The SoS notes that there are 17 Scheduled Monuments within 5 
km of the project site there are also two conservation areas one 
Grade I and seven Grade II listed buildings and three Grade II 
Historic Parks and Gardens. 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
26 
3.89 The SoS welcomes that the assessment will be carried out in 
accordance with NPS EN-1.    
3.90 The SoS notes that the applicant may provide screen planting 
should the project give rise to any adverse impact on above 
ground heritage assets.  
3.91 The SoS recommends the inclusion of aerial photographs within 
search information and draws the applicant’s attention to the 
comments of Cadw in this regard. 
3.92 The SoS directs the applicant to Cadw’s comment regarding the 
referenced Standard and Guidance for Archaeological Assessment 
(2011) being superseded by the Standard and Guidance for 
historic environment desk-based assessment (2012). 
3.93 The SoS notes the comments of Cadw in regard to the assessment 
on the setting of designated assets, it is recommended that 
photographs from each asset towards the development be 
produced and where an adverse impact is thought likely to occur a 
photomontage should be produced.  
3.94 The SoS directs the applicant to Cadw’s comment regarding the 
reference to Registered Battlefields; as not applicable in Wales this 
reference should be removed, but the ES should include 
consideration 
of 
potential 
impacts 
to 
Registered 
Historic 
Landscapes.    
3.95 The SoS recommends that tranquillity be added to the list of 
factors considered relevant when assessing impacts on setting.    
Socio Economics (see Scoping Report Section 5.11) 
3.96 The SoS notes that the applicant intends to employ between 150 
and 250 personnel and that subject to procurement rules it is 
anticipated that as many as possible of these staff will be recruited 
locally. 
3.97 The SoS notes that the operation of the generating equipment will 
require up to 15 full time staff over the lifetime of the project 
working in shifts and that in addition there will be indirect jobs for 
contracted 
engineering 
staff 
during 
regular 
maintenance 
shutdowns and maintenance of the Gas and Electrical connections. 
3.98 The SoS welcomes that the assessment will be carried out in 
accordance with NPS EN-1 and will consider all relevant socio-
economic impacts such as tourism, influxes of workers and 
cumulative impacts.  
3.99 The SoS welcomes that during construction, operation and 
decommissioning an effort will be made to use local goods and 
services, wherever possible.

4.0 OTHER INFORMATION 
4.1 
This section does not form part of the SoS’s Opinion as to the 
information to be provided in the environmental statement. 
However, it does respond to other issues that the SoS has 
identified which may help to inform the preparation of the 
application for the DCO.  
Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) 
4.2 
The applicant’s attention is drawn to The Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 
(as amended) (The APFP Regulations) and the need to include 
information identifying European sites to which the Habitats 
Regulations applies or any Ramsar site or potential SPA which may 
be affected by a proposal. The SoS notes that Burry Inlet Ramsar 
Site and SPA, Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and Crymlyn 
Bog Ramsar Site and SAC are all located with 10km of the 
proposed development site. The submitted information should be 
sufficient for the Competent Authority (CA) to make an 
appropriate assessment (AA) of the implications for the site if 
required by Regulation 61(1) of the Habitats Regulations. The 
applicant should note that the CA is the SoS. 
4.3 
The report to be submitted under Regulation 5(2)(g) of the APFP 
Regulations with the application must deal with two issues: the 
first is to enable a formal assessment by the CA of whether there 
is a likely significant effect; and the second, should it be required, 
is to enable the carrying out of an AA by the CA.  
4.4 
When considering aspects of the environment likely to be affected 
by the proposed development; including flora, fauna, soil, water, 
air and the inter-relationship between these, consideration should 
be given to the designated sites in the vicinity of the proposed 
development. 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
4.5 
The Secretary of State notes that two SSSIs are located within 
5km of the proposed development; Nant y Crimp SSSI and 
Penplas grasslands SSSI. Where there may be potential impacts 
on the SSSIs, the SoS has duties under sections 28(G) and 28(I) 
of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) (the W&C 
Act). These are set out below for information. 
4.6 
Under s28(G), the SoS has a general duty ‘… to take reasonable 
steps, consistent with the proper exercise of the authority’s 
functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the 
flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features by reason of 
which the site is of special scientific interest’.   
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
29 
4.7 
Under 
s28(I), 
the 
SoS 
must 
notify 
the 
relevant 
nature 
conservation body (NCB), NRW in this case, before authorising the 
carrying out of operations likely to damage the special interest 
features of a SSSI. Under these circumstances 28 days must 
elapse before deciding whether to grant consent, and the SoS 
must take account of any advice received from the NCB, including 
advice on attaching conditions to the consent. The NCB will be 
notified during the examination period.  
4.8 
If applicants consider it likely that notification may be necessary 
under s28(I), they are advised to resolve any issues with the NCB 
before the DCO application is submitted to the SoS. If, following 
assessment by applicants, it is considered that operations affecting 
the SSSI will not lead to damage of the special interest features, 
applicants should make this clear in the ES. The application 
documents submitted in accordance with Regulation 5(2)(l) could 
also provide this information. Applicants should seek to agree with 
the NCB the DCO requirements which will provide protection for 
the SSSI before the DCO application is submitted. 
European Protected Species (EPS)  
4.9 
Applicants should be aware that the decision maker under the 
Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) has, as the CA, a duty to engage 
with the Habitats Directive. Where a potential risk to an EPS is 
identified, and before making a decision to grant development 
consent, the CA must, amongst other things, address the 
derogation tests2 in Regulation 53 of the Habitats Regulations. 
Therefore the applicant may wish to provide information which will 
assist the decision maker to meet this duty.  
4.10 If an applicant has concluded that an EPS licence is required the 
ExA will need to understand whether there is any impediment to 
the licence being granted. The decision to apply for a licence or 
not will rest with the applicant as the person responsible for 
commissioning the proposed activity by taking into account the 
advice of their consultant ecologist. 
4.11 Applicants are encouraged to consult with NRW and, where 
required, to agree appropriate requirements to secure necessary 
mitigation. It would assist the examination if applicants could 
provide, with the application documents, confirmation from NRW 
whether any issues have been identified which would prevent the 
EPS licence being granted. 
4.12 Generally, NRW are unable to grant an EPS licence in respect of 
any development until all the necessary consents required have 
been secured in order to proceed.

East Cheshire County Council 2009 and Morge v Hampshire County Council 2010.  
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project

For NSIPs, NRW will assess a draft licence application in order to 
ensure that all the relevant issues have been addressed. Within 30 
working days of receipt, NRW will either issue ‘a letter of no 
impediment’ stating that it is satisfied, insofar as it can make a 
judgement, that the proposals presented comply with the 
regulations or will issue a letter outlining why NRW consider the 
proposals do not meet licensing requirements and what further 
information is required before a ‘letter of no impediment’ can be 
issued.  The applicant is responsible for ensure draft licence 
applications are satisfactory for the purposes of informing formal 
pre-application assessment by NRW.   
4.13 Ecological conditions on the site may change over time. It will be 
the applicant’s responsibility to ensure information is satisfactory 
for the purposes of informing the assessment of no detriment to 
the maintenance of favourable conservation status (FCS) of the 
population of EPS affected by the proposals3. Applicants are 
advised that current conservation status of populations may or 
may not be favourable. Demonstration of no detriment to 
favourable 
populations may require 
further survey and/or 
submission 
of 
revised 
short 
or 
long 
term 
mitigation 
or 
compensation proposals. In Wales, the focus is on evidencing the 
demonstration of no detriment to the maintenance of favourable 
conservation status (FCS) of the population or colony of EPS 
potentially affected by the proposals. This approach will help to 
ensure no delay in issuing the licence should the DCO application 
be successful.  
4.14 In Wales, assistance may be obtained from NRW’s Regional 
Species Teams. These Teams provide advice on a range of issues 
concerning EPS including advice on compensation site design, 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
incidental 
capture/killing, 
evidencing 
compliance and post project surveillance. The service is free of 
charge and entirely voluntary. Regional Species Teams can be 
contacted via NRW’s Enquiry Service. Further information is 
available from the following link:

grid/protected-species-licensing/european-protected-species-
licensing/?lang=en 
Health Impact Assessment  
4.15 The SoS considers that it is a matter for the applicant to decide 
whether or not to submit a stand-alone Health Impact Assessment 
(HIA).  
                                       
3 Key case law in respect of the application of the FCS test at a site level: Hafod

Borough Council) 2012, and Court of Appeal 2012. 
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
31 
However, the applicant should have regard to the responses 
received from the relevant consultees regarding health, and in 
particular to the comments from Public Health England in relation 
to emissions to air and the Health and Safety Executive in relation 
to electrical safety issues (see Appendix 2).  
4.16 The methodology for the HIA, if prepared, should be agreed with 
the relevant statutory consultees and take into account mitigation 
measures for acute risks. 
Other regulatory regimes 
4.17 The SoS recommends that the applicant should state clearly what 
regulatory areas are addressed in the ES and that the applicant 
should ensure that all relevant authorisations, licences, permits 
and consents that are necessary to enable operations to proceed 
are described in the ES. Also it should be clear that any likely 
significant effects of the proposed development which may be 
regulated by other statutory regimes have been properly taken 
into account in the ES. 
4.18 It will not necessarily follow that the granting of consent under one 
regime will ensure consent under another regime. For those 
consents not capable of being included in an application for 
consent under the PA 2008, the SoS will require a level of 
assurance or comfort from the relevant regulatory authorities that 
the proposal is acceptable and likely to be approved, before they 
make a recommendation or decision on an application. The 
applicant is encouraged to make early contact with other 
regulators. Information from the applicant about progress in 
obtaining other permits, licences or consents, including any 
confirmation that there is no obvious reason why these will not 
subsequently be granted, will be helpful in supporting an 
application for development consent to the SoS. 
Transboundary Impacts  
4.19 The SoS has noted that the applicant has not indicated whether 
the proposed development is likely to have significant impacts on 
another European Economic Area (EEA) State.  
4.20 Regulation 24 of the EIA Regulations, which inter alia require the 
SoS to publicise a DCO application if the SoS is of the view that 
the proposal is likely to have significant effects on the environment 
of another EEA state and where relevant to consult with the EEA 
state affected. The SoS considers that where Regulation 24 
applies, this is likely to have implications for the examination of a 
DCO application.  
 
Scoping Opinion for Abergelli Power Project 
  
 
32 
4.21 The SoS recommends that the ES should identify whether the 
proposed 
development 
has 
the 
potential 
for 
significant 
transboundary impacts and if so, what these are and which EEA 
States would be affected.

Abergelli Power Project Scoping Comment - EN010069

Dear Sirs, 
  
Proposed Abergelli Power Project – Scoping Comment 
  
Thank you for The Planning Inspectorate’s recent correspondence relating to the subject 
development.  The Inspectorate sought related Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) scoping comment; I 
trust the following is useful. 
 
I note from the Scoping Report (SR) that the tallest associated structures are expected to be 
between 1 and 5 chimney stacks that would each have a height of up to 60metres (m).  On that 
basis I belief the following (potential) issues are worthy of consideration: 
 
Aerodromes.  In respect of any potential aerodrome related issue, I should highlight the need to 
check any safeguarding maps lodged with relevant planning authorities to identify any aerodrome 
specific safeguarding issues.  To that effect, I note the relatively close proximity of Swansea 
Airport to the development site.  Noting that aerodrome safeguarding responsibility rests in all 
cases with the relevant aerodrome operator / licensee, not the CAA, it is important that the related 
viewpoints of any relevant aerodrome license holders / operators is established and any concerns 
expressed appropriately mitigated. 
 
Aviation Warning Lighting:   
 
In the UK, the need for aviation obstruction lighting on 'tall' structures depends in the first instance 
upon any particular structure's location in relationship to an aerodrome. If the structure constitutes 
an 'aerodrome obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that with review the lighting requirement. 
For civil aerodromes, they will, in general terms, follow the requirements of CAP 168 - Licensing of 
Aerodromes. This document can be downloaded from the Civil Aviation CAA website at 
www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP168.PDF - Chapter 4 (12.8) refers to obstacle lighting.  
 
Away from aerodromes Article 219 of the UK Air Navigation Order applies. This Article requires 
that for en-route obstructions (ie away from aerodromes) lighting only becomes legally mandated 
for structures of a height of 150m or more. However, structures of lesser high might need aviation 
obstruction lighting if, by virtue of their location and nature, they are considered a significant 
navigational hazard.  
 
Cranes, whether in situ temporarily or long term are captured by the points heighted above.  Note 
that if a crane is located on top of another structure, it is the overall height (structure + crane) than 
is relevant. 
 
In this case, given the assumed maximum height of 60m, Article 219 would not apply.  In the 
event that there is no aerodrome issue I can advise that the CAA would not in isolation make any 
case for lighting. 
 
Gas Venting and/or Flaring.  It is assumed that the new facility is not intended to vent or flare gas 
either routinely or as an emergency procedure such as to cause a danger to overlying aircraft.  If 
2
that is not the case parties are invited to use myself as an appropriate point of contact for any 
further related discussion. 
 
Aviation Promulgation.  There is a civil aviation requirement in the UK for all structures over 300 
feet high to be charted on aviation maps.  It follows that, at 60m (197ft) high, there is no en-route 
(ie non-aerodrome specific) civil aviation charting requirement.  However, if crane usage in the 
construction phase involves heights of 300ft or more, the temporary structure will need to be 
appropriately notified.  For temporary structures this notification can be achieved through the 
publication of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).  If needed by virtue of temporary use of cranes such 
that the 300ft threshold is breached a NOTAM can be arranged through the developer providing 
related details to the CAA’s Airspace Utilisation Section (ausops@caa.co.uk / 0207 453 6599).   
 
Military Aviation.  For completeness, the Ministry of Defence position in regards to the proposed 
development and military aviation activity should be established. 
 
I should also add that that due to the unique nature of associated operations in respect of 
operating altitudes and potentially unusual landing sites, it would also be sensible to establish the 
related viewpoint of local emergency services air support units.      
   
I believe that any associated Environmental Statement / Development Consent Order (or 
equivalent / similar) would be expected to acknowledge and where applicable address the issues 
highlighted above and accordingly the scoping opinion should make related comment. 
  
Whilst none of the above negates any aforementioned need to consult in line with Government 
requirements associated with the safeguarding of aerodromes and other technical sites 
(Government Circular 1/2003 refers), I hope this information matches your requirements.  Please 
do not hesitate to get in touch if you require any further comment or needs clarification of any 
point.

Dear Ms Colfer
PLANNING ACT 2008 (AS AMENDED) AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING 
(ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT) REGULATIONS 2009 (AS AMENDED) –
REGULATION 8
APPLICATION BY ABERGELLI POWER LIMTED FOR AN ORDER GRANTING 
DEVELOPMENT CONSENT FOR THE ABERGELLI POWER PROJECT
SCOPING CONSULTATION WITH NON PRESCRIBED CONSULATION BODIES
Thank you for your letter of 26 June 2014 inviting Cadw’s comments on the above.
This consultation is in regard to the scoping of the Cultural Heritage and Archaeology section 
of an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed Power Station.
The designated historic assets listed in the document as being inside 5km of the application 
area concurs with the information on Cadw’s database. 
In section 10.5.7 searches should include aerial photographs as held by Central Register of 
Air Photography for Wales and also LiDAR information held by National Resources Wales.
Section 5.10.8 Standard and Guidance for archaeological assessment (Institute for 
Archaeologists 2011) has been superseded by Standard and Guidance for historic 
environment desk-based assessment (Institute for Archaeologists 2012) and the work should 
be undertaken in accordance with that document.
Section 5.10.11 In order to assist the assessment on the setting of designated assets, 
photographs from each asset towards the development site should be produced. Where it is 
clear that an adverse impact will occur than a photomontage should be produced.
Section 5.10.12 Registered Battlefields should be removed from this list as no such register 
exists in Wales, although Registered Historic Landscapes should be added.
Section 5.10.14 Tranquillity should be added to this list.
Finally, as the work required to determine the magnitude of impact will need to be assessed 
using professional judgement by a competent expert, it is strongly recommended that this 
work should be undertaken by a Member of the Institute for Archaeologists (IfA) and ideally 
an IfA registered organisation.
         
Yours sincerely

RE: Reference: PE126442.  Plant Not Affected Notice from ES Pipelines
Dear Jenny, 
 
Thanks for your call and this often raises some confusion.  ESP Gas Group has been renamed ESP 
Utilities Group Limited and this standard response template is embedded in our database and is 
subject to revision at some stage soon on the next update tranche.  The company status has not 
changed in as much that ESP Utilities Group Ltd consists of the 5 licensed companies (referred to as 
‘subsidiary brands’ on our website) consisting E S Pipelines Ltd, ESP Electricity Ltd, ESP Pipelines Ltd, 
ESP Connections Ltd and ESP Networks Ltd.  They are all operated from our offices in Leatherhead and 
to avoid confusion and multiple and voluminous copies prefer to respond in ‘bulk’.  All our asset data is 
held at one location and the response is based upon a companywide search incorporating all gas and 
electricity assets that we own and manage and that fall under our statutory undertakers obligations.

the area shown on the ‘DCO Site & Development Land Parcels’ plan.  
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid’s Overhead Line/s is protected by a Deed of Easement/Wayleave Agreement 
which provides full right of access to retain, maintain, repair and inspect our asset 
 
 
Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed 
buildings must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends 
that no permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are 
set out in EN 43 – 8 Technical Specification for “overhead line clearances Issue 3 (2004) 
available at: 
http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/LandandDevelopment/DDC/devnearohl_final/appendixIII/ap
pIII-part2 
 
 
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our 
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such 
overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all 
circumstances. 
 
 
The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is 
contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS 
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should 
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse 
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and 
“swing”) drawings should be obtained using the contact details above. 
 
 
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and 
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing 
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety 
clearances. 
 
 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb 
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation 
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above

located within and in close proximity to the proposed order limits. Details are as follows: 
 
 
FM28- Herbrandston- Felinfre 
 
FM28- Felindre- Three Cocks 
 
FM28- Felindre- Clifrew 
 
National Grid Gas Distribution 
 
National Grid has no gas distribution apparatus within the proposed order limits 
 
Specific Comments – Gas Infrastructure 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the 
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline 
at previously agreed locations.  
 
 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.  
 
 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be 
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National 
Grid.  
 
 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of 
the proposed protective measure.  
 
 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip.

 
A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement 
 
Cables Crossing: 
 
 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline. 
 
 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is 
above the pipeline. 
 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres 
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If 
this cannot be achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance 
distance of 0.6 metres. 
 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and 
after construction.  
 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased. 
 
 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established 
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed 
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final 
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the 
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power 
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with 
NG supervision and guidance.

Further Advice 
 
We would request that the potential impact of the proposed scheme on National Grid’s 
existing assets as set out above is considered in any subsequent reports, including in the 
Environmental Statement, and as part of any subsequent application.  
 
Where the promoter intends to acquire land, extinguish rights, or interfere with any of 
National Grid apparatus protective provisions will be required in a form acceptable to it to 
be included within the DCO.  
 
Where any diversion of apparatus may be required to facilitate a scheme, National Grid is 
unable to give any certainty with the regard to diversions until such time as adequate 
conceptual design studies have been undertaken by National Grid. Further information 
relating to this can be obtained by contacting the email address below.  
 
National Grid requests to be consulted at the earliest stages to ensure that the most 
appropriate protective provisions are included within the DCO application to safeguard the 
integrity of our apparatus and to remove the requirement for objection. All consultations 
should be sent to the following: DCOConsultations@nationalgrid.com as well as by post to 
the following address:

APPLICATION BY ABERGELLI POWER LIMITED FOR AN ORDER GRANTING 
DEVELOPMENT CONSENT FOR THE ABERGELLI POWER PROJECT 
 
Thank you for referring the above scoping opinion to Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru 
(CNC)/Natural Resources Wales (NRW) which we received on 26 June 2014. 
 
Our advice and comments in relation to the above Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) are provided in the context of the full remit of NRW. As 
you are aware we are a statutory consultee under the Planning Act 2008, advising 
the decision maker on the land use planning implications of the development. For 
those developments which involve a regulated activity requiring an Environmental 
Permit under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010, NRW is the permitting 
authority. We wish to make you aware that we have different roles under different 
legislation which are independent of one another.  
 
Primarily we would question the need and benefit of such a development at the 
proposed location in relation to the current and predicted demand for electricity 
supply in South West Wales, given existing power stations, along with other 
proposed schemes (Abernedd, Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon) and generation through 
renewables (wind and solar farms both existing and due to be developed 
imminently).  
 
 
 
2 
The proposals place the Simple Cycle Gas Turbine among what is beginning to 
develop into an area of renewable energy generation, which would not appear to be 
in fitting with solar and wind power already being generated and further proposed in 
the vicinity. The proposals suggest enough power being generated to power 400,000 
homes, yet the population of Swansea is less than 250,000. In addition to this, a 
Tidal Lagoon if developed will power 150,000 homes. There would not appear to be 
this level of demand in South West Wales and with regard to the proximity principle, 
such a development would be better suited to a more heavily industrialised area 
where demand is much greater. 
In view of the above, we would request to see justification as to why the 
development is proposed at this location. 
  
Environmental Permitting Regulations. 
 
The proposal will require an environmental permit to operate and a successful 
application will need to be made under the Environmental Permitting (England & 
Wales) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to determine whether the plant can be 
permitted. 
 
Pre-application discussions with Natural Resources Wales should commence 
immediately and applicants are encouraged to “twin track” environmental permit 
(EPR) applications with their Development Consent Order (DCO) applications in 
order to facilitate timely decision-making. 
 
NRW would also like to draw the applicant’s attention to Annex D of the Planning 
Inspectorate’s Advice Note 11: Working with Public Bodies which recommends 
that applicants should work towards submitting the EPR permit application at least 6 
months prior to the submission of an application for a DCO. 
 
Technology Selection 
Open (simple) cycle gas turbine (GT) operation is not usually considered to 
represent Best Available Technique (BAT) for normal power plant GT operation and 
rigorous justification of efficiency penalties would be required if this type of operation 
were to be proposed. 
 
The technology selection process should also consider the best achievable 
efficiency, in particular the potential for CHP (see below). It is noted that air cooled 
condensers or coolers are proposed as the cooling system for the project. Alternative 
cooling options need to be considered and technique selection justified based upon 
efficiency, water resources and waste water discharge as well as economic 
considerations. 
 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
A combustion power plant with a thermal input of 50MW or more must include 
combined heat and power (CHP) or alternative be CHP-ready (The term CHP-Ready 
in this context represents a plant which is initially configured to generate electrical 
power only but which is designed to be ready, with minimum modification, to supply 
heat in the future). 
 
 
3 
Guidance on determining BAT for CHP readiness can be found in the Environment 
Agency guidance document: CHP Ready Guidance for Combustion and Energy 
from Waste Power Plants 
 
Accident Management 
Flood risk assessment – should include consideration of surface water drainage 
impacts and options for improving site surface water drainage to prevent localised 
flooding during extreme rainfall events. 
 
Air Quality (AQ) Assessment 
The proposals are noted and the applicant is advised that particular attention should 
be given to acid and nutrient deposition at sensitive habitat receptors. 
 
NRW agrees with the use of AQTAG06 to reference methodologies in relation to 
aerial emission process contributions on protected sites (as in section 5.3.18).  
However, the applicant should be aware that AQTAG06 methodologies are no longer 
used for calculating acid deposition figures as a function of relevant critical loads.  
The applicant should instead use the APIS critical load function tool found at 
http://www.apis.ac.uk/critical-load-function-tool, in order to calculate acid deposition 
process contributions/exceedences.  Please note, the methodology relating to 
Nitrogen deposition is unchanged from that described in AQTAG06. 
 
The village of Llangyfelach is just outside of the proposed consultation distance of 
1km, though is in direct line of site to the proposed development and is a densely 
populated residential receptor. The scope of the Environmental Impact Assessment 
should widen to include any impact upon this village in addition to any cumulative 
impact in relation to air quality arising from other sources of pollution e.g. the M4 
motorway, the A48, B4489 and Morriston Crematorium 
 
Noise Impact Assessment 
The noise assessment baseline assessment (5.4.3) states that the “The closest 
NSRs within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the nearby settlements of 
Morriston, Pant-lasau, Llwyncelyn and Felindre. In addition there are also isolated 
dwellings and farmsteads outside of the settlements including but not exclusive to: 
Aber gelli fawr; Abergelli Farm; Cefn-betingau; Maes-eglwys; Lletty Morfil Farm; 
Felin-wen; Pont Felinwen; Pontbren Llwyd; Gors-wen; Llety’r Bugall; Brynheulog; 
Taironen; Penfedi Uchaf; Penidy Isaf; Gellyfedden; Rhos fawr; Brynawel; 
Brynwhilhach; and Lletty’r-scil. “ 
 
However, the assessment needs to clearly identify the NSR, as some of the above 
receptors are much closer than the 1km outlined. It is important to note that NRW 
would carry out the assessments at the nearest receptor to the installation as 
outlined in the BS4142:1997 Method of Rating Industrial Noise Affecting Mixed 
Residential and Industrial Areas. 
 
The report also states that the location of the baseline assessment/s will be agreed 
with the local EHO. This being the case this discussion on monitoring locations 
needs to also be communicated with NRW as the installation will require an A1 EPR 
Permit from NRW which will also include noise conditions. 
 
 
4 
The report does reference the BS4142 standard in assessing noise, which should 
also consider noise characteristics. This being the case it is recommended that the 
company also capture the existing noise characteristics. I.e. tonal assessment/third 
octave baseline data. 
 
We would recommend that this is carried out as part of the baseline to identify, firstly 
any existing tonal issues and subsequently would be beneficial in identifying the 
impact of the operation on the noise environment once in operation. Due to the type 
of operation we (NRW) have experienced noise issues as a result of the tonal 
aspects rather than the actual increase in noise level. There is another procedure 
which we and the Local Authority use to identify low frequency noise (20Hz – 
160Hz). The “DEFRA NANR45 Procedure for the assessment of low frequency 
noise complaints” is used but it is important that the company also reference other 
standards: “BS 7445:1991 Part 2 – Description and measurement of 
environmental noise”, suggests that if the level in one 1/3rd octave band is 5dB or 
more higher than the level in the two adjacent bands, then an audible tone is likely to 
be perceived. The “ISO 1996-2:2007 Description, measurement and assessment 
of environmental noise Part 2” can be used to measure with any frequency 
weighting or in any frequency band. The standard also outlines how to evaluate the 
uncertainty of the result of a noise assessment. Section 5.4.17 of the scoping report 
also states: “Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has been scoped out 
as there would be no significant effects associated with the potential for a low level 
electrical hum emanating from an overhead line option, if one is required. In addition 
if a SEC is required, any low level electrical hum associated with the infrastructure 
will not be perceptible at the NSRs and therefore this has also been scoped out of 
the assessment.” 
 
This states that low frequency noise aspects has been scoped out for the overhead 
lines, however it is important to understand why this has been scoped out and how 
was this conclusion made, this justification needs to be provided for assessment. 
Based on the inclusion of frequency analysis of the background data, this statement 
could be verified after commissioning to ensure that the operation has not introduced 
an additional noise aspect. 
 
Section 5.4.1 of the scoping report states: “During operation, mitigation measures 
could include the use of silencers on the loudest plant items within the Generating 
Equipment.” Noise mitigation measures on an EPR Installation should be in 
accordance with our (EA/NRW) Horizontal Guidance Note (H3) Part 2 – Noise 
Assessment and Control. 
 
In relation to the noise assessment there is another piece of legislation that has not 
been outlined, the requirements of the Environmental Noise Directive which were 
given legal force in Wales through the Environmental Noise (Wales) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2009. These regulations have introduced a “Noise Action Plan for 
Wales” which does cover industrial noise sources and impacts on designated Quiet 
Areas. The plan also considers the impact of creeping background especially with 
the introduction of new sources of noise into the environment. It is suggested that as 
part of the noise impact assessment the above standards and regulations are given 
due consideration by the applicant. 
 
 
5 
In relation to the impact of operational noise from the installation, this is quite limited, 
and should consider all modes of operation from the installation. The application 
does state that the applicant will consider worst case scenarios for the modelling 
however has not explicitly stated what would be the worst case. Construction Noise 
will be covered by the Local Authority. 
 
The majority of the environmental noise from the operation will be assessed using 
the BS4142:1997 Standard, however an important factor to consider is that this 
standard is being reviewed and the new draft consultation has been passed, 
therefore the new updated version could be available in the next 6 months. The new 
draft standard introduces number of changes, e.g. duration of monitoring times. 
 
In relation to the design aspects of the plant, we would suggest that the applicant 
designs the operation with no additional noise load on to background in line with the 
“Noise Action Plan for Wales”. Noise mitigation measures should also include 
reference to use of acoustic enclosures and cladding for plant and pipe work or 
ducting likely to produce noise under all operating conditions including abnormal 
operation. 
 
Site Condition 
Site survey work undertaken should take into account current environmental 
permitting and likely future requirements under the Industrial Emissions Directive 
(IED) to undertake intrusive works to gather baseline contamination data as part of 
the environmental permitting process. 
 
Water Quality  
 
Water Quality (WQ) Impact Assessment 
Assessment of WQ impacts should also include consideration of periodic or 
intermittent waste water effluent arising from commissioning procedures, HRSG 
make up water treatment, plant maintenance and cleaning procedures and cooling 
system blow down in the event that wet or hybrid cooling technology is considered to 
be appropriate. 
 
Water treatment and recovery options should be considered in addition to treatment 
and discharge. 
 
Surface Waters 
 
Section 5.6.3 of the report refers to the Afon Llan being the main watercourse that 
traverses the project site through Swansea and into Swansea Bay. The Llan in fact 
discharges to the Loughor Estuary on North Gower via Penllergaer, Fforestfach and 
Gowerton. Shellfish are harvested in the vicinity and so any impact assessment 
should also consider any potential for impact upon Designated Shellfisheries. 
Section 5.6.9 states that “There are not anticipated to be any significant impacts on 
key waterbodies resulting from the project through physical works to them. It is also 
not anticipated that water will be abstracted or discharged to or from any of these 
sources during construction, operation or decommissioning”. In which case, where 
will cooling water be derived from and where will waste water be discharged to?  
 
 
6 
Section 5.6.18 then states that “during operation, NRW would set limits on the quality 
of water that is discharged from the Power Generation Plant under an Environmental 
Permit”. The EIA should therefore consider the impacts of any discharge to a 
watercourse, with particular regard to the effects of temperature and the addition of 
biocides or chlorination etc. of cooling waters. The temperature of a discharge can 
be critical to fish migration and so any discharge must not be above 21oC beyond the 
mixing zone in order to prevent a temperature barrier from being created. 
Temperature also has a bearing on the fate and behaviour of ammonia, amongst 
other physical and chemical characteristics, in the water environment and the Afon 
Llan is not without other water quality impacts from, for example, sewage pollution. 
An increase in temperature could therefore have a downstream impact upon 
ammonia. This will need to be assessed. 
The Afon Llan is a very flashy rapid response catchment in terms of the way in which 
it reacts to rainfall and so this would need to be considered in relation to any 
construction and mitigation proposals. In recent years the river has been significantly 
impacted by silt pollution arising from several development schemes. We would 
need to be satisfied that any proposals would adequately mitigate against the 
possibility of further pollution e.g. from stripping and exposure of materials, 
increasing run-off rates and/or the location and protection of stockpile locations. The 
drainage of any constructed access roads should be designed to prevent silt/mud 
contaminated run-off from entering any watercourses. 
Any proposals should also consider the installation of temporary attenuation ponds 
to allow adequate settlement of site generated run-off during the construction and 
decommissioning phases. The design of these ponds should demonstrate that 
adequate retention and settlement time has been calculated. Silt fencing, scour 
protection and Sedimats alone have been proven to be ineffective in mitigation in this 
catchment due to its flashy nature. 
Any surface water disposal scheme would need to demonstrate that it will not cause 
any impact upon the local watercourses upon discharge e.g. silt run-off from any 
retention ponds, storage tanks, soakaways, swales, wetlands etc. We would advise 
that all disposal techniques be explored and are demonstrated as fit for purpose for 
all parts of the site.  
Flood Consequence Assessment  
A small part of the site is located within flood zone C2, as defined by the 
development advice maps referred to under TAN 15 Development and Flood Risk 
(July 2004). Our Flood Map information, which is updated on a quarterly basis, 
confirms this part of the site to be at risk of flooding in the 1% flood event. 
  
A number of ordinary watercourses cross the site and a small section runs adjacent 
to the Main River Llan. Section 5.6.2 of the scoping report indicates that a Flood 
Consequences Assessment (FCA) will be submitted as a separate document. This 
should assess the flood risk at the site and as a result of the development in line with 
TAN15 guidelines. We would be in favour of this approach and strongly advise that 
the developer consults with both ourselves and the Lead Local Flood Authority 
(LLFA) concerning the site as mentioned in the report. 
 
 
 
7 
The impact of the development upon surface water will also need to be considered 
as part of the FCA as mentioned in section 5.6.8.   
 
The developer should also be aware that any works which affect the flow in the 
ordinary watercourses across the site may require prior consent from the Lead Local 
Flood Authority (LLFA) and any works in, under, over or within 7m from the Afon Llan 
will require prior consent from NRW. 
 
Groundwater (in addition to surface waters)  
 
Our mapping system indicates various groundwater vulnerability zones and minor 
aquifers at the proposed location. A thorough assessment of the historic mine 
workings would need to be conducted to ensure that development would not 
potentially disturb or contaminate groundwater and surface waters in the vicinity. 
Likewise, a geophysical survey should determine the local geological setting to 
ensure that new pathways are not created that could cause contamination. 
This should also be a consideration when dealing with the landfill at the location. 
Although this landfill was operated as an inert landfill, this is not to say that it is 
exclusively filled with inert wastes. Any disturbance, or excavation, reuse, temporary 
storage and disposal of this material should not preclude the possibility of it 
containing non-inert and potentially hazardous substances. An assessment of this 
element of the scheme may be necessary in the form of trial pits or boreholes in 
order to determine materials present. NRW should be made aware of any adverse 
findings. 
The scoping report does not appear to mention foul water drainage arrangements. 
There is no mains sewer in the vicinity of this proposed development. Details of how 
sewage and other waste waters will be managed at the site need to be included and 
again, assessment of whether there is likely to be any impact arising from this upon 
receiving waters.  
Waste Arisings 
 
Section 5.7.12 states that “using the information obtained, suitable remediation 
strategies will be developed to render the Project Site ready for development. These 
will include estimates of the types and volumes of waste material that will need to be 
removed from the Project Site prior to development”. The development is likely to 
generate significant quantities of waste. The reuse/recovery of as much of this 
should be considered as part of the scheme within the spirit of the Waste Hierarchy 
i.e. 1. Reduction, 2. Reuse, 3. Recovery (Recycling, Composting, Incineration or 
landfill with energy recovery), 4. Rubbish (Incinerate, Landfill – contained, Landfill – 
dilute and disperse). A cost benefit analysis of using suitable waste versus virgin 
materials should be considered. The Site Waste Management Strategy should 
encompass the above principles. 
Ecology 
 
We welcome the submission of the report entitled ‘Abergelli Power Project – 
Preliminary Ecological Appraisal’, produced by BSG Ecology, dated March 2014.

Species 
We note that a Phase 1 Habitat Survey of the site has been conducted, which 
highlighted the habitats on site and its potential to support protected or notable 
species. We support the recommendation that further species surveys will be carried 
out (as detailed in sections 5.12-5.38 of the above report).  We advise that all 
surveys are carried out following best practice, up to date guidelines and conducted 
by qualified, experienced and (where necessary) licensed ecologists at appropriate 
times of the year. 
 
We note that in sections 4.46 and 5.22 of the report that it has been identified that 
some of the watercourses may offer resting/lying up sites for otter, along with some 
commuting use. We note that no further survey work of the watercourses for otter 
potential is proposed to be carried out. As you are aware, Otter are fully protected 
under Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
which includes protection of their breeding or resting sites. We advise that further 
survey work is considered at the site in the areas identified with suitability to support 
otters.  
 
Please note that we cannot provide any comment on issues relating to Badgers at 
the site as we have no received the confidential version of the report as stated in 
section 4.5.1.   
 
Habitats 
We note from the report that the site is a very significant locally important site, with 
marshy grassland/wet heath and ancient woodland habitats present as outlined in 
the report.   
 
We welcome the re-surveying of these habitats during Spring/Summer, given the 
proximity to known sites surrounding the area. Given the quality of the habitat 
present as surveyed in the Phase 1 habitat survey, we recommend early discussions 
with your local authority’s Planning Ecologist with a view to avoiding destruction of 
the most significant habitats and mitigation and/or compensation for loss of any 
significant habitats.  We would also welcome justification on the choice of habitat to 
be destroyed/removed as part of the planning application and justification on why the 
development cannot be constructed on the improved land only. 
 
We hold a record of a Phase 2 grassland survey of the fields which lie adjacent to 
the proposed access track. We will be able to provide this information to the 
developer should it be required. Please get in touch if you would like a copy of this 
survey. 
 
We note in section 5.7.2 of the main scoping report that there is a brief mention of 
peat present on site. We seek clarification and further detail on the location of the 
peat on site and how it will be affected by the development.   
 
The proposals have the potential to affect riverine and wetland habitats as there are 
a number of watercourses on the site including the Afon Llan. We would like the 
EIA to consider these as a separate habitat and look at options for maintaining open 
watercourses with wide buffer strips.  
 
 
9 
Diversion of small watercourses would be preferable to culverting them as long as 
the new watercourses are well designed to offer the best habitat for wildlife. 
Connectivity between small watercourses, areas of retained wetland habitat and the 
Afon Llan should also be a consideration for the final site layout and any mitigation 
proposed. NRW Biodiversity staff are happy to offer further advice on these matters, 
should it be required. 
 
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 
 
We welcome that a Landscape and Visual Assessment (LVIA) will be conducted, 
following the most up to date guidelines as outlined in section 5.8.7 of the main scoping 
report. 
 
The EIA must include a description of all the existing landscape interests within and in 
the vicinity of the proposed development. This should be done using former Countryside 
Council for Wales’ LANDMAP methodology (www.landmap.ccw.gov.uk).  LANDMAP is 
an all-Wales GIS based landscape resource where landscape characteristics, qualities 
and influences on the landscape are recorded and evaluated into a nationally consistent 
data set. LANDMAP comprises five spatially related datasets known as Evaluated 
Aspects; the five layers are the Geological Landscape, Landscape Habitats, Visual & 
Sensory, Historic Landscape and Cultural Landscape. All information is managed 
through a Geographical Information System and associated Collector database. 
 
Where all five layers of LANDMAP data for the local authority are available, they should 
all be referred to. If the developer experiences difficulty in getting this data from the 
LANDMAP website it should be possible for the data to be obtained by contacting Jill 
Bullen, our LANDMAP Wales Coordinator at our Bangor offices. NRW would expect any 
Environmental Statement (ES) to demonstrate use of all five data sets in the LVIA for 
the application. We recommend that the impacts of any development proposals on the 
landscape character of the area and its visual effects are assessed against the findings 
of this study. 
 
Such issues should all be addressed in the ES and visual appraisal of the scheme in 
addition to specific site issues such as: 
 
• Development infrastructure – including cabling, ancillary buildings, working 
compounds should all be considered in the assessment, even if ‘temporary’ (i.e. only 
for the duration of construction works). 
• The removal and disposal of any excavated materials such as soil or rock; 
• Creation of new access tracks and re-profiling of existing ones;  
• Transmission route connections to the main power grid; it is important that a 
landscape assessment of the connection route from the development to the power 
grid is included for consideration 
 
The ES should also consider the presence of any historic landscapes in the area and 
the potential impact that the proposed development may have on these, which is noted 
in section 5.8.7 of the report.  
 
 
 
10 
The ES should consider protected landscapes in the vicinity of the proposals. It is vital 
that the LVIA utilises appropriate viewpoints to consider the impacts of the proposals on 
these protected landscapes as there is potential for it to be visible from a wide area 
surrounding it. We note that section 5.8.11 refers to a follow up consultation with the 
relevant stakeholders on a selection of photomontages from key sensitive viewpoints. 
NRW would be happy to provide advice on these viewpoints. It is noted that some 
viewpoints have been suggested; however these do not include detailed grid references 
therefore we cannot comment on their suitability at this stage. We advise that 
consideration is made for an additional viewpoint from the Brecon Beacons National 
Park. We note that the Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) has been 
scoped out of the assessment as it is visually separated from the project site by 
intervening topography. 
 
We advise that views in photographs and photomontages taken to assist with this 
process should be representative of that observed from each viewpoint and not partially 
obscured by structures such as buildings, pylons, telegraph poles, trees etc.  
 
The ES should also consider the potential impact of any proposed lighting impacts upon 
receptors in the vicinity of the project. The development has the potential to significantly 
increase the level of light pollution in the area. We advise that a night time visual effects 
is carried out to assess the level of night time illumination (should there be any).   
 
Habitats Regulation Assessment  
 
We welcome that a Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA) will be conducted as 
outlined in sections 5.5.28 – 5.5.30 of the report. The HRA must follow the consultation 
process as set out in the Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 10: Habitat 
Regulations Assessment relevant to nationally significant infrastructure projects 
(Link below).  
 
(http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Advice-note-10-
HRA.pdf).

Description of Site and its Surroundings: 
 
The proposed development is located close to Felindre in the City and 
County of Swansea, approximately 5.6km from this Authority’s 
administrative boundary.  
 
Brief description of proposal:  
 
The current consultation is from the Planning Inspectorate in relation to 
The Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended) – 
Regulations 8 and 9. 
 
The Project comprises; 
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by 
natural gas and capable of providing an electrical capacity of up to 
299 Megawatts (MW) comprising: 
 
 The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine 
Generators and Balance of Plant which are located on the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
 
A new purpose built Access Road either from the Rhyd-y-pandy 
Road to the north (Access Road – Option 1) or the B4489 to the 
Officer Report 
 
 
Page 2 of 3 
 
west (Access Road – Option 2) to the Generating Equipment 
Site; and 
 
During construction a temporary construction compound (the 
Laydown Area). 
 
 A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from either the National Transmission System (NTS) or 
the Local Transmission System (LTS), which is located within the 
Gas Opportunity Area; and 
 
A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) for distribution to homes and businesses 
 
In terms of the process, The Planning Act 2008 (as amended by the 
Localism Act 2011) made significant changes to the planning system for 
major infrastructure projects such as this. An application must therefore 
be made for the development as a National Strategic Infrastructure 
Project (NSIP) to the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) for permission under 
a development consent order (DCO) from the Secretary of State for 
Energy and Climate Change. 
 
This consultation seeks the Authority’s view of the scope of the EIA to 
support this application at a pre-application stage.  
 
Material Considerations: 
 
 
Any potential impacts that will require to be assessed as part of the sope 
of the supporting ES submitted with any future planning application for 
the above development.  
 
Policy Context: 
n/a 
 
Content of Scoping Report. 
 
The site is located such a distance from this Authority’s boundary that it 
unlikely to result in any cross boundary impacts, and therefore we have 
no significant comment to provide on the adequacy of the scoping report.  
 
The Air Quality Section have been consulted, as have the Highway 
Section, and Biodiversity Section, as these are the main potential areas of 
the ES that could have cross-boundary impacts.

Dear Ms Colfer, 
 
I refer to your letter dated 26th June 2014 in respect of the Scoping Consultation being undertaken on Abergelli Power 
Limited’s application for a Development Consent Order in relation to the proposed power generation plant and 
associated underground gas pipeline infrastructure and access road.  The following outlines Network Rail’s 
comments: 
 
Network Rail is the statutory undertaker responsible for maintaining and operating the country’s railway infrastructure 
and associated estate.  It owns, operates, maintains and develops the main rail network.  Network Rail aims to protect 
and enhance the railway infrastructure and therefore any proposed development which is in close vicinity to the 
railway line, or could potentially affect Network Rail’s specific land interests, will be carefully considered.  
 
The physical railway infrastructure must be protected and the development must ensure that it does not have an 
adverse affect upon the safety of the railway line.  This may be through increased usage of a level crossing or rail 
bridge by construction traffic associated with the proposed development or disruption to rail services during 
installation or maintenance of the overhead lines across the railway line.  If there is any impact upon rail infrastructure 
this must be examined and addressed within Abergelli Power Limited’s Environmental Statement. 
 
Any proposals that include the installation of cables under or over the railway, any methods of electricity 
transmissions across Network Rail’s land, or any access rights, temporary or otherwise will require the necessary 
property agreements to be entered into with our Easements and Wayleaves Team who can be contacted on 
easements&wayleaves@networkrail.co.uk . Please note that Network Rail will seek protection from the exercise of 
compulsory purchase powers over operational land whether for permanent or temporary purposes. 
 
Network Rail would have strong concerns if, during the construction or operation of the power generation plant, 
abnormal loads would use routes that include Network Rail assets (e.g. level crossings, bridges etc) and would advise 
that contact is made with our Asset Protection Engineers to confirm if any proposed route is viable.  A strategy must 
also be agreed to protect our assets from potential damage caused by abnormal loads in association with the 
implementation of the Abergelli Power Project.  I would also advise that where damage, injury or delay to the rail 
network is caused by abnormal load (related to the development), Abergelli Power Limited or relevant contractors 
would incur full liability.  
 
Notwithstanding the above, to mitigate the risks outlined above, Abergelli Power Limited must contact Network Rail’s 
Asset Protection Team (assetprotectionwales@networkrail.co.uk) well in advance of commencing any works. 
 
Although this consultation considers the scope of the Environmental Statement, we would also take this opportunity to 
highlight that Network Rail will expect to see its standard Protective Provisions in a schedule to the Development 
Consent Order, which is well precedented in both TWAOs and DCOs. 
 
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you require any further information in relation to the above.  
 
I would be grateful if you could confirm receipt of this email. 
 
Kind regards

Dear Jenny, 
 
 
Re: Abergelli Power Project – Scoping Consultation 
 
 
Thank you for including Public Health England (PHE) in the scoping consultation 
phase of the above application.  Our response focuses on health protection issues 
relating to chemicals and radiation.  Advice offered by PHE is impartial and 
independent. 
In order to ensure that health is fully and comprehensively considered, the 
Environmental Statement (ES) should provide sufficient information to allow the 
potential impact of the development on public health to be fully assessed. 
PHE, which includes PHE’s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental 
Hazards (Wales), has evaluated the submitted Environmental Impact Assessment 
Scoping Report (June 2014) alongside the request for a scoping opinion and can 
confirm that the proposed methodology for assessing possible impacts affecting 
human health and the mitigation measures suggested so far appear acceptable. 
However, the Environmental Impact Assessment report should also include possible 
risks on human health due to electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) produced by the 
electrical connection system and other electrical equipment. 
In order to assist the promoter in the production of the Environmental Impact 
Assessment report (i.e. subsequent ES) we have included an appendix which 
outlines the generic considerations that PHE advises should be addressed by all 
promoters when they are preparing ESs for NSIPs.  The ES report should include 
Your Ref: EN010069 
Our Ref: 140626 331 
any cumulative impacts upon the local vicinity that may occur during the lifetime of 
the proposed project.  
PHE will provide further comments when the ES becomes available. Should the 
promoter or their agents wish to discuss our recommendations or to seek any 
specific advice prior to the submission of the ES, PHE would of course be pleased to 
assist. 
Yours sincerely 
 
Antonio Peña-Fernández 
Health Protection Scientist

Please mark any correspondence for the attention of National Infrastructure Planning 
Administration. 
Appendix: PHE recommendations regarding the scoping document 
General approach  
The EIA should give consideration to best practice guidance such as the 
Government’s Good Practice Guide for EIA1. It is important that the EIA identifies 
and assesses the potential public health impacts of the activities at, and emissions 
from, the installation. Assessment should consider the development, operational, 
and decommissioning phases. 
The EIA Directive2 requires that ESs include a description of the aspects of the 
environment likely to be significantly affected by the development, including 
“population”. The EIA should provide sufficient information for PHE to fully assess 
the potential impact of the development on public health. PHE will only consider 
information contained or referenced in a separate section of the ES 
summarising the impact of the proposed development on public health: 
summarising risk assessments, proposed mitigation measures, and residual impacts. 
This section should summarise key information and conclusions relating to human 
health impacts contained in other sections of the application (e.g. in the separate 
sections dealing with: air quality, emissions to water, waste, contaminated land etc.) 
without undue duplication. Compliance with the requirements of National Policy 
Statements and relevant guidance and standards should be highlighted.  
It is not PHE’s role to undertake these assessments on behalf of promoters as this 
would conflict with PHE’s role as an impartial and independent body. 
Consideration of alternatives (including alternative sites, choice of process, and the 
phasing of construction) is widely regarded as good practice. Ideally, EIA should 
start at the stage of site and process selection, so that the environmental merits of 
practicable alternatives can be properly considered. Where this is undertaken, the 
main alternatives considered should be outlined in the ES3. 
The following text covers a range of issues that PHE would expect to be addressed 
by the promoter. However this list is not exhaustive and the onus is on the promoter 
to ensure that the relevant public health issues are identified and addressed. PHE’s 
advice and recommendations carry no statutory weight and constitute non-binding 
guidance. 
Receptors 
The ES should clearly identify the development’s location and the location and 
distance from the development of off-site human receptors that may be affected by 
emissions from, or activities at, the development. Off-site human receptors may 
include people living in residential premises; people working in commercial, and

Communities and Local Government. Available from:

environment. Available from: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1985L0337:20090625:EN:PDF

industrial premises and people using transport infrastructure (such as roads and 
railways), recreational areas, and publicly-accessible land. Consideration should also 
be given to environmental receptors such as the surrounding land, watercourses, 
surface and groundwater, and drinking water supplies such as wells, boreholes and 
water abstraction points. 
Impacts arising from construction and decommissioning 
Any assessment of impacts arising from emissions due to construction and 
decommissioning should consider potential impacts on all receptors and describe 
monitoring and mitigation during these phases. Construction and decommissioning 
will be associated with vehicle movements and cumulative impacts should be 
accounted for. 
We would expect the promoter to follow best practice guidance during all phases 
from construction to decommissioning to ensure appropriate measures are in place 
to mitigate any potential impact on health from emissions (point source, fugitive and 
traffic-related). An effective Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) 
(and Decommissioning Environmental Management Plan (DEMP)) will help provide 
reassurance that activities are well managed. The promoter should ensure that there 
are robust mechanisms in place to respond to any complaints of traffic-related 
pollution, during construction, operation, and decommissioning of the facility. 
Emissions to air and water 
Significant impacts are unlikely to arise from installations which employ Best 
Available Techniques (BAT) and which meet regulatory requirements concerning 
emission limits and design parameters. However, PHE has a number of comments 
regarding emissions in order that the EIA provides a comprehensive assessment of 
potential impacts. 
When considering a baseline (of existing environmental quality) and in the 
assessment and future monitoring of impacts these: 
 should include appropriate screening assessments and detailed dispersion 
modelling where this is screened as necessary  
 should encompass all pollutants which may be emitted by the installation in 
combination with all pollutants arising from associated development and 
transport, ideally these should be considered in a single holistic assessment 
 should consider the construction, operational, and decommissioning phases 
 should consider the typical operational emissions and emissions from start-up, 
shut-down, abnormal operation and accidents when assessing potential impacts 
and include an assessment of worst-case impacts 
 should fully account for fugitive emissions 
 should include appropriate estimates of background levels 
 should identify cumulative and incremental impacts (i.e. assess cumulative 
impacts from multiple sources), including those arising from associated 
development, other existing and proposed development in the local area, and 
new vehicle movements associated with the proposed development; associated 
transport emissions should include consideration of non-road impacts (i.e. rail, 
sea, and air) 
 should include consideration of local authority, Environment Agency, Defra 
national network, and any other local site-specific sources of monitoring data 
 should compare predicted environmental concentrations to the applicable 
standard or guideline value for the affected medium (such as UK Air Quality 
Standards and Objectives and Environmental Assessment Levels) 
 If no standard or guideline value exists, the predicted exposure to humans 
should be estimated and compared to an appropriate health-based value 
(a Tolerable Daily Intake or equivalent). Further guidance is provided in 
Annex 1 
 This should consider all applicable routes of exposure e.g. include 
consideration of aspects such as the deposition of chemicals emitted to air 
and their uptake via ingestion 
 should identify and consider impacts on residential areas and sensitive receptors 
(such as schools, nursing homes and healthcare facilities) in the area(s) which 
may be affected by emissions, this should include consideration of any new 
receptors arising from future development 
Whilst screening of impacts using qualitative methodologies is common practice (e.g. 
for impacts arising from fugitive emissions such as dust), where it is possible to 
undertake a quantitative assessment of impacts then this should be undertaken. 
PHE’s view is that the EIA should appraise and describe the measures that will be 
used to control both point source and fugitive emissions and demonstrate that 
standards, guideline values or health-based values will not be exceeded due to 
emissions from the installation, as described above. This should include 
consideration of any emitted pollutants for which there are no set emission limits. 
When assessing the potential impact of a proposed installation on environmental 
quality, predicted environmental concentrations should be compared to the permitted 
concentrations in the affected media; this should include both standards for short 
and long-term exposure.  
Additional points specific to emissions to air 
When considering a baseline (of existing air quality) and in the assessment and 
future monitoring of impacts these: 
 should include consideration of impacts on existing areas of poor air quality e.g. 
existing or proposed local authority Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) 
 should include modelling using appropriate meteorological data (i.e. come from 
the nearest suitable meteorological station and include a range of years and 
worst case conditions) 
 should include modelling taking into account local topography 
Additional points specific to emissions to water 
When considering a baseline (of existing water quality) and in the assessment and 
future monitoring of impacts these: 
 should include assessment of potential impacts on human health and not focus 
solely on ecological impacts 
 should identify and consider all routes by which emissions may lead to population 
exposure (e.g. surface watercourses; recreational waters; sewers; geological 
routes etc.)  
 should assess the potential off-site effects of emissions to groundwater (e.g. on 
aquifers used for drinking water) and surface water (used for drinking water 
abstraction) in terms of the potential for population exposure 
 should include consideration of potential impacts on recreational users (e.g. from 
fishing, canoeing etc) alongside assessment of potential exposure via drinking 
water 
Land quality 
We would expect the promoter to provide details of any hazardous contamination 
present on site (including ground gas) as part of the site condition report. 
Emissions to and from the ground should be considered in terms of the previous 
history of the site and the potential of the site, once operational, to give rise to 
issues. Public health impacts associated with ground contamination and/or the 
migration of material off-site should be assessed4 and the potential impact on nearby 
receptors and control and mitigation measures should be outlined.  
Relevant areas outlined in the Government’s Good Practice Guide for EIA include: 
 effects associated with ground contamination that may already exist 
                                            
4 Following the approach outlined in the section above dealing with emissions to air and water i.e. comparing predicted 
environmental concentrations to the applicable standard or guideline value for the affected medium  (such as Soil Guideline 
Values) 
 effects associated with the potential for polluting substances that are used (during 
construction / operation) to cause new ground contamination issues on a site, for 
example introducing / changing the source of contamination  
 impacts associated with re-use of soils and waste soils, for example, re-use of 
site-sourced materials on-site or offsite, disposal of site-sourced materials offsite, 
importation of materials to the site, etc. 
Waste 
The EIA should demonstrate compliance with the waste hierarchy (e.g. with respect 
to re-use, recycling or recovery and disposal). 
For wastes arising from the installation the EIA should consider: 
 the implications and wider environmental and public health impacts of different 
waste disposal options  
 disposal route(s) and transport method(s) and how potential impacts on public 
health will be mitigated 
Other aspects 
Within the EIA PHE would expect to see information about how the promoter would 
respond to accidents with potential off-site emissions e.g. flooding or fires, spills, 
leaks or releases off-site. Assessment of accidents should: identify all potential 
hazards in relation to construction, operation and decommissioning; include an 
assessment of the risks posed; and identify risk management measures and 
contingency actions that will be employed in the event of an accident in order to 
mitigate off-site effects. 
The EIA should include consideration of the COMAH Regulations (Control of Major 
Accident Hazards) and the Major Accident Off-Site Emergency Plan (Management of 
Waste from Extractive Industries) (England and Wales) Regulations 2009: both in 
terms of their applicability to the installation itself, and the installation’s potential to 
impact on, or be impacted by, any nearby installations themselves subject to the 
these Regulations. 
There is evidence that, in some cases, perception of risk may have a greater impact 
on health than the hazard itself. A 2009 report5, jointly published by Liverpool John 
Moores University and PHE, examined health risk perception and environmental 
problems using a number of case studies. As a point to consider, the report 
suggested: “Estimation of community anxiety and stress should be included as part 
of every risk or impact assessment of proposed plans that involve a potential 
environmental hazard. This is true even when the physical health risks may be 
negligible.” PHE supports the inclusion of this information within EIAs as good 
practice.

Electric and magnetic fields (EMF)  
There is a potential health impact associated with the electric and magnetic fields 
around substations and the connecting cables or lines. The following information 
provides a framework for considering the potential health impact. 
In March 2004, the National Radiological Protection Board, NRPB (now part of PHE), 
published advice on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields. The advice 
was based on an extensive review of the science and a public consultation on its 
website, and recommended the adoption in the UK of the EMF exposure guidelines 
published by the International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP):- 
http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/Radiation/NPRBArchive/DocumentsOfTheNRPB/
Absd1502/ 
The ICNIRP guidelines are based on the avoidance of known adverse effects of 
exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) at frequencies up to 300 GHz (gigahertz), 
which includes static magnetic fields and 50 Hz electric and magnetic fields 
associated with electricity transmission.  
PHE notes the current Government policy is that the ICNIRP guidelines are 
implemented in line with the terms of the EU Council Recommendation on limiting 
exposure of the general public (1999/519/EC): 
http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthprotection/DH_4089500 
For static magnetic fields, the latest ICNIRP guidelines (2009) recommend that acute 
exposure of the general public should not exceed 400 mT (millitesla), for any part of 
the body, although the previously recommended value of 40 mT is the value used in 
the Council Recommendation.  However, because of potential indirect adverse 
effects, ICNIRP recognises that practical policies need to be implemented to prevent 
inadvertent harmful exposure of people with implanted electronic medical devices 
and implants containing ferromagnetic materials, and injuries due to flying 
ferromagnetic objects, and these considerations can lead to much lower restrictions, 
such as 0.5 mT as advised by the International Electrotechnical Commission.  
At 50 Hz, the known direct effects include those of induced currents in the body on 
the central nervous system (CNS) and indirect effects include the risk of painful 
spark discharge on contact with metal objects exposed to the field. The ICNIRP 
guidelines give reference levels for public exposure to 50 Hz electric and magnetic 
fields, and these are respectively 5 kV m−1 (kilovolts per metre) and 100 μT 
(microtesla). If people are not exposed to field strengths above these levels, direct 
effects on the CNS should be avoided and indirect effects such as the risk of painful 
spark discharge will be small. The reference levels are not in themselves limits but 
provide guidance for assessing compliance with the basic restrictions and reducing 
the risk of indirect effects. Further clarification on advice on exposure guidelines for 
50 Hz electric and magnetic fields is provided in the following note on PHE website: 
http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/11957338050
36 
The Department of Energy and Climate Change has also published voluntary code 
of practices which set out key principles for complying with the ICNIRP guidelines for 
the industry. 
http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/consents_planning/c
odes/codes.aspx 
There is concern about the possible effects of long-term exposure to electromagnetic 
fields, including possible carcinogenic effects at levels much lower than those given 
in the ICNIRP guidelines. In the NRPB advice issued in 2004, it was concluded that 
the studies that suggest health effects, including those concerning childhood 
leukaemia, could not be used to derive quantitative guidance on restricting exposure. 
However, the results of these studies represented uncertainty in the underlying 
evidence base, and taken together with people’s concerns, provided a basis for 
providing an additional recommendation for Government to consider the need for 
further precautionary measures, particularly with respect to the exposure of children 
to power frequency magnetic fields.   
The Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs (SAGE) was then set up to take this 
recommendation forward, explore the implications for a precautionary approach to 
extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (ELF EMFs), and to make 
practical recommendations to Government. In the First Interim Assessment of the 
Group, consideration was given to mitigation options such as the 'corridor option' 
near power lines, and optimal phasing to reduce electric and magnetic fields. A 
Second Interim Assessment addresses electricity distribution systems up to 66 kV. 
The SAGE reports can be found at the following link: 
http://sagedialogue.org.uk/ (go to “Document Index” and Scroll to SAGE/Formal 
reports with recommendations) 
The Agency has given advice to Health Ministers on the First Interim Assessment of 
SAGE regarding precautionary approaches to ELF EMFs and specifically regarding 
power lines and property, wiring and electrical equipment in homes: 
http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/12042766825
32?p=1207897920036 
The evidence to date suggests that in general there are no adverse effects on the 
health of the population of the UK caused by exposure to ELF EMFs below the 
guideline levels. The scientific evidence, as reviewed by PHE, supports the view that 
precautionary measures should address solely the possible association with 
childhood leukaemia and not other more speculative health effects. The measures 
should be proportionate in that overall benefits outweigh the fiscal and social costs, 
have a convincing evidence base to show that they will be successful in reducing 
exposure, and be effective in providing reassurance to the public.  
The Government response to the SAGE report is given in the written Ministerial 
Statement by Gillian Merron, then Minister of State, Department of Health, published 
on 16th October 2009:

The above information provides a framework for considering the health impact 
associated with the proposed development, including the direct and indirect effects 
of the electric and magnetic fields as indicated above.  
Liaison with other stakeholders, comments should be sought from: 
 the local authority for matters relating to noise, odour, vermin and dust nuisance 
 the local authority regarding any site investigation and subsequent construction 
(and remediation) proposals to ensure that the site could not be determined as 
‘contaminated land’ under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 
 the local authority regarding any impacts on existing or proposed Air Quality 
Management Areas 
 the Food Standards Agency Wales  for matters relating to the impact on human 
health of pollutants deposited on land used for growing food/ crops 
 the Natural Resources Wales for matters relating to flood risk and releases with 
the potential to impact on surface and groundwaters 
 the Natural Resources Wales for matters relating to waste characterisation and 
acceptance 
 The Local Authority Directors of Public Health for matters relating to wider public 
health. 
 
 
 
Environmental Permitting  
Amongst other permits and consents, the development will require an environmental 
permit from the Environment Agency to operate (under the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010). Therefore the installation will need to 
comply with the requirements of best available techniques (BAT). PHE is a consultee 
for bespoke environmental permit applications and will respond separately to any 
such consultation. 
Annex 1 
 
Human health risk assessment (chemical pollutants) 
The points below are cross-cutting and should be considered when undertaking a 
human health risk assessment: 
 The promoter should consider including Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) 
numbers alongside chemical names, where referenced in the ES 
 Where available, the most recent United Kingdom standards for the 
appropriate media (e.g. air, water, and/or soil) and health-based guideline 
values should be used when quantifying the risk to human health from 
chemical pollutants. Where UK standards or guideline values are not 
available, those recommended by the European Union or World Health 
Organisation can be used  
 When assessing the human health risk of a chemical emitted from a facility or 
operation, the background exposure to the chemical from other sources 
should be taken into account 
 When quantitatively assessing the health risk of genotoxic and carcinogenic 
chemical pollutants PHE does not favour the use of mathematical models to 
extrapolate from high dose levels used in animal carcinogenicity studies to 
well below the observed region of a dose-response relationship.  When only 
animal data are available, we recommend that the ‘Margin of Exposure’ 
(MOE) approach6 is used

Dear Jenny  
 
APP NUMBER: 
ENQ2014/0800 
SITE LOCATION:  
Abergelli Power Project, Felindre, Swansea  
PROPOSAL: 
Power Generation Plant – 299 MW (EIA Scoping Report)  
 
I refer to your letter dated 26 June 2014 (Ref:ENO10069) regarding the EIA Scoping 
Consultation.   The Local Planning Authority would wish to highlight the following 
issues:  
 
4.3 
Cumulative Assessment 
In addition to the listed developments, the EIA should also have regard to the 
following:  
 
Planning Application 2012/1221 Mynydd y Gwair Wind Farm - Installation of 16 wind 
turbines (maximum height to blade tip of 127 metres with a hub height of 80 metres), 
with a maximum generating capacity of 48MW, associated tracks and ancillary 
infrastructure (including permanent and temporary anemometer masts, electrical 
substation compound, hardstandings, transformers and underground cabling) and 
construction of new access track from A48 (Bolgoed Road at Pontarddulais) 
(approximately 14.54km in length) incorporating improvements to 3.9km of existing 
road across Mynydd Pysgodlyn – Planning Permission March, 2013  
 
Planning Application 2006/0773 – Felindre Business Park  - Outline Planning 
Permission has been granted for a strategic business park for B1 and B2 uses to 
accommodate emerging industries, high tech manufacturing, high level services, 
ancillary uses, associated car parking, landscaping and access roads.  
 
The application site area extends to 195 hectares, however, the application master 
plan indicates the development area to be 60.9 hectares of the south eastern area of 
the site and is focussed on the main brownfield area of the site formerly occupied by 
the Felindre tinplate works. It is envisaged that this developable area on the master

plan will become the first phase of the overall concept and act as the catalyst for 
further potential phases of development. However, this is outside the scope of this 
particular application. 
 
The development of the Strategic employment site would represent the first stage in 
the implementation of a high level employment site at Felindre which envisages the 
following types of uses as appropriate within each of the high value added economic 
groups: 
 
 
emerging 
industries 
(media/multi-media, 
biotechnology 
and 
nanotechnology).  
 
High 
tech 
manufacturing 
(semiconductors, 
telecoms 
equipment, 
pharmaceuticals & fine chemicals, advanced materials, aerospace).  
 
High level services (IT services & software, HQ functions, R & D, financial 
and business services, publishing).    
 
The site is not considered suitable for general manufacturing, processing and office 
services. The main elements of the scheme are as follows: 
 
 80,065 sq. m/861,900 sq. ft of employment floor space for specific B1 and 
B2 use classes.  
 Ancillary uses associated with a Strategic Business Park. 
 Associated parking, landscaping and highway works. 
 
Additionally, the Felindre LDP / Candidate Site should be considered. The 
assessment fails to have regard to the Local Development Plan: Preferred Strategy, 
July 2013. Within its Sustainable Growth Strategy, at Felindre, it is proposed to 
establish a new sustainable urban village to complement the proposed strategic 
employment development site at this location of 1000 new houses, together with 
supporting community facilities, leisure opportunities and integrated green 
infrastructure.

ES Impact Sections  
 
5.3 Air Quality  
The Council’s Pollution Control team have assessed the scoping report and in 
respect of air quality are of the view that the main issues have been covered / 
identified.  
 
The proposed use of ADMS for the dispersion modelling is welcomed but Pollution 
Control would want to agree all selected receptor locations for the modelling studies 
and also some of the data inputs. The modelling studies would need to consider 
human receptor points and also any SAC/SSSI etc etc. It is noted that they also plan 
to include an assessment of all non designated ecological receptor sites i.e. the Lliw

and Llan reservoirs. The pollutants of interest would be NOx , NO and NO2, PM10 
and CO. In addition, and as increasing research is pointing to significant health 
effects from PM2.5 this pollutant should be included in any impact assessment. 
Pollution Control would also be interested in seeing predicted ground level ozone 
concentrations as a result of photochemistry from any increased NOx made 
available. (Ozone is known to be higher in rural areas due to ongoing photochemistry 
resulting from the wind mass laden with NOx passing overhead from the urban areas 
with ongoing photochemistry taking place – high ozone concentrations can have 
human health implications as well as effects on vegetation etc) 
 
Local meteorological data should be used for any modelling studies and not be 
sourced from Cardiff Airport / Tutt Head Mumbles for example as these locations 
would in all probability not reflect conditions at the proposed site. Pollution Control 
can make available both boundary scaling data and the climatological dataset from 
their 30m mast at Cwm Level Park for their use. However, if they are planning to 
source meteorological data from any other source i.e. the Mynydd y Gwair wind farm 
development then this may prove an even better local source. Pollution Control 
would also consider making their SODAR wind profiler available (AQ500) should a 
suitable remote site be found and made available to site the equipment trailer. This 
AQ500 produces detailed wind speed/wind direction measurements every 15m up to 
its maximum height range of 300m which would be useful in any modelling 
undertaken. 
 
5.4 
Noise and Vibration  
The Council’s Pollution Control team would require an assessment of the effects 
from all tonal noise from the development at existing receptor locations. Additionally, 
regard should be made to the committed development of the Felindre Strategic 
Business Park and the proposed residential development of the Felindre LDP urban 
village.    
 
5.5 
Ecology   
The Council’s Ecologist has assessed the ecological sections scoping report and 
confirms that it would appear that all of the relevant areas for ecological survey have 
been identified in the preliminary ecological appraisal (appendix 1). The surveyors 
have identified some areas requiring further work some of which is been carried out 
now.  This additional work is summarised in sections 5.5.9 to 5.5.25 of the report. 
Once the full report has been completed it will be possible to fully assess any 
potential impact. 
 
5.6 
Water Quality and Resources  
Immediately to the north of the site Dwr Cymru Welsh Water operate their Felindre 
Water Treatment Works (WTW) and further to the north the Upper and Lower Lliw 
reservoirs form an important watt storage asset for the provision of treated water to 
over 400,000 customers extending as far west as Carmarthen and as far east as the

Vale of Glamorgan and additionally there is a strategic watermain in the vicinity. The 
66” diameter strategic water pipeline, along with the Lliw Reservoirs and Felindre 
WTW form integral parts of the largest water supply scheme ever constructed in 
Wales and were built in 1968 under an Act of Parliament known as the River Towy 
Water Supply Scheme. The 66” watermain is 17 miles long running from 
Nantgaredig Pumping Station to Felindre Water Treatment Works, and has no 
isolation valves along its entire length. It carries 240 Megalitres of water per day. 
This asset is the sole supply from ther Llyn Brianne reservoir, via Nantgaredig 
Pumping Station to Felindre Water Treatment Works (WTW). Critical dependencies 
on this water supply include heavy and light industry, commercial centres and major 
health care facilities, such as the Morriston Hospital. Felindre WTW is one of only 
five DCWW assets in Wales which is classified by UK Government as of Critical 
National Importance. The strategic and importance of this asset therefore cannot be 
overstated.   
 
No doubt consultation has been undertaken with DCWW, but impacts about the 
water quality in the reservoir and the structural integrity of the strategic water mains 
will need to be fully considered.  It has previously been indicated by DCWW in 
association with other projects, that any works that would impact the integrity of the 
watermain would be of significant concern. It should also be noted that a fracture to 
this important watermain is likely to result in a major flooding incident as the water 
from the pipe drains out. Should the supply of water from this watermain to Felindre 
WTW be interrupted, water would be sourced from the Lower Lliw reservoir. 
Although the Lower Lliw would provide storage for a time, once half of the reservoir’s 
stored water has been used the remaining water will be of very poor quality. The 
amount of treatment required for the water extracted at lower water is likely to 
exceed the treatment which can be provided at Felindre WTW in the quantities 
required for 400,000 customers. 
   
Burry Inlet Habitat Regulations Assessment   
The Scoping Opinion indicates that the Afan Llan flows in Swansea Bay. This is 
incorrect as the Afan Llan flows into the Loughor Estuary / Burry Inlet. This forms 
part of a European protected site which potentially affects the Carmarthen Bay and 
Estuaries European Marine Site (CBEEMS), the Carmarthen Bay Special Protection 
Area (SPA) and the Burry Inlet SPA and RAMSAR site. The conservation status of 
the sites has for some time been a matter of concern, with the issues centre around 
deficiencies in the sewerage infrastructure and the resulting storm spills and 
nutrients that may discharge into the protected sites.  
 
The local authorities, Carmarthenshire County Council and City and County of 
Swansea Council, are required to meet their obligations under the EU Habitats 
Directive to ensure that no new developments adversely affect a protected site. This 
has led to a precautionary approach to new applications for development that may 
add additional loading on the public sewerage infrastructure in the area. To this end

a Memorandum of Understanding has been agreed between the relevant Councils, 
Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, Environment Agency and Countryside Council for Wales 
(Sept. 2011). The Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) relating to the 
Safeguarding the Environment of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries European 
Marine Site (CBEEMS) whilst enabling Social and Economic Development for 
Communities around Burry Inlet indicates that to allow developments to proceed 
within the Gowerton Catchment foul flows generated by a development will only be 
allowed to connect to the sewerage system once existing flows of surface water or 
foul have been removed from the system as a compensatory measure.

Landscape and Visual Impact 
It is noted that a landscape and visual assessment will be undertaken and it is noted 
that a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) will be generated for the Power Generation 
Plant and that a selection of photomontages will be taken from key sensitive 
viewpoints, and a suggested list in included in the Scoping Report for consultation. 
Whilst the suggested viewpoint locations appear to be indicative of the surrounding

Dear Ms Colfer 
 
Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended) – Regulations 8 and 9  
 
Application by Abergelli Power Limited for an Order Granting Development Consent 
for the Abergelli Power Project – Scoping Consultation 
 
Thank you for your consultation letter of 26 June 2014 seeking the views of The Coal 
Authority on the EIA Scoping Opinion for the above proposal. 
 
The Coal Authority is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change.  As a statutory consultee, The Coal Authority has a duty to 
respond to planning applications and development plans in order to protect the public and 
the environment in mining areas. 
 
The Coal Authority Response 
I have reviewed the proposals and confirm that the application site falls within the defined 
Development High Risk Area; the site therefore has been subject to past coal mining 
activity and is located within an area of surface coal resource. 
 
In accordance with the agreed risk-based approach to development management in 
Development High Risk Areas, the past coal mining activities and the presence of surface 
coal resources within the site should be fully considered as part of the Environmental 
Statement (ES) accompanying the Development Consent Order; this should take the form 
of a risk assessment, together with any necessary mitigation measures. 
 
The Coal Authority is therefore pleased to note that the Environmental Impact Assessment 
Scoping Report (June 2014) submitted at section 5.7 proposes the inclusion of a chapter 
 
 
 
Protecting the public and the environment in coal mining areas 
 
2
in the Environmental Statement on geology, ground conditions and agriculture and also 
demonstrates awareness in paragraph 5.7.3 that part of the proposed development site 
has been subject to past coal mining activity. 
 
Consideration of Coal Mining Issues in the ES 
There are a number of coal mining legacy issues that can potentially pose a risk to new 
development and therefore should be considered as part of an Environmental Statement 
for development proposals within coalfield areas: 
 The location and stability of abandoned mine entries 
 The extent and stability of shallow mine workings 
 Outcropping coal seams and unrecorded mine workings 
 Hydrogeology, minewater and minegas 
 
In addition, consideration should be afforded as part of development proposals and the ES 
to the following: 
 If surface coal resources are present, whether prior extraction of the mineral 
resource is practicable and viable 
 Whether Coal Authority permission is required to intersect, enter, or disturb any coal 
or coal workings during site investigation or development work 
 
Coal Mining Information 
Information on these issues can be obtained from The Coal Authority's Property Search 
Services Team (via The Coal Authority’s website) or book an appointment to visit The Coal 
Authority’s Mining Records Centre in Mansfield to view our mining information (Tel: 01623 
637 000). 
 
An assessment of the risks associated with the presence of coal mining legacy issues on a 
proposed development should be prepared by a “competent body”.  Links to the relevant 
professional 
institutions 
of 
competent 
bodies 
can 
be 
found 
at; 
http://coal.decc.gov.uk/en/coal/cms/services/planning/strategy/strategy.aspx 
 
In accordance with our consultation requirements, we look forward to being consulted on 
the Development Consent Order and accompanying Environmental Statement in due 
course. 
 
I trust this is acceptable, please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any additional 
information or would like to discuss this matter further. 
 
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended) – Regulation 8 
 
Application by Abergelli Power Limited for an Order Granting Development Consent for the Abergelli 
Power Project 
 
Scoping Consultation 
 
I refer to your consultation letter received in accordance with the above regulations. We have reviewed 
the documents available at this stage in the process and specifically the Scoping Request received. We 
therefore have the following comments to make.  
 
The application site lies in close proximity to the Lower Lliw Reservoir which supplies Felindre Water 
Treatment Works. The Scoping Request is silent on the potential impact of the development upon the 
water quality within the reservoir, which is approximately 1km from the site. It is therefore 
recommended that the developer explores these issues and undertakes an appropriate air quality 
assessment to consider possible effects to the water in the reservoir from both deposition and affected 
rainfall.  
 
Further to the above, and where relevant, we recommend that the developer considers the impact upon 
any DCWW assets and apparatus and our ability to fulfil statutory obligations. In particular we draw the 
Planning Inspectorate and the developer’s attention to the 48” strategic water main that crosses the 
application site. We would encourage and welcome early dialogue with ourselves to discuss these 
matters. 
  
Notwithstanding the above, we respectfully reserve the right to comment further on any matters and 
issues arising from ongoing and future consultation. However, we trust the above information is helpful 
at this stage and we look forward to continuing our engagement on the project prior and during the 
submission of an application to the Planning Inspectorate.

APPENDIX 3 
PRESENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT 
The 
Infrastructure 
Planning 
(Applications: 
Prescribed 
Forms 
and 
Procedure) Regulations 2009 (SI 2264) (as amended) sets out the 
information which must be provided for an application for a development 
consent order (DCO) for nationally significant infrastructure under the 
Planning Act 2008. Where required, this includes an environmental 
statement. Applicants may also provide any other documents considered 
necessary 
to 
support 
the 
application. 
Information 
which 
is 
not 
environmental information need not be replicated or included in the ES.  
An environmental statement (ES) is described under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2263) 
(as amended) (the EIA Regulations) as a statement: 
a) 
‘that includes such of the information referred to in Part 1 of 
Schedule 4 as is reasonably required to assess the environmental 
effects of the development and of any associated development and 
which the applicant can, having regard in particular to current 
knowledge and methods of assessment, reasonably be required to 
compile; but 
b) 
that includes at least the information required in Part 2 of 
Schedule 4’. 
(EIA Regulations Regulation 2) 
The purpose of an ES is to ensure that the environmental effects of a 
proposed development are fully considered, together with the economic or 
social benefits of the development, before the development consent 
application under the Planning Act 2008 is determined.  The ES should be 
an aid to decision making. 
The SoS advises that the ES should be laid out clearly with a minimum 
amount of technical terms and should provide a clear objective and 
realistic description of the likely significant impacts of the proposed 
development. The information should be presented so as to be 
comprehensible to the specialist and non-specialist alike. The SoS 
recommends that the ES be concise with technical information placed in 
appendices. 
ES Indicative Contents 
The SoS emphasises that the ES should be a ‘stand alone’ document in 
line with best practice and case law. The EIA Regulations Schedule 4, 
Parts 1 and 2, set out the information for inclusion in environmental 
statements.  
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations states this information includes: 
‘17.  
Description of the development, including in particular— 
(a)  
a description of the physical characteristics of the 
whole development and the land-use requirements 
during the construction and operational phases; 
(b)  
a description of the main characteristics of the 
production processes, for instance, nature and quantity 
of the materials used; 
(c)  
an estimate, by type and quantity, of expected 
residues and emissions (water, air and soil pollution, 
noise, vibration, light, heat, radiation, etc) resulting 
from the operation of the proposed development. 
 
18.  
An outline of the main alternatives studied by the applicant 
and an indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s 
choice, taking into account the environmental effects. 
 
19.  
A description of the aspects of the environment likely to be 
significantly affected by the development, including, in 
particular, population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic 
factors, material assets, including the architectural and 
archaeological heritage, landscape and the interrelationship 
between the above factors. 
 
20.  
A description of the likely significant effects of the 
development on the environment, which should cover the 
direct effects and any indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, 
medium and long-term, permanent and temporary, positive 
and negative effects of the development, resulting from: 
(a)  
the existence of the development; 
(b) 
the use of natural resources; 
(c)  
the emission of pollutants, the creation of nuisances 
and the elimination of waste,  
and the description by the applicant of the forecasting 
methods used to assess the effects on the environment. 
 
21.  
A description of the measures envisaged to prevent, reduce 
and where possible offset any significant adverse effects on 
the environment. 
 
22.  
A non-technical summary of the information provided under 
paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Part. 
 
23.  
An indication of any difficulties (technical deficiencies or lack 
of know-how) encountered by the applicant in compiling the 
required information’. 
EIA Regulations Schedule 4 Part 1 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
The content of the ES must include as a minimum those matters set out in 
Schedule 4 Part 2 of the EIA Regulations.  This includes the consideration 
of ‘the main alternatives studied by the applicant’ which the SoS 
recommends could be addressed as a separate chapter in the ES.  Part 2 
is included below for reference: 
Schedule 4 Part 2 
 
A description of the development comprising information on the 
site, design and size of the development 
 
A description of the measures envisaged in order to avoid, reduce 
and, if possible, remedy significant adverse  effects 
 
The data required to identify and assess the main effects which the 
development is likely to have on the environment 
 
An outline of the main alternatives studies by the applicant and an 
indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into 
account the environmental effects, and 
 
A non-technical summary of the information provided [under the 
four paragraphs above]. 
Traffic and transport is not specified as a topic for assessment under 
Schedule 4; although in line with good practice the SoS considers it is an 
important consideration per se, as well as being the source of further 
impacts in terms of air quality and noise and vibration. 
Balance 
The SoS recommends that the ES should be balanced, with matters which 
give rise to a greater number or more significant impacts being given 
greater prominence. Where few or no impacts are identified, the technical 
section may be much shorter, with greater use of information in 
appendices as appropriate. 
The SoS considers that the ES should not be a series of disparate reports 
and stresses the importance of considering inter-relationships between 
factors and cumulative impacts. 
Scheme Proposals  
The scheme parameters will need to be clearly defined in the draft DCO 
and therefore in the accompanying ES which should support the 
application as described. The SoS is not able to entertain material changes 
to a project once an application is submitted. The SoS draws the attention 
of the applicant to the DCLG and the Planning Inspectorate’s published 
advice on the preparation of a draft DCO and accompanying application 
documents. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Flexibility  
The SoS acknowledges that the EIA process is iterative, and therefore the 
proposals may change and evolve. For example, there may be changes to 
the scheme design in response to consultation. Such changes should be 
addressed in the ES. However, at the time of the application for a DCO, 
any proposed scheme parameters should not be so wide ranging as to 
represent effectively different schemes. 
It is a matter for the applicant, in preparing an ES, to consider whether it 
is possible to assess robustly a range of impacts resulting from a large 
number of undecided parameters. The description of the proposed 
development in the ES must not be so wide that it is insufficiently certain 
to comply with requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the 
EIA Regulations. 
The Rochdale Envelope principle (see R v Rochdale MBC ex parte Tew 
(1999) and R v Rochdale MBC ex parte Milne (2000)) is an accepted way 
of dealing with uncertainty in preparing development applications. The 
applicant’s attention is drawn to the Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 9 
‘Rochdale Envelope’ which is available on the Advice Note’s page of the 
National Infrastructure Planning website.  
The applicant should make every attempt to narrow the range of options 
and explain clearly in the ES which elements of the scheme have yet to be 
finalised and provide the reasons. Where some flexibility is sought and the 
precise details are not known, the applicant should assess the maximum 
potential adverse impacts the project could have to ensure that the 
project as it may be constructed has been properly assessed.  
The ES should be able to confirm that any changes to the development 
within any proposed parameters would not result in significant impacts not 
previously identified and assessed. The maximum and other dimensions of 
the proposed development should be clearly described in the ES, with 
appropriate justification. It will also be important to consider choice of 
materials, colour and the form of the structures and of any buildings. 
Lighting proposals should also be described. 
Scope 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas should be 
identified under all the environmental topics and should be sufficiently 
robust in order to undertake the assessment. The extent of the study 
areas should be on the basis of recognised professional guidance, 
whenever such guidance is available. The study areas should also be 
agreed with the relevant consultees and local authorities and, where this 
is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the ES and a reasoned 
justification given. The scope should also cover the breadth of the topic 
area and the temporal scope, and these aspects should be described and 
justified. 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Physical Scope 
In general the SoS recommends that the physical scope for the EIA should 
be determined in the light of: 
 
the nature of the proposal being considered 
 
the relevance in terms of the specialist topic  
 
the breadth of the topic 
 
the physical extent of any surveys or the study area, and 
 
the potential significant impacts. 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas should be 
identified for each of the environmental topics and should be sufficiently 
robust in order to undertake the assessment. This should include at least 
the whole of the application site, and include all offsite works. For certain 
topics, such as landscape and transport, the study area will need to be 
wider. The extent of the study areas should be on the basis of recognised 
professional guidance and best practice, whenever this is available, and 
determined by establishing the physical extent of the likely impacts. The 
study areas should also be agreed with the relevant consultees and, 
where this is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the ES and a 
reasoned justification given.  
Breadth of the Topic Area 
The ES should explain the range of matters to be considered under each 
topic and this may respond partly to the type of project being considered.  
If the range considered is drawn narrowly then a justification for the 
approach should be provided. 
Temporal Scope 
The assessment should consider: 
 
environmental impacts during construction works 
 
environmental impacts on completion/operation of the proposed 
development 
 
where appropriate, environmental impacts a suitable number of 
years after completion of the proposed development (for example, in 
order to allow for traffic growth or maturing of any landscape 
proposals), and 
 
environmental impacts during decommissioning. 
In terms of decommissioning, the SoS acknowledges that the further into 
the future any assessment is made, the less reliance may be placed on 
the outcome. However, the purpose of such a long term assessment, as 
well as to enable the decommissioning of the works to be taken into 
account, is to encourage early consideration as to how structures can be 
taken down. The purpose of this is to seek to minimise disruption, to re-
use materials and to restore the site or put it to a suitable new use. The 
SoS encourages consideration of such matters in the ES. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
The SoS recommends that these matters should be set out clearly in the 
ES and that the suitable time period for the assessment should be agreed 
with the relevant statutory consultees.  
The SoS recommends that throughout the ES a standard terminology for 
time periods should be defined, such that for example, ‘short term’ always 
refers to the same period of time.   
Baseline 
The SoS recommends that the baseline should describe the position from 
which the impacts of the proposed development are measured. The 
baseline should be chosen carefully and, whenever possible, be consistent 
between topics. The identification of a single baseline is to be welcomed in 
terms of the approach to the assessment, although it is recognised that 
this may not always be possible. 
The SoS recommends that the baseline environment should be clearly 
explained in the ES, including any dates of surveys, and care should be 
taken to ensure that all the baseline data remains relevant and up to date.  
For each of the environmental topics, the data source(s) for the baseline 
should be set out together with any survey work undertaken with the 
dates.  The timing and scope of all surveys should be agreed with the 
relevant statutory bodies and appropriate consultees, wherever possible.   
The baseline situation and the proposed development should be described 
within the context of the site and any other proposals in the vicinity. 
Identification of Impacts and Method Statement 
Legislation and Guidelines 
In terms of the EIA methodology, the SoS recommends that reference 
should be made to best practice and any standards, guidelines and 
legislation that have been used to inform the assessment. This should 
include guidelines prepared by relevant professional bodies. 
In terms of other regulatory regimes, the SoS recommends that relevant 
legislation and all permit and licences required should be listed in the ES 
where relevant to each topic. This information should also be submitted 
with the application in accordance with the APFP Regulations. 
In terms of assessing the impacts, the ES should approach all relevant 
planning and environmental policy – local, regional and national (and 
where appropriate international) – in a consistent manner. 
Assessment of Effects and Impact Significance 
The EIA Regulations require the identification of the ‘likely significant 
effects of the development on the environment’ (Schedule 4 Part 1 
paragraph 20). 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
As a matter of principle, the SoS applies the precautionary approach to 
follow the Court’s4 reasoning in judging ‘significant effects’. In other words 
‘likely to affect’ will be taken as meaning that there is a probability or risk 
that the proposed development will have an effect, and not that a 
development will definitely have an effect. 
The SoS considers it is imperative for the ES to define the meaning of 
‘significant’ in the context of each of the specialist topics and for 
significant impacts to be clearly identified. The SoS recommends that the 
criteria should be set out fully and that the ES should set out clearly the 
interpretation of ‘significant’ in terms of each of the EIA topics. 
Quantitative criteria should be used where available. The SoS considers 
that this should also apply to the consideration of cumulative impacts and 
impact inter-relationships. 
The SoS recognises that the way in which each element of the 
environment may be affected by the proposed development can be 
approached in a number of ways. However it considers that it would be 
helpful, in terms of ease of understanding and in terms of clarity of 
presentation, to consider the impact assessment in a similar manner for 
each of the specialist topic areas. The SoS recommends that a common 
format should be applied where possible.  
Inter-relationships between environmental factors 
The inter-relationship between aspects of the environments likely to be 
significantly affected is a requirement of the EIA Regulations (see 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations). These occur where a number of 
separate impacts, e.g. noise and air quality, affect a single receptor such 
as fauna. 
The SoS considers that the inter-relationships between factors must be 
assessed in order to address the environmental impacts of the proposal as 
a whole. This will help to ensure that the ES is not a series of separate 
reports collated into one document, but rather a comprehensive 
assessment drawing together the environmental impacts of the proposed 
development. This is particularly important when considering impacts in 
terms of any permutations or parameters to the proposed development. 
Cumulative Impacts  
The potential cumulative impacts with other major developments will need 
to be identified, as required by the Directive. The significance of such 
impacts should be shown to have been assessed against the baseline 
position (which would include built and operational development).  
                                       
4 See Landelijke Vereniging tot Behoud van de Waddenzee and Nederlandse 
Vereniging tot Bescherming van  Vogels v Staatssecretris van Landbouw 
(Waddenzee Case No C 127/02/2004) 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
In assessing cumulative impacts, other major development should be 
identified through consultation with the local planning authorities and 
other relevant authorities on the basis of those that are: 
 
projects that are under construction 
 
permitted application(s) not yet implemented 
 
submitted application(s) not yet determined  
 
all refusals subject to appeal procedures not yet determined  
 
projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects, and 
 
projects identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging 
development plans - with appropriate weight being given as they 
move closer to adoption) recognising that much information on any 
relevant proposals will be limited. 
Details should be provided in the ES, including the types of development, 
location and key aspects that may affect the EIA and how these have been 
taken into account as part of the assessment.   
The SoS recommends that offshore wind farms should also take account 
of any offshore licensed and consented activities in the area, for the 
purposes of assessing cumulative effects, through consultation with the 
relevant licensing/consenting bodies. 
For the purposes of identifying any cumulative effects with other 
developments in the area, applicants should also consult consenting 
bodies in other EU states to assist in identifying those developments (see 
commentary on Transboundary Effects below). 
Related Development 
The ES should give equal prominence to any development which is related 
with the proposed development to ensure that all the impacts of the 
proposal are assessed.   
The SoS recommends that the applicant should distinguish between the 
proposed development for which development consent will be sought and 
any other development. This distinction should be clear in the ES.  
Alternatives 
The ES must set out an outline of the main alternatives studied by the 
applicant and provide an indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s 
choice, taking account of the environmental effect (Schedule 4 Part 1 
paragraph 18). 
Matters should be included, such as inter alia alternative design options 
and alternative mitigation measures. The justification for the final choice 
and evolution of the scheme development should be made clear.  Where 
other sites have been considered, the reasons for the final choice should 
be addressed. 
  
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
The SoS advises that the ES should give sufficient attention to the 
alternative forms and locations for the off-site proposals, where 
appropriate, and justify the needs and choices made in terms of the form 
of the development proposed and the sites chosen. 
Mitigation Measures  
Mitigation measures may fall into certain categories namely: avoid; 
reduce; compensate or enhance (see Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 21); 
and should be identified as such in the specialist topics. Mitigation 
measures should not be developed in isolation as they may relate to more 
than one topic area. For each topic, the ES should set out any mitigation 
measures required to prevent, reduce and where possible offset any 
significant adverse effects, and to identify any residual effects with 
mitigation in place. Any proposed mitigation should be discussed and 
agreed with the relevant consultees. 
The effectiveness of mitigation should be apparent. Only mitigation 
measures which are a firm commitment and can be shown to be 
deliverable should be taken into account as part of the assessment. 
It would be helpful if the mitigation measures proposed could be cross 
referred to specific provisions and/or requirements proposed within the 
draft development consent order. This could be achieved by means of 
describing the mitigation measures proposed either in each of the 
specialist reports or collating these within a summary section on 
mitigation. 
The SoS advises that it is considered best practice to outline in the ES, the 
structure of the environmental management and monitoring plan and 
safety procedures which will be adopted during construction and operation 
and may be adopted during decommissioning. 
Cross References and Interactions 
The SoS recommends that all the specialist topics in the ES should cross 
reference their text to other relevant disciplines. Interactions between the 
specialist topics is essential to the production of a robust assessment, as 
the ES should not be a collection of separate specialist topics, but a 
comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposal 
and how these impacts can be mitigated. 
As set out in EIA Regulations Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 23, the ES 
should include an indication of any technical difficulties (technical 
deficiencies or lack of know-how) encountered by the applicant in 
compiling the required information. 
Consultation 
The SoS recommends that any changes to the scheme design in response 
to consultation should be addressed in the ES. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
It is recommended that the applicant provides preliminary environmental 
information (PEI) (this term is defined in the EIA Regulations under 
regulation 2 ‘Interpretation’) to the local authorities.  
Consultation with the local community should be carried out in accordance 
with the SoCC which will state how the applicant intends to consult on the 
preliminary environmental information (PEI). This PEI could include results 
of detailed surveys and recommended mitigation actions. Where effective 
consultation is carried out in accordance with Section 47 of the Planning 
Act, this could usefully assist the applicant in the EIA process – for 
example the local community may be able to identify possible mitigation 
measures to address the impacts identified in the PEI. Attention is drawn 
to the duty upon applicants under Section 50 of the Planning Act to have 
regard to the guidance on pre-application consultation. 
Transboundary Effects 
The SoS recommends that consideration should be given in the ES to any 
likely significant effects on the environment of another Member State of 
the European Economic Area. In particular, the SoS recommends 
consideration should be given to discharges to the air and water and to 
potential impacts on migratory species and to impacts on shipping and 
fishing areas.  
The Applicant’s attention is also drawn to the Planning Inspectorate’s 
Advice Note 12 ‘Development with significant transboundary impacts 
consultation’ which is available on the Advice Notes Page of the National 
Infrastructure Planning website 
Summary Tables 
The SoS recommends that in order to assist the decision making process, 
the applicant may wish to consider the use of tables: 
Table X 
to identify and collate the residual impacts after mitigation on 
the 
basis 
of 
specialist 
topics, 
inter-relationships 
and 
cumulative impacts. 
Table XX 
to demonstrate how the assessment has taken account of 
this Opinion and other responses to consultation.  
Table XXX to set out the mitigation measures proposed, as well as 
assisting the reader, the SoS considers that this would also 
enable the applicant to cross refer mitigation to specific 
provisions proposed to be 
included 
within 
the 
draft 
Development Consent Order. 
Table XXXX to cross reference where details in the HRA (where one is 
provided) such as descriptions of sites and their locations, 
together with any mitigation or compensation measures, are 
to be found in the ES. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Terminology and Glossary of Technical Terms 
The SoS recommends that a common terminology should be adopted. This 
will help to ensure consistency and ease of understanding for the decision 
making process. For example, ‘the site’ should be defined and used only in 
terms of this definition so as to avoid confusion with, for example, the 
wider site area or the surrounding site.  
A glossary of technical terms should be included in the ES.  
Presentation 
The ES should have all of its paragraphs numbered, as this makes 
referencing easier as well as accurate.  
Appendices must be clearly referenced, again with all paragraphs 
numbered.  
All figures and drawings, photographs and photomontages should be 
clearly referenced.  Figures should clearly show the proposed site 
application boundary. 
Bibliography 
A bibliography should be included in the ES. The author, date and 
publication title should be included for all references.  All publications 
referred to within the technical reports should be included. 
Non Technical Summary 
The EIA Regulations require a Non Technical Summary (EIA Regulations 
Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 22). This should be a summary of the 
assessment in simple language. It should be supported by appropriate 
figures, photographs and photomontages.

 Between March 2015 when the Project was ‘put on hold’ and the submission of the DCO in May 2018 the Project was subject to 
further design refinements as a result of updated environmental assessments and in response to consultation feedback.  
 
Notes provided in the column titled “Notes following Phase 2 Consultation (2018)” are given where the Project response to 
comments and feedback should be differentiated from or updated from the 2014 response due to the evolution of the Project, or 
updates in Policy and Guidance.

One comment strongly opposes 
the location of the proposed gas 
fired power plant, stating they 
live approximately 500 metres 
from the proposed site and are 
concerned about the emissions 
and also the noise levels 
(s42d). 
Another 
comment 
further 
states 
that 
this 
development is of great concern 
as it is located 500m from their 
property 
at 
Cefn 
Betingau 
(s42d). 
As explained in the ES, APL undertook a 
detailed site assessment in the initial 
phase of the Project from 2010-2013, 
during which period a range of sites 
around the UK were studied as to their 
suitability for a flexible gas-fired power 
station. 
This process identified that the site had 
the following key advantages: 
 
 It is in close proximity to a suitable 
electrical connection point; 
 It is in close proximity to a suitable 
gas connection point; 
 The Project Site does not include any 
nationally important environmental 
designations; 
 The land available is of an adequate

A noise assessment has been carried out 
as part of the EIA and the findings are

noise assessment predicts that there will 
be no significant residual effects from the 
operation of the Project.  Embedded 
mitigation measures will ensure that 
potential adverse impacts resulting from 
the Project are negligible and therefore 
not significant.

Two comments refer to the 
health and safety concerns 
regarding the selection of this 
site.  One of these comments 
states that the positioning of the 
development will have serious 
health 
issues 
for 
the 
surrounding properties due to 
the co2 emissions, particularly 
during high pressure weather 
conditions (s42d).  The other

Gas fired power stations have been 
operating safely in the UK for the last 30 
years. Some of these plants have 
operated in very close proximity to 
hospitals and residential populations. 
One comment states that the 
loss of agricultural land that 
has been in production for 
hundreds of years should not 
be allowed unless food 
production and the 
development can be managed 
alongside each other (s42d). 
An assessment of the likely impacts of the 
Project on geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology has been carried out 
as part of the EIA and the findings are 
presented in chapter 10 of the ES 
(Document 
Reference 
6.1). 
 
The 
assessment states that whilst there will be 
a 
negligible 
adverse 
impact 
on 
agricultural land, the agricultural land 
within and surrounding the Project Site is 
of a poor quality and therefore the 
importance 
of 
this

for 
assessment purposes is low.

were studied as to their suitability for a 
flexible gas-fired power station.  A 
number of key factors were considered in 
the site selection process including 
environmental factors and the need to 
avoid sterilisation of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land.  The Project 
Site is on poor quality agricultural land; 
based on this and other environmental, 
technical and economic considerations, a 
suitably sized site within Abergelli Farm 
was identified in 2013 and found likely to 
be suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station. 
Abergelli 
Farm 
has 
a 
history 
of 
commercial and industrial uses, including 
Abergelli Colliery and a landfill site.  The 
area surrounding the Project Site will 
continue to change over the next few 
years as demonstrated by the list of 
Projects with planning permission listed in 
Chapter 4 of the ES.  These include a 
number of renewable energy projects.

for food production (grazing of sheep 
only). 
Three comments refer to the 
consideration of other 
alternatives. One of such 
comments states that 
consideration of alternatives 
(including alternative sites, 
choice of process, and the 
phasing of construction) is 
widely regarded as good 
practice. Ideally, EIA should 
start at the stage of site and 
process selection, so that the 
environmental merits of 
practicable alternatives can be 
properly considered. Where 
this is undertaken, the main 
alternatives considered should 
be outlined in the ES (s42a).  
APL has considered alternatives in the 
selection of the Project Site, Generating 
Equipment 
technology 
options, 
Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection.  
Consideration of alternatives is set out in 
chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1). 
In respect of site alternatives, the ex-
British Steel Works site was considered 
by APL, but the local authority have plans 
for this site and suggested that APL look 
at alternative sites in the area.  Allocated 
employment land at Felindre Strategic 
Business Park, located approximately 1.5 
km to the south-west of the Project Site, 
is a brownfield site which possesses 
excellent accessibility and other features 
that will enable it to provide a valuable 
economic role in the locality and region, 
and is both designated for, and likely to 
be very attractive to, employment uses at 
this stage of its development. Therefore it 
is considered by the Applicant and CCS

to be a less appropriate site for the 
Project than the site selected. 
 
One comment states that there 
does not appear to be any 
evidence presented on the 
consideration of alternative 
sites for the power generation 
plant - this should be included 
in the EIA.   
 
One comment states that there 
is a far more suitable 
brownfield site approximately 
800 m to the north-west. This 
alternative site is closer to the 
gas pipeline and the electrical 
connections are still accessible 
and closer to the main 
entrance to Abergelli Farm 
(s42d). 
 
 
 
 
APL has fully considered alternatives in 
the selection of the Project Site, as set out 
in chapter 5 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).   
APL 
undertook 
a 
detailed 
site 
assessment in the initial phase of the 
Project from 2010-2013, during which 
period a range of sites around the UK 
were studied as to their suitability for a

number of key factors were considered in 
the site selection process: technical (e.g. 
the size of the site and the proximity to 
appropriate gas and electrical connection 
points), environmental, economic, and 
whether the proposals would be in line 
with local planning policy.  On such basis 
a suitably sized site within Abergelli Farm 
was identified in 2013 and found likely to 
be suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station.

One comment states that the 
proximity of a gas installation 
within close proximity of a 
hospital, schools, and houses 
will be an economic cost to 
people living in its immediate 
vicinity, due to the impact on 
property values (s42d).

Project and had regard to these when 
deciding on the red line boundary of the 
Project. 
See 
the

namely it is proposed to build a 
power station in what is 
effectively Green Belt land.  
You are proposing to further 
decimate the few green spaces

the 
quantities 
of 
'dangerous' substances stored at the 
plant do not meet the lower thresholds 
which require implementation of the

Accident Hazards); instead the plant is 
subject only to national legislation (e.g. 
occupational 
safety 
and 
health

 Clinical Commissioning 
Groups, NHS 
commissioning Boards and 
Local Planning Authority for 
matters relating to wider 
public health (s42a). 
As explained in chapter 15 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), the likely 
significant effects on human health 
regarding air quality from construction 
and decommissioning of the Project 
relate 
to 
dust/particulate 
matter 
generated from construction activities. 
With the implementation of dust control 
measures 
through 
the 
Outline 
Construction 
Environmental 
Management Plan the effects of the 
Project are predicted to be negligible or 
low and not significant.  The main likely 
significant effects on human health in 
relation to air quality arising from 
operation of the Project are associated 
with the stack emissions. However, 
modern gas-fired power plants are 
inherently clean and produce far fewer 
emissions than other fossil fuel power 
plants (e.g. coal) when compared on an 
energy output basis.  The stack height 
has been designed to ensure that there 
are no significant effects on human 
health.

generally acceptable when 
there is sufficient headroom 
such that the uncertainties 
involved are unlikely to make a 
significant difference to

acknowledge that critical loads 
at nearby habitats are already 
exceeded, therefore there is 
little headroom. Without further 
work NRW cannot comment on 
whether this methodology is a 
“worst case” approach. NRW 
would expect you to justify that 
your assessment is 
 The 
air 
quality 
assessment 
has 
assessed long term impacts by scaling 
the outputs for periods longer than one 
hour by the worst-case operating hours, 
2,250 per year*. This in turn meant that 
annual mean impacts were based on 
2,250 hours out of 8760 hours.  This 
approach is considered to represent a 
likely 
worst 
case, 
although 
it 
is 
acknowledged that this not the absolute 
“worst case” which would see the plant 
modeled as operating during the absolute

has such a low probability of occurring

make 
reference 
to 
a 
previous 
assessment of a peaking plant, operating 
at 1500 hours per year, in Wales. As part 
of that assessment potential impacts of 
different combinations of operating hours 
over the 5 years of meteorological data 
were tested to address NRW concerns 
over the scaling of long term impacts. The 
overall conclusions of the statistical test 
was that the scaling of long term impacts 
can result in +/- 10% difference in 
concentrations at the 99th Percentile 
level. Applying this conclusions to the 
predicted results presented in the air 
quality assessment for the Abergelli

conclusions of the assessment are 
robust. 
One comment states that the 
PEIR refers to monitoring of 
emissions as mitigation for the 
slight adverse effects on air 
quality during construction, 
operation and 
decommissioning.  Monitoring 
is not considered to be 
mitigation, therefore what 
additional mitigation measures 
are proposed? (a&d) 
The project has a number of embedded 
mitigations measures including a site 
specific Dust Management Plan (DMP) 
that forms part of the Construction 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(CEMP). The monitoring of construction 
emissions will form part of the DMP to 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures included in the DMP are 
applied proportionally and at a timely 
manner including damping down of dusty 
surfaces, imposing speed limits for 
vehicles, covering stock piles etc. etc. 
Furthermore 
ambient 
air 
monitoring 
during 
construction 
is 
a 
mitigation 
measure as an operator can set alarm 
levels to prevent emissions exceeding 
potentially significant levels.  During 
operation, real time stack monitoring can 
also be considered mitigation as any 
increases in emissions concentrations 
can be identified.  Furthermore the stack 
sensitivity assessment, included in the 
assessment 
ensured

One comment states that for all 
SSSIs within at least 2 km, and 
all SACs/SPAs/Ramsar sites 
within 10km of the proposed 
plant, the following information 
should be included within the 
ES - concentrations of NOx 
(and SO2 if present in 
emissions) emitted by the 
proposed plant compared to 
the critical levels for sensitive 
habitats at the above sites; 
proposed plant emissions 
(Process Contribution/PC) 
should be compared as a 
percentage of the relevant 
critical level as well being 
compared to the PC added to 
the background (PEC); levels 
of nutrient Nitrogen deposition 
and Acid deposition derived 
from the proposed plant (PC) 
should also be compared to 
A 
number 
of 
SSSI’s 
and 
SACs/SPAs/Ramsar sites are within the 
vicinity of the Project Site. Information on 
emission concentrations, comparisons 
with critical levels, and levels of acid an 
nitrogen deposition are contained within 
chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference

The PEIR outlines that at each

level is predicted to range 
between 40 dB to 47 dB LAeq 
which would result in a major 
noise impact at the receptor 
locations - however no

One comment states that slight 
and minor adverse effects are 
predicted at sensitive receptors 
during the construction phase 
of the project, and the 
proposed mitigation is site 
hoarding to mask the activities 
- will this afford any real 
mitigation against the 
increased noise levels? 
 
 
Construction noise mitigation measures 
are set out in the Outline CEMP. The 
results of the ES construction noise 
predictions are set out in ES Chapter 7.  
The site hoarding will provide a moderate 
level of noise reduction to low level 
receptors (Document References 6.1 and 
6.2). 
 
One comment which states 
that increased noise levels are 
likely to be perceived during 
start-up, and asks what levels 
are likely above background 
and how will this be mitigated? 
 
The noise assessment is presented in 
Chapter 7 of the ES. A +3 decibel (dB) 
correction factor is incorporated into the 
assessment to account for potentially 
distinctive character (see Section 7.7 of 
Chapter 7). 
 
The assessment demonstrates that noise 
effects as a result of the operation of the 
Project are not significant, and therefore

no further mitigation or monitoring is

One comment stated that the 
predicted habitat losses should 
be quantified in the ES - this is 
particularly important when 
agreeing a 
mitigation/compensation (a&d) 
Habitat losses for all Valued Ecological 
Receptors have been quantified in 
chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference

One comment advises that 
further detail is provided in the 
ES in relation to the discharge 
characteristics (with particular 
regards to temperature and 
chemical composition) of any 
cooling/process waters upon 
the above watercourses in 
order to assess any offsite 
environmental impact (a&d). 
 
As explained in Chapter 3 and 9 of the 
ES, no process waters will be discharged 
at the site. Wastewater to be generated 
from the Project Site has been considered 
in the embedded mitigation (Section 3.11 
in ES Chapter 3, Document Reference 
6.1). No discharge of process water to 
nearby water receptors is planned as all 
process wastewater will be taken off-site 
via a tanker to an appropriate wastewater 
treatment 
facility 
by 
specialist 
contractors.

changed river crossings, 
should be undertaken (a&d). 
The assessment of water quality and 
resources (ES Chapter 9) incorporates 
WFD assessment and concludes the

The WFD screening assessment is an 
appendix to the 2018 ES Appendix 9.2

One comment notes that the 
electric fields produced by the 
proposed new underground 
cables have been considered 
within the Report; however, 
such cables will also produce 
magnetic fields, which will not

therefore an assessment of the

Table 7.9 there is reference to 
‘slight adverse’ effects but it is 
unclear whether this is referring 
to ‘minor adverse’ effects 
specified in Table 7.4 above. 
There is no justification as to 
why the sound levels from the

may be injuriously affected by the Project 
during construction and / or operation, the

gain from construction would 
be short-lived - in practice 
there is very limited scope for 
job creation because skilled

One comment states that a 
tonal assessment was 
expected to be carried out in 
tandem with the noise survey 
(a&d). 
The noise assessment is presented in 
Chapter 
7 
of 
the 
ES 
(Document 
Reference 6.1). Detailed baseline sound 
monitoring was undertaken between 15 
and 
22 
February 
2018.  
Robust 
representative baseline ambient and 
background sound levels have been 
derived from the results by filtering for 
appropriate 
weather 
conditions 
and 
statistical analysis of filtered data. 
Corrections for tonality, impulsivity, and 
intermittency have not been applied on 
the assumption that these potential 
features would be designed out of the 
Project during the detailed design phase 
by the selection of appropriate plant, 
building cladding louvres and 
silencers/attenuators. However, for the 
daytime BS 4142 assessment a +3 dB 
correction has been applied to the 
specific noise levels predicted from the 
Project Site on the basis that the noise 
emissions may be distinctive above the

residual acoustic environment. This is 
considered conservative in the context of 
the prevailing noise environment, which 
includes road traffic, the existing 
electrical infrastructure and agricultural 
equipment. 
One comment states that slight 
and minor adverse effects are 
predicted at sensitive receptors 
during the construction phase 
of the project, and the 
proposed mitigation is site 
hoarding to mask the activities 
- will this afford any real 
mitigation against the 
increased noise levels? 
 
Construction noise mitigation measures 
are set out in the noise CEMP. The 
results 
of 
the 
construction 
noise 
predictions are set out in Tables 7.16 to 
7.19 of ES Chapter 7 (Document 
Reference 6.1).  The site hoarding will 
provide a moderate level of noise 
reduction to low level receptors. 
 
One comment states that it 
should be explained why a 30 
minute sample which covered 
a 24 hour period is believed to 
be representative to suggest 
that the sound was stable and 
not fluctuating. 
The ambient noise survey methodology 
was discussed and agreed with the 
Environmental Protection officer at CCS 
prior to commencing the works. Short 
term sampling coupled with long term 
measurements are a standard method 
employed 
when 
access 
or 
safety 
precludes long term measurements at all 
locations.*

limited measurements in 2013 which 
were subject to the influence of both short

inappropriate wind directions for some of

are that the detailed survey resulted in 
higher representative background sound 
levels at NSRs 1 and 6 and lower ambient 
levels at NSR 4.  As a result the

Three comments make 
reference to the PEIR. These

One comment identifies that in 
addition to the consideration of 
the potential impacts on human 
receptors from emissions to air

PEIR refers to monitoring of 
emissions as mitigation for the 
slight adverse effects on air 
quality during construction,

is not considered to be 
mitigation, therefore what 
additional mitigation measures 
are proposed? (a&d).

from emissions due to 
construction and 
decommissioning should

all receptors and describe 
monitoring and mitigation

Construction and 
decommissioning will be

construction is assessed qualitatively

One comment states that the 
application site lies in close 
proximity to the Lower Lliw 
Reservoir which supplies 
Felindre Water Treatment 
Works. The documentation 
refers to this reservoir as an 
emergency supply.  The 
proposed development has the 
potential to impact upon the 
water quality within the 
reservoir - therefore 
recommended that an 
appropriate air quality 
assessment is undertaken to 
consider possible effects to the 
water in the reservoir from both 
deposition and affected rainfall.  
The reservoir should be 
considered as a main receptor 
in the air quality change 
modelling (a&d). 
An assessment of the likely significant 
effects of the Project in respect of air 
quality has been undertaken as part of the 
EIA and the findings are recorded in the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
As explained in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the Lower Lliw Reservoir 
is an emergency reservoir. It is not 
possible to assess deposition on water 
and therefore assessing deposition on 
the reservoir could not be undertaken. 
However as the Project is a gas power 
station the only relevant pollutant is NOX 
and no metal deposition is expected.

predictions by operating hours 
is a methodology that is 
generally acceptable when 
there is sufficient headroom 
such that the uncertainties 
involved are unlikely to make a 
significant difference to 
predictions. In this case you 
acknowledge that critical loads 
at nearby habitats are already 
exceeded, therefore there is 
little headroom. Without further 
work NRW cannot comment on 
whether this methodology is a 
“worst case” approach. NRW 
would expect you to justify that

for periods longer than one hour by the 
worst-case operating hours, 2,250 per 
year*. This in turn meant that annual 
mean impacts were based on 2,250 hours 
out of 8760 hours.  This approach is 
considered to represent a likely worst 
case, although it is acknowledged that 
this not the absolute “worst case” which 
would see the plant modeled as operating 
during the absolute worst 2,250 hours 
each year however this has such a low 
probability of occurring that it is not 
relevant to the assessment of chronic or 
long term ecological effects. NRW 
acknowledges that factoring long term 
prediction by operating hours is a 
methodology that is generally acceptable. 
In order to address NRW concerns over 
the scaling of long term predictions, we 
make 
reference 
to 
a 
previous 
assessment of a peaking plant, operating 
at 1500 hours per year, in Wales. As part 
of that assessment potential impacts of 
different combinations of operating hours 
over the 5 years of meteorological data 
were tested to address NRW concerns 
over the scaling of long term impacts. The

was that the scaling of long term impacts 
can result  in +/- 10% difference in 
concentrations at the 99th Percentile 
level. Applying this conclusions to the 
predicted results presented in the air 
quality assessment for the Abergelli 
Power Project  and particularly on the 
most affected receptor (ie Rhyd-Y-Pandy 
Valley and Grasslands SINC) will mean 
that the Process Contribution from the 
proposed stack will change from 0.0071 
to 0.0078 kg N/ha/yr which when 
compared to the minimum critical load for 
nitrogen deposition is a change from 
0.071% of the minimum critical load to 
0.078% of the minimum critical load.  This 
difference is not significant and the 
conclusions of the assessment are 
robust.

One comment states that in 
order to ‘scope out’ impacts on 
the Gower AONB and Brecon 
Beacons National Park, it 
would be helpful to provide 
photographs from viewpoints 
within these designations and 
within the 15km study area 
(a&d). 
The 15 km ZTV (ES Figure 11.8, 
Document Reference 6.3) shows that 
there will be no theoretical visibility from 
any part of the National Park. NRW 
confirmed by email on the 4th December 
2017 that a viewpoint in the Brecon 
Beacons National Park would not be 
necessary 
(see 
ES 
Chapter 
11, 
Document Reference 6.1). The ZTV also 
demonstrates limited to no theoretical 
visibility from the Gower AONB. ES 
Chapter 11 confirms that the Gower 
AONB would not experience significant 
effects due to the intervening distance, 
vegetation and built form.  
 
 
One comment states that the 
assessment of landscape 
character and sensitivity should 
consider information from all 
five aspect areas, not only the 
visual and sensory aspect 
areas. As well as the overall 
evaluation for each aspect, the 
rarity/uniqueness evaluation for 
APL has noted this comment. All 5 Aspect 
Areas are now detailed and mapped in an

information states that there 
are views of the site from the

One comment states that if a 
landscaping scheme is 
proposed as part of the 
proposal, we request that only 
slow and low growing species 
of trees and shrubs are planted 
beneath and adjacent to the 
existing overhead line to 
reduce the risk of growth to a 
height which compromises 
statutory safety clearances 
(s42a). 
 
This is identified in the Outline Landscape 
Mitigation Strategy (Figure 11.10 of the

work should not be undertaken if it has 
the potential to disturb or adversely affect 
the foundations of an existing tower.

One comment would welcome 
further justification if the final 
location for the Generating 
Equipment Site and Temporary 
Laydown Area is decided to be 
on an area of marshy 
grassland (also known as 
Purple moorgrass and rush 
pasture), and why it cannot be 
located on areas of improved 
grassland, which would be less 
ecologically damaging (a&d). 
The Temporary Laydown Area is situated 
within a field of improved grassland, 
whilst the Generating Equipment Site is 
situated partially within fields of improved 
and semi-improved grasslands and two 
fields of marshy grasslands.  The loss of 
this habitat could not be avoided, 
however suitable mitigation measures will 
be provided to replace the habitat lost.

One comment states that 
further consultation with NRW

to watercourses and wetland 
habitats and their associated 
species before detailed site 
layout plans are drawn up and

One comment states that 
access option one would result 
in some habitat losses to Sites 
of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) through 
road widening. Option two 
would also result in habitat 
losses, but to a greater extent. 
The losses resulting from 
option two would result in 
permanent loss of ancient 
woodland which cannot be 
mitigated (a&d). 
Following statutory consultation, APL 
continued to engage in discussions with 
National Grid about the use of its road, 
and subsequently reached an agreement 
to propose Option 2 (access from the 
B4489) as the Access Road.   
Only one option has been taken forward 
and assessed in the ES (Document

One comment states that NRW 
note that there has already

and that the remaining 
woodland on and around the 
site was reclassified as 
Plantations on Ancient

One comment states that we

long-term management of the 
identified invasive species on 
site. Japanese Knotweed is 
classed as controlled waste 
under the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 and as 
such must be disposed of in a 
suitable manner (a&d). 
The ES (Chapter 8) identifies where 
invasive species will be directly affected

One comment states that the 
details of the watervole survey 
in the PEIR Appendix appear 
to be inconclusive as to 
whether there are water voles 
on site. The surveys found no 
signs of recent activity but 
there was suitable habitat and 
hole.  We would recommend 
that further watervole surveys 
are carried out in May when 
the voles are very active (a&d). 
Furthermore, one comment 
states that protection and 
enhancement of suitable 
watervole habitat on site will be 
an important mitigation 
measure which we would like 
to discuss further in the future 
when detailed plans for the 
development are being 
considered (a&d). 
The

survey 
found 
no 
conclusive evidence of water voles but 
that suitable habitat is present on site.

the suggestion that 
Rhydypandy Road is used as 
the access route to the 
proposed site is a recipe for 
disaster.  It is too narrow to

One comment objects to the 
possible use of the 
Rhydypandy Road route for 
site access.  It is also the direct 
access route for emergency 
vehicles to/from Morriston 
Hospital.  It is a narrow and 
circuitous country lane. Any

150m or more; however, 
structures of a lesser height 
may need aviation obstruction 
lighting if they are considered 
to be of a significant 
navigational hazard by virtue of 
their location and nature.  In 
this case, given the maximum 
stack height of 40m, CAA 
confirm that it would not in

One comment assumes that 
the facility is not intended to 
vent or flare gas either 
routinely or as an emergency 
procedure such as to cause a 
danger to overlying aircraft 
(s42a). 
APL has noted this comment.  
The Generating Equipment would not 
have a flare stack, as used in industrial 
plants such as chemical or natural gas 
processing plants. In such plants, flare 
stacks are used for burning off gas during 
unplanned 
over-pressuring 
of 
plant 
equipment. Gas is used to power turbines 
and generate electricity in a controlled 
environment. No venting or flaring of gas 
is therefore required either routinely or as 
an emergency procedure.

One comment notes there is a 
civil aviation requirement in the 
UK for all structures over 300ft 
(91.4m) high to be charted on 
aviation maps. As the 
maximum stack height is 40m, 
there is no civil aviation 
charting requirement; however, 
if crane usage in the

heights of 300ft, the temporary 
structure will need to be

Reference 6.1) which accompanies the 
Application. The ES states that, following 
the

of 
appropriate 
mitigation measures, there will be no 
significant adverse impacts resulting from 
the Project. 
An assessment of the cumulative effects 
of the Project has been undertaken as

noise and vibration; ecology; water 
quality and resources; geology, ground 
conditions and hydrogeology; landscape 
and visual effects; traffic, transport and

out the Projects that are considered as 
part of the cumulative assessment as 
agreed with CCS. A full cumulative impact

One comment states that we 
would expect the promoter to 
provide details of any 
hazardous contamination 
present on site (including 
ground gas) as part of the site 
condition report. 
Ground investigation works will be 
undertaken prior to construction and to 
intersect mine workings/coal seams a 
Coal Authority permit will be required. 
 
One comment states that 
emissions to and from the 
ground should be considered in 
terms of the previous history of 
the site and the potential of the 
site, once operational, to give 
rise to issues. Public health 
impacts associated with ground 
contamination and/or the 
migration of material off-site 
should be assessed and the 
potential impact on nearby 
receptors and control and 
mitigation measures should be

have been identified as a result of 
construction, 
operation 
or 
decommissioning of the Project. In order

consideration should be given 
to any emitted pollutants for 
which there are no set 
emission limits. When 
assessing the potential impact 
of a proposed installation on 
environmental quality, 
predicted environmental 
concentrations should be

concentrations in the affected 
media; this should include both 
standards for short and long-
term exposure (s42a).

One comment states that The 
application site lies in close 
proximity to the Lower Lliw 
Reservoir which supplies 
Felindre Water Treatment 
Works - source to the largest 
Water Treatment Works in 
Wales, permanently supplying 
approximately 700,000 
customers.  The 
documentation refers to this 
reservoir as an emergency 
supply.  The proposed 
development has the potential 
to impact upon the water 
quality within the reservoir - 
therefore recommended that 
an appropriate air quality 
assessment is undertaken to 
consider possible effects to the 
water in the reservoir from both 
deposition and affected rainfall.  
The reservoir should be 
considered as a main receptor 
in the air quality change 
modelling (s42a). 
 
An assessment of the likely significant 
effects of the Project in respect of air 
quality has been undertaken as part of the

The 
Lower 
Lliw 
Reservoir 
is 
an 
emergency reservoir. It is not possible to 
assess deposition on water and therefore 
assessing deposition on the reservoir 
could not be undertaken. However as the 
Project is a gas power station the only 
relevant pollutant is NOX and no metal 
deposition is expected.

One comment agrees that in relation to the Natura 2000 sites there is no likely 
significant effect alone from the emissions and depositions of NOx. However, the 
consultee highlights that although the contributions are below 1% and may not be 
significant alone (ref to NSER), this does not rule out the requirement of an in-
combination assessment.
Natural Resources 
Wales
APL welcomes the acceptance of the No Significant Effects Report (NSER) conclusions. APL's response regarding 
NRW comments on in-combination effects is given below.  
Air Quality

One comment states that the nitrogen deposition Table 1-7 (Chapter 6) has not been 
displayed as percentage values, and the contributions from the development to the 
Natura 2000 sites are below 1% of the relevant nitrogen critical load. Based on the 
Wealden Judgment, it is considered that an in combination is required.
Natural Resources 
Wales
The table has been updated to present the % change in NOx. APL has assumed that NRW are acknowledging that 
the NSER report screens out in combination effects from the two developments due to stack emissions and that the 
query relates to in combination effects from road traffic emissions.
APL wishes to note that limited to no traffic data is available for any of the strategic sites which are listed in the 
Chapter 17 Cumulative Effects.
Air Quality

One comment states that APL has identified two projects that could act in combination 
with the development. Sections 1.5.4 and 1.5.5 explain why these projects are not going 
to act in combination with Abergelli, however the consultee advises that additional 
information should be added to detailing and confirming where projects have changes in 
traffic emissions, that Natura 2000 sites are further than the 200m screening distance 
for road traffic assessments. Additionally, for other developments that have emissions, it 
would be beneficial to demonstrate that those developments are beyond their relevant 
screening distances.  
Natural Resources 
Wales
APL has assumed that NRW is acknowledging that the NSER report screens out in combination effects from the two 
developments due to stack emissions and that the query relates to in combination effects from road traffic 
emissions.  APL wishes to note that limited to no traffic data is available for any of the strategic sites which are listed 
in the Chapter 17 Cumulative Effects, and so clarity on this point would be very much appreciated at the earliest

An assessment of the potential air quality effects of the proposed development is presented in Chapter 6 of the ES.  
The meteorological data used in the air quality assessment has been sourced in consultation with City and County of 
Swansea Council (CCS).  The meteorological data provided by the CCS Environmental Health Officer has been 
selected to ensure that the air quality assessment takes account of the local meteorological conditions, including 
cloud cover, wind speeds, wind directions, precipitation and temperature.  The assessment also includes terrain 
data to ensure that effects such as depression and low lying land are taken into account when predicting 
concentrations of emissions, such as CO2, at nearby receptors.

data that has been specified by CCS, provided by the CCS Environmental Health Officer to ensure that the 
dispersion modelling takes account of the local meteorological conditions, including cloud cover, wind speeds, wind 
directions, precipitation and temperature.  The dispersion model also includes terrain data to ensure that effects 
such as depression and low lying land are taking into account when predicting concentrations at receptors and 
dispersion from the stack. 
With regards to concerns about ground level gas pollutants and acid levels, the absorption of emissions from the 
plume into rainfall is very limited and does not take place within the short-term or close to the stack as the pollutants 
have to undergo various chemical reactions before they become soluble which takes many days and by that time, 
the pollutants will have travelled many hundreds of kilometres away. However, dry deposition is of more concern as 
it increases the availability of nutrient nitrogen and can increase  acidification which could affect ecological 
receptors. This effect has been considered as part of the ecological assessment in Chapter 8 of the ES.  The impact 
on ecology has been assessed to be negligible.

The local residents are concerned as the Project only has to meet the less stringent 
Emission Limit Values (ELV’s) in respect of a 1500 hour derogation power plant (less 
stringent ELV’s for SO2 & NOx apply to power plants which operate for less than 1500 
hours per year on a rolling average over a 5 year period).  
Llangyfelach 
Community Council
The proposed site has been designed to minimise emission to air as far as practicable while achieving its intended 
purpose.  the emissions from the plant will achieve the emission limits set out in the European Industrial Emission 
Directive (IED) which the UK has written into law and forms part of our environmental permitting system over seen 
by NRW in Wales.  These emission limits apply to all power stations across Europe and are designed to ensure that 
emission do not lead to significant environmental harm and take into account transboundary pollution effects on 
neighbouring countries within the EU and outside of Europe.  The IED was preceded by the European Large 
Combustion Plant directive which was also written into UK law.  The Large Combustion Plant directive introduced 
emission limits which had to be achieved by older power generating plants by a certain deadline if they were to 
continue operating.  If the plant could not achieve the limit or if it was not cost effective to achieve these limits then 
the sites had to shut down which has resulted in the closure of a large number of older gas, oil and coal fired power 
stations throughout the UK. 
As well as setting limits for existing power plants the directive also set more stringent emission limits for all new plant 
that were to be built after the regulation came into force based on the state of technology at the time. The Large 
Combustion Plant directive was replaced by the IED which once more included one set of emission limits for existing 
plants or those under construction (Annex V Part 1) and more stringent emission limits for newer plants which are 
granted a permit to operate after the January 2013 or started operating by January 2014. As the 2013/2014 deadline 
has now passed the proposed OCGT plant will have to meet the most stringent emission limits that are set out in the 
IED. The proposed site will therefore achieve the most stringent emission limits that are applicable throughout 
Europe and in practice will operate at below these emission limits to ensure that any fluctuations in operations does 
not lead to an exceedance of the limit.  
If the limit is exceeded, then Natural Resources Wales (NRW) must be notified and if the limit is exceeded on a 
regular basis then NRW may order the site to cease operation (this is regulated under the Environmental Permit).  
The site’s stack height has been optimised to maximise dispersion of pollutants to ensure that local impacts are 
minimised as far as practicable while more regional effects will be managed by the permitting process as applied by 
NRW and determined as part of the DCO process and forms one of the items of consideration as part of the 
National Policy Statements for Energy.

One comment raises concern about air emissions settling on surrounding developments

Llangyfelach 
Community Council
The proposed stack height has been optimised to maximise dispersion of pollutants to ensure that air quality effects 
minimised as far as practicable. For the purposes of the air quality assessment presented in Chapter 6 of the ES, 
receptors have been located at both existing and proposed developments in the area. 
The air quality assessment considers all residential properties in close proximity to the site, as well as receptors at 
illustrative locations in order to cover residential areas further from the site, including one at Llangyfelach and one 
representative of Morriston Hospital.
In addition, at the request of the CCS Environmental Health Officer, a receptor has also been located at the closest 
location on the LDP Strategic Development Site to the west of the Project Site, which includes a proposal for 850 
dwellings. As such, the air quality assessment ensures that the potential effect of the plant on air quality on the 
nearby proposed residential site has been assessed.

APL notes this comment and clarifies that major accidents and abnormal operations, including gas leaks, fires and 
explosions are considered in Chapter 15 Other Effects in the ES. Operational maintenance is also described in

With regards to concerns that the Project is not "cleaner" than current coal APL notes that the emissions from the

One comment suggests that there is the risk of unknown heritage being discovered 
during the development and the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust (GGAT) should 
advise on the need for a watching brief.
City and County of

APL contacted GGAT to invite comment on the need for a watching brief during the construction phase. GGAT 
responded, suggesting that APL undertake a precautionary approach and undertake a watching brief. 
Accordingly, as identified in Chapter 13 Historic Environment of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and secured by 
the "Archaeology" requirement in Schedule 2 of the DCO, prior to commencement of work a written scheme for the 
investigation of areas of archaeological interest must be approved by CCS.

One comment highlighted that Table 5-5 of Appendix 13.1 (Heritage Gazetteer) 
indicates that Pare Llewelyn is Grade 2 Registered Historic Park and Garden. Following 
clarification with the Urban Design and Conservation Officer, the advise is that the Pare 
Llewelyn is not a Registered Historic Park, and APL may wish to exclude this from the

APL has clarified that Parc Llewellyn is included on the GIS dataset for the Cadw register of historic parks and 
gardens (dataset maintained and provided by Cadw). Its Register entry is PGW (Gm) 75(SWA) and is Grade II. We 
have not checked this data against the published copy of the Register, but have no reason to assume this is an

The list of developments considered by the APL cumulative assessment has been agreed in consultation with the 
City and County of Swansea Council (CCS) and includes developments which are: 
• In the process of being built;
• Permitted application(s) but not yet implemented;
• Submitted application(s) not yet determined;
• Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects;
• Projects identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging development plants – with appropriate weight 
being given as they move closer to adoption) recognising that information on the relevant proposals will be limited; 
and
• Projects identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set the framework for future 
DCOs/approvals, where such development is reasonably likely to come forward.
The agreed list can be found in Table 4-6 Projects considered with the cumulative assessment, in Chapter 4 
“Approach to EIA”. 
Future plans for the development of the local area are set out in the CCS Draft Local Development Plan, which is 
currently under examination. These plans include allocation for over 800 homes in the Strategic Development site to 
the west of the B4489, and an area allocated as a potential waste management area to the east of the site.

Cumulative Impact 1
As explained in our recent meeting, there are also three other schemes located within 
6km of the site that have recently been submitted (undetermined) that fall within the 
definition of major development as set out in the Town and Country Planning 
(Development Management Procedure) (Wales) Order 2012 (as amended). However, 
two of these are residential developments of fewer than 23 units, each located 
approximately 5.5km away from the site whilst the other proposal is for 1,700m2 of 
commercial space located 4km away from the site. Within this context, it is not 
considered that these proposals would have a cumulative impact on the Project and that 
February 2018 is the cut off date for cumulative impact projects in the EIA.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
A cumulative assessment has been carried out relating to the three schemes as mentioned, where possible. The ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) includes a discussion on cumulative effects in Chapter 17 Cumulative Effects. 
Cumulative Impact 1
Para 17.6.5 states that the Strategic Site at Felindre and other Strategic Sites have 
been scoped out as there are limited details about the scale and nature of the proposed 
developments. This is considered inaccurate. The Strategic Site at Felindre and the 
Strategic Site at Clasemont Road are both identified within the Emerging LDP which 
clarifies what is proposed as part of the development in terms of the number of units and 
supporting infrastructure. Both of these schemes have been subject to Scoping 
Opinions as well providing information on the various topics to be included within such 
an assessment. These sites are for 850 and 600 dwellings respectively and each would 
have a school and local centre.
Junction 46 of the M4 is in very close proximity to each of these sites and, assuming the 
LDP is adopted in its current form, are highly likely to be under construction at the same 
time as this site given their long build out periods over several years. Whilst the LDP is 
currently under Examination and it is appreciated that the LDP may not be adopted in its 
current form, it is considered more robust to include these two proposals within the 
Landscape and Visual Impact and Traffic, Transport and Access Chapters at this stage 
as the LDP should be adopted in Autumn 2018, prior to any DCO consent being made 
for this proposal.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
Both of the strategic sites were identified in the 'long list' as detailed Table 4-6 and located in Figure 4-1. These 
schemes were classed as 'Identified / Allocated' and limited information was available at the time of writing.  There 
are complexities with trying to assume likely effects and mitigation measures associated with the strategic sites that 
would prevent meaningful assessment at this stage.
This Project is considerably progressed at this point, ahead of the nearby potential strategic site allocations. These 
allocated sites would therefore need to account for the Project as committed. 
Cumulative Impact 1
One comment notes the difficulty of assessing the traffic forecasts for the 
decommissioning phase which is accepted, but this reiterates the need for a 
comprehensive Decommissioning Method Statement which considers updated 
environmental information at a later date. However, Paragraph 12.7.30 states that the 
overall impact of the project is likely to be lesser in nature than construction as many 
aspects are likely to be left in situ. Whilst this is appreciated, the traffic on the highway in 
the vicinity of the site (and utilising junction 46 specifically) is expected to have 
increased significantly by the time of decommissioning as the Strategic Business Park 
should have been developed at that time (utilising Link 2) and the Strategic 
Development Area identified in the LOP (assuming it is included in the Adopted Plan) 
would also be fully operational and heavily dependent on the car, based on the existing 
traffic situation.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
APL has included developments that are consented or allocated where there is a reasonable degree of certainty will 
proceed within the next three years. APL may be required to carry out an assessment of the impact of those 
adopted Local Plan allocations which have the potential to impact on the same sections of transport network as well 
as other relevant local sites benefitting from as yet unimplemented planning approval.
In considering the current status of the LDP and the timeline of the Project, APL considers that it is unlikely that 
Felindre and the Project will overlap.  The Swansea LDP is, at the time of writing, at the inspector’s hearing and may 
become formally adopted by the end of summer or autumn. Therefore the official status of all the strategic 
development sites is unallocated. In the case of Felindre, the tender for transport planning services was put out one 
to two years ago and from APL's review we assume that there is no planning application submitted and in the public 
domain. Therefore the site in question is not classed as consented.
The Application is to be submitted in May 2018 and DCO consent is anticipated in Q3 2019. This will lead to the 
commencement of the (less than) two year construction period. The probability of the two sites being in construction 
period at the same time is low. In the worst and unlikely case Felindre construction may start at the end of the 
Project construction period. This would be after peak Project construction traffic, which occurs around 11 months 
from start. The Felindre construction would also be limited to initial preliminary construction activities at that time.

Para 12.10.4 considers the cumulative impact of other developments that have been 
submitted for planning permission. 12.10.5 goes on to state why certain projects have 
been excluded from the cumulative impact assessment. Whilst it is appreciated that two 
of the nearby LOP sites are not yet subject to a planning application and few details of 
traffic generation have been provided; it is considered that two strategic sites (Strategic 
Sites G at Felindre and E at Clasemont Road) should be included within the assessment 
given their proximity to the site and Junction 46 of the M4. The LOP is currently at 
Examination and given the scale of both developments (850 units and 600 units 
respectively along with a school and local centre at each site), it is anticipated that they 
will each take several years to develop completely. The LOP will run until 2025 and 
applications on these sites are anticipated shortly in order to provide the requisite 
number of units within the plan period. Given that construction of the Project is 
anticipated to occur in 2020, it is highly likely that these sites would be under 
construction at the same time (assuming the LOP is considered sound, these sites 
remain within the plan and the plan is recommended for adoption) and should therefore 
be considered within the cumulative assessment in terms of construction. Whilst at the 
current time full details of the construction timelines are not available, it is considered 
that the build rates would be similar to the Strategic Site at Llangyfelach 
(2017/1822/0UT) that has been included (as an application has been submitted) and this 
could be used as a basis for a more robust assessment. Link 2 in the TA would also be 
used by construction traffic for the Strategic Site at Felindre and Junction 46 is likely to 
be used by the construction traffic going to the 3 Strategic Sites within the vicinity.
At this stage this Project is considerably progressed, ahead of the nearby potential strategic site allocations. Thus if, 
in the unlikely scenario, the sites were to overlap construction periods for less than a year, Felindre would need to 
account for the Project as committed. This approach would also ensure robust assessments were undertaken in the 
future given that the Project traffic impact will be in the public domain and agreed with CCS, this eliminates the need 
for broad assumptions and follows logical steps. There are complexities with trying to assume development 
quantum, access arrangements and mitigation measures associated with strategic sites that would prevent 
meaningful assessment at this stage.
With regards to the decommissioning, the request for assessments are noted. APL would advise that at present it 
does not have the ability to forecast that far into the future as the growth rate calculators are not that far advanced 
and also have not been updated with LDP allocations or any trends in economic activity or government intervention 
on private car use. APL has confirmed within the assessment that decommission will result in less of a traffic impact 
than construction. Decommissioning will be subject to the 'Decommissioning Strategy' requirement as detailed in the 
DCO, Schedule 2 Requirements.

Three comments relate to the decommissioning phase, specifically the design life of the 
Project and state that the 2018 PEIR is unclear how the power plant will be re-powered 
at the end of its anticipated 25 year working life.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
APL can confirm that the ES has been updated to clarify the Project design life. For the purpose of the EIA and in 
order to allow a decommissioning assessment to be presented in the ES, the assessment takes the design life of 
the power generation plant (25 years) as its assumption for the point in time when decommissioning is assessed. 
For the purposes of the assessment, it is assumed that the above ground Generating Equipment would be 
demolished and removed after 25 years and the Generating Equipment Site re-instated to a similar condition as 
before construction. Any decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar duration to construction i.e. 22 
months. The detail of future decommissioning will be determined following submission of a decommissioning 
strategy for approval by CCS under the corresponding Requirement in Schedule 2 of the DCO.

The Community Council feel that that before a Development Control Order is considered 
for approval and an NRW permit is also considered for approval; that it would be more 
appropriate that a more efficient gas fired power station should be looked at to include 
the recycling of hot/warm gases generated, from such a station be used to serve the 
buildings on the site , the nearby Swansea Business Park & the proposed 850 dwelling 
etc. on Strategic Site G in the Swansea Local Development Plan.
Llangyfelach 
Community Council
APL notes this comment about the recycling of hot gases from the Project, to serve the onsite buildings as well as 
other developments in the local area. The potential for combined heat and power (CHP) opportunities are 
considered in Chapter 5 Alternatives Considered of the ES, which concludes that it is not technically or economically 
feasible with a peaking power station in this location.
The proposed power station is to operate as a peaking plant to address short-term changes in power supply or 
demand.  To achieve this the plant needs to be able to start producing electricity as quickly as possible and 
conversely to shut down as fast as possible to only operate when there is a need.  This type of plant is not 
conducive to the supply of heat to other sites/residential properties which would need regular heating supplies 
throughout the year for industrial use of more heat in winter and none in summer for residential use.  As the peaking 
plant will only operate if there is a need there would be no heat available at some time of the day/year unless the 
OCGT operated at all times which is not economically viable.  
APL notes the comment in relation to the Environmental Permit and can confirm that the DCO and EP applications 
will be twin tracked.

A comprehensive suite of ecological surveys has been carried out in support of the Project, all of which are 
published with the ES. In addition to a general habitat survey (Appendix 8.1), the following species specific surveys 
have also been carried out and can be located in Volumes B and C of the ES Technical Appendices (Document

• Great Crested Newt Survey Report
• Reptile Survey Report
• Breeding Bird Survey Report 
• Bat Surveys
• Dormouse Survey 
• Otter and Water Vole Survey 
• Invasive Plant Species Survey 
• Arboricultural Survey 
Where the construction, operation of maintenance of the Project could affect habitats or species, the ES proposes 
appropriate mitigation – this is discussed in Chapter 8 Ecology. Where habitat is to be removed, reinstatement or 
replacement planting is proposed. This is also the case for the ponds, as two attenuation ponds that are included in

habitat loss and the measures to be employed to avoid, mitigate and compensate for the 
unavoidable impacts. The mitigation hierarchy must be clearly presented to allow an 
informed decision to be made regarding the degree of loss and subsequent measures to 
be employed to ameliorate that loss.

APL notes this comment about the ongoing survey work. Habitat loss calculations have been included in the ES for 
each habitat and designated site. Mitigation and compensation measures have been included in the ES for each 
feature where an effect has been evaluated as being significant. The ES proposes mitigation and compensation 
measures for each feature where the effect has been evaluated as significant. An Outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Plan (ES Figure 3.6, Document Reference 6.3) and an Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
Strategy (ES Appendix 3.4, Document Reference 6.2) include details of where mitigation and compensatory habitats 
will be located, and how they will be created and managed. The mitigation hierarchy is clearly presented in ES

One comment notes that there is potential for otters to use habitats that will be affected 
by the proposal and NRW will provide detailed advice in relation to otter as a European 
Protected Species.  Although current use by water vole has been ruled out they should 
be able to re-colonise the site if they move back. All new water features created as part 
of the scheme should incorporate features to enable them to be used by this species if 
present.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
Comment noted regard NRW providing advice on otter as a European Protected Species. 
Comments regarding water vole being able to recolonise previously used areas of the Site have been noted.  
Of the water features created by the Project, attenuation ponds will become green infrastructure features that are 
suitable water vole habitat. The fire water tank cannot double up as a green infrastructure feature as it is not 
compatible with its function.

Populations of slow worm and grass snake have been recorded on site and in areas to 
be affected by the works. It is not possible to rule out other species such as Adder as the 
habitat is suitable particularly the wet woodland edge habitat and they have been 
recorded within the 2km record search buffer.
A full and detailed method statement must be produced in respect of these species 
outlining how works will be carried out to avoid killing or injuring these species as 
required by the Wildlife & Countryside Act (1981). Given the amount of suitable 
surrounding habitat the strategy should seek to systematically make the working areas 
unsuitable for them and effectively "push" them into safeguarded adjacent receptor 
areas in the first instance. Some work may be required in the receptor areas before any 
works begin to increase the carrying capacity ready to receive the additional numbers of 
reptiles. As they will not be able to use the site in the same way as they currently do a 
certain amount of mitigation will be required to make up this short fall in the form of 
habitat improvement and targeted management. Some mitigation should take the form 
of creating suitable boundary habitats around working areas allowing reptiles to 
recolonise the site to some degree post construction.

These are numerous on the site and there is a substantial risk of spread and 
contamination without appropriate preventative measures being in place. Of particular 
concern is the presence of floating pennywort in one of the ponds scheduled for 
removal. Given the amount of ground works and movement of soils, digging of new 
ditches and ponds that will be required there is a significant risk of spread. A detailed 
and thorough plan must be produced for its eradication on site and to prevent it from 
spreading to others. The same goes for the other species identified as present.
A detailed mitigation statement should be compiled to demonstrate how these species 
will be considered during construction works (could be incorporated into the CEMP), 
during plant operation and during the decommissioning phase.

It is currently unclear exactly how much SINC and Section 7 habitat will be lost to the 
proposal. Whilst the 2018 PEIR sets out some figures for habitat loss these are based 
on the main power generation plant and does not consider other loss that may occur 
during associated works such as access routes construction, electrical cable installation, 
drainage, AGI construction etc. All these elements must be fully considered to allow a 
thorough mitigation package to be determined.
Some loss has been identified as a temporary loss that can be reinstated once 
construction works are complete but this is not necessarily an easy thing to achieve, 
some habitat is easier that others but it must be carefully thought about and planned for 
it to be successful. Based on the current level of information it is not possible to 
determine if this strategy is feasible for example; is there sufficient receptor and storage 
areas for the temporarily removed habitat without harming existing habitat? How much 
will require new planting? More detail on how the temporary loss will be managed will be 
needed to properly determine the impacts of the scheme.
Where long term loss of habitat will occur compensation will be necessary. Although not 
detailed in the submitted literature it is understood from verbal communication that the 
"tear drop" or southernmost part of the development boundary is being considered as an 
offsetting area. This area is already assessed as marshy grassland and therefore has 
value in its own right. It is acknowledged that improvements could be made to this area 
to partially offset some loss but based on current information is considered insufficient 
on its own. The most suitable areas for offsetting are those of low ecological value such 
as improved grassland which is present in the surrounding area. As a standard, twice 
the amount of area should be sought in compensation as that which has been lost.

One comment notes that in Para 8.7.40 that the impact of construction noise has been 
considered on the nearest bat roost, however, it is queried whether the impact of the 
operation of the Project would impact on bats given that Figures 5.1 and 5.3 of Appendix 
8.7 (Bat Activity Transect and Roost Survey Report) indicate that bats utilise the gallops 
which traverse the Project site. If this impact does not need to be considered, it would be 
useful to clarify why this element has not been considered further as it appears as an 
omission at the current time.

Para 8.8.43 states that the detailed decommissioning....would be subject to a separate 
assessment and planning application at that time. Firstly, it is understood that the 
demolition of the Project would be included within any DCO granted so this statement is 
incorrect and secondly, it reiterates the general point that a full assessment of the 
environmental impact of the decommissioning will be required at a later date.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
APL notes these comments and clarifies that a Decommissioning Strategy will be required to be submitted and 
agreed with City and County of Swansea at the appropriate time but prior to any decommissioning works being 
undertaken, this will be secured via the 'Decommissioning Strategy' requirement in Schedule 2 of the draft DCO to 
be submitted with the APL DCO Application.  
For the purpose of the EIA and in order to allow a decommissioning assessment to be presented in the ES, the 
assessment takes the design life of the power generation plant (25 years) as its assumption for the point in time 
when decommissioning is assessed. For the purposes of the assessment, it is assumed that the above ground 
Generating Equipment would be demolished and removed after 25 years and the Generating Equipment Site re-
instated to a similar condition as before construction. Any decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar 
duration to construction i.e. 22 months.

The submitted Arboricultural Report was undertaken in 2014 when the Project site was 
larger and the proposal was different. Section 3.3.5 highlights that certain works are 
required to trees along an internal access road (G3 and G4) which were required to 
enable construction of the gas connection. It is unclear whether the recommendations 
remain the same given that the scheme has subsequently changed. It would be useful 
for the applicant to update/ clarify the full extent of the tree works within the 
Environmental Statement to identify what is proposed as part of the DCO application.

Para 10.7.16 2018 PEIR refers to the sand and gravel reserves within the vicinity of the 
gas connection. It is unclear whether the significance of the magnitude of the impact 
would change given that, unlike the Power Generation Plant, the gas pipeline is 
expected to be left in situ (see para 10.7.50 of the CCS s42 response) and therefore this 
sterilisation would be permanent as opposed to just for the duration of the project as 
indicated in this paragraph.
Para 9.7.61 2018 PEIR states that the reinstatement of the power generation plant to the 
existing characteristics would bring back the drainage benefits of the existing 'greenfield' 
characteristics. However, it is considered that the soil would be heavily compacted as a 
result of the development of the Project and details to overcome soil compaction as a 
result of the development would be required at the decommissioning stage.
City and County of 
Swansea Council
APL notes this comment. Para 11.7.16 (formerly 10.7.16) does indicate that the sterilisation of the sand and gravel 
reserves would be permanent however the significance of effects is only considered to be minor as the area 
sterilised by the pipeline compared to the overall size of the reserves is relatively small and there is minimal 
economic use of the reserves.  Table 11.14 (formerly Table 10.14) will be amended to include an additional row 
relating to the gas pipeline and electrical connection being left in situ following decommissioning permanently 
sterilising a thin strip of land. Given the low economic value of the reserves and the relatively small area affected  
the significance of effect is considered to be minor adverse.

In terms of the Non-Technical Summary, I would advise that this document strikes a 
good balance between the level of information contained within it whilst also ensuring 
that the document is user-friendly. The NTS provides a significant amount of useful 
information in easy to understand language whilst also clarifying what has been covered 
in each topic area and giving an indication of the significance of these effects. It is 
appreciated that it is a difficult task to reconcile providing a summary of the 
environmental information without going into the detail contained within the 2018 PEIR in 
an easy access format but it is hoped that the final NTS follows the same approach to 
enable all participants to understand the environmental issues that have been 
considered and their significance overall in EIA terms. The list of abbreviations at the 
start is particularly useful given the amount of acronyms used throughout the document.
One point to note is the use of the term "major development" on P46 of the NTS. There 
is a statutory definition of major development contained within the Town and Country 
Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Wales) Order 2012 (as amended). 
This definition provides for schemes of 10 or more dwellings and commercial 
developments creating over 1,000m2 of floor space amongst other criteria. Within this 
context, the term major development is misleading as it was agreed that larger, more 
strategic scale developments would be considered (i.e. 40+ dwellings or more) within the 
5km area. These larger schemes are considered to have more potential for a cumulative 
impact given their scale/ characteristics than smaller developments.
An indicative site layout of the Project site itself would also prove beneficial in the NTS 
along with a plan referring to the different pieces of infrastructure on site.

APL welcomes the positive comments on the NTS. The term 'major development' will be amended within the NTS to 
a non-statutory definition.

The loss of agricultural land that has been in production for hundreds of years should not 
be allowed unless food production and the development can be managed alongside 
each other. Such as land based solar panels and sheep production this development will 
mean the total loss of production permanently.

APL notes this comment. As explained in Chapter 10 Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology (Document 
Reference 6.1), the agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding the Project site is Grade 4 
poor quality agricultural land “with severe limitations which significantly restricts the range of crops and/or level of 
yields, mainly suited to grass with occasional arable crops.” Chapter 10 assesses the impact of the Project on 
agricultural land to be negligible, with only a relatively small area of the Project Site permanently sterilised by the 
development with the rest reinstated following construction.

One comment notes that the final design will incorporate suitable mitigation on the basis 
of intrusive investigation findings to minimise disturbance with peat, and a Peat 
Management Plan is proposed. NRW recommends:
-information on the location and extent of peat is provided upfront as part of the DCO 
submission
-a peat survey should comply of a minimum, of 1 peat probe per hectare of development 
area and 1 pear probe per 10 peat probes 
-the above will show the distribution of peak across the development area so that the 
main areas of peat can be avoided by infrastructure.

APL notes this comment and confirms that an additional desk study of peat resources including NATMAP 
Soilscapes dataset (Cranfield University) and soil maps have been undertaken to better understand the location and 
spatial extent of the peat deposits. The results of this assessment have been included in the ES chapter. It is 
understood that a peat survey is recommended, this will be undertaken during ground investigations. If following the 
peat survey a reasonable amount of peat is found, a Peat Management Plan will be agreed in consultation with CCS 
and NRW. This will be secured via the corresponding requirement in schedule 2 of the DCO.

A plume consisting mainly of water vapour may be visible from the stack of the power station but only under certain 
atmospheric conditions (cold and dry with high pressure); this is not ‘smoke’. The emissions from the stack will be 
strictly limited by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) as part of an operational environmental permit and will not have 
any significant effect on people or the environment.

Further to our recent meeting, it was suggested that additional information is added to 
the submitted photomontages to clarify exactly what is being indicated in each drawing 
and clearly point out where the Project site is in some of the viewpoints (especially the 
longer distance views where the site would be partially visible). Whilst the impact is 
Major Adverse from views 16 and 17, it is not readily apparent where the equipment and 
stack are in each viewpoint. Currently, the red outline of the Project infrastructure is not 
clear and is not used in all montages. As discussed, wireframes should be added to 
indicate landform and the outline of the infrastructure should be indicated on all 
montages, especially where the project would be visible. It is also appreciated that the 
winter shots to be added would further aid interpretation.
Further to this, the inclusion of two pylon heights (Para 11.5.7) within close proximity to 
the site are welcomed as this will help gain a better appreciation of the scale of the 
project relative to the existing infrastructure in the area. However, it would be useful if 
these two pylons are marked on a plan (I would suggest Figure 3.1 - Existing Site 
Levels) along with  their topographical datum points and this cross-referenced on the 
relative photomontages (such as view 9 where a pylon towers above the stack 
comparatively). This would enable readers to cross-reference the photomontages with 
these points and enable easier comparison/ verification.

Two comments are concerned about the effect of noise (including vibration) emissions 
from the Project on their home.
Response

Detailed baseline sound monitoring was undertaken between 15 and 22 February 2018.  The results included a full 
range of relevant weather conditions which have been used to update the noise assessment in the ES.  Robust 
representative baseline ambient and background sound levels have been derived from the results by filtering for 
appropriate weather conditions and statistical analysis of filtered data. The results show some changes from the 
data used in the 2018 PEIR.  This is to be expected at the data used in the 2018 PEIR was based on very limited 
measurements in 2014 which were subject to the influence of both short duration sound source effects and 
inappropriate wind directions for some of the receptors.  The most notable changes are that the detailed survey 
resulted in higher representative background sound levels at NSRs 1 and 6 and lower ambient levels at NSR 4.  As 
a result the assessments are now clearer in terms of their low impacts. The BS 4142 night time assessment based 
on the results of the detailed survey demonstrate an impact better than low adverse at all receptors.  A night time 
BS 4142 assessment is therefore in the ES alongside the WHO assessment.
ES Chapter 7 'Noise and Vibration' confirms that operational noise effects at the property in question are negligible 
and not significant.

- NRW states that it has been presented with a 10-minute sample. 
- WHO excludes sound with characteristics which is associated with industrial noise.
- NRW acknowledges APL's need to undertake additional monitoring which should 
produce a greater detailed data set for the L90 and residual sound, and once this has 
been presented they would consider whether BS4142 is more suitable for night time 
sound.

demonstrate an impact better than low adverse at all receptors.  A night time BS 4142 assessment is therefore in 
the ES alongside the WHO assessment. The lower residual levels (baseline ambient) measured at NSR4 also mean 
that the complex situation regarding the WHO assessment at that location, where the residual noise already 
exceeded the WHO criterion but the power station noise did not result in any increase, no longer applies.

The exact nature of the character of the power station sound at each receptor is not known although observations of 
similar sites confirm that the intention for there to be no major tonal or impulsive characteristics is achievable.  The

On a more general note, the Community Council is aware that the land adjacent to the 
site of the proposed power station is included in the draft Local Development Plan as a

inherently inconsistent with a residential development.

The Project is located adjacent to an existing electricity substation and is set within an area of existing energy-
related infrastructure (substation and overhead power lines).  There is an existing belt of trees which acts to 
separate and provide a visual barrier from the existing and proposed infrastructure to any proposed residential

Welsh Government APL notes this comment. The Project has the ability to meet statutory emissions reduction targets. The Project is a 
new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, 
which is designed to operate intermittently, to provide support in plugging the gaps created by intermittent 
renewables, and boosting the overall security of supply. Paragraph 3.6.1 of the Overarching National Policy

If the structure constitutes an 'aerodrome obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that 
will review the lighting requirement (part of the safeguarding process). 
Civil Aviation 
Authority
APL acknowledges these comments on aviation obstruction lighting.
Safety

In the UK, the need for aviation obstruction lighting on 'tall' structures depends in the first 
instance upon any particular structure's location in relationship to an aerodrome.  If the 
structure constitutes an 'aerodrome obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that will 
review the lighting requirement (part of the safeguarding process).  For civil aerodromes, 
they will, in general terms, follow the requirements of CAP 168 - Licensing of 
Aerodromes. Chapter 4 refers to obstacles and obstacle lighting (I have included an 
extract from CAP168).  
Article 222 of the UK Air Navigation Order applies.  Article 222 requires that for en-route 
obstructions (i.e. away from aerodromes) lighting only becomes legally mandated for 
structures of a height of 150m or more above ground level.  
Typically, structures less than 150m above ground level and away from the immediate 
vicinity of an aerodrome are not routinely lit for civil aviation purposes.  However, 
structures of lesser high might need aviation obstruction lighting if, by virtue of their 
location and nature, they are considered a significant navigational hazard.
Note that if the structure is to be 150m or higher, the lighting specification set out in 
Article 222 becomes a statutory requirement.  In this latter case, any proposal to seek a 
lighting specification at odds with Article 222 should involve the CAA.

Site Selection

We are not in principally objecting to this development as we will always need an 
electrical generation. It is the location we are objecting to. When there is a far more 
suitable site approximately 800meters to the North West which could be classed as a 
brown field site because of its industrial past i.e. coal mining and recent land fill. A 
second alternative site lies approximately 400m to the west alongside the existing 
development of the gas pumping station.
Response 
anonymised
APL notes this comment about site selection. The suggested site approximately 400 m west of the proposed 
Generating Equipment Site would not be suitable due to the National Transmission System gas pipelines that enter 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station on the western side of the National Grid compound. Figure 3.4 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.3) shows the existing utilities (including underground gas pipelines, overhead and 
underground electricity cables and telecommunication lines) within the Project Site area. The proposed site for the 
Abergelli Power Project has been carefully considered and selected after an extensive site selection process. The 
Project Site was considered suitable for the following main reasons: 
- It is in close proximity to a suitable electrical connection point;
- It is in close proximity to a suitable gas connection point;
- The Project Site does not include any nationally important environmental designations;
- The land available is of an adequate size to accommodate the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection;
- The Project site is largely situated on poor quality agricultural land (improved grassland classified as Grade 4 
agricultural land);
- It is in close proximity to similar industrial developments including the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and 
Swansea North Substation;
- The surrounding network is within an area of net electricity import; and
- It is in close proximity to a well-developed road network to the Project Site.

The Community Council are of the opinion, that should the DCO be approved, the size & 
height, especially of the stack of this proposed power station would have a substantial & 
damaging effect on the marketability of the aforementioned sites.  The Community 
Council consider the proposed Residential use & existing Business Park to be more 
appropriate for their area, especially if the Swansea Barrage scheme is given the go-
ahead. 
Llangyfelach 
Community Council
APL notes this comment and has worked, through the design and assessment process, to minimise intrusion by 
reducing the footprint of the Project and limiting the number of stacks to one. APL also proposes that the electrical 
connection to the nearby substation is underground rather than a more traditional overhead line connection.  It is 
considered that a project of this nature, situated close to significant existing energy-related infrastructure (including 
the substation and overhead powerlines), which assist in achieving these design efficiencies, is appropriately 
designed and located.

This should not be at the expense of existing residents by retrospectively damaging our 
carefully planned long term financial positions. We feel that the construction and running 
of the station would have a very damaging impact on local house prices, tourism and the 
future of Felindre being a desirable place to live. 
Response 
anonymised
APL notes this comment. ES Chapter 14 "Socio-economics" discusses likely effects on tourism and business as a 
result of the Project. As explained, a tourism business survey was carried out during November and December in 
2014. This has not been repeated for this assessment as baseline assessment shows the visitor economy has not 
materially changed since 2014.  The 2014 business survey findings are therefore considered to remain valid for this 
assessment. In terms of impact, the vast majority of respondents felt that the Project would have no impact on 
business performance. Some businesses felt that they would benefit at the construction phase through related 
demand for accommodation, food and drink, and other services.  Only one respondent predicted an adverse impact 
on business performance based mainly on perceived adverse visual impact.
In response to concerns about house prices, APL advises that loss of  property value is not a material consideration 
in the planning process and is therefore not something that is covered in an EIA. Evidence would need to be 
provided to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an adverse impact on the property value. APL 
provided additional explanation to explain the circumstances in which parties my by entitled to claim compensation 
due to impacts from the proposed development, whilst noting that parties should, in any event, seek independent

up to 300 homes) is valued at £5.9m and the Strategic Sites at Llangyfelach (up to 1,950 
dwellings) and Garden Village (650) are only £16.4m and £11.8m respectively.

The proposed Access Road has been selected following previous consultation in 2014 and 2015. In 2014, two 
potential access routes were considered to reach the Generating Equipment Site as discussed in Chapter 5 
“Alternatives” of the ES. Feedback from the local authority, local highways authority and local residents indicated 
that the preference would be to avoid use of the Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and instead route via the B4489. Therefore, 
the chosen route to site is from Junction 46 of the M4, north along the B4489, then along the existing access to the 
National Grid compound which houses the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and Swansea North Substation. The 
selected access route will result in a lower adverse impact on traffic by using a shorter, more direct route and would 
avoid the roads leading to Morriston Hospital. 
ES Chapter 12 Traffic and Transport considers the impacts of traffic generating by the Project. The assessment 
states that there will be some temporary adverse effects in relation to increased HGV movements during the 
construction period. A Construction Traffic Management Plan is submitted as Appendix 3.3 to the ES Document 
Reference 6.2) setting out measures to manage construction traffic and minimise adverse impacts. The traffic and

One comment notes that this land is proposed for ecological mitigation however no 
further detail has yet been provided on this.  NRW advises that  if these proposals 
include raising of land within the flood zone (C2), further flood risk assessment may be 
required and any works on the River Llan may also require a Flood Risk Activity Permit 
from NRW.

APL notes the comment. Acknowledged. APL can confirm that there will be no built equipment in this area and that 
the area known locally as the "teardrop" will be primarily and only for Ecological Mitigation. As such no Flood Risk 
Activity Permit will be required.

One comment notes the submission of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) screening 
assessment for this project. and agrees with its conclusion that the project will not have 
a significant adverse effect on the River Llan waterbody from a WFD perspective, and 
that no further assessments are required.

One comment suggests that the APL should consider the proposed surface water 
attenuation pond(s) to be potentially dual use, i.e. a sustainable drainage solution, which 
also doubles as green infrastructure, whereby the water could be reused/recycled for fire-
fighting purposes in the event of an emergency and negate the need for an additional 
fire water storage tank.

Wales
APL notes the comment and clarifies that green infrastructure attenuation pond(s) would not suitable to double up as 
fire water storage due the health and safety implications and would not conform to industrial standards or 
regulations.

One comment advises that a statement about the water quality improving overtime as 
sediments settle  and pollutants are dispersed/diluted/treated by natural processes is not 
relied upon, as appropriate mitigation in response to any adverse impact during 
construction.

APL clarified that Para 9.7.6 of the 2018 PEIR, as stated, is not the primary mitigation to be employed, and is used 
only for reference to described what would happen without mitigation as detailed in the CEMP.

One comment is satisfied that the draft CEMP, Surface Water and Environmental 
Management Plans incorporate matters raised for consideration in response to the 
previous 2018 PEIR consultation. NRW notes that that these documents will be 
developed further when more specific details of the development emerge in the coming 
stages.

The Drainage Strategy and Flood Consequences Assessment (FCA) are broadly 
acceptable. In regards to section 1.1.7 of the FCA, this is correct, the lifetime of the 
development is taken to be 25 years which takes us to early 2050's and therefore 
complies with Table 7-1 for peak river flows. Table 7-2 further expands this by looking at 
peak rainfall intensity where the anticipated change by the 2050's is 20%, again this is 
an acceptable approach and complies with the latest guidance available on surface 
water design parameters. It is noted that the 20% figure is based on figures which run to 
2069 (based on 7.2.2 and 7.3.2 of the FCA) which would comprise a 47 year lifetime for 
the development (assuming it is completed in 2022).
 
However, it is noted that the Power Station could be re-powered on more than one 
occasion and the WG Policy Clarification Letter - Guidance on Climate Change 
Allowance for Planning Purposes (CL-03-16) - indicates that a lifetime of 75 years should 
be assumed for non-residential development. It is therefore considered that an 
allowance of 30% should be added on for climate change pursuant to this guidance. 
Given that the overall lifetime of the development is not known, it would be considered 
prudent to plan for the future to ensure any attenuation is appropriately sized.
In section 8.3.4 the report indicates that the site surface water drainage system will be 
designed to prevent flooding of the project-t site for events up to and including 1 in 30 
year and maintain existing runoff rates for events from 1 in 30 year up to and including 1 
in 100 year including an appropriate allowance for climate change, this is an acceptable 
approach. To enable such an approach, sufficient information will be needed showing 
where and how surface water will be stored across the site to maintain existing run-off 
rates while not placing both the site itself and adjacent third party land at risk.

The ES has been updated to clarify that the operational life of the Power Station is 25 years only. From previous 
correspondence with CCS (18/10/2017)  and this consultation response it is understood that the assessment 
undertaken using the 20% climate change allowances is acceptable for an operational life of 25 years. It is therefore 
considered there are no requirements to update the climate change allowance for this application.   
Plans of the proposed surface water drainage network are detailed in the DCO Application, in compliance with runoff 
capacity requirements set out in the Drainage Strategy (Appendix 9.1 of Document Reference 6.2) and secured by 
'Surface and foul water drainage' requirement in Schedule 2 of the DCO to be submitted with the APL DCO 
Application. 
Detailed plans of the proposed watercourse crossings are supplied as part of the DCO application to validate the 
conclusions of the FCA (Appendix 9.1).
An assessment for the requirement of trash screens will be carried out for access road crossings during the detailed 
design phase of the project, and a written surface and foul water drainage plan have been submitted to and 
approved by CCS as secured by 'Surface and foul water drainage', requirement. 
As noted in ES Chapter 9, the run off rate calculations have been updated using the FEH2013 rainfall parameters 
and the attenuation storage requirements for the Project Site will be confirmed.

We understand from previous discussions and the FCA/DS document that several on 
site streams will be altered to enable the development and it's access, detailed plans will 
be needed showing the diversionary routes, gradients, cross sections, any retaining 
structures and crossings supported by appropriate levels of assessment to demonstrate 
that the changes will not affect third party land or the development itself.
Section 8.2.20 mentions that for access roads twin culvert arrangements and/or trash 
screens are implemented, we recommend that a robust assessment is carried out on the 
need for trash screens as in our experience they cause more issues that they solve.
In regards to run-off rates, the approach used is acceptable i.e. IOH124, but when it 
comes to assessment of the chosen system we would be looking for FEH2013 rainfall 
parameters to be used in preference to FSR or earlier versions of FEH in line with the 
latest NRW guidance from 2016.

One comment advises that further information should be provided on the in-combination 
effect of foul water drainage from the Project and other potential developments.

APL acknowledges this comment and provided clarification regarding foul water drainage. Namely, there will be a 
maximum of 2 toilets on site with approximately 3 shifts of 5 workers in a 24 hour period. As there is no main 
drainage available to the Project, preference is to install a Package Treatment Plant (as described in Chapter 3 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1). Therefore the discharge from the Project site during operation will be negligible 
and highly unlikely to cause significant effects to a Natura 2000 site. During construction temporary package 
treatment or mobile provision of toilets will be utilised, and therefore the conclusions within the NSER remain valid.

One comment accepts that the pollution control measures contained within the project 
proposals, if implemented as designed should mean that there will be no significant 
impacts on the water environment as a result of pollution from both construction and

Drainage will also need to be considered to ensure that stockpiling, landform compaction 
and modifications and drainage of hardstandings do not drain towards the solar fields
