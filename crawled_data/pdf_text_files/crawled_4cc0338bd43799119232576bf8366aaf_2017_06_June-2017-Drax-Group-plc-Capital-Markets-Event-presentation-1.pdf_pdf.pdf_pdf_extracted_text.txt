Dividend Policy
68
Drax Group plc – Capital Markets Day 
Drax expects to pay a growing dividend consistent with maintaining its credit rating and investing 
in its business
Drax expects to recommend a dividend of £50m with regards to the 2017 financial year. The 
Board is confident that this dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow from this level as the 
implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash 
flow. In determining the rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of future 
investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Group’s commodity-based 
businesses
If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs the Board will consider 
the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders
