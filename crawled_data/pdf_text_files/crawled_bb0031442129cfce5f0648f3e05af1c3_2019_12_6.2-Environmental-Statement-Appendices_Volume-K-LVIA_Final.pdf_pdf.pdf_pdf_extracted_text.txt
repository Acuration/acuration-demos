BASELINE AND SENSITIVITY 
CHANGE, MAGNITUDE AND SIGNIFICANCE 
 
General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site  Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

Key characteristics of relevance to the Project 
Site and locality, include: 
 
Gently undulating, lowland plateau divided 
by shallow river valleys that gradually widen 
as they approach The Fens NCA in the east; 
 
Brickfields of the Marston Vale and 
Peterborough area form distinctive post-
industrial 
landscapes 
with 
man-made 
waterbodies and landfill sites. Restoration of 
sand and gravel workings has left a series of 
flooded and restored waterbodies within the 
river valleys; 
 
Variable, 
scattered 
woodland 
cover 
comprising smaller plantations, secondary 
woodland, pollarded willows and poplar 
along river valleys, and clusters of ancient 
woodland; 
 
Predominantly open, arable landscape of 
planned and regular fields bounded by open 
ditches and trimmed, often species-poor 
hedgerows which contrast with those fields 
that are irregular and piecemeal; 
 
Wide variety of semi-natural habitats 
supporting a range of species; 
 
A number of historic parklands, designed 
landscapes and country houses… combine 
with… brickfields to provide a strong sense 
of history and place;  
 
Settlements cluster around major road and 
rail corridors, with smaller towns, villages 
and linear settlements widely dispersed 
throughout, giving a more rural feel; and 
 
Recreational assets include… Forest of 
Marston 
Vale 
Community 
Forest… 
woodland and wetland sites, an extensive 
rights of way network and two National 
Cycle Routes 
Value of LCA: Medium (as the LCA

Natural England Landscape 
Character Area 90: 
Bedfordshire Greensand 
Ridge  
 
Key characteristics of relevance to the Project 
Site and locality, include: 
 
 
Narrow escarpment resulting from the 
erosion-resistant sediments of the Lower 
Greensand Group, with a distinct scarp 
slope to the northwest and dip slope to the 
south-east; 
 
The rolling and elevated Ridge provides a 
north-west-facing wooded skyline offering 
extensive panoramic views across the 
lower-lying 
Bedfordshire 
and 
Cambridgeshire Claylands and towards the 
Chilterns; 
 
Substantial blocks of ancient woodland and 
coniferous plantation are found on the Ridge 
and steeper slopes. Wood pasture and 
numerous hedgerow trees, copses and 
shelterbelts are associated with the estate 
farmland and parkland trees; 
 
Mixed field and roadside boundaries range 
from mature shelterbelts to gappy, short 
flailed boundaries to intact evergreen 
hedgerows; 
 
A patchwork of semi-natural habitats 
including mire habitats, lowland heathland 
and lowland mixed deciduous woodland 
species; 
 
Historic parklands and estates associated 
with grand country houses such as Woburn;  
 
Dispersed settlement pattern along the 
Greensand Ridge, with most settlements 
along the river valleys and southern dip 
slopes; and 
 
Road and rail links cut north–south through 
the Ridge. 
Value of LCA: Medium as the LCA 
covers an extensive area and has a 
wide range of commonly occurring 
characteristics. 
 
Susceptibility to Change: Medium

Landscape Character Area 
5D: North Marston Clay Vale 
The key characteristics of this character area, 
which are relevant to the Project Site, are: 
 
A large scale, open vale, defined by Oxford 
Clay geology, located between the elevated 
landscapes of the Wooded Greensand 
Ridge (6b) and the Cranfield to Stagsden 
Clay Farmland (1a) that provide a sense of 
containment; 
 
An agricultural landscape fragmented by 
current 
and 
former 
industrial 
activity 
including brick works, open cast clay pits, 
landfill, distribution centres and industrial 
estates; 
 
A legacy of clay extraction (for brick making) 
has resulted in a disturbed landscape, 
currently subject to large scale restoration - 
evoking a landscape in transition;  
 
The establishment of Country Parks and the 
Forest of Marston Vale with its Forest Centre 
provides valuable ecological, recreational 
and landscape resources; 
 
Flooded clay pits form a series of lakes 
throughout the vale such as at Stewartby 
Country 
Park. 
These 
have 
created 
significant recreational value and ecological 
interest; 
 
Mature woodland is relatively scarce; 
 
Arable farming is the predominant land use 
of the area typically occurring in large, open 
fields with short-flailed, sparse hedgerow 
boundaries and drainage channels; 
 
A number of busy transport routes cut north 
south through the landscape - including the 
A421(T) the A6 (forming the eastern 
boundary of the area) and the main railway 
lines running from Bedford to London and 
Milton Keynes; 
 
Lines of pylons cut across the landscape 
and are highly visible - extending from the 
Greensand Ridge; 
Value of LCA: Low (as has strong 
evidence of industrial use and no 
landscape designation) 
 
Susceptibility to Change: Low (as 
many of key characteristics relate to 
former industrial uses)

Forest of Marston Vale 
Landscape Zone: 
Greensand Ridge and East 
Vale (G) 
 
The assessment states that: 
 
The Ridge and its scarp provides one of the 
most wooded areas of the Community 
Forest and is an important backdrop to the 
work planned for the core of the Vale; 
 
Opportunities 
should 
be 
sought 
to 
strengthen the existing woodlands, improve 
the hedgerow network and to add features 
such as copses on knolls; 
 
Points of topographical interest such as 
outcrops of greensand and small valleys 
should not be obscured by planting; 
 
The existing areas of scrub and sites that 
could be developed as acidic grassland 
could offer much to the diversity of the Ridge 
landscape and tree planting must not detract 
from 
this 
variety. 
For 
some 
sites, 
management will be required to maintain the 
diversity of habitats that generates such 
landscape interest; 
 
Villages and infrastructure such as roads 
can be better assimilated into the landscape 
by the planting of more blocks of trees and 
the use of screening belts, but long distance 
views of the Greensand Ridge must not be 
obscured. 
 
Value of LCA: Medium (as the LCA 
covers an extensive area and has a

Forest of Marston Vale 
Landscape Zone: Brickfields 
The assessment states that: 
 
This is the core area of the Vale where there 
is a need to secure a higher level of new 
planting than elsewhere in the Community 
Forest. The derelict land and pits associated 
with 
the 
brick 
industry, 
expanding 
settlements and busy transport links require 
substantial planting to offer landscape, 
wildlife, recreation and amenity benefits; 
 
The relationship of new woods with open 
waterbodies 
such 
as 
Stewartby 
and 
Brogborough lakes will be very important 
and a mix of waterside landuses including 
open land, wetlands and woodland should 
be developed; 
 
Substantial tree and shrub planting will 
encourage a sense of place but wider views 
need to be retained particularly where 
features such as lakes, the Greensand 
Ridge and church towers can be seen; and 
 
Farming is still important in this area and is 
characterised 
by 
large, 
open 
fields 
surrounded by ditches and over trimmed, 
sparse hedges. 
 
Value of LCA: Low (as has strong 
evidence of industrial use and no 
landscape designation) 
 
Susceptibility to Change: Low (as 
many of key characteristics relate to 
former industrial uses) 
 
OVERALL SENSITIVITY: LOW

Introduction  
1.1.1 
This outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy (LEMMS) 
has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook 
Power Ltd. (the Applicant). It outlines the proposed mitigation and management 
measures for the Millbrook Power Project (hereafter referred to as the Project) in 
relation to landscape and ecological management and mitigation.  It covers the 
period from the completion of the landscape works during the operational phase for 
the first ten years, and can be extended up to the decommissioning stage after a 
further 15 years. 
1.1.2 
The Project is proposed at and adjacent to the former clay extraction pit at Rookery 
South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the approximate centre of the Project Site 
at grid reference 501373, 240734.  The boundary of the Project Site falls within both 
Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC) areas.  The 
Project comprises an up to 299 Megawatts (MW) gas fired peaking power generation 
plant which constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 and therefore requires development consent 
under that Act. This document therefore supports the development consent order 
("DCO") Application for the Project.   
1.1.3 
The DCO Application is being made to the Planning Inspectorate pursuant to the 
Planning Act 2008 and in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2009 (the “APFP” Regulations”). 
1.1.4 
This outline strategy is the precursor to a more detailed Landscape and Ecological 
Mitigation and Management Plan which will be prepared should the application be 
successful. 
1.1.5 
The requirement to prepare a final version of the LEMMS is included as a 
Requirement attached to the DCO (Requirement 3 of Document Reference 3.1).  
Purpose of this Document 
1.1.6 
This outline LEMMS augments the mitigation measures included in the 
Environmental Statement (ES) Chapter 11 (Document Reference 6.1): Landscape 
and Visual Impact, and Chapter 8: Ecology, and Appendix 3.2 – Outline Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP), (Document Reference 6.2). Its purpose 
is to: 
 
Provide a clear landscape and ecology mitigation and management rationale, 
which responds to the context of the Project Site; 
 Provide more clearly defined landscape and ecological mitigation; and 
 Provide graphical illustrations of the proposed mitigation.

The Project 
1.1.8 
A full description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3 of the ES however; a brief 
overview is provided below.   
1.1.9 
The Project would comprise: 
 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated 
electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating station as 
a whole, measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. The Power 
Generation Plant comprises: 
 generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust 
gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating 
Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
 a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the 
‘Laydown Area’); 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project

 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length (the 
‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection also 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the 
National Transmission System; and 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to 
the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Connection’), comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would 
require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be located in the 
existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no 
net additional towers). This option would require two SECs, one located on each 
side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would then be connected 
via underground cables approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the 
‘Substation’). 
1.1.10  
1.1.11 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as 
the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant 
Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area.  
1.1.12 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together 
with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land upon which 
the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the 
development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. The Project Site is 
approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is described in more detail in Chapter 3 of 
the ES. 
1.1.13 
A full glossary of defined terms is presented in Appendix 1.1 of the ES. 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
1.1.14 The Project layout has taken into account the landscape receptors, ecological 
features, and mitigation requirements.  In addition, embedded design mitigation 
measures which can often be considered as standard, best practice working 
methods, without which the Project would not be allowed to be developed, have been 
included as follows:  
Landscape Working Methods 
1.1.15 As the construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), 
significant mitigation to limit landscape and visual impacts is not anticipated. 
However, the following will be applied through a CEMP through a Requirement 
attached to the DCO (Requirement 10). An outline CEMP is included in Appendix 
3.2 of the ES: 
 Land / vegetation clearance and occupation will be limited to the minimum area 
necessary for the works; 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
4 
 Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to be retained 
will be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice; 
 Temporary storage of soils and other material considered of value for retention 
will be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice. Where practical, 
stockpiles will be sited to screen the construction works from sensitive receptors 
such as PROW.  
 Construction areas will be laid out to minimise adverse impacts arising from 
temporary structures, construction activities and lighting; 
 Construction roads will be on the same alignment as permanent access roads 
where possible; 
 Use of construction site lighting outside normal working hours will be restricted 
to the minimum necessary for workforce and public safety, and for security. 
Directional luminaries will be used to limit unwanted light spill in accordance with 
guidance provided by the Bat Conservation Trust and Institute of Lighting 
Engineers (2009); 
 Maintenance of tidy and contained site compounds; 
 Hoardings erected around the area of construction works, for reasons of creating 
a visual barrier to construction activities and also as a safety measure, to prevent 
access to the general public; 
 Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary structures and 
stockpiles when no longer required, and prompt reinstatement of construction 
areas; 
 Reinstatement of all agricultural land required temporarily during construction, 
and a five-year aftercare plan to seek to ensure land is returned to its former 
productivity;  
 Replacement of all trees, shrubs and hedgerows removed to accommodate the 
utility Connections, subject to NG planting constraints; and; 
 The AGI will be screened on all sides with vegetation to limit visual impacts. 
Ecological Working Methods 
1.1.16 The CEMP would incorporate measures to protect sensitive ecology such as:  
 Work compounds and access tracks etc. will not be located in, or adjacent to, 
areas that maintain habitat value; 
 Site fencing will be used to prevent access to areas outside working areas, 
particularly in areas adjacent to features of ecological value; 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
5 
 Procedures will be implemented to address site safety issues, including storage 
of potentially dangerous materials; 
 Briefings and instruction would be given to contractors regarding the biodiversity 
issues associated with the Project Site; and 
 Best practice pollution prevention measures would be followed to prevent 
pollution of water courses by silt or chemicals. 
Temporal Scope 
1.1.17 The management plan covers an initial 10-year period commencing at the beginning 
of the construction phase, and will form the basis of a longer term management plan 
for up to 25 years in total, up to the assumed decommissioning date of the project. 
Spatial Scope 
1.1.18 The strategy and management plans cover the whole Project Site. The principal area 
for development of the Power Generation Plant takes up part of the disused Rookery 
South Pit next to Pillinge Farm South.  The Project Site extends to the north between 
the Marston Vale Line and Rookery North Pit to Green Lane in Stewartby and to the 
south the Gas Connection AGI is adjacent to Lower Farm. 
Responsibilities 
1.1.19 The execution of the LEMMS will be the responsibility of the developer / operator of 
the Project, except for certain areas which may be managed by the landowner under 
agreement (e.g. limited areas of new hedge planting along the Gas Connection).  
The LEMMS operations in association with AGI and SECs will be undertaken by 
National Grid and / or the Project operator.  
Plans and Surveys 
1.1.20 In preparing this LEMMS, reference has been made to other documents which also 
support the DCO Application for the Project, namely: 
 Environmental Statement (ES) (Document Reference 6.1); and 
 Ecological Surveys (Appendix 8.1 to 8.5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2));

Baseline Conditions 
Project Site Location 
2.1.1 
The Project would be located in an area known as ‘the Marston Vale’ between Milton 
Keynes and Bedford with the approximate centre of the Project Site at grid reference 
501373, 240734.  The Project Site falls within areas administered by both Central 
Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC).   
The Rookery 
2.1.2 
The Project Site is partially located within ‘The Rookery’.  The Rookery comprises 
two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South) separated by an east-west 
spine of unexcavated clay covering an area of some 210 ha.  The Rookery is situated 
in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford.   
2.1.3 
The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within part of Rookery South 
Pit, which is approximately 95 ha in area and is bounded by steep clay banks that 
are varied in nature and substrate. The level of the pit base currently varies between 
approximately 10 and 15 m below ground level and includes open water, reed beds, 
pools and bare inundated clay.  The land that remains at the original ground level, 
approximately 42 m above ordnance datum (AOD) immediately around the periphery 
of Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground that has been previously cleared 
of vegetation and subsequently maintained in this state over approximately the last 
30 years.  
2.1.4 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would extend from Rookery South 
Pit into farmland to the south and south east. Part of the Access Road would run to 
the west of Rookery North Pit. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme 
2.1.5 
Prior to the commencement of construction works on site a Low Level Restoration 
Scheme (LLRS) will have been undertaken (Appendix 4).  The restoration of the site 
includes the re-grading of the sides of the pit, planting of semi improved grassland, 
trees marsh, marginal aquatics and native hedgerows and scrub and the re-
alignement of surface management ditches.   
2.1.6 
The LLRS provides the baseline for which future mitigation proposals in this LEMMS 
have been proposed.  
Relevant History 
2.1.7 
The area around the Marston Vale has a long history of clay extraction, which was 
used primarily for the brick industry resulting in former clay extraction pits dominating 
the immediate landscape around the Project Site. Some pits have been restored for 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
7 
amenity use (e.g. on the nearby Millennium Country Park), while others have been 
used for landfill (e.g. Stewartby and Brogborough). The Rookery South Pit has 
remained as an open, undeveloped pit.  
2.1.8 
Partial backfilling of Rookery South Pit has been recorded, including deposition of 
non-hazardous liquid organic wastes from a variety of industrial sources.  The waste 
was reportedly mixed with unweathered Oxford Clay deposits commonly known as 
the “callow” and pumped, as sludge, into the south eastern quarter of the Rookery 
North Pit and the north eastern quarter of Rookery South Pit. 
2.1.9 
Additional fill to the base of Rookery South Pit has also been historically undertaken 
by placement of variable thicknesses (generally from 1 m to 4 m) of Callow Clay Fill 
across the base of the pit.  These naturally occurring deposits were unsuitable for 
the brick making process and were cast back into the pit along with brick fragments 
and other overburden deposits. 
2.1.10 The land directly north of the Generating Equipment Site has been allocated to a 
Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) which Covanta Rookery South Limited obtained 
DCO consent for pursuant to the PA 2008 in autumn 2011 (the ‘Covanta RRF 
Project’).  
Landscape Character 
2.1.11 Published sources describing the landscape character of the area at the National, 
Regional and District level are: 
 National Character Area 88: Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands 
(Natural England, 2014a);  
 National Character Area 90: Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge (Natural England, 
2014b);

 The Forest of Marston Vale: Forest Plan (The Forest of Marston Vale, 2000) 
2.1.12 Figure 11.3 of the ES illustrates landscape character areas applicable to the Project 
Site and surrounding area.  
Ecological Character 
2.1.13 Baseline conditions of the Power Generation Plant Site include the Rookery South 
Clay Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS). The 
base of the western parts of Rookery South Pit presently comprises a mosaic of 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project

sparsely vegetated and bare ground, with occasional channels and pools of standing 
water supporting emergent vegetation including reed grasses and sedges.   
2.1.14 In the past, Rookery South Clay Pit supported a large population of great crested 
newts, a small population of grass snakes and a medium population of common 
lizards, along with a valuable invertebrate fauna and numerous bird species of 
conservation importance.  Trapping and translocation of great crested newts (and 
reptiles) has taken place under a mitigation licence, issued by Natural England in 
2011 as part of the LLRS. This has affected the southern half of the Rookery Clay 
Pit CWS incorporating the southern portion of the Access Road and a proportion of 
the arable land in the south of the Project Site. The translocation programme was 
completed in November 2014. Significant areas of the western half of the base of 
Rookery South Pit were levelled following completion of the translocation exercise, 
and during an ecological walkover survey undertaken by PBA in April 2017, it was 
noted that herpetofauna exclusion fencing had been retained in situ. At the time that 
the Project is constructed in 2020, it is assumed that no great crested newts or 
reptiles will be present in the base of the Rookery South Pit and surrounding area. 
In addition, the LLRS re-profiling works will replace any terrestrial habitat currently 
suitable for great crested newts, reptiles, breeding birds and/or invertebrates within 
Rookery South Pit with clay, rendering it of negligible nature conservation value for 
these species.   
2.1.15 The surrounds of the pit comprise a patchy mosaic of bare ground, species-poor 
neutral grassland and woodland/scrub habitats that have developed since clay 
extraction ceased.  The access track comprises a mosaic of bare ground with 
ephemeral vegetation and scrub, which is known to be used as a commuting and 
foraging route by a range of bat species. In addition, suitable terrestrial habitat along 
the track is likely to be used by great crested newts and reptiles, and the trees and 
scrub are likely to be used by nesting birds.  
2.1.16 The majority of the habitats within the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Connection route comprise intensively managed agricultural land, characterised by 
large arable fields, with grassy field margins which are bound by young species-poor 
hedgerows. A small number of plantation woodlands, which appear to be relatively 
recent in origin (less than 30 years old) are present within the areas proposed for 
the Gas and Electrical Connection. Parts of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection (e.g. the Substation) are within Rookery South Pit. These are assumed 
to be the same as the Power Generation Plant Site.  
2.1.17 Two great crested newt meta-populations are located within 250m of the Gas and 
Electrical Connection area.  In addition, small populations of reptiles (common 
lizards and grass snake) have been recorded within the Gas and Electrical 
Connection areas. In addition, the hedgerows are likely to be used by nesting and 
foraging birds.

Ecological Features 
3.1.1 
In order to determine the ecological features for which ecological mitigation 
measures are required for the Project, an evaluation of ecological features was 
undertaken having regards to the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management’s (CIEEM) Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (2016).  
Ecological features that were deemed to be important, and therefore required full 
consideration in the impact assessment were identified. These features are those 
that are important within a ‘Local’ context or greater. Only one important ecological 
feature has been identified: Rookery Clay Pit CWS. Further information is provided 
in Chapter 8 of the ES.   
3.1.2 
A number of ecological features are considered to be of insufficient importance to 
trigger a detailed assessment.  Nevertheless, due to their protection under the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) and/ or the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), consideration needs to be given 
to appropriate management measures during the design and implementation of the 
Project, which are required to avoid a breach of legislation.  These are described 
below.  
Important Ecological Features 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
3.1.3 
There will be direct habitat loss within Rookery Clay Pit CWS associated with the 
construction of the Power Generation Plant.  As identified above, the re-grading 
works associated with the LLRS within Rookery South Pit will replace any terrestrial 
habitat suitable for newts, reptiles, breeding birds and/ or reptiles.  Impacts are 
therefore limited to the loss of any new habitat that would have been created 
associated as part of the LLRS restoration strategy, in the absence of the Project, 
and the areas of ephemeral vegetation and scrub habitat on the peripheral areas of 
the western edge of Rookery North Pit, including along the Access Road, if 
vegetation removal is required.   Given that the LLRS will be completed by the time 
of construction of the Project, and Rookery North Pit will be retained, the effect of 
habitat loss upon Rookery Clay Pit CWS before mitigation is considered to be ‘Not 
Significant’.   
Other ecological features requiring appropriate management to avoid a breach 
of legislation 
Designated sites 
3.1.4 
There is one SSSI within 2 km of the Power Generation Plant Site. Coopers Hill SSSI 
is approximately 1.2 km to the south-east.  A further 11 non-statutory designated 
sites are present within 2 km of the Project Site.  
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
10 
3.1.5 
Given the distances of these statutory and non-statutory designated sites from the 
Power Generation Plant Site, the risk of dust and particulate matter emissions during 
construction and decommissioning of the Project is considered to be low.  No direct 
or indirect impacts are anticipated, and no specific mitigation is deemed necessary.   
Great crested newts 
3.1.6 
At the time of construction, it is assumed that Rookery South Pit will remain free of 
great crested newts. However, the existing access track, along the alignment of the 
Access Road, on the western edge of Rookery North Pit, comprises areas of scrub, 
ephemeral vegetation and bare ground with cracks and crevices. These habitats, 
including the voids in the bare ground, could be used by the meta-population of great 
crested newts supported by Rookery North Pit during their terrestrial phase.  The 
potential exists for construction of the Access Road to result in incidental harm to 
great crested newts using suitable features associated with terrestrial habitat along 
the route of the Access Road.   
3.1.7 
Surveys have confirmed the presence of one small population of great crested newts 
and one medium population of great crested newts within the Gas and Electrical 
Connection area.   
3.1.8 
Great crested newts are relatively common in the county and are widespread within 
the vicinity of the Project Site (comprising four meta-populations recorded during the 
surveys, a large population associated with the receptor sites from the Rookery 
South Pit translocation, and robust meta-populations known to occur elsewhere 
within the base of Marston Vale). The great crested newt populations associated 
with the Project Site are therefore considered to be of less than ‘Local’ importance.   
Reptiles 
3.1.9 
The existing access track along the alignment of the Access Road, on the western 
edge of Rookery North Pit comprises areas of scrub, ephemeral vegetation and bare 
ground with cracks and crevices which could be used by common species of reptiles 
associated with Rookery North Pit. In addition, small populations of common lizard 
and grass snakes were recorded within the Gas and Electrical Connection, although 
the areas affected are considered to be of limited value, due to the intense 
management of the arable farmland.   
3.1.10 Given that other similar habitat is widespread in Marston Vale and the surrounding 
area, and that only small to medium populations of reptiles have been confirmed 
during the baseline surveys, the reptile populations within the Project Site are 
considered to be of less than ‘Local’ importance. 
Nesting birds 
3.1.11 The areas of scrub along the existing access track can be expected to support 
nesting birds.  The majority of the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Connection are of limited value for breeding birds, consisting of large arable fields, 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
11 
delineated by species-poor hedgerows and ditches.  Overall, the assemblage of 
breeding birds associated with the Project Site is considered to be of less than ‘Local’ 
importance. 
Bats 
3.1.12 The majority of bats were recorded foraging and commuting along the scrub-lined 
access track, which constitutes a ‘green corridor’, linking the known bat roosts at 
South Pillinge Farm, with valuable foraging habitat to the north, associated with 
Rookery North Pit and beyond.  The bat populations associated with the Project Site 
are considered to be of less than ‘Local’ importance.

Landscape & Ecological Mitigation Proposals 
Overview 
4.1.1 
The Landscape and Ecology Strategy Plan (Appendix 2) includes the creation of a 
new structurally diverse and species-rich belt of woodland planting to reflect the 
species composition within the wider Marston Vale Forest.  Additional planting and 
appropriate management of existing blocks of planted woodland would be expected 
to enhance their nature conservation value.  Native species of local provenance will 
be used, wherever possible. These new areas of planting linking existing habitats 
would be expected to increase the connectivity of the Project Site for wildlife. The 
planting proposed has been designed to ensure the value for biodiversity is 
maximised, whilst performing a landscape screening function.   
4.1.2 
The surface water management ditches proposed as part of the LLRS have been 
incorporated into the LEMMS for the Project, albeit with minor realignments to the 
south of the Generating Equipment and Substation. In addition, a series of small 
ponds will be created within the Project Site, designed to be of value to wildlife, with 
shallow sloping edges planted with marginal vegetation to provide egg laying 
opportunities for newts. This new pond creation would also contribute towards 
relevant targets in the Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Action Plan. The exact 
location of the ponds would be defined prior to construction, in liaison with 
stakeholders. 
Project Landscape Strategy 
Introduction 
4.1.3 
It is anticipated that where possible, existing planting within the Project Site will be 
retained and protected.  Where it is necessary for vegetation to be removed, the 
extent will be kept to a minimum and it will be replanted within the Project Site 
following construction. 
4.1.4 
A palette of native tree and shrub planting (see Appendix 1) has been compiled to 
meet the various planting scenarios identified within this LEMMS. 
Planting proposals 
4.1.5 
The planting species that form the basis of the landscape planting strategy on site 
are detailed in Appendix 1, and include the following: 
 New structural planting; 
 Trees; 
 Hedgerows, both general mixed native hedgerow planting and hawthorn and 
blackthorn only hedgerows crossing easements; 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
13 
 Grassland seeding; and 
 Scrub planting. 
Ecological Mitigation Strategy 
Overview 
4.1.6 
Given that no likely significant effects are predicted on important ecological features 
(Rookery Pit CWS), no project specific mitigation is required in addition to the 
embedded design mitigation described in Chapter 3, section 3.6 of the ES and 
outlined in the CEMP (Appendix 3.2).   
4.1.7 
The LEMMS for the Project will ensure that any habitats of ecological value that 
would have been created as part of the LLRS (in the absence of the Project) will be 
incorporated into the design of the Project.  This includes surface water management 
ditches, and areas of woodland, tree and scrub planting.  Should the construction of 
the Access Road result in the loss of any vegetation, this would be replanted with 
appropriate native species, to maintain the bat foraging and commuting corridor.  In 
addition, the enhancement of retained vegetation and creation of new habitats, 
through woodland, tree and hedgerow planting and new ponds would be expected 
to result in a net gain in biodiversity. 
4.1.8 
The Landscape Strategy associated with the Covanta RRF project has been taken 
into account when designing the LEMMS for the Project.  All areas of proposed 
planting and habitat creation associated with the Covanta RRF project have been 
taken into account in the context of the outline LEMMS. Should areas of landscape 
mitigation planted as part of the Covanta RRF Project need to be disturbed by the 
construction of the Project, provision has been made for the areas to be replaced, 
re-planted or equivalent planting placed appropriately so as not to detract from the 
overall mitigation screening or habitat creation originally envisaged by the Covanta 
RRF landscape and ecology strategy.  If mitigation planting used at the Covanta 
RRF Project is disturbed by the Project, it would be the responsibility of the developer 
of the Project to replace this planting.   
4.1.9 
Details showing the landscape and ecology mitigation strategy for the Project 
integrated with the landscape planting proposed as part of the Covanta RRF Project 
(e.g. assuming both projects co-exist) are provided in Appendix 3.  
Great crested newts 
4.1.10 Great crested newts and their places of shelter are protected under the Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended).  They are also protected 
under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  The management 
measures identified below are required in order to avoid the incidental mortality of 
great crested newts during the implementation of the Project, and to ensure that the 
favourable conservation status of the local great crested newt population is 
maintained.  
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
14 
4.1.11 Whilst no ponds would be directly affected by the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant or Gas Connection or Electrical Connection, short sections of the 
Access Road are located approximately 490 m from the Rookery North Pit large 
population of great crested newts. The potential therefore exists for the incidental 
mortality of great crested newts, associated with the re-surfacing works.  Similarly, 
the Electrical Connection will be installed within 250 m of Pond C (see Appendix 5) 
which supports a small population of great crested newts; a narrow strip of planted 
woodland will be removed to facilitate the trench installation.  In addition, five 
sections of hedgerows will be removed, four of which are located within 250 m of 
Pond H (see Appendix 5).  However, given the distances involved, the limited 
suitability of the habitats affected, and the presence of more suitable terrestrial 
habitat nearby the likelihood of encountering great crested newts has been assessed 
as being low in each instance.   
4.1.12 Using Natural England’s Rapid Risk Assessment tool, the likelihood of an offence 
being committed as a result of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
installation is considered to be ‘highly unlikely’.  Any requirement to carry out the 
works under a precautionary method statement included within the CEMP or a 
derogation licence issued by Natural England to ensure that no newts are harmed 
during the construction process, will be determined prior to construction. This will be 
based on the historical context of mitigation works associated with great crested 
newts in and adjacent to the Project Site. If required, appropriate mitigation 
measures will involve the appropriate timing of works, avoidance of suitable 
terrestrial habitat as far as possible, and the careful removal/ dismantling by hand of 
any suitable refugia beneath the footprint of the works.     
Reptiles 
4.1.13 Reptiles are afforded protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended).  Any elements of the Project affecting the limited areas of potential reptile 
habitat will give due regard to the legislation protecting common and widespread 
reptile species, i.e. protection against injury and killing.  This will be achieved through 
the displacement of any reptiles present into areas of retained habitat within and 
adjacent to the Project Site prior to construction works commencing through the 
following approach: 
 Progressive removal of suitable low-lying vegetation, including long grass, 
ruderals and scrub, using hand-held tools.  The final stages of clearance to 
ground level should take place during suitable climatic conditions at a time of 
year when reptiles are active (generally April to September inclusive). 
 Dismantling of any potential hibernacula or refugia by hand, including compost 
heaps and log piles. 
 Where appropriate, ground level clearance work will be overseen by a suitably 
experienced ecologist who would relocate any reptiles encountered to an area of 
suitable retained habitat within and adjacent to the site. 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
15 
 Following the clearance of vegetation, the vegetation will be maintained at ground 
level to prevent re-colonisation prior to works commencing. 
Nesting birds 
4.1.14 Nesting birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended).  Any clearance or cutting of woody vegetation will avoid the breeding bird 
season (generally taken to be March to August inclusive) in order to avoid the 
destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the vegetation will be checked 
prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' nests.  If active nests are 
present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be retained around the nest and such 
works will be delayed until the young birds have fledged and the nest becomes 
inactive.   
Bats 
4.1.15 All species of bats in the UK are European protected species, receiving protection 
under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended).  
They are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). 
4.1.16 The lighting scheme associated with the construction and operation of the Project 
has been sensitively designed to minimise potential impacts on bats in accordance 
with guidance provided by the Bat Conservation Trust and Institute of Lighting 
Engineers (2009).  As a minimum, down-lighting and motion-sensitive lights will be 
used, and light spill will be minimised by the use of baffles, as appropriate to avoid 
disturbance effects on the known bat roost associated with the South Pillinge Farm.  
An outline lighting strategy is included as Appendix 11.2 of the ES.

Landscape and Ecological Management 
Establishment & Management 
Protection of Valuable Features during Construction 
5.1.1 
In order to retain and protect existing trees and hedgerows, temporary fencing will 
be erected in accordance with British Standard BS5837:2012 ‘Trees in relation to 
design, demolition and construction’.  
5.1.2 
BS5837:2012, would also be followed which sets out, amongst other things, 
operations not permitted within the protected zones of trees, and describes suitable 
fencing types depending on their proximity to construction activity and the potential 
vulnerability of plant material to construction damage. Fencing will be erected at the 
commencement of the construction phase and be maintained until practical 
completion.  
Services 
5.1.3 
Landscape proposals will be coordinated with drainage, mechanical and electrical 
services layouts as far as they are available prior to the design being completed. 
5.1.4 
Liaison would be undertaken with National Grid Gas (NGG) and National Grid 
Electricity and Transmission (NGET) to ensure that any mitigation planting within the 
Gas Connection or Electrical Connection is undertaken in accordance with this 
strategy.  
Programme for Vegetation Removal and Management 
5.1.5 
Any clearance or cutting of woody vegetation will ideally avoid the nesting bird 
season (generally taken to be March to August inclusive) in order to avoid the 
destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the vegetation will be checked 
prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' nests.  If active nests are 
present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be retained around the nest and such 
works will be delayed until the young birds have fledged and the nest becomes 
inactive.   
Management of Vegetation Prior to Implementation of the Landscape Scheme 
5.1.6 
Hedgerow pruning will be carried out using a reciprocating blade cutter to reduce the 
height of 3-5m. Sides will be cut back. Standard trees are to remain uncut and be 
allowed to grow on. 
5.1.7 
Where overgrown hedges require rejuvenating, they will be coppiced to 150 mm in 
height.

Annual Maintenance Operations  
Generally 
5.1.20 The management regime is described below in terms of the scope and frequency of 
annual maintenance operations. These are relevant throughout the whole 
management period, and particularly in years 1-5 during the establishment of woody 
and herbaceous plant material. 
5.1.21 A health and safety method statement will be agreed between the Project developer 
and contractor regarding the types of maintenance machinery and chemicals to be 
used on-site. 
5.1.22 Should any new construction works be required on-site, or additional services be 
installed, new and original vegetation is to be protected as set out in paragraphs 
5.1.1 - 5.1.2. 
5.1.23 The timing of tree and hedgerow works will comply with paragraphs 4.1.14 and 5.1.5. 
5.1.24 All tree works will be undertaken by a qualified arboriculturalist or tree surgeon. 
Works are to comply with BS3998 and HSE Forestry and Arboricultural safety 
leaflets. Trees are to be left with a well-balanced shape and natural appearance. 
Chainsaw operatives must hold a certificate of competence. Chain or hand saw 
wounds will be as small as possible, cutting back to sound wood leaving a smooth 
surface, angled to shed the water and avoiding bark tears. 
Planted Woodland / mature trees 
5.1.25 In order to ensure longevity of trees in good condition and prevent potential instability 
as a result of severed roots, no compaction, excavation, digging of service trenches, 
or level changes are to take place within a zone extending from a tree trunk to at 
least 2 m beyond the outer edge of the tree canopy (for deciduous trees) or an area 
with a radius of half the trees height measured from the trunk (for evergreen 
varieties). These dimensions are relevant where root protection areas (RPA) have 
not been established as part of a recent (within 3 years) arboricultural survey. Where 
such a survey has been undertaken, the dimensions provided by the arboriculturalist 
are to be used. Within woodlands, RPAs are likely to be continuous. 
5.1.26 Outside RPAs described above, tree roots over 50 mm diameter will not be cut. 
Where cutting takes place, it will by means of a smooth cut with a hand saw, followed 
by backfilling over tree roots with original topsoil. 
5.1.27 Inspections will be carried out at 12-15 month intervals to note any: 
 major deadwood that needs to be removed from crowns; 
 split or damaged branches, storm damage, hung-up limbs, and jagged or open 
wounds that require tidying; 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
23 
 forks, cavities and major defects that could result in structural failure, cavities, 
cracks or bark wounds at the base of trees, together with bracket fungus. An 
arboriculturalist will probe cavities as required to determine the course of action; 
 basal suckers or epicormic growth that require removal from the main trunk; 
 poor quality trees with structural defects, such as forked trunks that may require 
pruning or felling; and 
 areas of disease. 
5.1.28 Ivy on tree trunks will be retained, except where it needs to be removed to facilitate 
inspection of trees or where it has become extensive and could result in a tree falling 
in high winds. 
5.1.29 Removal of litter and fly-tipped material will be carried out four times a year. 
New Structure Planting 
5.1.30 Operations will ensure: 
 dead, dying and diseased wood and suckers will be removed annually to promote 
healthy growth, a natural shape and to avoid health and safety concerns; 
 dead, missing, dying or defective plants will be replaced annually for the first 5 
years after implementation; 
 all tree stakes, ties and guards will be adjusted/replaced/removed as required 
until anchorage has been achieved. This will be done biannually; 
 rabbit/deer protection will be maintained until no longer needed. This will be 
checked four times a year; 
 weed-free ground will be maintained with the use of translocated, non-residual 
herbicides, until the canopy closes, in order to avoid competition for water and 
nutrients. This will be done eight times a year, reducing to three times a year 
when the canopy is closed; 
 a slow release fertiliser will be spread annually in early March in the first three 
years after planting or replanting after defects replacements; 
 litter and fly-tipped material will be removed four times a year; 
 plants overhanging roads or paths or starting to encroach onto public footpaths 
will be trimmed back annually; 
 bramble or other invasive weeds will be removed through the use of herbicides 
and/or by digging up; 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
24 
 self-sown trees will be removed annually by digging up or use of suitable 
herbicides; 
 plants will be watered in dry weather in the initial 3-year establishment period. 
Watering will be carried out twice a week to field capacity. Beyond the 
establishment period, watering will be in times of drought; 
 pruning will take place annually to avoid obstruction of sightlines, visibility splays, 
traffic signs and access points; and 
 formative pruning of young trees annually. 
5.1.31 Management operations will ensure: 
 root protection zones are identified by an arboriculturalist where construction or 
service trenching is anticipated. To ensure longevity of trees in good condition, 
and ensure no potential instability as a result of severed roots, no compaction, 
excavation, digging of service trenches, or level changes are to take place within 
the root protection zones established as part of a recent (within 3 years) 
arboricultural survey; 
 no fertilisers or pesticides will be spread near roots or trunks of trees; and 
 litter and fly-tipped material will be removed four times a year. 
New Trees 
5.1.32 Operations will ensure: 
 new plantings provide a diversity of species, varied height and structure; 
 dead, dying and diseased wood and suckers will be removed annually to promote 
healthy growth, a natural shape and to avoid health and safety concerns; 
 dead, missing, dying or defective plants will be replaced annually for the first 5 
years after implementation; 
 all tree stakes, ties and guards will be adjusted/replaced/removed as required 
until anchorage has been achieved. This will be done biannually; 
 rabbit/deer protection will be maintained until no longer needed. This will be 
checked four times a year; 
 new trees are protected from livestock browsing. This will be checked four times 
a year; 
 weed-free ground will be maintained with the use of translocated, non-residual 
herbicides, until the canopy closes, in order to avoid competition for water and 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
25 
nutrients. This will be done eight times a year, reducing to three times a year 
when the canopy is closed; 
 a slow release fertiliser will be spread annually in early March in the first three 
years after planting or replanting after defects replacements; 
 plants will be watered in dry weather in the initial 3-year establishment period. 
Watering will be carried out twice a week to field capacity. Beyond the 
establishment period, watering will be in times of drought; 
 trees are maintained upright and adjustments will be made following strong 
winds; and 
 formative pruning will be carried out. 
Mature Hedgerows 
5.1.33 Objectives in relation to mature hedgerows are to: 
 thin trees to centres no closer than 6 m, retaining the best quality specimens to 
grow on as standards within the hedge; 
 trim sides to within 1.0m of the main stems and tops to 3-5m on a 3-year 
rotational basis across the site. Where possible, leave one side of each 
hedgerow uncut each year. This will maintain a resource of flowering and fruiting 
plants across the site and create nesting and foraging habitat for wildlife; 
 cut ground flora at the base of hedges on a 3-year rotation to 150 mm height, 
with arisings removed. This is to maximise the value of the habitat for 
overwintering and foraging insects, and prevent scrub establishment. Cutting is 
to take place in October/November. 
New Hedgerows 
5.1.34 Maintenance operations will ensure: 
 the base of hedges will be kept weed-free manually or by applications of a 
translocated non-residual herbicide. This will be done eight times a year. 
Maintenance input will reduce after Year 5, when continuous hedgerows should 
be achieved. Weeding, watering, fertiliser applications and topping up the mulch 
are key to achieving successful establishment; 
 litter and fly-tipped material will be removed four times a year; 
 plants will be watered in dry weather in the initial 3-year establishment period. 
Watering will be carried out twice a week to field capacity. Beyond the 
establishment period, watering will be in times of drought; 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
26 
 composted woodbark mulch will be topped up annually to 75mm depth for the 
first 3 years after implementation to suppress weeds and retain moisture; 
 rabbit/deer protection will be retained/replaced until no longer needed. This is to 
be checked four times a year; 
 a slow release fertiliser will be applied annually in March; 
 all bamboo canes or tree stakes will be adjusted/replaced/removed as necessary 
once plants are anchored. This will be carried out four times a year; 
 plants will remain upright. Any adjustments will be made four times a year; 
 plants will be pruned annually to remove any dead, lying or diseased wood and 
suckers to promote healthy growth and a natural shape; 
 dead, dying, defective or missing plants will be replaced annually for the first five 
years after planting; and 
 once established, hedgerows will be cut to 3-5m in height. Sides will be cut back 
to within 1.0m of the main stems to create bases that are wider than the top of 
the hedgerows. This will be carried out between November and mid-February 
using a reciprocating blade cutter, not a flail. It will take place annually on a 3-
year rotation, with one third of hedgerows being pruned each year. Individual 
trees will be allowed to grown on. Management operations will ensure: 
 rubbish, vegetation and litter will be removed, including adjacent to any pipes, 
overflows or grates. This will be done biannually; 
 marginals and aquatics will be allowed to find their own equilibrium, and this is 
dependent upon unpredictable water levels; 
 dead foliage/flower stems will be cut down annually in early autumn; 
 vegetation removed from drainage/water features will be left on the sides for 48 
hours for invertebrates to crawl back into the pond, and then removed; 
 wildflower areas or grass above the waterline will be cut as set out above. 
Reseeding will not take place where grass/wildflowers have died out due to 
regular water inundation; and 
 a more open aspect to ditches will be created to reduce overshadowing and 
promote the Periodic Management Operations.  
5.1.35 In addition, other operations will be required intermittently; notably, pruning, 
woodland thinning and coppicing. Approximate years when these are required have 
been set out, although regular site monitoring will be required to respond to 
unpredictable events, poor plant establishment rates, extreme weather, etc.

5.1.36 A health and safety method statement will be agreed between the client and 
contractor regarding the types of maintenance machinery and chemicals to be used 
on-site. 
5.1.37 Should any new construction works be required on-site, or additional services be 
installed, new and original vegetation is to be protected as set out in paragraphs 
5.1.1 - 5.1.2. 
5.1.38 The timing of tree, hedgerow and ditch clearance works will comply with paragraph 
4.1.14 and 5.1.5. 
5.1.39 Where woodland thinning involves trees with a stem diameter over 100 mm, a felling 
licence is required where more than 5 m³ of timber is felled per calendar quarter 
provided that no more than 2 m³ is sold. To avoid felling licences, felling should be 
undertaken quarterly over a number of years, with priority areas tackled first.

be retained at the expense of short-lived varieties. Mature and overmature 
specimens will be retained as veterans. Formative pruning will be undertaken to 
retained trees. Some standing deadwood will be retained for wildlife, providing it 
poses no health and safety risks. Thinning will ensure that remaining canopies are 
not touching. Anticipated centres are 5m after Years 6-9; 8m at Years 15-20 and 
8-10m at Year 25 for new structure planting. Cut stumps will be treated to stop 
regeneration.

silt will be removed from the bed of the ditches over their entire length, but 'pockets' 
of silt will be retained in specified areas, where this would not restrict flow or 
compromise flood defence. Desilting will progress in an upstream direction to aid 
rapid recolonisation of the desilted and disturbed substrate. It is envisaged that

it is envisaged that weed control from alternate sides will be carried out on a 3-5 
year rotation, in September/October. 
* 
 
deposition of materials will follow the Environment Agency's best practice 
guidance set out in 'Disposal of Cut Vegetation' (1999). Submerged vegetation 
removed from the watercourse will be deposited on the top of the banks for a 48-
hour period, to enable mobile aquatic species to return to the water. The material 
will be deposited away from any sensitive areas so, for example, the valuable 
plant communities are not smothered.

(Requirement 3). Implementation of the CEMP and the other measures during 
construction will be the responsibility of the Project developer. 
Operation 
6.1.2 
During operation, two mitigation measures are proposed: a lighting scheme to 
reduce disturbance from operational lighting and a drainage design to avoid pollution 
of waterbodies. These will be secured as Requirements attached to the DCO 
(Requirements 14 and 7 respectively). Both will provide for ongoing maintenance 
activities and will be implemented by the site staff operating on site at the time. 
Please note that should great crested newts be found, additional measures may be 
required during operation.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1.1 
The statement sets out the lighting concept for the operation of the Millbrook Power Project. 
Lighting measures to minimise the adverse effect of artificial lighting during construction are set 
out in the Outline Construction and Environmental Management Plant (CEMP). 
2 
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 
2.1.1 
The overarching philosophy underpinning the design of the lighting for the Project is, as far as 
possible, to maintain a ‘dark’ site. Only critical light sources, such as emergency exit illumination 
and security lighting at low level, will remain on during the night. 
2.1.2 
For the Generating Equipment Site a curfew will be implemented for all non-critical lighting from 
23.00 to 05.00 hrs to reduce the impact of the development on the local environment. This means 
that all non-critical lighting will be switched off during these hours via a time clock. Routes and 
entrances not in constant use will be controlled via a movement detector or manual switch, 
ensuring that lighting in these areas will be switched off the vast majority of the time. 
2.1.3 
External lighting for the Substation and Above Ground Installation (AGI) will only be required for 
routine and unplanned maintenance activity. The need for external lighting within the Above 
Ground Installation and Substation will be infrequent. Infrared floodlighting and CCTV systems will 
be used for security purposes. 
2.1.4 
Internal lighting will be required within buildings for occupational and operational requirements, 
though appropriate measures will be included for reducing light spill. 
2.1.5 
The level of lighting within open compounds will be sufficient to allow the safe movement of 
pedestrians and vehicles (using their headlights) about the compound in areas that they might 
reasonably be expected to negotiate at night. It is not intended to facilitate planned or unplanned 
maintenance activities for which additional localised portable equipment will be required. 
2.1.6 
All luminaires will have the necessary optical control and be appropriately aimed to completely 
omit direct upward light emission. Luminaires shall also be positioned and aimed so that so that 
peak light intensities from any fitting do not unintentionally illuminate any building or structural 
façade. 
2.1.7 
The lighting design for the operation of the Generating Equipment will be developed to comply 
with the Institution of Lighting Engineers publication: Guidance Notes for the Reduction of 
Obtrusive Light: a recognised best practice guide for the reduction of light pollution. 
2.1.8 
The lighting design for the National Grid substation will be developed to comply with Civil, 
Structural and Building Engineering Design Handbook, DH10 issue 4. 
2.1.9 
The lighting design for the AGI will be developed to comply with National Grid standard 
T/PM/EL/1. 
2.1.10 
The main drivers for the design are; 
 The health and safety of employees and visitors performing normal working duties.

 The safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic around the Project Site during the 
hours of darkness. 
 To minimise light pollution in terms of light trespass, sky glow and glare. 
 The security of the Project Site and its occupants including lighting suitable for the correct 
functioning of the preferred CCTV system

EXTERNAL LIGHTING BY AREA 
3.1.1 
For the purposes of this indicative lighting design, the Project site has been split into six zones. 
- 
Zone 1: Generating Equipment Site internal roads (excluding the national grid substation) 
- 
Zone 2: Comprising the gas turbine generator area, including the generator step-up 
transformer and fin fan coolers; 
- 
Zone 3: Comprising the gas receiving facility within the power generation plant; 
- 
Zone 4: Comprising water tanks and emergency diesel generator; 
- 
Zone 5: Comprising the national grid substation 
- 
Zone 6: Above Ground Installation (AGI) 
3.1.2 
Please note the Access Road will not be illuminated. 
3.2 
ZONE 1: SITE ROADS AND CAR PARKING 
3.2.1 
The site internal roads will be lit by column mounted road luminaires. The overall lantern mounting 
height will be at 6 m. The critical road lighting will operate during the hours of darkness using a 
timeclock or photocell. 
3.3 
ZONE 2: GAS TURBINE GENERATOR AREA 
3.3.1 
The gas turbine generator will be lit by building mounted equipment. The lighting will be provided 
by flood lights. The lighting in this area will be group switched from the control room so the lighting 
is operated only when required. 
3.3.2 
Where required column mounted equipment at 8m above the working plane will also be used. 
3.3.3 
The road lighting also contributes to the illumination in Zone 2. 
3.4 
ZONES 3 AND 4 – OPEN AREAS 
3.4.1 
Lighting of open areas such as the water tank area and gas receiving facility will use column 
mounted equipment at 8m above the working plane. 
3.4.2 
The lighting in this area will be group switched from the control room so the lighting is operated 
only when required. 
3.4.3 
Where equipment is mounted on columns, the columns will be hinged to be lowered for 
maintenance purposes. 
3.5 
ZONE 5 – NATIONAL GRID SUBSTATION 
3.5.1 
Lighting of the substation compound will use column mounted equipment at 8m above the 
working plane. The lighting design will be developed to comply with National Grid’s design 
guidelines. The lighting in this area will be group switched from the substation control room so the 
lighting is operated only when required.

3.6 
AGI 
3.6.1 
The lighting of the AGI will use column mounted equipment at 8m above the working plane. The 
lighting design will be developed to comply with National Grid standard T/PM/EL/1. The lighting in 
this area will be operated via a manual switch so the lighting is operated only when required.

LIGHTING EQUIPMENT 
4.1.1 
All luminaires used are designed to minimise upward light spill and are adjustable in elevation to 
allow for re-alignment so that light can be directed to avoid light spill above the horizontal. 
4.1.2 
Luminaires will employ high efficiency integral control gear to minimise circuit parasitic power 
losses and, where appropriate, will be controlled by a site wide lighting control system to minimise 
waste light output. 
4.1.3 
All external luminaires will be ingress protected to a minimum standard of IP44 and will be chosen 
to suit any hazardous areas as identified during detailed design. 
4.2 
GENERIC EQUIPMENT AND INSTALLATION 
4.2.1 
Lighting buildings will have a significant impact on the level of light spill produced. Equally 
important is the choice of lighting equipment and lighting techniques. This general guidance will 
be followed when selecting equipment and lighting techniques. 
 
Fixed head lanterns will not emit any direct light above horizontal 
 
Movable luminaries will be tilted so that no light is being emitted above horizontal

Lantern heights will be increased where feasible to reduce tilt angles 
 
Quality luminaire optics will be used which accurately control light distribution and do not spill light 
into the atmosphere

LIGHTING CONTROL 
5.1.1 
External lighting control will form part of the overall lighting control system. Operators will have the 
ability to override any lighting circuit and, where appropriate, individual luminaires from the 
Control Room. The general lighting control philosophy is for the lighting to be controlled by a 
combination of time clock and photocell arrangements with additional local control for open 
compound lighting, perimeter lighting around buildings and external stairs and platforms with 
automatic delayed off controls where appropriate. The use of digital dimming will be considered to 
further reduce energy consumption. 
5.1.2 
The site internal road lighting will be controlled using a timeclock or photocell to restrict operation 
to the hours of darkness. Other site lighting will be controlled using group switching from the 
control room and only used when required for tasks in that area to avoid unnecessary light 
emission. 
5.1.3 
It is noted that this site may be unmanned and therefore road and site lighting may not be 
required at all times. The final lighting scheme will consider the planned operation of the site and 
will reduce the amount of lighting as appropriate for an unmanned site.
