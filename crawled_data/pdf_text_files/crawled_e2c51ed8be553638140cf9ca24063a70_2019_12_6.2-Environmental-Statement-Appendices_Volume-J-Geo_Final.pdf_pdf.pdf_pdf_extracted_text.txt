Introduction 
1.1 
Preamble 
1.1.1 
Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) has been instructed by Millbrook Power Ltd (the Applicant) to 
undertake a Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (GCA) for an area of land (the Project Site) 
that lies within and around the Rookery South clay pit, approximately 1km to the south of the 
village of Stewartby, in Marston Vale, Bedfordshire. A site location plan is presented as Figure 
1. 
1.1.2 
This report has been prepared to support a Development Consent Order (DCO) application to 
develop the Project Site for the construction of a proposed gas fired electricity peaking plant. 
1.1.3 
The Project would comprise: 
• 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW.  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the terminals of 
the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
- generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
- a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
- a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’); 
• 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length (the ‘Pipeline’) 
to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System 
(the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection also incorporates an Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System; and 
• 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National 
Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), comprising an 
underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will replace 
an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route 
corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two SECs, 
one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would then be 
connected via underground cables approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the 
‘Substation’). 
1.1.4 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the ‘Power 
Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant Site’. The Power 
Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area.  
1.1.5 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with all 
access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would be 
developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the ‘Project Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is 
described in more detail in Chapter 3. 
1.1.6 
A full glossary of defined terms is presented in Appendix 1.1 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.2).

1.2 
Background 
1.2.1 
The Rookery South clay pit (comprising an area of approximately 95 ha) and adjoining Rookery 
North clay pit (approximately 70 ha), were previously used for clay extraction of the Oxford Clay 
Formation to use in brick manufacture at the Stewartby Brickworks. The former clay pits have 
been largely worked out (clay extraction ceased in 1986), with basal levels up until May 2017 in 
the Rookery South pit left largely as they were after excavation apart from some minor areas of 
reworked ground and partial buttressing of the pit edge side slopes to improve their stability. At 
the time of writing this report the Rookery South pit earthworks associated with the Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) were ongoing having commenced in circa May 2017. A site layout 
plan indicating the current red line boundary is presented as Figure 2. 
1.2.2 
The Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS is proposed to further restore and reshape the base 
and sides of the Rookery South pit to facilitate development within the pit and the proposals). 
The proposed LLRS will be implemented prior to the development of the Project Site described 
in this GCA and will involve the use of soils, overburden and a proportion of the remaining clay 
reserves within the Project Site to re-profile the base of the pit, and buttress the side slopes to 
improve their stability. These restoration works are described in more detail in Section 1.5 
below.  
1.2.3 
The wider site area has been the subject of several previous ground investigations and reports 
compiled by PBA and others. The following sections of the report draw upon previous studies 
and site investigation information primarily from the following reports:

1.3 
Objectives 
1.3.1 
The primary aim of this assessment is to meet the requirements of the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF) Clauses 120, 121 and 122 (DCLG, 2012). Under the definition ‘Site 
Investigation Information’ given in the NPPF, a Phase 1 Desk Study and contamination risk 
assessment is the minimum requirement under the NPPF to support any planning application 
on a site that might be potentially affected by contamination. Similarly, a desk study and site 
reconnaissance is the minimum information that should be provided for a site potentially at risk 
from ground instability.  
1.3.2 
This report presents a Phase 1 ground condition assessment comprising a desk study, site 
walkover and Tier 1 preliminary qualitative contamination risk assessment and preliminary 
geotechnical assessment. 
1.3.3 
The objective of the Phase 1 is to review readily available information to assess the likely ground 
conditions and environmental setting at the Project Site and in the immediate surrounding area 
in order to identify if there are potential geoenvironmental and geotechnical hazards and 
constraints that present a significant risk to The Project. 
1.3.4 
It should be noted that this Phase 1 assessment is a land condition assessment and does not 
purport to be an ecological, flood risk or archaeological survey and additional specific surveys 
may be required to support a planning application. Guidance on the use of this report is provided 
in Section 9. 
1.4 
Scope of Work/Terms of Reference 
1.4.1 
In accordance with the requirements of the NPPF (DCLoG, 2012), the assessment has been 
carried out in accordance with “established procedures” using current UK best practice and 
guidance as given in British Standard 10175 (2011), Contaminated Land Report 11 (EA, 2004) 
and NHBC Standards Chapter 4.1 (NHBC, 2016). 
1.4.2 
In order to identify the current conditions and land use on the Project Site and in the surrounding 
area, readily available information in the public domain has been obtained and reviewed, and a 
site reconnaissance walkover has been carried out. This report presents a review of the 
acquired information, together with the development of a Preliminary Conceptual Site Model 
(CSM) and the associated Tier 1 risk assessment. This report also presents a qualitative 
assessment of any hazards and constraints posed by the existing ground conditions to the 
proposed development and comments on any mitigation or remediation measures that may be 
required. The PBA Specification for Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment is presented as 
Appendix 1.  
1.5 
Methodology   
1.5.1 
The PBA methodology for the assessment of potentially contaminated land is presented in 
Appendix 1. 
1.5.2 
The underlying principle is the evaluation of pollutant linkages in order to assess whether the 
presence of a source of contamination could potentially lead to harmful consequences. A 
pollutant linkage consists of the following three elements: 
� 
A source of contamination or hazard that has the potential to cause harm or 
pollution; 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
4 
� 
A pathway for the hazard to move along / generate exposure; and 
� 
A receptor which is affected by the hazard.  
1.5.3 
For each potential pollutant linkage identified the risk is estimated through consideration of the 
magnitude of the potential consequences and the likelihood or probability of an event occurring. 
1.5.4 
This report is divided into chapters identifying potential sources (hazard identification), potential 
pathway and receptor identification and risk estimation and assessment. 
1.6 
Sources of Information 
1.6.1 
Information within PBA archives (See Section 1.2 above) and that readily available in the public 
domain has been reviewed in order to identify the likely ground conditions at the Project Site 
and in the surrounding area.  
1.6.2 
The following additional sources of information were used in the preparation of this report: - 
� 
Landmark Information Group (LIG) was commissioned to provide historical 
maps (2014) and an Envirocheck report (2017) that includes environmental 
datasets and sensitivity information for the site and the surrounding area. The 
historical maps are presented as Appendix 3 and the Envirocheck report is 
presented as Appendix 4 
� 
PBA walkover inspection on 24th July 2017 – photographic plates are 
presented in Appendix 2

Land Use Information 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This section presents a summary of current and historical land uses on and immediately 
adjacent to the Project Site. Land use is used to inform the hazard identification element of the 
risk assessment. 
2.1.2 
The current land use information is based on a walkover inspection undertaken by PBA on the 
24th July 2017. Photographs taken during the site walkover (Plates 1 to 6) are presented in 
Appendix 2.  
2.1.3 
The historical land use information is based largely on archive information held by PBA, 
supplemented by historical Ordnance Survey maps and aerial photography provided by LIG and 
presented in Appendix 3. 
2.1.4 
For simplicity and ease of reading, the description of the Project Site has been split into four 
sections; the site of the generating equipment and power generation plant (Power Generation 
Plant Site) in the base of the Rookery South Pit (includes temporary laydown area), the Access 
Road providing connectivity between the Generating Equipment Site and Green Lane, the 
Electrical Connection, and the Gas Connection.  
2.2 
Site Location and Setting 
2.2.1 
The Project Site is approximately centred at National Grid Reference TL013 408, approximately 
1km to south of the village of Stewartby, in Marston Vale, Bedfordshire. 
2.2.2 
The Project Site comprises part of a former clay pit and agricultural land between Stewartby in 
the north and the Millbrook proving ground to the south, the Marston Vale branch railway line to 
the west and the mainline London to Sheffield railway line to the east. 
2.2.3 
This site is currently accessed via a track leading from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment 
Site. A site location plan is presented as Figure 1. 
2.2.4 
A site layout plan, annotated with the areas discussed in this report is presented as Figure 2.   
Power Generation Plant  
2.2.5 
The western boundary of the Power Generation Plant Site is formed by the Bedford to Bletchley 
(‘Marston Vale’) railway line and Pillinge Farm South.  
2.2.6 
The northern and eastern boundary is formed by the remainder of the Rookery South Pit. 
2.2.7 
The southern boundary is formed by the Electrical and Gas Connection area. 
The Access Road 
2.2.8 
The Access Road runs in a southerly direction from Green Lane along the western perimeter of 
the Rookery North pit and then descends via an access ramp in the north-western corner of 
Rookery South pit meeting the northern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site.  
2.2.9 
The western boundary is formed by the Bedford to Bletchley (‘Marston Vale’) railway line.

Electrical and Gas Connection 
2.2.10 An area of agricultural land south of and adjacent to the clay pit is included within the wider 
Project Site. This land will be utilised for an Electrical Connection to the existing 400kV power 
connection (Electrical Connection) and a link to the National Transmission System gas pipeline 
(Gas Connection). The furthest point of this area is located approximately 1.5km to the 
southeast of the Power Generation Plant Site.  
2.2.11 South Pillinge Farm is located to the immediate west of the Electrical Connection with the 
southern boundary formed by the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground. The Gas Connection forms 
the eastern boundary. 
2.2.12 The Gas Connection is formed of a narrow corridor, approximately 50m wide, running south 
east for approximately 1.8 km. The route crosses Millbrook Road and reaches its furthest point 
adjacent to Lower Farm.   
2.2.13 The Gas Connection is located across predominantly agricultural land and these form the 
boundaries of the area.  
2.3 
Current Land Use 
Power Generation Plant Site 
2.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site lies partly within the base of the Rookery South clay pit. 
Topographically the pit lies some 15m lower than the natural surrounding ground level. The 
base of the pit in this area is roughly level and sparsely vegetated, with no features of note 
observed within the excavation. 
2.3.2 
The southern part of the Generating Equipment Site includes the southern bank of the clay pit, 
which is again sparsely vegetated. The western bank lies in close proximity of the north-western 
Project Site boundary and comprises a split-level pit edge slope adjacent to the access road. 
2.3.3 
At the time of the walkover inspection in July 2017 a number of earthwork activities were being 
undertaken within the base of the Rookery South clay pit as part of the ongoing LLRS 
earthworks, and as such stockpiles of topsoil and as dug callow clay are presented in the base 
of the pit, arising from material stripped from the southern enclave borrow pit area used to source 
materials for the wider LLRS earthworks  
2.3.4 
Off Site land uses is as follows: 
2.3.5 
North: The remainder of the Rookery South clay pit bounds the northern parts of the Generating 
Equipment Site, beyond which is the Rookery North pit, Green Lane and the redundant 
Stewartby Brickworks site. Stewartby Village lies adjacent to the north of the Rookery North pit 
some 1200m to the north of the Generating Equipment Site. 
2.3.6 
East: The remainder of the Rookery South Pit bounds arable land currently set to a cereal crop 
with a public footpath and the Midland Mainline railway beyond.  
2.3.7 
West: The western edge of the Rookery South Pit bounds lies in close proximity to the western 
boundary of the Generating Equipment Site with the Marston Vale railway line and the Marston 
Vale Millennium Country Park beyond.  
2.3.8 
South: South of the Power Generation Plant Site is entirely bounded by agricultural and the 
Electrical Connection and Gas Connection Areas.

Access Road  
2.3.9 
The Access Road is located toward the north-western corner of the Project Site and runs along 
the western Project Site boundary between Rookery North Pit and the Marston Vale railway line.  
2.3.10 The Access Road meets Green Lane at its northernmost extent. The access road is orientated 
broadly north-east to south-west and extends approximately 1.27km between national grid 
refences (NGR) 501590E, 242184N to 501590E, 242184N. 
Electrical Connection and Gas Connection 
2.3.11 This area of the Project Site predominantly comprises agricultural land located adjacent to the 
south and south-east of the Rookery South clay pit. However, the north-west corner of this area 
is situated within the south-western corner of the Rookery South pit as described above. The 
site areas are both elongate and irregular in shape, due to the connection requirements to the 
existing gas and electrical networks as shown on Figure 2. 
2.3.12 The land rises to the crest of a hill some 400m to the south of the clay pit with maximum elevation 
of around 58m AOD. This higher ground is aligned generally in a north-west to southeastwardly 
direction, with levels reducing to the north towards the clay pit.  
2.3.13 There are 33kV electricity pylons that cross part of the Electrical Connection. The pylons run in 
a north-westerly direction and exit the site boundary immediately to the south of South Pillinge 
Farm.  
2.3.14 The off-site land use information is as follows: 
2.3.15 North: Power Generation Plant Site comprising the Rookery South pit and agricultural land to 
the east. 
2.3.16 East: Predominantly agricultural land with the Millbrook Road and the Midland Mainline railway 
beyond. 
2.3.17 South: Predominantly agricultural land. 
2.3.18 West: South Pillinge Farm, Station Lane, immediately beyond which Millbrook Vehicle Proving 
Ground is situated.

The earliest available historical map (1883/1884) shows the Electrical Connection and Gas 
Connection to be undeveloped and comprise agricultural fields. Several drains running along 
field boundaries and tracks and footpaths cross the area.  
2.4.2 
No further on-site land-use changes could be identified until the map dated 1978, whereby 
electricity pylons and associated cables are marked crossing this part of the Project Site. The 
route of the pylons enters the Project Site along the southern boundary of the Gas Connection 
and runs in a north west, south east direction through the Electrical Connection.  
2.4.3 
The 2006 map indicates that some of the field boundaries have been removed to make way for 
larger fields. The field drainage is more clearly marked with a drain running from close to the 
railway bridge in a northerly direction to the edge of the Rookery South clay pit, then tuning in a 
westerly direction towards South Pillinge Farm, with another running along the southern 
boundary with the Vehicle Proving Ground and running across the Electrical Connection.

Power Generation Plant Site 
2.4.4 
The earliest available map (1883) indicates this area falls within agricultural fields. Two farm 
tracks originating from South Pillinge Farm cross this area.  
2.4.5 
No land use changes are marked in this area of the site until the map dated 1976. This map 
shows that this part of the site is occupied by a clay pit, extending beyond the north of the Project 
Site and forming part of the wider Rookery South clay pit.  
2.4.6 
By the 1982-1983 map the clay pit is marked as disused with no features whatsoever marked 
within this part of the site except a drain running through the North Pit and into the South Pit in 
a northwest-southeast direction, understood to now occupy part of the base of the clay pit. 
2.4.7 
The map dated 2014 indicates that part of the site is occupied by water, expected to be the 
flooded base of the clay pit.  
2.4.8 
In 2009 however the LLRS was grated planning permission and at the time of the site inspection 
the water accumulated in the base of the pit had been removed and by May 2017 earthworks 
to Phase 1 if the LLRS had commenced. 
Access Road 
2.4.9 
The earliest available map (1883-1884) shows the proposed route of the Access Road runs 
alongside the Bedford Branch of the London and Northwest Railway, through agricultural fields. 
No further features of note are marked within the Access Road. 
2.4.10 No changes in on-site land use are marked until the map dated 1982. This area of the site now 
lies wholly within the clay pits of Rookery South and Rookery North (marked as disused). A 
conveyor and an access track are marked running along the western pit boundary, these fall 
within the boundary of the Access Road where it follows this part of the site. An electrical 
substation is also marked within this area located some 300m to the south of Green Lane 
adjacent to the Access Road. 
2.4.11 The Map dated 2006 indicates that the part of the site which falls within the Rookery North pit is 
occupied by water, expected to be the flooded base of the clay pit. The conveyor remains along 
the western boundary although it is now shown to run in an easterly direction at the junction of 
the Rookery South and Rookery North pits. The base of the Rookery South pit is not shown to 
be flooded at this time. 
2.4.12 By 2014 the conveyors have been removed and now form tracks, the base of the clay pit is still 
occupied by water.  
2.5 
Summary of Notable Off-Site Historical Land Uses 
2.5.1 
The earliest available Ordnance Survey maps from 1883 – 1884 show that the Project Site is 
situated in open agricultural land. The railway lines that border the Rookery Pits were already 
constructed and Millbrook Station has been developed in association with the western railway 
line. The Morteyne Arms Inn is also present adjacent to the station. The settlement of ‘Wooton 
Pillinge’ is indicated approximately 1km to the northeast of the Project Site, and to the northwest 
of Wooten Pilinge, the early stages of a Brickworks are shown adjacent to Randall’s Sidings 
approximately 1km north of Green Lane. A group of buildings labelled as ‘Pillinge Farm South’ 
are located adjacent to the southwest of the Power Generation Plant Site and ‘Lower Farm’ is 
situated adjacent to the southern boundary of the Gas Connection. A number of footpaths and 
land drains ran across the Project Site. 
2.5.2 
The maps from 1901-1902 show some small developments at the Millbrook Station with 
construction of a ‘goods shed’. The ‘Brickworks’ are shown to have undergone expansion, with 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
9 
clay pits shown adjacent to the railway line with numerous out buildings associated. With 
another ‘Brickworks’, being developed approximately 500m to the north of Green Lane.  
2.5.3 
Expansion of the ‘Brickworks’ site takes place over the subsequent decades, amalgamating and 
forming ‘Pillinge Brickworks’ with an engine house and tramway marked by 1927. The clay pits 
adjacent to the west of the brickworks site are shown to have expanded and have reached their 
maximum extent by 1927. Continued expansion is shown up until the map dated 1983. By the 
1982-1983 map the site occupies an area of some 700m x 1800m with numerous chimneys, 
tanks kilns and conveyors marked. The Brickworks site now bounds the land adjacent to the 
north of Green Lane. 
2.5.4 
The 1938 maps show the start of construction of the village of Stewartby immediately to the 
north of Rookery North. By 1960 Wootoon Pillinge becomes part of Stewartby, ceasing to exist 
in its own right.  
2.5.5 
The map dated 1960 shows the commencement of clay extraction west of the railway line which 
by the 1982-1983 map has been flooded and forms Stewartby Lake. A sewage works has been 
constructed to the south of Stewartby Lake. Further to the south of Stewartby Lake, and to the 
west of the Project Site, an additional lake is present. This area was further altered in the period 
between 1983 and 2006 when additional lakes had been created as wetland habitats (the 
‘Marston Vale Millennium Country Park’). 
2.5.6 
Anecdotal accounts and review of historical aerial photographs suggest that the Rookery North 
pit was partially backfilled during the period from about 1971 to 1997.  
2.5.7 
The Envirocheck report has indicated that the Rookery North pit, and part of Rookery South pit 
was licensed as a ‘co-disposal landfill’. Further details provided by the Environment Agency 
have indicated that non-hazardous organic waste from a variety of local industrial sources were 
mixed with surface waters from the Rookery Pit and ‘Callow’ deposits and pumped into the base 
of the pit. The licensed area for these operations covered all of the Rookery North pit and the 
northern third of the Rookery South pit. A copy of the Environment Agency plan showing the 
extent of the licence boundary shows details of the waste sources as follows: non-notifiable 
mineral wastes (including ‘neosid’ ferrite sludge, lime and water from water softening treatments 
and Hargreaves fertiliser waste), food wastes (from Coca Cola, Rosa Poultry, Telfers and 
Unilever), leather wastes and gelatine wastes from ‘Croda’. 
2.5.8 
The 1978 shows the development of a vehicle proving ground to the south of the Project Site. 
The 1982-1983 maps show the expansion of the village of Stewartby. 
2.6 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.6.1 
Prior to construction of the Project it is understood that the proposed LLRS for Rookery South 
will be completed and will therefore form the baseline conditions for the Project Site. Planning 
Permission has been granted for the LLRS under application numbers BC/CM/2000/9 and 
BC/CM/2000/8. In summary the LLRS for the Rookery South pit will comprise:  
� 
Topsoil stripping from an area to the immediate south of Rookery South pit to 
enable further overburden and clay extraction from this area. 
� 
Excavation of soils, overburden and clay from the southern area to provide 
engineered clay fill and restoration soils for the re-profiling and buttressing works 
around the pit edges of Rookery South pit.  
� 
Re-profiling of the base of Rookery South pit, graded to falls, utilising clay won from 
the southern area.

� 
Construction of a new vehicular access track into the southwestern corner of the pit 
to provide low level access to the pit. 
� 
Buttressing of slopes on the southern, eastern and northern sides of the Rookery 
South pit to provide a slope stabilisation solution to existing slopes. 
� 
Provision of surface water management ditches in the reprofiled pit base 
discharging to an attenuation pond located in northwest corner of Rookery South 
pit. The surface water ditches and attenuation pond will include habitat mitigation 
and enhancement measures. 
� 
Provision of a pumping station to enable discharge of collected waters from the 
attenuation pond to Stewartby Lake with additional provision of a pumped 
emergency flow to Rookery North and reverse flow drainage. 
2.6.2 
Works are ongoing at the time of the site inspection in August 2017 to facilitate Phase 1 of the 
LLRS and as such many of the listed items above were seen to be in progress.

Environmental Setting 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
Information on the environmental setting is presented in this Section and the data is used to 
inform the Ground Stability Risk Assessment in Section 4 and the Contamination Risk 
Assessment presented in Section 6. 
3.2 
Geology  
Geological Map and Regional Geology 
3.2.1 
According to the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geological Maps (1:50,000 Sheet 203 and 
1:10,000 Sheet TL 04 SW) the solid geology of the Project Site and surrounding area generally 
consists of the following sequence of strata: 
� 
The Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation (highly plastic fossiliferous 
clay);  
� 
The Kellaways Formation (sandy clays and clayey sands of the Kellaways Sand Member 
with an underlying stiff shelly clay called the Kellaways Clay Member);  
� 
The Cornbrash Formation (limestone) and the Blisworth Clay Formation and Blisworth 
Limestone Formation at depth.  
3.2.2 
In the southern parts of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection in the south of the Project 
Site, the geological map records unworked Oxford Clay comprising the Stewartby Member and 
the Weymouth Member which underlies the vast majority of this area. The Peterborough 
Member of the Oxford Clay is shown to outcrop in the north-western part of the Electrical 
Connection and northern part of the Gas Connection. 
3.2.3 
There are small areas of the west of the Project Site that are indicated to be underlain by 
superficial deposits of Alluvium, associated with the Mill Brook. 
3.2.4 
Superficial Head deposits comprising clay, silt, sand and gravel are also indicated to be present 
in some parts of the Project Site, namely along the southwestern boundary adjacent to South 
Pillinge Farm.  
Anthropogenic Effects 
3.2.5 
Superficial Deposits and weathered Oxford Clay were unsuitable for the brickmaking process 
and this material was removed and cast back into the Rookery South pit. Locally, it was called 
Callow and for the purposes of this report is called Callow when in-situ, and Callow Clay Fill, 
when disturbed and placed at a new location. The Callow Clay Fill sometimes contains brick 
fragments because broken brick rubble was used for making temporary pads and machinery 
stands. Generally, excavations left around 0.5 to 1.0m of remnant Oxford Clay in the base of 
the Rookery South Pit overlying the Kellaways Sand, although this was dependant on the 
workmanship of the machine operators and in places the layer of remnant clay is thicker or 
absent. 
3.2.6 
The unweathered Oxford Clay was called Knotts by the local brickmaking industry. The Oxford 
Clay Formation supported a major brickmaking industry locally because its high organic content 
reduced the amount of fuel required to ‘fire’ the clay, and its carbonate content was ideally suited 
to brickmaking.

3.2.7 
Historical clay extraction from the Rookery Pit has resulted in ground levels in the base of the 
pit some 15m – 25m lower than the surrounding ground. 
Site Specific Ground Conditions from Previous Ground Investigations 
3.2.8 
Information on the ground conditions at the Project site and in the surrounding area has been 
taken from CL Associates (2000) and with reference to wider BGS records. Other studies 
undertaken by PBA in the vicinity of the site, within Rookery South and North pits have also 
been used, including PBA (2009b) and PBA (2011). Copies of the exploratory hole records that 
are located within or close to the Project Site are presented in Appendix 5.  
Electrical Connection and Gas Connection 
3.2.9 
Exploratory hole records for this area are only available for the north-western corner of this part 
of the Project Site and were taken by CL Associates, they include BH3 to BH6 and TP5, 6 and 
13, as well as TP28 to TP34. The records indicate the presence of ‘reworked topsoil’ comprising 
soft brown slightly sandy slightly gravelly clay to around 0.2m bgl in the southern part of the Gas 
Connection, with ‘reworked clay’ comprising brown slightly sandy clay with some fine to coarse 
gravel and cobble size brick.  
3.2.10 This was recorded to be underlain by weathered Oxford Clay comprising soft and firm light 
orange brown mottled slightly sandy clay proven to around 3.5m bgl, and then Oxford Clay 
described as firm dark green brown laminated very silty clay proven in the boreholes to depths 
of between 13.8m bgl (BH4) and 20.5m bgl (BH6).  
3.2.11 The Kellaways Formation was identified underlying the Oxford Clay, recorded as interbedded 
dark grey sand and firm grey green clay with occasional shell fragments. The Kellaways 
Formation was proven to between 19.75m bgl and 24.65m bgl in the areas investigated.  
3.2.12 The Cornbrash Formation was recorded as dark grey fine to medium grained muddy limestone 
was identified underlying the Kellaways Formation, and was proven to a maximum depth of 
24.9m bgl (BH6). 
Power Generation Plant Site  
3.2.13 On the basis of the available exploratory hole records within PBA (2009b), the strata thicknesses 
in the base of the Rookery South Pit are expected to be variable, although the sequence of the 
strata is consistent. 
3.2.14 Made Ground in the form of Callow Clay fill was reported in several of the exploratory holes 
proven to a maximum depth of 4.70m in TP14, although the full thickness of the Made Ground 
was not proven in this location. In general, the thicknesses of Made Ground (recorded as 
reworked clay comprising firm grey brown slightly gravelly cobbly clay) appears to be greater 
towards the centre of the pit. Where the exploratory holes are closer to the edges of the pit, the 
thicknesses of Made Ground are less or it is altogether absent. In BH102 Made Ground (Callow 
Clay Fill) was recorded to a depth of 3.00m bgl, underlain by Oxford Clay proven to a depth of 
12.2m bgl. This was underlain by the Kellaways Formation proven to 17.6m bgl, and then by 
the Cornbrash Formation proven to a depth of 17.7m bgl. The base of the Cornbrash was not 
proven. 
3.2.15 Since the base of the Rookery South Pit is roughly level, on the basis of the exploratory hole 
records it is anticipated to be underlain by a thickness of either around 3m of Callow Clay or 
remnant Oxford Clay or a combination of the two depending on the location within the base of 
the pit.  
3.2.16 Current earthworks associated with the Phase1 LLRS development at the time of reporting have 
resulted in stockpiles of as dug topsoil and callow clay being temporarily stockpiled in the base 
of the pit.

Radon  
3.2.17 Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and emanates from certain geological formations 
to varying degrees, depending on the type, porosity and permeability. The Envirocheck Report 
indicates the Project Site is not located in a Radon Affected Area. 
3.3 
Hydrogeology 
3.3.1 
The aquifer designation map for the Project Site indicates that the Oxford Clay is considered to 
be an unproductive strata.  
3.3.2 
The Alluvium and Head Deposits are designated as secondary (undifferentiated) aquifers with 
intermediate soil leaching potential. However, the EA are currently in the process of updating 
the groundwater vulnerability maps (to reflect improvements in data mapping and understanding 
of the factors affecting vulnerability) and this designation should therefore be re-assessed once 
the new mapping and information is available.  
3.3.3 
The Kellaways Sand has previously been considered by the EA to be a secondary (previously 
minor) aquifer. However, a review of the Kellaways Sand properties concluded that the 
permeability of the stratum was very low (median value of 3.1 x 10-7 m/s) due to the high 
proportion of clays and silts in the stratum[5] (Mather et al.,1998), and it is believed that the EA 
now consider that the formation has limited water resources potential. 
3.3.4 
Although the Cornbrash Formation is considered by the EA to be a secondary aquifer, it has 
limited thickness and is separated from the Blisworth Limestone by the Blisworth Clay 
(unproductive strata). It is considered that the formation has a very limited water resources 
potential[6] (BGS 2000). 
3.3.5 
The Blisworth Limestone Formation is considered by the EA to be a Principal Aquifer. However, 
it is confined by overlying strata at this site and the BGS guide ‘Geology of the Bedford district’ 
(BGS 2010) indicates that where the formation is buried below the confining Oxford Clay 
Formation, yields and quality of groundwater deteriorate.  
3.3.6 
The clayey deposits of the Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay 
Formation have been shown to be of extremely low permeability and can be considered as being 
aquicludes. Whilst the Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash Formation are classified as secondary 
aquifers, they have previously been shown by extensive investigations for the brickmaking, 
landfill/waste deposition industry and other developments, to be insignificant for water resources 
purposes in this region due to their limited thickness, low permeability and poor water quality. 
These formations are considered herein to act as aquitards. The Blisworth Limestone Formation 
has been shown to be of a slightly higher permeability but also of naturally poor water quality.  
3.3.7 
The elevation of the base of the Rookery South Pit is between 27m and 30m AOD, and once 
the LLRS has been implemented the base of the pit is expected to lie between 31.6m and 31.0m 
AOD. 
3.3.8 
Piezometric levels beneath the base of the pit have historically been recorded at approximately 
28m AOD to 29.5m AOD in the Kellaways Sand, approximately 27m AOD – 29.5m AOD in the 
Cornbrash Formation and approximately 30m AOD – 32m AOD in the Blisworth Limestone 
Formation. There is no evidence at all to suggest that hydraulic uplift (or heave) caused by 
groundwater pressures has occurred in the pit base in the past, and assessments of the 
potential for hydraulic uplift have shown that the factor of safety is acceptable and there is no 
risk of heave occurring once the LLRS has been implemented. These assessments are provided 
in PBA 2009 and PBA 2009b. 
3.3.9 
A summary of the permeabilities of the strata underlying the site and the respective groundwater 
elevations is presented in Table 3.2 below.

Hydrology – Summary of Surface Water Monitoring Results. 
3.5.1 
Assessment of the quality of the surface water bodies in the vicinity of Rookery South Pit has 
been undertaken since 1999. During this time surface water samples have been taken from the 
lakes in Rookery South and Rookery North Pits, Harrowden Brook, Elstow Brook, the drainage 
ditches to the south (the Mill Brook tributary) and west (Mill Brook watercourse) of the Project 
Site and Stewartby Lake to the west of the Project Site. A summary of the historical data is 
presented in the PBA (2009b) report. 
3.5.2 
Monitoring of the surface water quality within the lake in Rookery South Pit, previously 
undertaken by CLA in 1999 – 2000, recorded elevated sulphate levels (1,500mg/l – 2,000mg/l) 
and electrical conductivity levels (2,800µS/cm – 3050µS/cm) but no other determinants tested 
were significantly elevated against the screening criteria such as cyanides, metals and potential 
organic contaminants. Similar conditions were recorded within the lake in the Rookery North pit 
at the same time. Monitoring of the surface waters within the ditches and brooks surrounding 
the Rookery Pits, undertaken at the same time, recorded similar conditions, albeit that the 
sulphate concentrations and electrical conductivity values were generally lower than within the 
lakes. 
3.5.3 
Monitoring of the surface water quality within Elstow Brook and the lakes in the Rookery North 
and Rookery South pits and the Stewartby Lake has previously been undertaken on four 
occasions by PBA (in June – August 2008, January 2009 and April 2011) as part of a study of 
the wider Marston Vale area. Water samples were analysed for suspended soils, copper, lead, 
zinc, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, Biological Oxygen Demand, sulphate, ammonia, chloride, 
electrical conductivity, nitrate, pH and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons. The results showed 
similar characteristics as the data collected previously by CLA, with electrical conductivity levels 
and sulphate concentrations elevated within the lakes on the Rookery North and Rookery South 
pits but lower concentrations within the surrounding water bodies. Based upon the recorded 
BOD and ammonia results, water quality at the time was classified as Class A (very good) 
according to the Environment Agency GQA scheme current at that time. 
3.5.4 
Refer to Section 5 (Baseline Conditions) for surface water monitoring results from 2017.  
3.6 
Landfill Records 
3.6.1 
According to the Envirocheck Report there is a landfill marked within the footprint of the Rookery 
North and the northern third of the Rookery South pits. The licence is held by London Brick 
Landfill Ltd at Rookery Clay Pit. Input dates were between 1971 and 1987 with deposited waste 
including industrial and household waste and liquid sludge. No other landfills are noted within 
500m of the Project Site. 
3.6.2 
Previous investigations confirm that the Rookery South pit was not used for landfilling of 
household waste or liquid sludge, although the base of the pit has been proven to be underlain

by a variable thickness of reworked clay in the form of Callow Clay Fill. It is understood a small 
area in the northeast corner of the Rookery South pit is underlain by a greater thickness of 
reworked clay that forms a lobe shaped feature. Extensive investigation of this feature (PBA 
2011) suggests that it is inert and comprises reworked Callow Clay Fill, and does not include 
liquid wastes, sludges or household waste. Its origins are not entirely clear; however, it is 
possible that this feature formed as a result of a land slip or from deposited clay overburden. 
3.6.3 
Previous testing undertaken on the Callow Clay fill and lobe feature in Rookery South (PBA 
2011) indicates that the materials are inert in nature with low concentrations of potential 
contaminants with regard to the proposed end-use.  
3.6.4 
The Envirocheck report indicates that there is an active licensed waste management facility 
(Licensed to FCC Waste Services UK Ltd) at Stewartby Landfill site approximately 600 m to the 
northwest of the Access Road, and another licensed to Veolia ES (UK) Ltd for a household, 
commercial and Industrial transfer station also approximately 600 m north west of the Access 
Road at Green Lane, Stewartby.  
3.6.5 
The EA website (what’s in your backyard), access on the 24th July 2017, indicates that the former 
Pillinge/Stewartby brickworks located to the immediate north of the Access Road is a ‘Historic 
Landfill’, and that adjacent to that is another historic and also authorised landfill known as L 
Field Clay Pit (EPR/BV4576IK). The authorised landfill relates to the FCC Waste Services UK 
Ltd site described above. 
3.7 
Substantiated Pollution Incidents 
3.7.1 
The Envirocheck Report records six pollution incidents to controlled waters within 1 km of the 
Project Site, but only one within 500m of the Project Site. The incident was approximately 90m 
to the southwest and occurred 18 years ago. The incident is recorded as a Category 3 (minor 
incident) where treated sewage effluent affected Boiling Pot Brook. 
3.7.2 
There are no substantiated pollution incidents within 500 m of the Project Site.

3.10 Discharge Consents 
3.10.1 The Envirocheck report indicates that there are two discharge consents located adjacent to the 
Access Road that are not indicated to have been revoked and may therefore still be active. 
These are for the discharge of trade effluent/process water from Rookery north and south pits 
to a partly culverted ditch (assumed from the location to be Mill Brook). 
3.10.2 It is understood that there is an active discharge consent within the Project Site associated with 
the Rookery Pits (licensed to City and St James Property), although this record is not identified 
within the Envirocheck Report. Details of this “trade effluent” discharge consent relating to the 
Rookery South and Rookery North pits is contained within the PBA (2011) report. The consent 
understood to be currently in force, allows for pumping “trade effluent” (accumulated waters) 
from the Rookery Pits into the Mill Brook culvert beneath the railway line to the west of Rookery 
South and into Stewartby Lake. The points of note relating to this discharge consent are detailed 
below: 
• 
The discharge must not contain any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter, or greater than 
40mg/l suspended solids; 
• 
The discharge takes place through a brick lined channel into a partly culverted ditch leading 
to Stewartby Lake through an outlet at National Grid Reference TL 0112 4131; 
• 
Whilst pumping is underway from the Rookery pits, sulphate and suspended solids 
concentrations are to be measured once a week (albeit that no constraints on 
concentrations are identified on the formal consent); and, 
• 
The maximum volume of discharge is not to exceed 2,000m3 in a 24-hour period.

Ground Stability Risk Assessment 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
In accordance with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (DCLoG, 2012), 
the potential for the Project to contribute to or to be adversely affected by land instability has 
been assessed. Accordingly, consideration is given below to the potential risk of ground 
instability arising from Naturally Occurring Geological Hazards, Natural and Mining Cavities and 
Slope Instability due to existing ground conditions across the Project Site, as identified in this 
report. 
4.2 
Naturally Occurring Geological Hazards 
4.2.1 
An assessment of potential geological hazards that may give rise to instability or adverse 
foundation or construction conditions as supplied by the British Geological Survey (BGS) from 
their National Geoscience Information Service (NGIS) are presented in the Envirocheck report 
reproduced in Appendix 4. The generic assessment is generated automatically based on digital 
geological maps and the scope and the accuracy is limited by the methods used to create the 
dataset and the excavations and landform modifications undertaken at the specific site. The 
BGS dataset is therefore only relevant for the search area. 
4.2.2 
The information contained in the Envirocheck Report has been reviewed and where considered 
necessary reassessed considering the specific information available for the Project Site. The 
modified assessment of the potential for geological hazards to be present on the Project Site is 
summarised in Table 4.1 below.

4.2.3 
PBA would generally agree with the above assessments indicating that the Project Site 
generally has a low or very low potential for being affected by the majority of geological hazards.  
4.2.4 
The exceptions to this are hazards associated with compressible ground, anticipated to be 
related to the potential for Alluvium and Callow Clay Fill to be present in parts of the Project Site, 
landslide ground stability which is anticipated to be related to the slopes of the Rookery South 
clay pit that are partly within the Project Site and shrinking or swelling clay, related to the 
presence of Oxford Clay at the Project Site. 
4.2.5 
Given the implementation of the Low Level Restoration Scheme before commencement of the 
Project, this risk will be reduced to the level of very low through the regrading of the side slopes 
of the pit to a slope angle that will provide long term stability. 
4.2.6 
Compressible ground stability hazards are highlighted as moderate owing to the presence of 
Alluvium associated with the watercourses and Callow Clay Fill within the base of the Rookery 
South pit. Some of this fill will be in its ‘as placed’ un-engineered condition and will be susceptible 
to long term consolidation settlement under its self-weight and/or any surface applied loads. 
Some engineered fill will be placed over the areas of Callow Clay Fill to deliver the LLRS. PBA

would agree with this assessment on the basis of the potential for variable proportions of 
compressible Callow Clay Fill underlying parts of the ‘Power Generation Plant’ part of the Project 
Site  
4.3 
Natural and Mining Cavities 
4.3.1 
The National Natural and Mining Cavities Database maintained and updated by PBA has been 
searched for relevant natural and mining cavity records. No record was found of natural and 
mining cavities within a 2.0 km radius of the Projct Site. Whilst the absence of existing records 
does not, in itself, demonstrate that natural or mining cavities are not present, the geology and 
geomorphological setting of the Project Site is such that the potential for such features to be 
present is considered to be Very Low. 
4.4 
Slope Stability 
4.4.1 
The sections below present a description of the slopes around both Rookery South and Rookery 
North pits, and comments on the stability of those slopes, prior to commencement of the LLRS. 
The LLRS commenced in May 2017 and therefore modifications to the slopes will be undertaken 
in accordance with the details provided in the LLRS Planning Permission.  
Rookery South 
4.4.2 
Prior to commencement of the LLRS, the majority of the western face of the Rookery South pit 
was observed to be formed at angles of 1Vertical(V):2Horizontal(H) to 1V:3H. The slope rose 
from the base of the pit at approximately 26m AOD to 28m AOD to a bench level at 
approximately 38m AOD. The upper bench was approximately 30m in width, with a second 
slope further westwards rising to the perimeter level at approximately 42m AOD at an angle of 
approximately 1V:2.5H.  
4.4.3 
On the northern section of the western face, the slope profile was formed at characteristically 
lower gradients. The toe of the slope was situated along the same alignment as the section 
further south but the width of the upper bench reduced from 30m to approximately 12m. The 
resultant slope was at a lower gradient than that further south and was formed at angles of 
1V:3.5H to 1V:4H. 
4.4.4 
Inspection of the western pit face did not at the time reveal the presence of significant failures 
other than minor slope wash and sloughing in the exposed face in places. 
Rookery North 
4.4.5 
Within the Rookery North pit, the southern and eastern pit faces were both historically modified 
by the placement of sludge fill material covered with Callow Clay Fill in the base of the pit, 
forming shallow gradient slopes of around 1V:16H, that fan out from apparent deposition 
locations in the south-eastern parts of the pit. These deposits typically extended part way up the 
pit faces but in the south-eastern corner of the pit, the bank of deposits extended up to the level 
of the central causeway at approximately 52m AOD. The western and north-western faces, 
where they bound the access road, appeared to be at their ‘as cut’ angles of approximately 
1V:2H to 1V:3H. However, the full height of these faces was obscured by the water body in the 
pit and only the Callow faces could be seen. 
4.4.6 
Several small scale failures were noted within the exposed Callow faces along the central parts 
of the northern wall, i.e. to the east of the new junction and access road. These small scale 
features had resulted in near vertical back scars of typically 1m – 2m in height. These failures 
coincided with the water levels within the lake and appeared to represent a wave cut platform 
formed as a result of wave erosion affecting the stability of the Callow material.

Baseline Conditions – Groundwater Analysis 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
In November 2014, samples of groundwater and surface water were obtained from the Project 
Site to enable an assessment of the quality of the waters to be carried out, and a summary of 
the surface water results is presented in Section 3.5.  A review of the 2014 groundwater quality 
assessment is provided in Section 5.4.6 below. For the purposes of this report, additional 
groundwater and surface water samples were obtained as discussed in the Sections below, to 
enable an assessment of the current quality of the waters. 
5.1.2 
On the 24th July 2017 the Project Site was visited to obtain surface water and groundwater 
samples from several locations in order to assess the surface water and groundwater quality. 
Where possible these locations are the same as the sampling undertaken in 2014. Samples 
were obtained from the following locations and strata/source: 
• 
Rookery North Pit (SW) 
• 
Mill Brook (SW) 
• 
Tributary to Mill Brook (SW) 
• 
BH102 (GW - Kellaways Sand) 
• 
BH103 (GW - Kellaways Sand) 
• 
BH206 (GW – Cornbrash Formation) 
5.1.3 
It was not possible to obtain water samples from Rookery South Pit as this location has been 
pumped dry as part of the commencement of the LLRS. It was also not possible to obtain 
samples from BH’s 104, 105B, 5, 6 or 12 as these boreholes have been lost as part of the 
ongoing LLRS works.  
5.2 
Rationale 
Laboratory Selection 
5.2.1 
Geoenvironmental testing was performed by Chemtest Ltd. The designated laboratory is one 
approved by PBA and holds UKAS and MCERTS accreditations.   
5.2.2 
Analytical testing for potential contaminants that might be associated with the past use of the 
Project Site were scheduled on groundwater and surface water samples recovered from the 
Project Site. In addition, reference was also made to the historical testing undertaken at the site 
to enable comparison of the previous and current data.  
5.2.3

QA/QC Measures for Groundwater Sampling 
5.2.4 
Separate sampling bailers were used in each of the boreholes sampled to mitigate the potential 
for cross contamination. 
5.2.5 
The standpipes were purged (where possible) to ensure representative sampling of the 
groundwater body by removing three well volumes; this included both the volume of water within 
the standpipe itself and the volume contained within any filter pack placed around the standpipe.  
5.2.6 
The water samples were stored in cool boxes containing ice packs pending transportation and 
were transported to the laboratory by courier.

Review of Chemical Testing Results 
Selection of Tier 2 Assessment Criteria 
5.4.1 
The rationale for selection of generic assessment criteria routinely used by PBA has been used 
and a copy is presented in Appendix 6.   
5.4.2 
There are no groundwater abstractions for potable use within at least 1km of the Project Site 
and the Project Site is not located within a groundwater source protection zone and therefore 
Fresh Water/Inland Surface Waters screening criteria (Parts 2 and 3 of Schedule 3 of the WFD, 
2015) have been selected for both groundwater and surface water.

Review of Historical Testing Results - General 
5.4.3 
In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been identified as being poor with saline 
conditions reported from the majority of reports and investigations (PBA, 2009b).  
5.4.4 
Historical monitoring of water quality within the Kellaways Formation and the Blisworth 
Limestone Formation (undertaken on 15 occasions during the period February 2000 – 
November 2002 by CLA within the monitoring boreholes installed as part of the CLA (2000) 
investigations) has confirmed that the quality of the groundwater within the Kellaways Formation 
and the Blisworth Limestone Formation is similar in nature, and is generally poor with elevated 
concentrations of electrical conductivity, chloride, sulphate, ammoniacal nitrogen, boron and 
zinc when compared to the relevant assessment criteria at the time. 
5.4.5 
The historical groundwater monitoring data was supplemented by groundwater samples taken 
from the Kellaways Formation as part of the PBA 2010 investigation from a total of three 
locations on two occasions. In general, the recent 2010 quality data was similar to that 
previously recorded by CLA. During the PBA 2010 investigation, hydrocarbon analysis of the 
groundwater retained from the Kellaways Formation from BH103 (on one occasion) recorded a 
concentration of 0.026mg/l. A subsequent sample was taken from the same borehole and the 
result showed a concentration below the detection limit. It is likely that the initial concentration 
was the result of remnant dilute drilling fluid within the borehole at the time of sampling on the 
first occasion, which has now been removed by the sampling and purging process. 
Review of Historical Testing Results - 2014 
5.4.6 
In 2014, a total of nine groundwater samples and three surface water samples were obtained 
from the Project Site and submitted for geoenvironmental laboratory testing for a wide range of 
potential contaminants including metals, PAH’s, EPH and a general suite. The results of the 
2014 testing compared to screening criteria at the time indicated that generally the water quality 
data was similar to historical data (see Sections 5.4.3 to 5.4.5 above) and that there were no 
indicators of significant anthropogenic contamination.  
Review of Recent Testing Results – General 
5.4.7 
In 2017, a total of three groundwater samples (Kellaways Formation and Cornbrash Formation) 
and three surface water samples were obtained from the Project Site and submitted for 
geoenvironmental laboratory testing as described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 above. The laboratory 
results are presented in Appendix 8. 
5.4.8 
The results of the surface water are generally similar in nature to previous testing with higher 
concentrations/readings of electrical conductivity and sulphate in Rookery North than in the 
other surface water ditches. Similarly, in the groundwaters, concentrations/readings of electrical 
conductivity, sulphate, chloride, ammoniacal nitrogen and zinc indicate generally poor quality. 
Review of Recent Testing Results – WFD Schedule 3 Part 2 – Specific Pollutants 
5.4.9 
Arsenic concentrations recorded in the groundwater and surface water from the Project Site in 
2017 are presented in Table 5.3. The results indicate concentrations below the specified 
standard. 
5.4.10 Hexavalent chromium concentrations in the groundwater and surface water were all recorded 
below the laboratory limit of detection. 
5.4.11 Copper concentrations in the groundwater and surface water were recorded at between 1.4ug/l 
and 4.4ug/l. The WFD identifies that the standard for copper is 1ug/l bioavailable. Calculations 
of bioavailable copper concentrations have been carried out and the results indicate that the 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
22 
bioavailable concentrations of copper at all monitoring locations are below the assessment 
standard.  
5.4.12 The concentrations of Iron recorded in 2017 are presented in Table 5.3, and all of the results 
exceed the WFD assessment standard for Iron.  
5.4.13 Zinc concentrations in the groundwater and surface water from the Project Site in 2017 were 
recorded at between 5.8ug/l and 48ug/l. The WFD identifies that the standard for Zinc is 
0.0109ug/l bioavailable, plus the Ambient Background Concentration dissolved (3.1ug/l for 
Great Ouse). Calculations of bioavailable zinc concentrations have been carried out and the 
results indicate that the bioavailable concentrations of zinc at all monitoring locations except 
BH206 are below the assessment standard. At BH206 the bioavailable zinc concentration was 
calculated at 13.92ug/l with a risk characterisation ratio of 1.28. 
Review of Recent Testing Results – WFD Schedule 3 Part 3 – Priority Substances 
5.4.14 Speciated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations were all recorded below the 
laboratory limit of detection.  
5.4.15 Nickel concentrations in the groundwater and surface water from the Project Site in 2017 were 
recorded at between 1.2ug/l and 9.7ug/l. The WFD identifies that the standard for nickel is 4ug/l 
bioavailable. Calculations of bioavailable nickel have been carried out and the results indicate 
that the bioavailable concentration of nickel at all the monitoring locations is below the 
assessment standard.  
5.4.16 The concentrations of cadmium in the groundwater and surface water in 2017 were all recorded 
below the laboratory limit of detection. 
5.4.17 The concentrations of lead in the groundwater and surface water in 2017 were all recorded 
below the laboratory limit of detection.  
5.4.18 The concentrations of mercury in the groundwater and surface water in 2017 were all recorded 
below the laboratory limit of detection. 
Review of Recent Testing Results – Other Determinands 
5.4.19 The results of the testing for the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons Criteria Working Group were 
below the laboratory limit of detection at all monitoring locations.

5.4.20 A full copy of the geoenvironmental test results for surface water and groundwater samples 
obtained in July 2017 is presented in Appendix 8. In general, the recent results are broadly 
similar to the available historical data from 2010 and 2014 and many of the determinands were 
recorded below the laboratory limit of detection.  
5.4.21 The recent testing results indicate that the concentrations of Iron exceeded the assessment 
standard at all monitoring locations in both surface water and groundwater, and there was one 
exceedance of the bioavailable standard for Zinc at BH206. However, it is considered that the 
results of the testing are typical of naturally occurring conditions and that there is no indication 
of anthropogenic contamination.

Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
The methodology developed and adopted by PBA for the assessment of ground conditions is 
presented in Appendix 1. In accordance with guidance presented in CLR 11 (EA Model 
Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination) we adopt a staged approach to risk 
assessment and this report presents a Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment. 
6.1.2 
The underlying principle to ground condition assessment is the identification of pollutant linkages 
in order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of contamination could potentially lead to 
harmful consequences. 
6.2 
Conceptual Site Model 
6.2.1 
The Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment includes the development of a conceptual site model 
(CSM). The CSM describes the types and locations of potential contamination sources, the 
identification of potential receptors and the identification of potential transport/migration 
pathways. 
6.2.2 
For a pollutant linkage to be identified a connection between all three elements (source-
pathway-receptor) is required. 
6.3 
Geoenvironmental Hazard Identification 
On-Site - Electrical Connection and Gas Connection  
6.3.1 
This part of the Project Site predominantly comprises farmland, and historical map evidence 
indicates that these areas have been farmland since the earliest available historical map. The 
proposed end use of this part of the Project Site to provide an electrical and gas connection is 
not considered to introduce new sensitive receptors in this area. Since no significant plausible 
contamination sources have been identified and the end use will not introduce any new 
receptors, it is considered that there are no plausible pollutant linkages. Therefore, this part of 
the Project Site has not been taken forward through the risk assessment. 
On-site – Power Generation Plant Site 
6.3.2 
The brickworks manufacturing operation was located approximately 1.3km to the north of the 
Project Site, and consequently any potential contamination sources linked to the process of 
manufacturing and firing of bricks are considered to be located far enough away to not affect 
the Project Site. 
6.3.3 
A notable thickness of Callow Clay Fill (CCF) typically around 2.5m thick (PBA, 2009b), but 
possibly in excess of 4.7m thick has been confirmed to be present across the Generating 
Equipment Site. This CCF has been typically described as reworked clay with occasional brick 
fragments and is therefore not expected to contain any significantly elevated concentrations of 
potential contaminants. The previous ground investigations include geoenvironmental data from 
exploratory holes within the Power Generation Plant Site and also from other exploratory holes 
within the wider Rookery South pit. The results of contamination testing undertaken by both CLA 
2000 and by PBA 2009b for the consented Covanta RRF scheme are considered to be 
representative of the Power Generation Plant Site, even where they are from exploratory holes 
outside of the area because the historical and geographical setting of the area is identical to that 
of the wider pit. Testing from the exploratory holes within and immediately adjacent to the Power 
Generation Plant Site did not show any evidence of elevated concentrations of potential 
contaminants. 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
25 
6.3.4 
Whilst there is the potential for small pockets of sporadic and discreet localised contamination 
to be present within the CCF, it is considered that the frequency and magnitude of any such 
localised contamination will be very small based upon the current available information. 
6.3.5 
Experience in contaminated land assessment by PBA of many other brickmaking sites from the 
same era in the former London Brick Company (LBC) landholding has indicated that the 
historical industrial activity of clay excavation and casting back of overburden, with 
reprofiling/landscaping carried out at these sites does not in itself give rise to significant levels 
of potential contamination.  
6.3.6 
The potential for contamination to be present based on the past and present site use is assessed 
as classification score ‘2’; Low. (see Table 1, Appendix 1). 
Ground gases 
6.3.7 
The previous ground investigations have not encountered any significant quantities of organic 
materials within the deposits underlying the Project Site; however, the Oxford Clay Formation is 
known to contain organic matter and carbonates, which can degrade to produce gases such as 
carbon dioxide and methane. Ground gas monitoring has been carried out for many previous 
developments on Oxford Clay and the gas generation potential is well established. It is 
considered that the hazard level in areas of Oxford Clay and CCF is Low to Moderate. 
6.3.8 
Low concentrations of carbon dioxide and potentially methane may be associated with the very 
localised deposits of Alluvium, associated typically with the Mill Brook, and it considered that 
the localised hazard level in these areas is Low to Moderate. 
6.3.9 
There is potential for hazardous ground gases associated with the adjacent former Stewartby 
Landfill site, however it is considered that there is low potential for any ground gas present to 
affect buildings associated with the Project Site due to both the migration distance and generally 
low permeability of the ground conditions.  
Groundwater 
6.3.10 In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been identified as being poor with saline 
conditions reported from the majority of reports and investigations. In particular, historically, the 
Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) screening criteria have been exceeded for ammoniacal 
nitrogen, boron, electrical conductivity and chloride. The concentrations recorded are 
considered to be naturally occurring and typical of baseline conditions in similar geological 
settings, and not a result of the on-site ground conditions. There are no indicators of 
anthropogenic contamination, and hydrocarbons have not been recorded above the screening 
criteria in the recent analyses undertaken. 
Surface Water  
6.3.11 Similarly, previous testing undertaken in 2010 and 2014 on the surface waters that form part of 
the wider area indicate that elevated sulphate and electrical conductivity levels were present in 
the surface waters at the site. These were the only parameters that exceeded the screening 
criteria, and based on the results of the BOD and ammonia results the surface water quality was 
assessed at the time as Class A (Very Good) according to the Environment Agency CQA 
Scheme.  
6.3.12 More recent testing undertaken in 2017 indicates that concentrations of hydrocarbons and 
metals such as lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium and cadmium were all recorded below the 
laboratory limit of detection. Concentrations of Iron exceeded the assessment standard at each 
monitoring location and there was an exceedance of the bioavailable standard for Zinc at 
BH206.  
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
26 
6.3.13 In general, the surface water monitoring data largely reflects the chemistry of the groundwater 
data and shows that whilst some naturally occurring substances are elevated, there is no 
evidence of significant anthropogenic contamination of the surface waters and groundwater. 
Off-Site 
6.3.14 The Project Site lies within a predominantly agricultural setting and consequently potential off-
site sources of significant contamination have not been identified. The exception to this is the 
Pillinge (Stewartby) Brickworks site and the Stewartby Landfill (located adjacent to the Access 
Road), the railway lines and sidings adjacent to parts of the Project Site and Pillinge Farm South.  
6.3.15 Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground is located adjacent to the southwest boundary of the Electrical 
Connection; however, there are no records of any pollution incidents arising from this facility 
within the Envirocheck Report.  
6.3.16 it is considered that the risk to the Project Site associated with potential off-site contamination 
generation based on the past and present off-site land-use is assessed as classification score 
‘4’; High. (see Table 1, Appendix 1). 
6.3.17 Given the observations made during the previous investigations and the groundwater and 
surface water quality data that has been previously collected from the wider Marston Vale area, 
and the distance of these sources from the Project Site in conjunction with the expected low 
permeability of the underlying geology means that any off-site contamination (if present) is not 
likely to affect the Project Site, because there are not expected to be any plausible pathways.  
6.4 
Hazard Assessment 
6.4.1 
In order to determine whether the identified hazards pose a risk it is necessary to identify the 
presence of potential receptors and pathways by which they can be exposed to the hazard. 
Identification of Potential Receptors

Potential receptors identified by this assessment and determination of the sensitivity/value are 
presented in Table 6.1 below.

Risk Estimation 
6.5.1 
Risk estimation involves predicting the likely consequence (what degree of harm might result) 
and the probability that the consequences will arise (how likely the outcome is). The table in 
Appendix 7 summarises the estimated risks for the identified pollutant linkages.  
6.5.2 
When there is a pollutant linkage (and therefore some measure of risk) it is necessary to 
determine whether the risk matters and therefore whether further action is required. Risk 
estimation involves predicting the likely consequence (what degree of harm might result) and 
the probability that the consequences will arise (how likely the outcome is).  
6.5.3 
The table in Appendix 7 presents an assessment of consequence and probability for each 
potential pollutant linkage identified. Based on the information available, and assuming a worst 
case scenario, the estimated risks have been designated as follows: 
• 
Human Health Future Users – Low 
• 
Human Health – Off Site - Low 
• 
Human Health Construction Workers – Very Low 
• 
Groundwater – Low  
• 
Surface Water – Very Low  
• 
Buildings / Services – Low 
• 
Animals and Crops – Very Low 
6.5.4 
During construction phase the underlying ground will be exposed and there is an enhanced 
short term risk, particularly to construction workers, however it is considered that this will be 
mitigated by the adoption of appropriate training and use of Personal Protective Equipment by 
site workers.  
6.5.5 
The highest estimated risk of Low for human health is a function of: 
• 
The relatively low sensitivity of the proposed end use with regard to human health. 
• 
The relatively low potential for significant sources of potential contamination to be present. 
• 
The relatively low sensitivity of the environmental setting around the Project Site.  
6.5.6 
A low risk is defined as where ‘it is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from 
an identified hazard, but it is likely that this harm, if realised, would at worst normally be mild.’ 
Ground Gases 
6.5.7 
It is anticipated that ground investigation including ground gas monitoring will be required at the 
Project Site, to confirm the actual ground gas conditions and any protection measures that may 
be required in the construction of the proposed development.  
6.6 
Risk Evaluation 
6.6.1 
Possible pollutant linkages are determined using professional judgement. If a linkage is 
considered possible, it is considered that this represents a potentially ‘unacceptable risk’ and 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
28 
therefore requires further consideration. This may be through remediation or mitigation or 
through further tiers of assessment. 
6.7 
Confidence and Uncertainty  
6.7.1 
The assessment presented herein is based on publically available information on land use and 
third party reports on intrusive investigations. Whilst the third party reports provide comfort that 
there is not likely to be site-wide significant contamination, further site specific data from 
intrusive ground investigation will be required in due course and prior to commencement of 
development to confirm the risk estimation.

Preliminary Geotechnical Assessment 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
The following assessments have been undertaken in accordance with the NPPF, in order to 
determine whether there are any land stability constraints at the Project Site and identify any 
appropriate remedial, preventative or precautionary measures, as required. The assessments 
include consideration of the potential for unstable slopes, ground compressibility and 
shrinkage/heave in the context of the proposed development and the local geographical 
environment. 
7.1.2 
The following sections of the report are based upon the geological / geotechnical information 
that has been collated from previous ground investigations and published information. 
7.2 
Implications of Proposed Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
7.2.1 
It is recognised that the proposed LLRS will take place prior to commencement of construction 
of the Project. The LLRS will include regrading levels within the base of the Rookery South pit 
by cut and placement of engineered fill, including the winning of clay fill from parts of the wider 
area.  
7.2.2 
The earthworks in the base of the pit will be undertaken by placing Oxford Clay Fill in layers to 
raise ground levels and produce a fall across the pit towards an attenuation pond in the northern 
part of the Rookery South pit. It is proposed that the resulting topographic levels beneath the 
Generating Equipment Site will be approximately 30m AOD – 31m AOD, which equates to a 
limited thickness of fill above current levels of circa 0.5m in places and cut of up to 1.2m. 
7.3 
Potential Ground Settlement 
7.3.1 
Historically the Callow Clay Fill was placed in the base of the pit without any compaction or 
surcharge control measures having been implemented, and will have settled under its self-
weight since placement. Parts of the Rookery South Pit have previously become inundated with 
water, and these areas may affect the proposed Power Generation Plant Area and Access 
Road. These deposits may therefore currently be present in a relatively soft and compressible 
nature. Any new fill placed in the base as part of the LLRS will therefore induce additional 
consolidation settlement of the underlying historical Callow Clay Fill. 
7.3.2 
PBA have previously undertaken detailed research and analysis of the potential for settlements 
to be induced by loading of historical Callow Clay Fill in the base of similar pits excavated in the 
Oxford Clay. Assessments have included one dimensional consolidation analysis in the 
laboratory and monitoring of in-situ settlements caused by surcharge loading. Results of one-
dimensional consolidation testing showed Mv values, which describe the total magnitude of 
settlement, generally in the range 0.3 m2/MN to 0.4 m2/MN. Corresponding Cv values, which 
describe the time required for settlement to occur, ranged from 0.2 m2/year to 1.4 m2/year. It 
has, however, been recognised that the Cv values from consolidation tests show considerable 
variation and estimates of the time required for settlement to occur are sensitive to these 
variations. Back-analysis of the in-situ settlement recorded in association with the construction 
of an earth embankment over Callow Clay Fill estimated actual Cv values in the range 1.6 
m2/year to 3 m2/year.  
7.3.3 
Utilising relatively conservative values, with an Mv value of 0.4 m2/Mn and a Cv value of 2 
m2/year, preliminary calculations show that for 0.5m of engineered fill placed over 2.5m Callow 
Clay Fill total settlements of about less than 20mm can be expected. In areas where thicker 
deposits of Callow Clay Fill have been recorded, or alternatively where thicker deposits of 
engineered fill will be placed, larger settlements will take place. It is, however, recognised that 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
30 
some areas of relatively thick Callow Clay Fill form topographic high points and will therefore 
require less engineered fill in order to produce the required platform levels.  
7.3.4 
The currently envisaged programme for the placement of engineered fill as part of the LLRS 
and the subsequent development works suggests that construction will commence almost 
immediately after completion of the earthworks for the LLRS in the Power Generation Plant Area 
and will be largely completed within 12 months. Given this timescale, settlement of the Callow 
Clay Fill induced by placement of any residual engineered fill will not be fully mobilised prior to 
construction and recognition of such should therefore be made in respect of the design of hard-
surfacing and infrastructure not founded upon deeper naturally occurring materials, particularly 
in respect of any differential settlement that might occur. It may be necessary to incorporate 
mitigation measures into the design such as ground improvement or geogrid re-enforcement to 
stiffen the ground present. It is also recognised that the area is currently being used as a 
temporary stockpile of materials during the LLRS development and as such some preloading of 
the area is being undertaken as a result which will in effect allow some initial settlement to be 
induced, reducing the effects of settlement as a result of achieving the subsequent final levels 
in the development area.   
7.3.5 
Particular attention will need to be given to any areas where the characteristics and thicknesses 
of the underlying deposits vary across short distances such as at the edges of the pit. Here, 
there may be a considerable thickness of unimproved Callow Clay Fill banked against the 
relatively incompressible natural ground forming the steep original pit edge. Infrastructure such 
as roads, pavements and utilities could be at risk from unacceptably high magnitudes of 
differential settlement and careful consideration should be made of this risk in their design. 
7.4 
Access Road and Green Lane Junction 
7.4.1 
The Project includes for provision of a new vehicular access junction from Green Lane into the 
existing open access area adjacent to the north-western corner of the Rookery North pit. In 
order to facilitate the required turning arcs for large construction vehicles the access road may 
pass relatively close to the perimeter crest of the pit. The design of the access road must 
therefore include assessment of the slope angle, the distance between the road and the slope 
and the resultant slope stability.  
7.5 
Foundations 
7.5.1 
The ground conditions at the Project Site, are in general, expected to form a suitable platform 
for the construction of the proposed Project. For very lightly loaded elements and elements that 
are able to tolerate differential movements, shallow spread footings constructed within the 
remaining Oxford Clay, and possibly in the overlying Callow Clay Fill and engineered 
development platform fill, may be feasible. 
7.6 
Floor Slabs and Pavements 
7.6.1 
Based upon the expected ground conditions present in the Power Generation Plant Site, 
comprising Callow Clay Fill overlain by a limited thickness of engineered fill placed in the base 
of the pit as part of the LLRS, it is expected that lightly loaded ground bearing floor slabs and 
pavements constructed on a suitable depth of capping/sub-base and reinforced by geogrid as 
necessary will prove adequate.  
7.6.2 
However, given the relatively soft nature of the Callow Clay Fill, any heavily loaded floor slabs 
will either need to be suspended on to piles or the ground will require improvement before the 
slabs are cast. Potential ground improvement techniques could include preloading and 
surcharging of the Callow Clay Fill in order to accelerate the settlement, or improvement of soft 
materials by in-situ ground improvement techniques, such as the installation of vibratory stone 
or concrete columns. It should be recognised; however, that surcharging is a process that 
requires a certain period of time for porewater pressures to dissipate and for primary settlements 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
31 
to take place and it may be necessary to install additional drainage such as vertical sand drains 
for this to take place during an acceptable timescale. 
7.7 
Clay Volume Change Potential 
7.7.1 
Due to the highly plastic nature of the Oxford Clay, and the Callow deposits derived from it, the 
soils are liable to shrink or swell in response to changes in moisture content. Such changes in 
moisture content can occur due to seasonal or climatic effects but more commonly structural 
damage can occur when trees and hedgerows remove moisture from the soil at depth. 
Conversely removal of trees can cause swelling and structural damage as the soils re-saturate. 
7.7.2 
Guidance on foundation design in such circumstances is given in BRE Digests 240, 241, 242, 
298 and 412, and also in NHBC Standards Chapter 4.2, which can be applied as equally as 
appropriate to industrial buildings as houses. The historical laboratory testing on the soils 
present indicates that the in-situ Callow deposits exhibit a high volume change potential whilst 
the Callow Clay Fill and the Knotts exhibit a generally moderate volume change potential. It is 
recommended that a high volume change potential is assumed for those fill deposits that will be 
placed into the base of the pit as part of the LLRS. Particular attention will need to be given to 
the design of any foundations within the tree root zone of influence of the extensive tree screen 
proposed as part of the landscaping of the Project. 
7.7.3 
NHBC Chapter 4.2 recommends that for foundations outside of the zone of influence of any 
proposed trees or shrubs a minimum foundation depth of 1.0m should be adopted for high 
volume change potential soils. For any foundations inside the potential zone of influence of any 
proposed trees or shrubs foundation depths of 1.5m are appropriate, providing that absolute 
limits are agreed within the planting schedules to exclude any tree planting within a certain 
distance of the foundations. The reader is referred to the NHBC guidance for further details 
regarding the zone of influence identified for a variety of different tree species. 
7.8 
Chemical Attack on Buried Concrete 
7.8.1 
It should be recognised that the Oxford Clay is known to be sulphate and pyrite bearing and can 
therefore be corrosive to buried concrete. Groundwater and surface water monitoring data has 
also indicated that the waters present at the Project Site are characterised by high chloride and 
high sulphate concentrations. It is recommended that checks on site specific conditions should 
be made prior to construction and the mix design of buried concrete should follow the 
recommendations of BRE Special Digest 1: Concrete in Aggressive ground (2005 with 
amendments in 2017). Generally, a design sulphate class of DS4 is required in Oxford Clay 
terrain and subject to groundwater considerations an ACEC class of AC-4 is adopted for mobile 
groundwater conditions. 
7.9 
Slope Stability 
7.9.1 
A number of both small scale and large scale instability features have been noted within the 
Callow and Knotts slopes of the Rookery South pit. A review of the stability of the slopes in the 
pit was previously carried out (PBA, 2005) and the review identified the potential for slope 
stability issues to occur in the future as pore water pressures within the former pit faces dissipate 
over time. 
7.9.2 
The proposed scope of works for the LLRS includes provision of buttresses as required to the 
slopes within Rookery South pit, to facilitate long term stability, and this work will be completed 
prior to development of the Project Site.  
7.9.3 
The results of a survey of the slope condition on motorway earthworks (Perry, 1989) indicates 
that slopes greater than 2.5m high, constructed using material sourced from the Oxford Clay 
Formation, should have a gradient no steeper than 1V:3.5H to limit the risk of slope failure to 
less than 1 per cent within 20 years of construction. Where the slopes are formed at a gradient 
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
32 
steeper than 1V:3.5H, weathering and progressive softening of the near-surface soils on the 
slope may result in shallow translational and flow movements through the soils near the base of 
the root system of the vegetation on the slope. For slopes at about 1V:2.5H, the risk of such 
failures occurring within about 10 years of construction was reported to be about 20%. 
7.9.4 
The proposed slope gradients following the implementation of the LLRS are approximately 
1V:3.5H. 
7.10 Potential for Hydraulic Uplift 
7.10.1 When the piezometric pressure in a relatively permeable stratum exceeds the confining 
overburden pressure of the relatively impermeable strata overlying it, then there is a theoretical 
risk of heave or hydraulic uplift. However, the inherent strength and cohesion of the confining 
strata (rather than just its downward acting mass) can also contribute to the resisting downward 
forces acting against the uplift. Therefore, with essentially impermeable deposits (remnant 
Oxford Clay and Callow Clay Fill) overlying slightly more permeable deposits (Kellaways Sand), 
and with relatively high piezometric levels recorded in boreholes around the perimeter of the 
Project Site, there might be a risk that hydraulic uplift may occur in the pit base where the 
thickness of the overlying impermeable deposits has been reduced by excavation works and 
overburden pressures therefore reduced. It should be noted that hydraulic uplift has not 
occurred in the Rookery South Pit although the theoretical possibility remains. 
7.10.2 Previous groundwater monitoring undertaken at the Project Site has shown that piezometric 
levels within the Kellaways Sand are at, or close to, the topographic levels currently present 
within the base of the pit. However, the permeability of the Kellaways Sand has been shown by 
historical investigations to be relatively low (2.4 x 10-6 m/s to 5.1 x 10-7 m/s) and the potential 
for significant hydraulic pressure to build up is therefore considered to be very low. 
7.10.3 Calculations of the potential for basal heave have been undertaken using stratigraphical 
information collected during historical ground investigations undertaken at the Project Site and 
wider area by CL Associates in 2000 (CLA, 2000) and maximum recorded piezometric levels 
based on hydrogeological information collected during groundwater monitoring undertaken by 
CLA between 2000 and 2002 and by PBA in June and September 2008. The factor of safety 
against the potential for heave to occur as a result of piezometric pressures within the Kellaways 
Sand, Cornbrash Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation, has been calculated by 
comparing the uplift pressure from each respective groundwater body, measured at boreholes 
located within the base of the pit, to the vertical overburden pressure applied by the overlying 
deposits based on the proposed basal formation levels at these locations. The results show that 
a factor of safety against basal heave of 1.5 or more is present and basal heave is therefore 
considered unlikely to occur.  
7.10.4 The proposed regrading works included as part of the LLRS will result in a platform at 
approximately 30m AOD – 31m AOD. These works will effectively require placement of fill in 
places but removal of soil in other areas where ground levels are currently slightly higher than 
the proposed platform levels. In general, comparing the depth to the Kellaways Sand Formation, 
recorded during previous ground investigations, with the proposed development platform level 
indicates that the Kellaways Sand will be overlain by approximately 5m – 10m of very low 
permeability in-situ Oxford Clay and re-worked Callow Clay Fill and basal heave is considered 
highly unlikely to occur. 
7.11 Surface Water Disposal 
7.11.1 The Oxford Clay and underlying Kellaways Sand are of a very low permeability and there is 
therefore no scope for the use of infiltration drainage within the Project Site. As a result, the 
LLRS includes development of a surface water attenuation pond and associated pumping 
station in order to control the surface waters within the pits.  
Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination and Geotechnical) 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
33 
7.11.2 It is understood that the drainage of the Project Site will be via a series of surface water 
interceptor channels flowing under gravity to the surface water attenuation pond. Levels within 
the attenuation pond will be controlled by stage pumping any accumulated waters via an existing 
culvert into Mill Brook and ultimately Stewartby Lake.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
8.1 
Conclusions 
8.1.1 
The Project Site includes part of the Rookery South former clay extraction pit, and also includes 
the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection that lie outside of the clay pit. The Generating 
Equipment Site is located within the south and west part of the Rookery South clay pit that 
provided clay to the nearby Stewartby brickworks. It is understood that clay extraction from this 
area ceased in 1986. At the time of reporting the pit is currently undergoing earthworks 
associated with the delivery of the Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS). The remaining parts 
of the Project Site lie to the south of the clay pit and comprise agricultural land that forms part 
of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection. Evidence from historical maps suggests that 
this land has always been in agricultural use. 
8.1.2 
From a review of the available desk based information it is likely that Callow Clay Fill in the form 
of reworked clay underlies the base of the Rookery South clay pit. Indications are that this could 
be in excess of 4.5m deep in some parts although more typically around 2.5m thick. 
Geoenvironmental testing data from within the actual Project Site area and from samples taken 
elsewhere within the wider confines of Rookery South Pit indicate that the material is typical of 
reworked clay with rare inclusions of brick, and consequently this is not expected to represent 
a potential source of significant contamination.  
8.1.3 
With regard to the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection, there are not expected to be any 
new receptors introduced. Furthermore, there are not expected to be any notable on-site or 
plausible off-site sources of contamination in this area and potential hazards associated with 
ground contamination have not been identified in this part of the Project Site. Therefore, these 
areas have not been taken forward in the risk assessment.   
8.1.4 
Whilst it is possible that the reworked Callow Clay Fill within the base of the Rookery South pit 
may contain occasional, discrete and localised elevated concentrations of potential 
contaminants, this is considered unlikely on the basis of the testing carried out elsewhere on 
the Project Site. Furthermore, the low sensitivity of the proposed end-use in this area and the 
ground conditions identified means that even if any localised contamination is present, it is 
unlikely that any pollutant linkages between the end-users and these potential sources would 
be realised.  
8.1.5 
Nevertheless, the presence of Oxford Clay and materials derived from the Oxford Clay such as 
Callow Clay Fill presents a Low to Moderate potential risk of ground gases such as Carbon 
Dioxide being present at the Project Site. It is anticipated that ground investigation including 
ground gas monitoring will be required at the Project Site, to confirm the actual ground gas 
conditions and any protection measures that may be required in the construction of the Project.  
8.1.6 
Potential pollutant linkages have been identified within the Power Generation Plant Site only. 
Using the information on potential sources (contaminant types), receptors and exposure 
pathways the estimated risks for the identified pollutant linkages have been assessed as Low 
in all cases (human health and controlled waters), with the exception of potential ground gas as 
described above.  
8.1.7 
It is therefore considered that the site is unlikely to be designated as “contaminated land” under 
Part IIA. 
8.1.8 
Possible pollutant linkages have been identified in the Power Generation Plant Site only, but 
these risks have been assessed to be Low. It is considered that the risks can be managed and 
reduced through a combination of mitigation, remediation, design and adoption of good practice 
measures during construction.

8.2 
Geotechnical Considerations 
8.2.1 
It is recognised that the LLRS will take place prior to commencement of the construction of the 
Project, works in that regard are ongoing at the time of reporting. The LLRS will include 
regrading levels within the base of the pit by cut and placement of engineered fill, including the 
winning of clay material from parts of the wider site area. The earthworks in the base of the pit 
will be undertaken by placing Oxford Clay Fill in layers to raise ground levels and produce a fall 
across the pit towards an attenuation pond in the northern part of the Rookery South pit. It is 
proposed that the resulting topographic levels beneath the Generating Equipment Site will be 
approximately 30m AOD – 31m AOD, which equates to a limited thickness of fill above current 
levels of circa 0.5m in places and cut of up to 1.2m. In the western parts of the Power Generation 
Plant Area, the proposed slope gradient as a result of the LLRS earthworks will provide a 
resultant slope gradient equivalent to approximately 1V:3.5H to limit the risk of slope failure to 
less than 1 per cent within 20 years of construction. 
8.2.2 
The ground conditions on the Project Site are, in general, expected to form a suitable platform 
for the construction of the Project. For very lightly loaded elements of the Project and elements 
that are able to tolerate differential movements, shallow spread footings constructed within the 
remaining Oxford Clay, and possibly in the overlying Callow Clay Fill and engineered 
development platform fill, could be feasible.  
8.2.3 
It should be recognised that the Oxford Clay is known to be sulphate and pyrite bearing and can 
therefore be corrosive to buried concrete. Generally, a design sulphate class of DS4 is required 
in Oxford Clay terrain and subject to groundwater considerations an ACEC class of AC-4 is 
adopted for mobile groundwater conditions. 
8.3 
Recommendations  
8.3.1 
It is recommended that a Geotechnical Ground Investigation is carried out within the Power 
Generation Plant Site to inform the foundation design of the separate elements of the Project 
within that area. The ground investigation should primarily target the parts of the area that fall 
within the base of the Rookery South pit to ascertain the nature and extent of the Callow Clay 
Fill present. 
8.3.2 
Given the anticipated low level of contamination risk throughout the Project Site and its proposed 
end-use, it is anticipated that the requirement to carry out a bespoke Phase 2 geoenvironmental 
intrusive investigation is not required.  
8.3.3 
It may however be prudent to obtain soil samples for geoenvironmental screening during the 
geotechnical ground investigation in the Power Generation Plant Site, and to simultaneously 
install groundwater/gas monitoring standpipes during these works. This should be followed up 
by a robust groundwater/gas monitoring programme. It is expected that any requirement for 
contamination testing can be satisfactorily dealt with by planning conditions incorporated in any 
granted Consent. 
8.3.4 
It is nevertheless recommended that a programme of groundwater and surface water monitoring 
is carried out for the Project Site to provide information on the current baseline conditions prior 
to construction of the Project.

PBA Methodology for Assessing Land Contamination in England 
Revision June 2016 
Page 1 of 8 
 
 
1 
Introduction 
This document defines the approach adopted by PBA 
in relation to the assessment of land contamination in 
England.  The aim is for the approach to (i) be 
systematic and objective, (ii) provide for the 
assessment of uncertainty and (iii) provide a rational, 
consistent, transparent framework.  
 
When preparing our methodology we have made 
reference to various technical guidance documents and 
legislation referenced in Section 7 of which the 
principal documents are (i) Contaminated Land 
Statutory Guidance (Defra 2012), (ii) the Model 
Procedures for the Management of Contamination 
(CLR 11) (EA 2004), (iii) Contaminated land risk 
assessment: A guide to good practice (C552) (CIRIA 
2001) and (iv) National Planning Policy Framework 
(DCLG 2012).

Dealing with Land Contamination 
Government policy on land contamination aims to 
prevent new contaminated land from being created and 
promotes a risk based approach to addressing 
historical contamination.  With regard to historical 
contamination, regulatory intervention is held in reserve 
for land that meets the legal definition and cannot be 
dealt with through any other means, including through 
planning.  Land is only considered to be “contaminated 
land” in the legal sense if it poses an unacceptable risk.  
 
UK legislation on contaminated land is principally 
contained in Part 2A of the Environmental Protection 
Act, 1990 (which was inserted into the 1990 Act by 
section 57 of the Environment Act 1995). Part 2A was 
introduced in England on 1 April 2000 and provides a 
risk-based 
approach 
to 
the 
identification 
and 
remediation of land where contamination poses an 
unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. 
In 2004 the Model Procedures for the Management of 
Contamination (CLR 11) were published providing 
guidance on how the statutory requirements were to be 
delivery.  The approach, concepts and principles for 
land contamination management promoted by CLR 11 
are applied to the determination of planning 
applications. 
 
Other legislative regimes may also provide a means of 
dealing with land contamination issues, such as the 
regimes for waste, water, environmental permitting, and 
environmental damage. Further, the law of statutory 
nuisance 
may 
result 
in 
contaminants 
being 
unacceptable to third parties whilst not attracting action 
under Part 2A or other environmental legislation. 
 
2.1 
Part 2A 
The Regulations and Statutory Guidance that 
accompanied the Act, including the Contaminated Land 
(England) Regulations 2006, has been revised with the 
issue 
of 
The 
Contaminated 
Land 
(England) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/263) and the 
Contaminated Land Statutory Guidance for England 
2012.  
 
Part 2A defines contaminated land as “land which 
appears to the Local Authority in whose area it is 
situated to be in such a condition that, by reason of 
substances in, on or under the land that significant 
harm is being caused, or there is a significant 
possibility that such harm could be caused, or pollution 
of controlled waters is being, or likely to be, caused”.   
 
Harm is defined as “harm to the health of living 
organisms or other interference with the ecological 
systems of which they form part, and in the case of 
man, includes harm to his property”.   
 
For the purposes of Part 2A, land is contaminated if it 
poses a significant possibility of significant harm 
(SPOSH).   
 
Part 2A provides a means of dealing with unacceptable 
risks posed by land contamination to human health and 
the environment, and under the guidance enforcing 
authorities should seek to find and deal with such land. 
It states that “under Part 2A the starting point should be 
that land is not contaminated land unless there is 
reason to consider otherwise. Only land where 
unacceptable risks are clearly identified, after a risk 
assessment has been undertaken in accordance with 
the Guidance, should be considered as meeting the 
Part 2A definition of contaminated land”. Further the 
guidance makes it clear that “regulatory decisions 
should be based on what is reasonably likely, not what 
is hypothetically possible”. 
 
The overarching objectives of the Government’s policy 
on contaminated land and the Part 2A regime are: 
 
“(a) 
To identify and remove unacceptable risks to  
 human health and the environment. 
(a) 
To seek to ensure that contaminated land is 
made suitable for its current use. 
(b) 
To ensure that the burdens faced by 
individuals, companies and society as a whole 
are 
proportionate, 
manageable 
and 
compatible with the principles of sustainable 
development”. 
 
The enforcing authority may need to decide whether 
and how to act in situations where decisions are not 
straight forward, and where there is uncertainty. “In so 
doing, the authority should use its judgement to strike a 
reasonable balance between: (a) dealing with risks 
raised by contaminants in land and the benefits of 
remediating land to remove or reduce those risks; and 
(b) the potential impacts of regulatory intervention 
including financial costs to whoever will pay for 
remediation, health and environmental impacts of 
taking action, property blight, and burdens on affected 
people”. The authority is required to “take a 
precautionary approach to the risks raised by 
contamination, whilst avoiding a disproportionate 
approach given the circumstances of each case”. The 
aim is “that the regime produces net benefits, taking 
account of local circumstances”. 
 
The guidance recognises that “normal levels of 
contaminants in soils should not be considered to 
cause land to qualify as contaminated land, unless 
there is a particular reason to consider otherwise”. 
 
Normal levels are quoted as: 
“a)   
natural presence of contaminants’ such as 
from underlying geology ‘that have not been 
shown to pose an unacceptable risk to health 
and the environment 
b)   
…low level diffuse pollution, and common 
human activity…” 
PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision 8 June 2017 
Page 2 of 8 
 
 
Similarly the guidance states that significant pollution of 
controlled waters is required for land to be considered 
contaminated and the “fact that substances are merely 
entering water” or “where discharge from land is not 
discernible at a location immediately downstream” does 
not constitute contaminated land. 
 
To help achieve a more targeted approach to 
identifying and managing contaminated land in relation 
to the risk (or possibility) of harm to human health, the 
revised Statutory Guidance presented a new four 
category system for considering land under Part 2A, 
ranging from Category 4, where there is no risk that 
land poses a significant possibility of significant harm 
(SPOSH), or the level of risk is low, to Category 1, 
where the risk that land poses a significant possibility of 
significant harm (SPOSH) is unacceptably high.  
 
For land that cannot be readily placed into Categories 1 
or 4 further assessment is required.  If there is a 
sufficiently strong case that the risks are of sufficient 
concern to cause significant harm/pollution or have the 
significant possibility of significant harm/pollution the 
land is to be placed into Category 2.  If the concern is 
not met land is considered Category 3. 
 
The technical guidance clearly states that the currently 
published SGV and GAC’s represent “cautious 
estimates of level of contaminants in soils” which 
should be considered “no risk to health or, at most, a 
minimal risk”. These values do not represent the 
boundary between categories 3 and 4 and “should be 
considered to be comfortably within Category 4”. 
 
At the end of 2013 technical guidance in support of 
Defra’s revised Statutory Guidance (SG) was published 
(CL:AIRE 2013) which provided:  
• A methodology for deriving C4SLs for four generic 
land-uses 
comprising 
residential, 
commercial, 
allotments and public open space; and  
• A demonstration of the methodology, via the 
derivation of C4SLs for six substances – arsenic, 
benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium, chromium (VI) 
and lead.  
 
2.2 
Planning 
The Local Planning Authority (LPA) is responsible for 
the control of development, and in doing so it has a 
duty to take account of all material considerations, 
including contamination.   
Section 11, Paragraph 109 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) (DCLG 2012) states the 
planning system should contribute to and enhance the 
natural and local environment by “preventing both new 
and existing developments from contributing to or being 
put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely 
affected by unacceptable levels of soil, air, water 
pollution” and “remediating and mitigating despoiled, 
degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land, 
where appropriate”.  Paragraphs 120 and 121 describe 
the policy considerations the Government expects LPA 
to have in regard to land affected by contamination 
when preparing policies for development plans and in 
taking decisions on applications. 
For planning purposes, the NPPF requires that the 
assessment of risks arising from contamination and 
remediation requirements should be considered on the 
basis of the current environmental setting, the current 
land use, and the circumstances of its proposed new 
use  The NPPF stipulates that planning policies and 
decisions should ensure that “the site is suitable for its 
new use taking account of ground conditions and land 
instability, including from natural hazards or former 
activities from previous uses and any proposals for 
mitigation including land remediation or impacts on the 
natural environment arising from that remediation”; and 
that “after remediation, as a minimum, land should not 
be capable of being determined as contaminated land 
under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990; and adequate site investigation information, 
prepared by a competent person, is presented.” 
 
The level at which contamination is deemed to be 
unacceptable, or, gives rise to adverse effects under a 
planning context has not been identified but is 
envisaged to be more precautionary than the level 
required to detrmine land as contaminated under Part 
2A. 
 
In paragraph 121 the developer is required to ensure 
that land, after development, is not capable of being 
determined as contaminated land under Part 2A of the 
EPA 1990.  
 
The principal planning objective is to ensure that any 
unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and 
other property and the natural and historical 
environment from the contaminated condition of the 
land are identified so that appropriate action can be 
considered and taken to address those risks.  In order 
to grant a planning permission the Local Planning 
Authority (LPA) has to be satisfied that there is 
sufficient information about the condition of the land, its 
impacts and the availability of viable remedial options. 
NPPF Paragraph 21 states that “planning policies and 
decisions should also ensure that adequate site 
investigation information, prepared by a competent 
person, is presented”. Site investigation information is 
further defined in the NPPF Glossary page 56 and that 
also states that investigations should be carried out in 
accordance with established procedures, including 
BS10175 (BSI 2011) that in turn links procedure to the 
requirements of CLR11. 
A key distinction between the Soil Guideline Values 
(SGVs) and the C4SLs is the level of risk that they 
describe. As described by the Environment Agency 
(2009a):  
“SGVs are guidelines on the level of long-term human 
exposure to individual chemicals in soil that, unless 
stated otherwise, are tolerable or pose a minimal risk to 
human health.” 
 
A letter from Lord de Mauley dated 3rd September 
2014 provides more explicit direction to local authorities 
on the use of the C4SL in a planning context. The letter 
identifies four key points:  
1) that the screening values were developed expressly 
with the planning regime in mind 
2) their use is recommended in DCLG’s planning 
guidance 
3) soil concentrations below a C4SL limit are 
considered to be ‘definitely not contaminated’ under 
Part llA of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act and 
pose at most a ‘low level of toxicological concern’ and 
4) exceedance of a C4SL screening value does not 
mean that land is definitely contaminated, just that 
further investigation may be warranted.

2.3 
Building Control 
The building control department of the local authority or 
private sector approved inspectors are responsible for 
the operation and enforcement of the Building 
Regulations (DCLG 2010) to protect the health, safety 
and welfare of people in and around buildings. 
Approved Document C requires the protection of 
buildings and associated land from the effects of 
contamination, to be applied (non-exclusively) in all 
changes of use from commercial or industrial premises, 
to residential property. 
3 
Approach 
CLR 11 recommends a phased or tiered approach to 
risk assessment with the three tiers being:- 
� 
Tier 1 - preliminary – a qualitative assessment 
forming part of a Phase 1 report,  
� 
Tier 2 - generic - a quantitative assessment using 
published criteria to screen site specific ground 
condition data forming part of a Phase 2 report 
� 
Tier 3 - detailed – a quantitative assessment 
involving 
the 
generation 
of 
site 
specific 
assessment criteria 
 
Each tier of risk assessment comprises the following 
four stages:- 
 
1. 
Hazard Identification – identifying potential 
contaminant sources on and off site; 
2. 
Hazard Assessment – assessing the potential for 
unacceptable risks by identifying what pathways 
and receptors could be present, and what pollutant 
linkages could result (forming the Conceptual Site 
Model (CSM)); 
3. 
Risk Estimation – estimating the magnitude and 
probability of the possible consequences (what 
degree of harm might result to a defined receptor 
and how likely); and 
4. 
Risk Evaluation – evaluating whether the risk 
needs to be, and can be, managed.   
 
A PBA Phase 1 report normally comprises a desk 
study, walkover and Tier 1 risk assessment (the project 
specific offer defines the actual scope of work). This is 
the minimum requirement as defined by the NPPF, 
pp56. At Tier 1 the PBA approach to risk estimation 
involves identifying the magnitude of the potential 
consequence (taking into account both the potential 
severity of the hazard and the sensitivity of the 
receptor) and the magnitude of the likelihood i.e. the 
probability (taking into account the presence of the 
hazard and the receptor and the integrity of the 
pathway).  This approach is promoted in current 
guidance such as R&D 66 (NHBC 2008). 
 
The PBA approach is that if a pollution linkage is 
identified then it represents a potential risk which 
requires 
further 
consideration 
and 
either 
(1) 
remediation / direct risk management or (2) further tiers 
of assessment.   
 
A PBA preliminary Phase 2 report comprises an 
intrusive 
investigation 
to 
collect 
site 
specific 
information, a Tier 2 quantitative generic risk 
assessment and a refinement of the CSM using the site 
specific data.  Depending on the findings further 
investigation and/or progression to Tier 3 risk 
assessment and the generation of site specific 
assessment criteria may be required. 
 
The PBA methodology provides an estimate of the level 
of risk, it does not identify a risk level at which the risk 
is considered “significant” and/or “unacceptable” as this 
is dependant on the view of the individual / stakeholder. 
For example; to a risk adverse stakeholder even a risk 
level of “very low” may be considered unacceptable 
and as such this stakeholder may require risk 
management options to be implemented. 
 
4 
Identification of Pollutant Linkages and 
Conceptual Site Model (CSM) 
For all Tiers the underlying principle to ground condition 
assessment is the identification of pollutant linkages in 
order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of 
contamination could potentially lead to harmful 
consequences.  A pollutant linkage consists of the 
following three elements:- 
 
• 
A source/hazard – a substance or situation which 
has the potential to cause harm or pollution; 
 
• 
A pathway – a means by which the hazard moves 
along / generates exposure; and 
 
• 
A receptor/target – an entity which is vulnerable to 
the potential adverse effects of the hazard. 
 
The Conceptual Site Model identifies the types and 
locations of potential contaminant sources/hazards and 
potential 
receptors 
and 
potential 
migration/transportation pathway(s).  The CSM is 
refined as the assessment progresses through the 
Tiers. 
 
4.1 
Hazard Identification  
 
A hazard is a substance or situation that has the 
potential to cause harm.  Hazards may be chemical, 
biological or physical (e.g. explosive gases).   
 
At Tier 1 the potential for hazards to be present is 
determined from consideration of the previous or 
ongoing activities on or near to the site in accordance 
with the criteria presented in the Table 1.  
 
Based on the land use information Potential 
Contaminants of Concern (PCOC) are identified.  The 
PCOC direct the scope of the collection of site specific 
data and the analytical testing selected for subsequent 
Tiers. 
 
At Tier 2 the site specific data is screened using 
published assessment criteria (refer to PBA document 
entitled Rationale for the Selection of Tier 2 
Assessment Criteria).  In general, published criteria 
have been developed using highly conservative 
assumptions and therefore if the screening criterion is 
not exceeded then the PCOC is eliminated as a 
potential Hazard.  It should be noted that exceedance 
does not necessarily indicate that a site is 
contaminated and/or unsuitable for use only that the 
PCOC is retained as a potential Hazard.  Published 
criteria are generated using models based on 
numerous and complex assumptions.  Whether or not 
these assumptions are appropriate in a site-specific

data with a critical concentration (CL:AIRE/CIEH 2008) 
which presents a structured process for employing 
statistical techniques for data assessment purposes.  
The benefit of the statistical tool is uncertainty is 
quantified and decisions are made knowing the 
strength of the evidence.  Correct decision probability is 
a function of sample size, difference in the mean and 
the critical concentration, variation in measured values 
and the significance level. 
 
4.2 
Receptor and Pathway Identification 
For all Tiers the potential receptors (for both on site and 
adjoining land) that will be considered are: 
• 
Human Health – including current and future 
occupiers, construction and future maintenance 
workers, and neighbouring properties/third parties;  
• 
Ecological systems; *1 
• 
Controlled waters *2 – including surface water and 
groundwater; 
• 
Property, Animal or Crop (existing or proposed) - 
including buildings, service lines and pipes, crops, 
livestock, pets, woodland; and 
• 
Archaeological sites and ancient monuments. 
 
*1 International or nationally designated sites (as defined in the 
statutory guidance (Defra Circular 04/12)) “in the local area” will 
be identified as potential ecological receptors.  A search radius 
of 1, 2 or 5km will be utilised depending on the site specific 
circumstances (see also pathway identification). The 
Environment Agency has published an ecological risk 
assessment framework (EA 2008) which promotes (as opposed 
to statutorily enforces) consideration of additional receptors to 
include locally protected sites and protected or notable species. 
These additional potential receptors will only be considered if a 
Phase 1 habitat survey, undertaken in accordance with 
guidance (JNCC 1993), is commissioned and the data provided 
to PBA.  It should be noted that without such a survey the Tier 
1 risk assessment may conclude that the identification of 
potential ecological receptors is inconclusive (refer to PBA 
Specification for Phase 1). 
 
*2 the definition of “pollution of controlled water” was amended 
by the introduction of Section 86 of the Water Act 2003.  For 
the purposes of Part 2A groundwater does not include waters 
above the saturated zone and our assessment does not 
therefore 
address perched water other than where 
development causes a pathway to develop. 
 
If a receptor is taken forward for further assessment it 
will be classified in terms of its sensitivity, the criteria 
for which are presented in Table 2.  Table 2 has been 
generated using descriptions of environmental receptor 
importance/value given in various guidance documents 
including R&D 66 (NHBC 2008) and Transport Analysis 
Guidance (based on DETR 2000). Human health and 
buildings classifications have been generated by PBA 
using the attribute description for each class. 
 
The exposure pathway and modes of transport that will 
be considered are presented in Table 3. 
 
4.3 
Note regarding Ecological Systems  
The Environment Agency (EA) has developed an 
ecological risk assessment framework which aims to 
provide a structured approach for assessing the risks to 
ecology from chemical contaminants in soils (EA 2008). 
In circumstances where contaminants in water 
represent a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems then 
risk assessors will need to consider this separately.  
 
The framework consists of a three tiered process:- 
 
• 
Tier 1 is a screening step where the site soils 
chemical data is compared to a soil screening 
value (SSV) 
• 
Tier 2 uses various tools (including surveys and 
biological testing) to gather evidence for any harm 
to the ecological receptors 
• 
Tier 3 seeks to attribute the harm to the chemical 
contamination 
 
Tier 1 is preceded by a desk study to collate 
information about the site and the nature of the 
contamination to assess whether pollutant linkages are 
feasible.  The framework presents ten steps for 
ecological desk studies and development of a 
conceptual site model as follows.   
 
1 Establish Regulatory Context 
2 Collate and Assess Documentary Information 
3 Summarise Documentary Information 
4 Identify Potential Contaminants of Concern 
5 Identify Likely Fate Transport of Contaminants 
6 Identify Potential Receptors of Concern 
7 Identify Potential Pathways of Concern 
8 Create a Conceptual Site Model 
9 Identify Assessment and Measurement Endpoints 
10 Identify Gaps and Uncertainties 
 
The information in a standard PBA Phase 1 report 
covers Steps 1 to 4 inclusive.  Step 5 considers fate 
and transport of contaminants and it should be noted 
that our standard report adopts a simplified approach 
considering only transport mechanisms.  A simplified 
approach has also been adopted in respect of Steps 6 
and 7 receptors (a detailed review of the ecological 
attributes has not been undertaken) and pathways (a 
food chain assessment has not been undertaken). 
Step 9 is outside the scope of our standard Phase 1 
report. 
 
It should be noted that the Tier 1 assessment for 
ecological systems (i.e. where designated sites are 
identified) as part of a Phase 1 report will assess the 
viability of the mode of transport given the site specific 
circumstances not specific pathways.   
 
The Tier 1 risk assessment may conclude that the risk 
to potential ecological receptors is inconclusive (see 
PBA Specification for Phase 1). 
 
4.4 
Note regarding Controlled Waters 
Controlled Waters are rivers, estuaries, coastal 
waters, lakes and groundwaters, but not perched 
waters.   
The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
2000/60/EC provides for the protection of sub-
surface, surface, coastal and territorial waters 
through a framework of river basin management.  
The EU Updated Water Framework Standards 
Directive 2014/101/EU amended the EU WFD to 
update the international standards therein; it enters 
into force on 20 November 2014 and its provisions 
must be transposed in Member State law by 20 May 
2016.  Other EU Directives in the European water 
management framework include: 
• 
the EU Priority Substances Directive 
2013/39/EU; 
PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision 8 June 2017 
Page 5 of 8 
 
• 
EU Groundwater Pollutants Threshold Values 
Directive 2014/80/EU amending the EU 
Groundwater Directive 2006/118/EC; and 
• 
EU Biological Monitoring Directive 2014/101/EU. 
The Ground Water Daughter Directive (GWDD) was 
enacted by the Groundwater Regulations (2009), 
which were subsumed by the Environmental 
Permitting Regulations (2010) which provide 
essential clarification including on the four objectives 
specifically for groundwater quality in the WFD:- 
• 
Achieve ‘Good’ groundwater chemical status 
by 2015, commonly referred to as ‘status 
objective’; 
• 
Achieve Drinking Water Protected Area 
Objectives; 
• 
Implement measures to reverse any 
significant and sustained upward trend in 
groundwater quality, referred to as ‘trend 
objective’; and 
• 
Prevent or limit the inputs of pollutants into 
groundwater, commonly referred to as ‘prevent 
or limit’ objectives 
The Water Act 2003 (Commencement No.11) Order 
2012 amends the test for 'contaminated land' which 
relates to water pollution so that pollution of 
controlled waters must now be "significant" to meet 
the definition of contaminated land. 
 
River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) have been 
developed for the 11 River Basin Districts in England 
and Wales.  These were released by Defra in 2009 
(Defra 2009). 
 
These RBMP’s establish the current status of waters 
within the catchments of the respective Districts and 
the current status of adjoining waters identified.  As part 
of a Tier 2 risk assessment water quality data is 
screened against the WFD assessment criteria. 
Compare to the RBMP’s current status of waters for the 
catchment under consideration would form part of a 
Tier 3 assessment. 
5 
Risk Estimation 
Risk estimation classifies what degree of harm might 
result to a receptor (defined as consequence) and how 
likely it is that such harm might arise (probability).   
At Tier 1 the consequence classification is generated 
by multiplying the hazard classification score and the 
receptor sensitivity score.  This approach follows that 
presented in the republished R&D 66 (NHBC 2008).   
 
The criteria for classifying probability are set out in 
Table 4 and have been taken directly from Table 6.4 
CIRIA C552 (CIRIA 2001).  Probability considers the 
integrity of the exposure pathway. 
 
The consequence classifications detailed in Table 5 
have been adapted from Table 6.3 presented in C552 
and R&D 66 (Annex 4 Table A4.3). 
 
The Tier 1 risk classification is estimated for each 
pollutant linkage using the matrix given in Table 6 
which is taken directly from C552 (Table 6.5). 
Subsequent Tiers refine the CSM through retention or 
elimination of potential hazards and pollutant linkages.   
6 
Risk Evaluation 
In order to put the Tier 1 risk classification into context 
the likely actions are described in Table 7 which is 
taken directly from C552 (Table 6.6). Subsequent Tiers 
identify potential risk management options through 
remediation and/or mitigation measures.

Classification 
Definition 
High likelihood 
There is a pollution linkage and an event either appears very likely in the short-term and 
almost inevitable over the long-term, or there is already evidence at the receptor of harm / 
pollution. 
Likely 
There is a pollution linkage and all the elements are present and in the right place, which 
means that it is probable that an event will occur.  Circumstances are such that an event is 
not inevitable, but possible in the short-term and likely over the long-term. 
Low likelihood 
There is a pollution linkage and circumstances are possible under which an event could 
occur.  However, it is by no means certain that even over a longer period such event would 
take place, and is less likely in the shorter-term. 
Unlikely 
There is a pollution linkage but circumstances are such that it is improbable that an event 
would occur even in the very long-term.

Risk Classification 
Description 
Very high risk 
There is a high probability that severe harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified 
hazard, OR, there is evidence that severe harm to a designated receptor is currently happening.  
This risk, if realised, is likely to result in a substantial liability. Urgent investigation (if not undertaken 
already) and remediation is likely to be required in the short term. 
High risk 
Harm is likely to arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard.  Realisation of the risk is 
likely to present a substantial liability. 
Urgent investigation (if not undertaken already) is required and remedial works may be necessary in 
the short-term and are likely over the longer-term. 
Moderate risk 
It is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard.  However, it is 
either relatively unlikely that any such harm would be severe, or if any harm were to occur it is more 
likely that the harm would be relatively mild. 
Investigation (if not already undertaken) is normally required to clarify the risk and to determine the 
potential liability.  Some remedial works may be required in the longer-term. 
Low risk 
It is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard, but it is likely 
that this harm, if realised, would at worst normally be mild. 
Very low risk 
There is a low possibility that harm could arise to a receptor.  In the event of such harm being 
realised it is not likely to be severe.

Published 1883 - 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Published 1972 - 1976
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Published 1976
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

Published 1993

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first

VectorMap Local (Raster) is Ordnance Survey's highest detailed 'backdrop' 
mapping product. These maps are produced from OS's VectorMap Local, a 
simple vector dataset at a nominal scale of 1:10,000, covering the whole of 
Great Britain, that has been designed for creating graphical mapping. OS 
VectorMap Local is derived from large-scale information surveyed at 1:1250 
scale (covering major towns and cities),1:2500 scale (smaller towns, villages 
and developed rural areas), and 1:10 000 scale (mountain, moorland and 
river estuary areas).

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1901
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Introduction

Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Soils of Intermediate Leaching Potential (I1) - Soils which can possibly 
transmit a wide range of pollutants
Sheet 31 Bedfordshire
1:100,000
Soils of Low Leaching Potential - Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to 
penetrate the soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they 
have large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment
Sheet 31 Bedfordshire
1:100,000
Soils of High Leaching Potential (U) - Soil information for restored mineral 
workings and urban areas is based on fewer observations than elsewhere. A

Introduction
Copyright Notice

Peter Brett Associates Copyright Notice
Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Soils of Low Leaching Potential - Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to 
penetrate the soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they 
have large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment
Sheet 31 Bedfordshire

Soils of High Leaching Potential (U) - Soil information for restored mineral 
workings and urban areas is based on fewer observations than elsewhere. A 
worst case vulnerability classification (H) assumed, until proved otherwise

Introduction

Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Soils of Low Leaching Potential - Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to 
penetrate the soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they 
have large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment

Introduction

Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Soils of Low Leaching Potential - Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to 
penetrate the soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they 
have large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment

Introduction
Copyright Notice

Peter Brett Associates Copyright Notice
Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Client Details
For ease of identification, your site and buffer have been split into Slices, 
Segments and Quadrants.  These are illustrated on the Index Map opposite 
and explained further below.
Each slice represents a 1:10,000 plot area (2.7km x 2.7km) for your site and 
buffer.  A large site and buffer may be made up of several slices (represented
by a red outline), that are referenced by letters of the alphabet, starting from 
the bottom left corner of the slice "grid". This grid does not relate to National 
Grid lines but is designed to give best fit over the site and buffer.
A segment represents a 1:2,500 plot area.  Segments that have plot files 
associated with them are shown in dark green, others in light blue.  These are
numbered from the bottom left hand corner within each slice.
A quadrant is a quarter of a segment.  These are labelled as NW, NE, SW, 
SE and are referenced in the datasheet to allow features to be quickly located
on plots.  Therefore a feature that has a quadrant reference of A7NW will be 
in Slice A, Segment 7 and the NW Quadrant.

PBA Assessment Criteria 
 
PBA Rationale for Selection of Criteria Used in Tier 2 (Generic) Risk Assessment (England) 
Page 1 of 12 
Revision 21 
1 Introduction 
The aim of this document is to present an 
explanation for the selection of the assessment 
criteria routinely used by PBA when undertaking a 
Tier 2 contamination risk assessment.    Any 
deviation from the routine criteria and/or selection 
of criteria for parameters not covered in this 
document will be described in the report text.   
A Tier 2 assessment is a quantitative assessment 
using published criteria to screen the site-specific 
contamination testing data and identify potential 
hazards to specific receptors. Generic criteria are 
typically cautious in derivation and exceedance 
does not indicate that a site is statutorily 
contaminated and/or necessarily unsuitable for 
use in the planning context.  These criteria are 
used 
to 
identify 
situations 
where 
further 
assessment and/or action may be required.  
This document is divided into general introductory 
text and sections on soils, waters and gases. 
2 General Notes 
This document should be read in conjunction with 
another 
entitled 
“PBA 
Methodology 
for 
Assessment of Land Contamination” which 
summarises the legislative regime and our 
approach to ground contamination and risk 
assessment. 
Any PBA interpretation of contamination test 
results is based on a scientific and engineering 
appraisal.  The perceptions of, for example, 
banks, insurers, lay people etc are not taken into 
account. 
Any tables included in this document are 
produced for ease of reference to the criteria, 
they do not in any way replace the documents 
of origin (which are fully referenced) and 
which should be read to ensure appropriate 
use and interpretation of the data.  
Generic criteria provide an aid to decision-making, 
but they do not replace the need for sound 
professional judgement in risk assessment (EA, 
2006b). The criteria are based on numerous and 
complex assumptions.  The appropriateness of 
these assumptions in a site-specific context 
requires confirmation on a project by project basis. 
Our interpretative report will comment on the 
appropriateness of the routine criteria for project 
objectives or ground conditions. It is important to 
note that if the use of the published criteria is 
challenged, it may be necessary to carry out 
modelling to generate site-specific assessment 
criteria. 
 
3 Criteria for Assessing Soil 
Results 
3.1 Potential Harm to Human Health  
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 soil 
screening values for the protection of human 
health are:- 
• 
Suitable 4 Use Levels (S4ULs) published in 
2015 which adopt a minimal or tolerable risk 
as described in SR2 (EA 2009c). 
• 
Category 4 Screening Levels (C4SLs) 
published in 2014 which adopt a “low level of 
toxicological 
concern” 
(LLTC) 
as 
the 
toxicological benchmark.  
The criteria have been generated using the 
Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment model 
(CLEA) and supporting technical guidance (EA, 
2009a, 2009b, 2009c). The CLEA model uses 
generic assumptions about the fate and transport 
of chemicals in the environment and a generic 
conceptual model for site conditions and human 
behaviour to estimate child and adult exposures to 
soil contaminants for those potentially living, 
working, and/or playing on contaminated sites 
over long time periods (EA, 2009b).  
The handbook (EA 2009e) referring to version 
1.05 is still valid for the 1.071 software.  An update 
to the software (1.071) was published on 
04/09/2015. The update includes the library data 
sets from the DEFRA research project SP1010 
(Development of Category 4 Screening Levels for 
assessment of land affected by contamination). It 
also fixes a problem in version 1.07 with the 
adding of new chemicals.). 
The CLEA model uses ten exposure pathways 
(Ingestion (outdoor soil, indoor dust, homegrown 
vegetables and soil attached to homegrown 
vegetables), Dermal Contact (outdoor soil and 
indoor dust) and Inhalation (outdoor dust, indoor 
dust, outdoor vapours and indoor vapours)).  
There are exposure pathways not included in the 
CLEA model such as the permeation of organics 
into plastic water supply pipes. 
The presence and/or significance of each of the 
potential exposure pathways is dependent on the 
land use being considered.  The model uses 
standard land use scenarios as follows:- 
Residential – habitation of a dwelling up to two 
storeys high with various default material and 
design parameters, access to either private or 
nearby community open space with soil track back 
to form indoor dust.  Assumes ingestion of 
homegrown produce. 
Allotments – the model has default parameters 
for use and consumption of vegetables but not 
animals or their products (eggs). 
 
 
PBA Rationale for Selection of Criteria Used in Tier 2 (Generic) Risk Assessment (England)  
Page 2 of 12 
Revision 21 
 
Industrial/commercial – assumes office or light 
physical work in a permanent three storey 
structure with breaks taken outside and that the 
site is NOT covered in hardstanding. 
The assessment criteria generated using CLEA 
can be used as a starting point for evaluating long-
term risks to human health from chemicals in soil. 
It is important to note that the model does not 
assess all the potential exposure risks for example 
risk to workers in excavations (short term 
exposure), inhalation of vapours generated from 
contaminants 
in 
groundwater, 
diffusion 
of 
contaminants through drinking water pipes.  
Recent guidance (DEFRA 2012) introduces a four 
stage classification system where Category 1 sites 
are obviously contaminated and Category 4 sites 
uncontaminated as defined by EPA 1990. Outside 
of 
these 
categories 
further 
specific 
risk 
assessment is required to determine if the site 
should fall into Category 2 contaminated or 
Category 3 uncontaminated.  Category 4 
screening values are considered to be more 
pragmatic than the current published SGV/GAC 
criteria but still strongly precautionary with the aim 
of allowing rapid identification of sites where the 
risk is above minimal but still low/acceptable 
(within the context of Part 2A).  
At the end of 2013 technical guidance in support 
of DEFRA’s revised Statutory Guidance (SG) was 
published (CL:AIRE 2013) which provided:  
• 
A methodology for deriving C4SLs for the 
standard land-uses and two new public open 
space 
scenarios 
using 
the 
updated 
assumptions relating to the modelling of 
human exposure to soil contaminants; and  
• 
A demonstration of the methodology, via the 
derivation of C4SLs for six substances – 
arsenic, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium, 
chromium (VI) and lead.  
Following issue of an Erratum in December 2014 
a  Policy Companion Document was published 
(DEFRA 2014B).  
Soil Guideline Values (SGVs)  
The first series of SGVs were generated using a 
probabilistic version of the CLEA model.  
However, on 22 July 2008 DEFRA announced the 
withdrawal of these SGVs and revised SGVs were 
calculated for all substances except lead using a 
deterministic version of the CLEA model (v1.05). 
Table 1 presents the SGVs which have not been 
withdrawn but it should be noted that they were 
developed using assumptions for body weight and 
inhalation rates that have been revised since 
publication. 
Category 4 Screening Levels (C4SLs)  
A letter from Lord de Mauley dated 3rd September 
2014 provides more explicit direction to local 
authorities on the use of the C4SL in a planning 
context. The letter identifies four key points:  
1) that the screening values were developed 
expressly with the planning regime in mind 
2)  their use is recommended in DCLG’s planning 
guidance 
3) soil concentrations below a C4SL limit are 
considered to be ‘definitely not contaminated’ 
under Part llA of the 1990 Environmental 
Protection Act and pose at most a ‘low level of 
toxicological concern’ and 
4) exceedance of a C4SL screening value does 
not mean that land is definitely contaminated, 
just 
that 
further 
investigation 
may 
be 
warranted.  Table 6 summarises the C4SL 
(DEFRA 
2014B) 
for each of the six 
substances.  PBA uses the criterion for lead 
and may use the other criteria, depending on 
site specific conditions. 
Suitable 4 Use Levels (S4ULs) 
In July 2009, Generic Assessment Criteria (GACs) 
for 82 substances were published by the 
Chartered Institute of Environmental Health 
(CIEH) (LQM and CIEH, 2009) using the then 
current version of the CLEA software v1.04 and 
replacing those generated in 2006 using the 
original version of the model CLEA UK beta. In 
2015 S4ULs were published by LQM/CIEH to 
replace the second edition GACs.  Table 5 
summarises the S4ULs. 
Note on Mercury, Chromium and Arsenic 
Assessment The analytical testing routinely 
undertaken 
by 
PBA 
determines 
total 
concentration, however, the toxicity depends on 
the form of the contaminant.     
If a source of Mercury, Chromium or Arsenic is 
identified or the total concentration exceeds the 
relevant worst case speciated criteria it will be 
desirable/necessary to undertake additional 
speciated testing and further assessment. 
Note on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons 
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a 
family of hundreds of different congeners whose 
chemical structures contain 2 or more fused 
aromatic rings. Whilst it is recognised that there is 
an ongoing debate on the most appropriate 
method to assess health effects of PAH mixtures 
in 
2010 
the 
Health 
Protection 
Agency 
recommended the use of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) as 
a surrogate marker approach in the assessment 
of carcinogenic risks posed by PAHs in soils.  
In most cases, BaP is chosen as the surrogate 
marker (SM) due to its ubiquitous nature and the 
vast amount of data available and has been used 
by various authoritative bodies to assess the 
carcinogenic risk of PAHs in food. The SM 
approach estimates the toxicity of a mixture of 
PAHs in an environmental matrix by using toxicity 
data for a PAH mixture for which the composition 
is known.  
 
PBA Rationale for Selection of Criteria Used in Tier 2 (Generic) Risk Assessment (England)  
Page 3 of 12 
Revision 21 
 
Exposure to the SM is assumed to represent 
exposure to all PAHs in that matrix therefore the 
toxicity of the SM represents the toxicity of the 
mixture.  The SM approach relies on a number of 
assumptions (HPA 2010). 
• 
The SM (BaP) must be present in all the 
samples. 
• 
The profile of the different PAH relative to BaP 
should be similar in all samples. 
• 
The PAH profile in the soil samples should be 
sufficiently similar to that used in the pivotal 
toxicity study on which HBGV was based i.e. 
the Culp study (Culp et al. (1998)). 
In order to justify the use of a surrogate marker 
assessment criterion (C4SL for benzo(a)pyrene 
and S4UL coal tar) the LQM PAH Profiling Tool is 
used by PBA to assess the similarity of the PAH 
profile in a soil sample to that of the toxicity study. 
The spreadsheet that calculates the relative 
proportions of the genotoxic PAHs and plots them 
on the two charts relative to composition of the 
two coal mixtures used by Culp et al. (the 
plus/minus an order of magnitude limits suggested 
by HPA). 
Note on Asbestos  
Asbestos in soil and made ground is currently 
under review by a number of bodies. There are no 
current published guidance values for asbestos in 
soil other than the waste classification values 
given in the EA’s Technical Guidance WM3, 
Hazardous Waste – Interpretation of the definition 
and classification of hazard waste (3d Edition, 
2015). This guidance is only appropriate for soils 
that are being discarded as waste. 
Testing for asbestos will be carried out on 
selected samples of made ground encountered 
during investigation, initially samples will be 
subjected to an asbestos screen and, if asbestos 
is found to be present, subjected to quantification 
depending on the project specific requirements. 
The reader is directed to the report text for 
guidance on the approach adopted in respect to 
any asbestos found to be present. Further 
guidance is also available in the 2014 CIRIA 
publication C733, Asbestos in soil and made 
ground: a guide to understanding and managing 
risks.  
3.2 Potential Harm to the Built Environment  
Land contamination can pose risks to buildings, 
building materials and services (BBM&S) in a 
number of ways. Volatile contaminants and gases 
can accumulate and cause explosion or fire. 
Foundations and buried services can be damaged 
by corrosive substances and contaminants such 
as steel slags can create unstable ground 
conditions through expansion causing structural 
damage.   
 
PBA use the following primary guidance to assess 
the significance of soil chemistry with respect to its 
potential to harm the built environment. 
i)

Resistance to Contaminants and Moisture. 
(DCLG 2010);  
ii) Concrete in aggressive ground SD1 (BRE 
2005);  
iii) Guidance for the selection of water supply 
pipes to be used in brownfield sites (UKWIR 
2011); 
iv) Protocols published by agreement between 
Water UK and the Home Builders Federation 
providing supplementary guidance which 
includes the Risk Assessment for Water 
Pipes (the ‘RA’) (Water UK 2014). 
v) Performance 
of

Materials 
in 
Contaminated Land report BR255 (BRE 
1994). 
vi) Risks of Contaminated Land to Buildings,

Review - Technical Report P331 (EA 2000). 
vii) Guidance on assessing and managing risks to 
buildings from land contamination - Technical 
Report P5 035/TR/01 (EA 2001). 
3.3 Potential to Harm Ecosystems, Animals, 
Crops etc  
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 
screening values to assess the potential of soil 
chemistry to harm ecosystems are taken from the 
following guidance and summarised in are given in 
Table 2. 
i) 
Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) Science 
Report Series SC070009, published by the 
Environment Agency, Bristol (EA, 2008); 
ii) The Restoration and Aftercare of Metalliferous 
Mining Sites for Pasture and Grazing (ICRCL 
70/90, 1990); and 
iii) Code of Practice for Agricultural Use of 
Sewage Sludge 2nd Edition (DOE, 2006). 
iv) BS 3882:2015 Specification for topsoil and 
requirements for use.   
Unless stated in the report the assessment is 
solely for phytotoxic parameters and additional 
assessment is required to determine suitability as 
a growing medium. 
4 Criteria for Assessing Liquid 
Results 
4.1 Potential Harm to Human Health  
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 water 
screening values (Table 4) are taken from 
Statutory Instrument (S.I.) The Water Supply 
(Water Quality) Regulations (S.I. 2016/614).   
 
 
PBA Rationale for Selection of Criteria Used in Tier 2 (Generic) Risk Assessment (England)  
Page 4 of 12 
Revision 21 
 
It should be noted that some of the prescribed 
concentrations listed in the Water Supply 
Regulations have been set for reasons other than 
their potential to cause harm to human health.  
The concentrations of iron and manganese are 
controlled because they may taint potable water 
with an undesirable taste, odour or colour or may 
potentially deposit precipitates in water supply 
pipes. 
4.2 Potential to Harm Controlled Waters  
When assessing ground condition data and the 
potential to harm Controlled Waters PBA uses the 
approach presented in Groundwater Protection 
Policy and Practice (GP3) (EA 2013).Controlled 
Waters are rivers, estuaries, coastal waters, lakes 
and groundwaters.  Water in the unsaturated zone 
is not groundwater but does come within the 
scope of the term “ground waters” as used and 
defined in the Water Resources Act 1991. It will 
continue to be a technical decision for the 
Environment Agency to determine what is 
groundwater in certain circumstances for the 
purposes of the Regulations.   
The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
2000/60/EC provides for the protection of sub-
surface, surface, coastal and territorial waters 
through a framework of river basin management. 
The EU Updated Water Framework Standards 
Directive 2014/101/EU amended the EU WFD to 
update the international standards therein; it 
entered into force on 20 November 2014 and its 
provisions must be transposed in Member State 
law by 20 May 2016. 
Member States are required under the EU WFD to 
update their river basin management plans every 
six years. The first river basin management plans 
for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern 
Ireland were published in December 2009, and the 
process of producing the second RBMPs is 
currently ongoing. 
Other EU Directives in the European water 
management framework include: 
• 
the 
EU 
Priority 
Substances 
Directive 
2013/39/EU; 
• EU Groundwater Pollutants Threshold Values 
Directive 
2014/80/EU 
amending 
the 
EU 
Groundwater Directive 2006/118/EC; and 
• 
the 
EU 
Biological 
Monitoring 
Directive 
2014/101/EU. 
The 
Priority 
Substances 
Directive 
set 
environmental quality standards (EQS) for the 
substances in surface waters (river, lake, 
transitional and coastal) and confirmed their 
designation as priority or priority hazardous 
substances (PS), the latter being a subset of 
particular 
concern. 
Environmental 
Quality 
Standards for PS are determined at the European 
level and apply to all Member States. Member 
States identify and develop standards for ‘Specific 
Pollutants’. Specific Pollutants (SP) are defined as 
substances that can have a harmful effect on 
biological quality.   
The Water Framework Directive (Standards and 
Classification) Directions (England and Wales) 
2015 were issued by Defra to the Environment 
Agency as an associated document of the Water 
Environment (WFD) (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1623) and provide 
directions for the classification of surface water 
and groundwater bodies.  Schedule 3 parts 2 and 
3 relate to surface water standards for specific 
pollutants in fresh or salt water bodies and priority 
substances in inland (rivers, lakes and related 
modified/artificial bodies)  or other surface waters 
respectively.  Although Schedule 5 presents 
threshold values for groundwater the Direction 
specifically excludes their use as part of site 
specific investigations. 
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 
screening values (Table 4). This table only 
presents a selection of the more commonly 
analysed parameters and the source documents 
should be consulted for other chemicals.  For 
screening  groundwater the criteria selected are 
the standards for surface water and/or human 
consumption as appropriate together with the 
following:-   
For a hazardous substance PBA adopts the 
approach that, if the concentration in a discharge 
is less than the Minimum Reporting Value (MRV), 
the input is regarded as automatically meeting the 
Article 2 (b) ‘de-minimus’ requirement of 
exemption 6 (3) (b) of the GWDD. PBA has 
selected hazardous substances and associated 
MRV from those listed in Table 13 of UKTAG 
WFD River Basin Management 2015-21 Updated 
Recommendations on Environmental Standards 
(as referenced in Defra 2014). MRV is the lowest 
concentration of a substance that can be routinely 
determined with a known degree of confidence, 
and may not be equivalent to limit of detection. 
For non-hazardous substances the GWDD 
requires that inputs be limited to avoid 
deterioration. 
UKTAG 
guidance 
equates 
deterioration 
with 
pollution. 
Non-hazardous 
substances are all substances not classified as 
hazardous. 
5 Criteria for Assessing Gas 
Results 
PBA use the following primary guidance on gas 
monitoring methods and strategy, the assessment 
of risk posed by soil gases (including Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs)) and mitigation 
measures/risk reduction during site development. 
i)

and carbon dioxide ground gases for new 
buildings (BSI 2015).  
Gas and borehole flow data are used to obtain the 
gas screening value (GSV) for methane and 
carbon dioxide. The GSV is used to establish the 
characteristic 
situation 
and 
to 
make 
recommendations for gas protection measures for 
buildings if required. 
Radon  
PBA use the following primary guidance to assess 
the significance of the radon content of soil gas. 
i) 
Radon: guidance on protective measures for 
new dwellings. Report BR211 (BRE, 2015); 
and
