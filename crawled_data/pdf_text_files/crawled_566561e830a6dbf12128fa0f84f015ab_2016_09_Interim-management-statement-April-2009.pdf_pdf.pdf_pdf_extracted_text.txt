Interim Management Statement
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 January 2009 to
date.
With respect to 2009, the UK market has been experiencing low near-term dark green spreads,
although our exposure is mitigated by our strong forward contracted position. If commodity prices
remain at current levels, we anticipate full year EBITDA will be in line with those market forecasts
which have taken into account these low margins. Our continued focus on active working capital
management will provide some support to the impact on cash available for distribution.
For 2010 and beyond, commodity markets currently forecast a sharp recovery in prices and dark
green spreads. We continue to trade at healthy levels for these years.
On 6 March, we announced the acquisition of Haven Power, an electricity supply business serving
business customers, in line with our strategy to extend our trading capabilities and options for
routes to market. We are pleased to note that the integration of Haven Power within the Drax group
is proceeding well.
On 7 April, we announced the signing of the design and build contract with C Spencer, to supply
rail unloading equipment and biomass bulk storage and handling systems for the direct injection
biomass co-firing systems being installed at Drax. This was the final contract to be awarded for the
400MW biomass co-firing project, which is being delivered to cost and schedule.
We are also pleased to announce that we have recently signed a new long-term contract with UK
Coal at attractive prices, replacing the existing arrangements.
We continue to make good progress on our biomass growth strategy: we have formally accepted
the grid connection offer of 2012 for the Drax site and initial scoping documents have been
submitted for both the Drax and Immingham sites. Furthermore, local consultations on the two
sites have commenced as part of the planning process.
Other than as stated above, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any material
change in the underlying financial position of the group during the period.
Drax will issue a pre close statement on 30 June 2009 in which it will update the market on its
positions under contract for 2009, 2010 and 2011.
