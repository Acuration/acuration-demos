Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified records of otter Lutra lutra and water vole Arvicola 
amphibius within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey 
Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey of streams 
and wet ditches within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 
within the Survey Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Project. 
1.3 
All accessible ponds, streams and wet ditches within the Survey Site boundary were surveyed for 
field signs of use by otter and water vole. 
1.4 
There are water courses on Survey Site that could provide resting places and commuting routes for 
otter. A single fresh spraint was recorded during the survey. This was observed on a rock in the 
stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site. 
1.5 
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were observed at six points along two streams 
within the Survey Site. The holes have the right dimensions to allow use by water voles, but did not 
show signs of current occupation. No latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed during the 
survey.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey 
in May/June 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
2.4 
There are a number of water courses within the Survey Site as described below: 
 
A stream corridor with small tributaries fed by springs and surface runoff along the 
eastern boundary of the Survey Site, which feeds into the River Llan to the south.  
 
A wooded stream runs along the north western boundary.  
 
Several small streams and wet ditches run through the woodland surrounding the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations. 
 
Drainage ditches border many of the pasture fields. 
Description of Project 
2.5 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.6 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including an otter and water vole survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in 
support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.7 
The aims of the otter and water vole survey within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Assess where water courses within the Survey Site have the potential to support otter and 
water vole. 
 
Establish the likely presence/absence of each species and, if present, their distribution 
throughout the relevant watercourses.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected2 species, including otter and water vole, was requested covering the Survey 
Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area was also reviewed in May 2014 to identify watercourses that might be 
present within the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
A Phase 1 habitat survey was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated in April 
and July 20143. During the Phase 1 habitat survey it was noted that a number of watercourses 
within the Survey Site had the potential to support otter and water vole, although no field signs 
were observed. The ponds within the Survey Site were also assessed at this time, and no field 
signs of otter or water vole were noted. 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The otter and water vole survey included two visits to cover water courses within the Survey Site. 
The first visit covered the north of the Survey Site and was conducted on 20 May 2014 by Anna 
Gundrey MCIEEM and Rachel Taylor ACIEEM. The second visit covered the south of the Survey 
Site and was conducted on 26 June 2014 by Rachel Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. All 
accessible water courses were inspected for field signs of otter and water vole. In addition, Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann surveyed the ponds within the Survey Site while undertaking 
great crested newt Triturus cristatus presence/absence surveys in May 20144.  
Otter 
3.4 
The otter survey was carried out on all accessible water courses within the Survey Site. Survey 
methods followed those recommended in Chanin (2003)5. 
3.5 
The water courses, including the channel and banks, were systematically surveyed for signs of 
otter such as droppings (‘spraints’), runs and footprints.  All areas that were accessible were 
surveyed, and particular attention was given to suitable sprainting areas such as large, flat rocks or 
areas where otters were likely to leave the water course.  Otter spraint can be distinguished from 
other mammal droppings, such as mink, by its distinctive musky smell and the presence of fish 
bones.  Mink scats tend to be twisted in appearance and are smaller.   
3.6 
Signs of, or potential for, permanent dwellings (‘holts’) or resting places for otters were also 
recorded.  Holts and resting places include structures such as cavities in roots of bank side trees, 
piles of logs or flood debris, drains and caves.  Otters can also use resting places above ground in 
reed beds and dense scrub such as bramble Rubus fruticosa and blackthorn Prunus spinosa.   
Water Vole 
3.7 
All water courses that were accessible were surveyed within the optimal period for finding water 
vole (late April to early October). This is in line with survey standards set out in The Water Vole 
Conservation Handbook6. The water courses, including the channel and banks, were

systematically surveyed for signs of water vole such as latrines (a communal area of droppings), 
feeding stations and grazed lawns, burrows (wider than high, diameter 4-8 cm), runs and footprints.   
3.8 
In addition, an assessment was made of whether individual water courses have potential to support 
water vole. The Water Vole Conservation Handbook describes favourable water vole habitat as 
having: wide swathes of riparian vegetation to provide both food and shelter; easily penetrable 
earth banks; and slow flowing, relatively deep (over 1 m) slow flowing water courses.  Factors such 
as shallow water or over-shading by trees are generally unfavourable to water voles. 
Classification of Areas Surveyed for Otter and Water Vole 
3.9 
Target notes (TN) were used to describe the characteristics of the water courses surveyed and to 
record any field signs that were observed. These were mapped (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and the 
target notes included (Appendix 2). In order to further illustrate the findings of the survey, the 
streams and ditches were categorised as follows: 
3.10 
Habitat considered unsuitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of 
the following characteristics: no/low water levels; shaded; little vegetation; poached banks; no 
suitable resting places; no field signs of otter or water vole. 
3.11 
Habitat considered suitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of the 
following characteristics: permanent flow of water; vegetation on banks; minimal shading; suitable 
resting places present; signs of otter/water vole. 
3.12 
Photographs are included showing the characteristics of water courses within the Survey Site 
(Appendix 3).

Results  
Otter 
Desk Study 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 
and 2013. The closest record to the Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west of the River Llan.  At its 
closest point the River Llan is approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, 
within the same surface water catchment, and it links to the Survey Site via the stream running 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site. 
Field Survey 
4.2 
A single fresh otter spraint was found in the stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the 
Survey Site (see TN3, Figure 1, Appendix 1; and Appendix 2). At this point the stream is 
approximately 15 cm deep and with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks, the eastern bank is 
approximately 2 m high and sheer with over hanging trees. The western bank has an 
approximately 45 degree grass slope and is approximately 1.5 m high. 
4.3 
No other signs were observed that confirm otter presence in the other water courses within the 
Survey Site.  
4.4 
The stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site also had deep overhangs 
created by the root system of the mature hedge and trees on the east bank. These have potential 
to be used as resting places by otter (see Figure 1, Appendix 1). However, foraging opportunities 
for otters are likely to be limited due to the low water levels (20-30 cm), which would make the 
watercourse less suitable for fish, and therefore foraging otters.   
Water Vole 
Desk Study 
4.5 
SEWBReC provided three records of water vole, within a 2 km search radius. These records were 
from the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River 
is in the same surface water catchment as watercourses present in the Survey Site, so it is 
possible that water voles could move along water courses that are linked to the River Llan (see 
section 4.1 above). 
Field Survey 
4.6 
During the surveys many of the ditches that had contained water during the first Phase 1 habitat 
survey (in February after a very wet winter) had completely dried out by the time of the otter and 
water vole surveys in May and June 2014. The remaining water courses were fast running and 
shallow. The banks of the streams were often over-shaded with encroaching bramble and gorse or 
had steep, bare banks.  
4.7 
No field signs were observed during the surveys that clearly establish the presence of water vole. 
Some burrows were noted that had dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole 
Myodes glareolus and rats, but did not exhibit signs of current use (see TNs 1. 2, 4, 5 and 7). 
However, no associated latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed at any of these 
locations, Figure 1, Appendix 1; Appendix 2). There was also no evidence of associated burrows 
below the water line, which is typical of water vole burrows. The holes were therefore considered 
unlikely to be used by water vole and are more likely to have been created by another species of 
small mammal, such as bank vole Myodes glareolus, or been created by water vole but 
subsequently abandoned.

4.8 
No water vole field signs were observed at the ponds within the Survey Site during the great 
crested newt presence/absence surveys in May 20147. 
Incidental Sightings 
In addition to signs of otter and water vole presence recorded during the survey, some signs of 
badger activity were also noted and are included here for completeness. A single hole badger sett 
was found at TN9, with digging and a fresh latrine recorded at TN8.  
Limitations of Study 
4.9 
Some of the southern stretch of the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site had 
extensive bramble and scrub along the banks, with low over-hanging branches and debris in the 
stream itself. This impeded the view of the surveyors along this stretch. However, a large stretch of 
the northern section of the same stream was also surveyed without issue, and therefore this 
limitation should not affect the overall results of the survey. Areas that were inaccessible, or for 
which the visibility was limited due to extensive scrub, are also indicated on the map (Figure 1, 
Appendix 1).

Appendix 2: Target Notes (TN) 
 
Stream at TN1 - The stream is wooded, mostly shaded with shallow bramble covered banks. The 
stream bed is stony, water fast moving and shallow. This provides a sheltered corridor through 
which otter may commute, but no obvious resting places or signs of otter use were observed. 
 
1. 
At TN 1 there is a vertical 1m high bare mud bank on the western side of the stream. The stream is 
approximately 10 cm deep at this point. There is a hole 1 m above the water which had dimensions 
suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed.  
 
To the south of TN1 is a marshy field with a network of ditches - At the time of survey (May) these 
ditches were dry or contained very little water and had steep banks with very little or no vegetation. 
 
Stream at TN2 to TN10 – The stream is relatively unshaded, with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks. 
The water depth ranges from approximately 10 cm to 20 cm where pools form. It is fast flowing and 
appears clean. The eastern bank is approximately 2 m high and sheer. It is topped by a mature 
hedge the root system of which form a number of deep overhangs by the side of the stream. The 
west bank has an approximately 45 degree grassed slope.  
 
2. 
A hole was found in the vertical east bank, approximately 20 cm above the waterline, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
3. 
A fresh otter spraint was found on a large, flat stone in the middle of the stream. 
4. 
A pair of holes was found in the east bank approximately 1.5 m from the water line, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
5. 
A possible otter resting place on east bank. No otter field signs were observed. A 15 cm diameter 
hole was found leading into a cavity under the tree root bole, approximately 2 m above the water 
line. Approximately 3 m to the south of this there are three further holes, 1 m above the waterline 
on the eastern bank with dimensions that would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No 
water vole field signs were observed.  
6. 
Tributary of the main stream, this is a narrow brook that has dried out at its northern end. It is over 
shaded by scrub, no field signs for otter or water vole were observed. 
7. 
There is a particularly deep over-hang in the east bank under a root bole. Basal rocks are moss 
free on top suggesting that it may be regularly accessed; however no field signs of otter were 
observed. This has good potential as a resting place for otter. On the west bank, above a culvert 
pipe that runs into the stream from the brook at TN6 there are two holes with dimensions that 
would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs of water vole were 
observed. 
8. 
A deep cavity in the eastern bank along the waterline good provides a potential resting place for 
otter. No otter field signs were observed. On the top of the west bank opposite the cavity are a 
number of fresh patches of badger digging and a fresh badger latrine. 
9. 
A hole was found in the east bank 2 m above the water line; dimensions suggest that this is a 
badger sett. There is a mammal run into the field to the east.  
10. 
The stream becomes very shaded at this point, and the eastern bank is largely undercut providing 
several potential resting places for otter. No field signs were observed.  
 
Damp ditch/brook at TN11 to TN12 – to the north of TN11 this is a dry to damp ditch that has 
mainly bare banks, with some areas over-grown by bramble. It is open to horses and sheep and 
the land around the ditch is poached. No signs of otter or water vole were observed and this 
section is considered unsuitable for use by either species. To the south of TN11 the amount of 
water in the ditch gradually becomes greater until it forms a narrow brook, approximately 10 cm in 
depth.  
 
11. 
The brook is very over-grown with gorse and bramble, the banks are approximately 1 m high and 
the water is quick moving and shallow. There is a fenced culvert 10 m to the north which is partially 
blocked by debris from a fallen tree on the eastern bank. No field signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
12. 
The brook is shallow and fast moving with low grassy banks, over grown by bramble and nettle in 
large sections. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. South of this location the stream runs 
through woodland and connects to the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site.  
 
 
 
 
Stream at TN13 to TN18 – The southern section of the stream previously described in TN2 to 
TN10. The banks are lined with trees and a scrub understorey of predominantly bramble, the 
stream is approximately 10 cm – 20 cm deep with a rocky bed. The bank is approximately 1 – 2 m 
high and undercut in places. The extensive scrub impeded the surveyors’ ability to access the 
stream, however the length was walked and notes made when a good view was available. 
  
13. 
The stream is narrow, with a bare bank approximately 1 m on each side. It is encroached by 
bramble and gorse and is largely over shaded. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
14. 
A shallow ditch extending north-west of the stream, it is dry at the northern end, the banks and low 
and poached by horses. The south end contains a small amount of slow moving water and is 
overgrown with bramble.  
15. 
A similar ditch to TN14, this is dry to the north and the banks are poached by horses. No signs of 
otter or water vole were observed.  
16. 
The stream is wide, and fast moving, approximately 10 cm in depth. The banks are approximately 1 
m high and covered by bramble. There is some undercutting of the bank, although not deep 
enough to provide resting opportunities for otter. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
17. 
The stream is narrow and fast moving, approximately 15cm deep, banks are steep and bare 
topped with bramble. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
18. 
The stream is wide and fast flowing, approximately 20 cm deep. Root boles of trees along the 
western bank provide resting opportunities for otter. The eastern bank is low with a stone beach 
where the stream bends. No signs were observed however access was limited due to bramble and 
a fence on the western bank.  
 
Ditches and stream at TN19 to TN21 – ditches run along the edge of sheep pasture, most of 
these are dry with bare banks. A small brook runs from the edge of the woodland through the 
pasture and extends south outside of the site boundary.  
 
19. 
This is a dry sheep poached ditch. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
20. 
A shallow brook, approximately 10cm in depth with a 50cm high grassy bank to the west and trees 
along the eastern bank. There are fox runs along the western side. No signs of otter or water vole 
were observed.  
21. 
A nearly dry ditch, small trickle of water runs over a muddy bed. The banks are low and bare, the 
ditch is over shaded by trees which line each side. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
  
Water courses in and around wet woodland and National Grid land at TN22 to TN26 – There 
are shallow ditches along the edges of the woodland, with small streams running in the interior of 
the woodland. The streams are approximately 10 cm deep, containing leaf litter and debris. The 
banks are steep with little vegetation other than nettle.  
 
22. 
Very narrow, over-shaded steam with fast moving, shallow water. There is bramble encroaching on 
both banks. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
23. 
Slow flowing woodland ditch with little water, and a large amount of leaf litter and debris. The banks 
are low with no vegetation. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. The ditch to the north of 
this point becomes inaccessible.  
24. 
Similar to the ditch at TN23 this ditch is shallow with slow moving water and completely over 
shaded by the woodland, with large amounts of leaf litter. No otter or water vole signs were 
observed.  
25.
