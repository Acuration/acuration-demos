provide an area for the assembly of large plant items within a 
reasonable distance of the project site. A small area to the south 
of the Power Generation Plant (to the south of Main Avenue) has 
been acquired by Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL) and would be used 
for this purpose. The laydown area is an existing car parking area 
covered in hardstanding, with miscellaneous buildings and 
structures. The area will be made suitable for use as a laydown 
area through demolition of some of these buildings and structures. 
The laydown area is indicated on Figure 4.2 [APP-026]. 
2.13 
This laydown area would also be used periodically during operation 
for any maintenance activities. 
2.14 
The project is a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
compromising a generating station as defended in sections 
14(1)(a) and 15 of the Planning Act 2008. The various works that 
this application is seeking authorisation for are detailed in

Hirwaun Power Project
 
10
 
 
the gas NTS, adjacent to the A4061. It has an approximate length 
of 0.9 km. 
2.18 
An Above Ground Installation (AGI) would be required to connect 
the gas pipeline to the NTS, including gas regulating equipment. A 
new permanent access track would allow access to the AGI from 
the A4061 for maintenance.  Connection to the NTS at any high 
pressure pipeline location will require two adjacent above ground 
facilities to be installed: 
 
a Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC), which would be 
designed, constructed, owned and operated by National Grid 
Gas (NGG), and 
 
a Pig Trap Facility (PTF)  which would be designed, 
constructed, owned and operated by the Applicant (these two 
facilities together constitute the AGI).  
 
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION 
2.19 
The Electrical Connection would connect the Power Generation 
Plant to a new substation, approximately 686m west of the Power 
Generation Plant Site (Rhigos Substation). The substation is 
currently under construction by National Grid Company (NGC) in 
connection with the development of the Pen Y Cymoedd Wind 
Farm, which was granted Section 36 consent (under the Electricity 
Act 1989) and deemed planning consent. 
2.20

EUROPEAN SITES 
2.28 
The Applicant’s No Significant Effects Report (NSER) [APP-045] 
identified the following UK European sites for which the UK is 
responsible for inclusion within the assessment:  
 
Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation (SAC); 
(i)
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC; and 
(ii)
 Cwm Cadlan SAC.  
(iii)
2.29 
These three sites are referred to collectively as the European 
Sites: 
 
Blaen Cynon SAC & Cors Bryn Y Gaer SSSI 
(i)
The Blaen Cynon SAC is located approximately 0.25 km north east 
from the site. 
Blaen Cynon contains an extensive complex of damp pastures and 
heaths supporting the largest meta-population of marsh fritillary 
(Euphydryas aurinia) on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons 
National Park (BBNP).   The Annex II primary qualifying feature 
and sole reason for the sites selection as an SAC is marsh fritillary 
butterfly. This SAC is considered to be the one of the best areas in 
the UK for marsh fritillary butterfly. The population of marsh 
fritillary is considered to be between 501 and 1000 resident 
individuals3. The SAC encompasses an area of 66.81 ha and 
supports a variety of habitats.

Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI is of special interest4 for its lowland bog 
and for areas of soligenous flush, marshy grassland, dry neutral 
grassland and lowland acid grassland. These habitats occur in a 
complex with wet heath, swamp and semi-improved grassland. 
The site is also of special interest for the marsh fritillary butterfly 
Euphydryas aurinia. The site forms part of Blaen Cynon SAC.  The 
lowland raised bog feature is the most sensitive to the effects of 
nitrogen deposition and consequently has the lowest minimum 
critical load of the habitats present on site which is 5kg/N/ha/yr. 
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC  
(ii)
The Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC is located approximately 1.2 km 
north west from the site at its closest point. 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte is an extensive area of woodland along a 
series of deeply incised valleys and ravines, situated to the north 
of Pontneddfechan in south Wales. The European (Annex I habitat) 
interests are the western sessile oak woodland and ash woodland. 
The whole site is biologically rich, with many woodland plant 
communities represented as well as a rich variety of ferns, lichens, 
mosses and liverworts. 4.3.2 This SAC encompasses an area of 
378.18 ha5. 
 Cwm Cadlan SAC  
(iii)
The Cwm Cadlan SAC is located approximately 3 km north-north 
east from the site at its closest point. 
This SAC encompasses an area of 83.91 ha. Cwm Cadlan is a 
mosaic of wet grassland fields in a small valley to the north-west 
of Merthyr Tydfil.  Lime-rich waters flow through the reserve and 
sustain marshy grassland habitats, as well as a variety of 
specialised plants and animals. Marshy grassland and wetlands like 
this are now uncommon features of the wider countryside, with 
many areas having been drained and used for more intensive 
agriculture. 
There are two Annex I habitats identified as primary reasons for 
site selection, with no further qualifying interests. The two habitats 
are Molinia meadows on calcareous, peaty or clayey-silt-laden 
soils (Molinion caeruleae) and Alkaline Fens6.

LEGAL AND POLICY CONTEXT 
PLANNING ACT 2008, AS AMENDED 
3.1 
The application is a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP), being an electricity generating station with a capacity of 
more than 50MWe (Planning Act 2008, s14 (1) (a) and s. 15 (2)). 
Accordingly, the principal policy basis against which the proposal 
must be decided is that set out in the relevant National Policy 
Statements (NPS) (Planning Act 2008, s104). 
3.2 
Whilst other policies, including those contained in the development 
plans for the area, may constitute matters that the SoS may 
regard as important and relevant to the decision, the primacy of 
the NPSs is clear (Planning Act 2008 s104(3) and NPS EN-1, 
paragraph 1.1.1).  In the event of a conflict between policies 
contained in any other documents (including development plan 
documents) and those contained in an NPS, those in the NPS 
prevail for the purposes of decision making on nationally 
significant infrastructure (NPS EN-1, paragraph 4.1.5).  
3.3 
The application includes a Planning Statement which sets out the 
policy context for the proposed development [APP-040]. Additional 
information on local planning policies was provided by BBNPA 
[REP-024] and RCT [REP-025] as part of their Local Impact 
Reports (LIRs).  
 
NATIONAL POLICY STATEMENTS 
3.4 
The ExA has had regard first and foremost to the requirements of 
the Planning Act 2008, as amended. In relation to s.104 the ExA 
has had regard to the matters in subsection (2) (a) and (b) of the 
Act.  
3.5 
The NPSs which are relevant to the consideration of the DCO 
Application are: 
 
NPS EN-1 The Overarching National Policy Statement for 
Energy; 
 
NPS EN-2 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure; 
 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply 
Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines; and 
 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks. 
3.6 
These four NPSs formed the primary policy context for this 
examination. These were formally designated as statements of 
national policy and presented to Parliament in accordance with s 
5(9) of the Planning Act 2008 in July 2011. The ExA’s views on 
their significance for this application are set out in Section 4 of this 
report. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State

3.7 
Section 1.1.2 of EN-1 states that: 
'The Planning Act 2008 also requires that the IPC7 must decide an 
application for energy infrastructure in accordance with the 
relevant NPSs except to the extent it is satisfied that to do so 
would: 
 
lead to the UK being in breach of its international obligations; 
 
be in breach of any statutory duty that applies to the IPC; 
 
be unlawful;  
 
result in adverse impacts from the development outweighing 
the benefits; or  
 
be contrary to regulations about how its decisions are to be 
taken.’ 
3.8 
In relation to s.104 of Planning Act 2008 the ExA has had regard 
to the matters in subsection (2)(b). Two LIRs from BBNPA [REP-
024] and RCT [REP-025] were submitted and are considered in 
Section 4.8 - 4.13 of this report.  
3.9 
In relation to s.104(4) of Planning Act 2008 the question whether 
deciding the application in accordance with the NPS would lead to 
the UK being in breach of its international obligations under the 
Habitats Directive is considered in Section 5 of this report.  
3.10 
There is clearly an urgent national need established in national 
policy as a set out in EN-1 and EN-2 to deliver new energy 
generation capacity of the sort proposed for Hirwaun. EN-1 goes 
on to state that if a development is in accordance with the NPS, 
the decision maker should start with a presumption in favour of 
that development.  The ExA consider the application project 
against the policies of the NPS in Section 4 of this report. 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING (ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
ASSESSMENT) REGULATIONS 
3.11 
The application is also subject to the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009, as 
amended by the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
assessment) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, and in particular 
Regulation 38, which requires the SoS to take the environmental 
information into consideration before taking a decision.  
                                       
 
7 Infrastructure Planning Commission  
8 Regulation 3.- Prohibition on granting consent without consideration of environmental 
information  
3.—(1) This regulation applies to— 
(a) every application for an order granting development consent for EIA development received by the 
Commission; and  (b) every subsequent application for EIA development received by a relevant 
authority on or after 1st March 2010. (2) Where this regulation applies, the Secretary of State or 
relevant authority (as the case may be) must not (in the case of the Secretary of State) make an 
order granting development consent or (in the case of the relevant authority) grant subsequent 
consent unless it has first taken the environmental information into consideration, and it must state in 
its decision that it has done so.

3.12 
The application is EIA development as defined by the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended).  It was accompanied by an 
Environmental Statement (ES) [APP-019 to APP-032].  
Supplementary environmental information was supplied during the 
course of the examination. The ExA in reaching its conclusions and 
recommendation, has taken into consideration the environmental 
information as defined in Regulation 3 (1) (including the ES and all 
other information on the environmental effects of the 
development) (see Section 4 of this report). 
 
EUROPEAN REQUIREMENTS AND RELATED UK 
REGULATIONS 
Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) 
3.13 
The Habitats Directive (together with the Council Directive 
79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (Wild Birds 
Directive) (Birds Directive)) forms the cornerstone of Europe's 
nature conservation policy. It is built around two pillars:  
 
the Natura 2000 network of protected sites and 
(i)
 
the strict system of species protection.  
(ii)
The directive protects over 1000 animals and plant species and 
over 200 habitat types, which are of European importance. 
Conservation and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
the Habitats Regulations 
Conservation of Habitats and Species (Amendment) 
Regulations 2012 
3.14 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
replaced The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 
1994 (as amended) in England and Wales. The Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (which are the principal 
means by which the Habitats Directive is transposed in England 
and Wales) update the legislation and consolidated all the many 
amendments which have been made to the regulations since they 
were first made in 1994. 
3.15 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 apply 
in the terrestrial environment and in territorial waters out to 12 
nautical miles. The Conservation of Habitats and Species 
(Amendment) Regulations 2012 came into force on 16 August 
2012. 
3.16 
These Regulations amend the Habitats Regulations. They place 
new duties on public bodies to take measures to preserve, 
maintain and re-establish habitat for wild birds. They also make a 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
18
 
 
number of further amendments to the Habitats Regulations to 
ensure certain provisions of Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats 
Directive) and Directive 2009/147/EC (the Wild Birds Directive) 
are transposed clearly. 
3.17 
The relevance to this application is discussed in Section 5 of this 
report, and in the NRW written representation [REP-019].  The 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (the 
Habitats Regulations) are engaged because this case involves the: 
 
Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation (SAC); 
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC; and 
 
Cwm Cadlan SAC. 
which, as European sites, are subject to the protection required by 
the Habitats Directive.  
3.18 
In determining these applications, the SoS for Energy and Climate 
Change will be acting as competent authority for the purposes of 
regulations 61, 62 and 66 of the Habitats Regulations.  
THE WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE 
Background 
3.19 
The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) (Directive 2000/60/EC) 
established a framework for Community action in the field of water 
policy. Some amendments have been introduced into the Directive 
since 2000. The purpose of the WFD is to establish a framework 
for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters, 
coastal waters and groundwater.  
3.20 
The WFD requires Member States to identify ‘river basin districts’ – 
the area of land and sea made up of one or more neighbouring 
river basins with their associated coastal waters and groundwater. 
Member States must also identify a ‘competent authority’ to apply 
the WFD rules within those districts. 
3.21 
The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England 
and Wales) Regulations 2003 transposed the WFD into law in 
England and Wales (the WFD Regulations). The WFD Regulations 
separate the ‘competent authority’ functions into two. The 
‘appropriate authority’ has a number of strategic functions under 
the Regulations, including approval (or rejection) of ‘river basin 
management plans’ (RBMPs) prepared by the ‘appropriate agency’. 
3.22 
In Wales, Welsh Government (WG) is the ‘appropriate authority’, 
and NRW the ‘appropriate agency’ for the production of river basin 
management plans.  
3.23 
The river basin districts (RBD) in England and Wales are identified 
on a map deposited with the WFD Regulations. The WFD 
Regulations require that RBMPs were published by December 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
19
 
 
2009. They are (where appropriate) to be updated by 22 
December 2015 and thereafter by each sixth anniversary of that 
date. 
3.24 
The RBMPs must relate to a specified period, and include 
information specified in relevant provisions of the WFD. 
Environmental objectives for the district must be proposed, 
together with a programme of measures to achieve them. Detailed 
provision is made in the regulations for public participation on the 
content of the RBMPs. 
3.25 
The environmental objectives to be included in RBMPs are those 
required to comply with Article 4 of the WFD. Broadly the WFD 
requires that there be no deterioration in status and that good 
ecological and chemical status be achieved by 2015. However, for 
‘artificial and heavily modified bodies of water’, the objective is for 
them to reach good ecological potential and good chemical status 
by that date. These are bodies of water that are either created by 
human activity or whose character has been substantially changed 
by human activity. 
3.26 
Article 4.4 of the WFD sets out certain circumstances in which, 
exceptionally, the period for compliance may be extended to no 
later than 2027. 
Derogation 
3.27 
Member States will be in breach of the WFD if the relevant 
deadline is not met, unless the very limited circumstances set out 
in Article 4.7 apply (“derogation”). These are because the failure is 
either: 
 
“the result of new modifications to the physical characteristics 
of a surface water body or alterations to the level of bodies of 
groundwater”, or 
 
 
To prevent deterioration of a surface water body from high 
status to good status as a “result of new sustainable human 
development activities”, and 
  
3.28 
In either case all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the 
adverse impact on status and the reasons for the modifications or 
alterations are: 
 
Explained in the RBMP, and its objectives are reviewed every 
six years; and 
 
 
Of overriding public interest and/or  
 
 
The benefits to the environment and to society of achieving 
the environmental objectives of the WFD are outweighed by 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
20
 
 
the benefits to human health, to the maintenance of human 
safety or to sustainable development, and 
 
 
The beneficial objectives of the modifications or alterations 
cannot, due to technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, 
be achieved by other means which are a significantly better 
environmental option, and  
  
 
The modifications or alterations must not permanently 
exclude or compromise the achievement of the WFD 
objectives in other bodies of water in the same river basin 
district. 
 
3.29 
The WFD Regulations (Regulation 3) place a general duty on the 
Secretary of State, Welsh Government, EA and NRW to exercise 
their ‘relevant functions’ so as to secure compliance with the WFD. 
The Planning Act 2008 (PA2008) is not a ‘relevant function’ for this 
purpose. 
3.30 
However, they also have a specific duty to have regard to the 
relevant RBMP – and any supplementary plans made under it – in 
exercising their functions, which would include functions under the 
PA2008. The SoS will need to consider the implications of the 
project firstly in regard to his specific duty to have regard to the 
RMBP and secondly – in more general terms – in relation to the 
UK’s ability to comply with the WFD including (if applicable) the 
derogation provisions of Article 4.7. 
3.31 
The relevant RBMP in this case is the South East Valleys 
Management Catchment and is addressed in Section 4 of this 
report. 
 
OTHER LEGAL AND POLICY PROVISIONS 
Welsh Government Policies  
3.32 
There are several Welsh Government (WG) policy statements that 
are relevant to the application. These are:  
 
The Climate Change Strategy for Wales (October 2010) which 
seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3 % a year. 
The focus is principally on improving energy efficiency and 
the promotion of low-carbon generation9; 
 
A Low Carbon Revolution - Wales' Energy Policy Statement 
(March 2010) which states that new fossil fuel plant should

be carbon capture ready and should maximise energy 
efficiency through the use of waste heat and co-firing where 
appropriate10; 
 
The Wales Spatial Plan (2008) which sets out cross-cutting 
national spatial priorities. These provide the context for the 
application of national and regional policies for specific 
sectors, such as health, education, housing and the economy, 
reflecting the distinctive characteristics of different sub-
regions (areas) of Wales and their cross-border relationships.  
It identifies six sub-regions in Wales without defining hard 
boundaries, reflecting the different linkages involved in daily 
activities.  Hirwaun is in South East Wales - Capital Region11; 
 
Planning Policy Wales (PPW) (Seventh Edition, July 2014) 
which confirms that the planning system will play an 
important role in tackling climate change and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions12. Sustainability should be at the 
heart of the decision making process. The planning system 
should facilitate delivery of the targets in the earlier Wales' 
Energy Policy Statement. The planning system should 
optimise low- carbon energy generation and facilitate 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems. It recognises that 
in National Parks, special considerations apply to major 
development proposals but that exceptional circumstances 
may arise where there is demonstrated to be an overriding 
public need.  Major developments should not take place in 
National Parks or AONBs except in exceptional circumstances. 
This may arise where, after rigorous Examination, there is 
demonstrated to be an overriding public need and refusal 
would be severely detrimental to the local economy and there 
is no potential for locating the development elsewhere or 
meeting the need in some other way. Any construction and 
restoration must be carried out to high environmental 
standards; and  
 
Technical Advice Notes (TAN) 1213 and 2214.  TAN 12

 
TAN 23: Economic Development (2014). 
3.33 
Where relevant, the ExA has taken account of these policy 
documents mentioned in this section of the report.  
Government of Wales Act 2006 (GWA 2006), Devolved 
Matters 
3.34 
The GWA 2006 enables the Welsh Government (WG) to make 
legislation which then applies in Wales. The legislation must be 
within the legislative competence of the WG, i.e. relate to the 
devolved matters which are set out in Schedule 7 to the Act. 
These are set out as a series of broad headings, or ‘subjects’ 
which include: 
 
Environment: matters such as environmental protection, 
countryside, open spaces, nature conservation, habitats, 
coast and marine environment;  
 
 
Local government, including areas of local authorities which 
includes their boundaries of jurisdiction for matters such as 
development control and enforcement; and 
 
 
Town and Country Planning.  
 
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 
3.35 
The Act provides the framework for the establishment of National 
Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs). It also 
establishes powers for the appropriate nature conservation body 
to declare Nature Reserves, and for local authorities to establish 
Local Nature Reserves (LNRs). 
3.36 
The 1949 Act provided the framework for the establishment of 
National Parks. The Brecon Beacons was designated as a National 
Park in 1957.  
3.37 
National Parks have statutory protection. The purposes of 
designating a National Park are set out in Section 5 of the 1949 
Act:  
 
conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, wildlife and 
cultural heritage of the areas; and  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
23
 
 
 
promoting opportunities for the understanding and 
enjoyment of their special qualities by the public.  
3.38 
If it appears that there is a conflict between those purposes, 
greater weight is to be given to conserving and enhancing the 
natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Park.  
3.39 
In relation to the application Brecon Beacons National Park (BBNP) 
is discussed in paras. 3.42 -3.50 and Section 4 of this report. 
 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
3.40 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981(WCA) is the primary 
legislation which protects animals, plants, and certain habitats in 
the UK. The Act provides for the notification and confirmation of 
SSSIs. These sites are identified for their flora, fauna, geological 
or physiographical features by the countryside conservation bodies 
(in Wales this is Natural Resources Wales (NRW)). The Act also 
contains measures for the protection and management of SSSIs. 
3.41 
The Act is divided into four parts: Part l relating to the protection 
of wildlife, Part ll relating to designation of SSSIs and other 
designations, Part lll on public rights of way and Part lV on 
miscellaneous provisions. If a species protected under Part l is 
likely to be affected by development, a protected species license 
will be required from NRW. 
3.42 
This has relevance to consideration of impacts on SSSIs and on 
protected species and habitats. 
3.43 
In relation to the application it has relevance to consideration of 
impacts on Cors Bryn Y Gaer SSSI and on protected species and 
habitats, which will be assessed in Sections 4 and 5 of this report. 
3.44 
Section 28G of the WCA places legal obligations on public 
authorities in relation to SSSIs. These authorities are known as 
Section 28G authorities‘, and the definition given at s.28G(3) 
embraces all public office-holders including the SoS.  
3.45 
An authority to whom Section 28G applies has a duty in exercising 
its functions so far as their exercise is likely to affect the flora, 
fauna or geological or physiographical features by reason of which 
a SSSI is of special interest to:  
'...take reasonable steps, consistent with the proper exercise of 
the authority's functions, to further the conservation and 
enhancement of the flora, fauna or geological or physiographical 
features by reason of which the site is of special scientific interest.' 
3.46 
In addition, where the permission of a Section 28G authority is 
needed before proposed operations may be carried out, the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
24
 
 
Section 28G authority must, in accordance with Sections 28I(2) 
and 28I(5) of the WCA 1981, give notice of the proposal to NRW 
and take any advice received from NRW into account:  
 
in deciding whether or not to permit the proposed operations; 
and  
 
if it does decide to do so, in deciding what (if any) conditions 
are to be attached to the permission.  
3.47 
Permission is defined so as to include any kind of consent or 
authorisation15. As the Applicant requires development consent 
from the SoS in order to proceed with its proposals, and as the 
SoS is a Section 28G authority, the duties under Section 28I (5) 
apply to the SoS. In relation to the application these matters are 
considered in Sections 4 and 5 of this report. 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 
3.48 
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC) 
made provision for bodies concerned with the natural environment 
and rural communities, in connection with wildlife sites, SSSIs, 
National Parks and the Broads. It includes a duty that every public 
body must, in exercising its functions, have regard so far as is 
consistent with the proper exercising of those functions, to the 
purpose of biodiversity. In complying with this, regard must be 
given to the United Nations Environment Programme Convention 
on Biological Diversity of 1992. 
3.49 
This is of relevance to biodiversity, biological environment and 
ecology and landscape matters in the proposed development. 
3.50 
In relation to the application these matters are considered in 
Sections 4 and 5 of this report. 
Transboundary Effects 
3.51 
Under Regulation 24 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (EIA Regulations as 
amended ), and on the basis of the information available from the 
Applicant, the ExA is not of the view that the proposed 
development is likely to have significant effects on the 
environment in another European Economic Area (EEA) State [PD-
022]. 
3.52 
In reaching this view the ExA has applied the precautionary 
approach (as explained in the Planning Inspectorate Advice Note 
12 Transboundary Impacts Consultation). Transboundary issues 
consultation under Regulation 24 of the EIA Regulations was 
therefore not considered necessary.

3.53 
The ExA is satisfied that with regard to regulation 7 of the 
Infrastructure Planning (Decisions) Regulations 2010, all 
transboundary biodiversity matters have been addressed and 
there are no such matters outstanding that would argue against 
the Order being confirmed. 
 
Local Impact Report[s] 
3.54 
There is a requirement under s.60(2) of Planning Act 2008 to give 
notice in writing to each local authority falling under s.56A inviting 
them to submit Local Impact Reports (LIRs). This notice was given 
on 30 June 2014 [DEC-004]. 
3.55 
Two LIRs from BBNPA [REP-024] and RCT [REP-025] were 
submitted and are considered in Section 4.8 - 4.13 of this report.  
 
 
The Development Plans 
3.56 
Paragraph 4.1.5 of EN-1 states:  
'Other matters that the IPC may consider both important and 
relevant to its decision-making may include Development Plan 
Documents or other documents in the Local Development 
Framework. In the event of a conflict between these or any other 
documents and an NPS, the NPS prevails for purposes of IPC 
decision making given the national significance of the 
infrastructure. The energy NPSs have taken account of relevant 
Planning Policy Statements (PPSs) and older-style Planning Policy 
Guidance Notes (PPGs) in England and Technical Advice Notes 
(TANs) in Wales where appropriate.' 
Brecon Beacons National Park 
3.57 
The guidance set out in legislation and Planning Policy Wales 
(PPW) (para. 3.32 of this report) underpins the guidance set out in 
the Brecon Beacons National Park Management Plan 2010 – 2015 
and the Brecon Beacons National Park Local Development Plan 
(Approved December 2013) (the LDP). Whilst the ExA does not 
necessarily have to have regard to the LDP as would be the case 
under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), it is 
considered that these documents are important and relevant that 
warrant significant weight to be attached to their content.  
3.58 
The Brecon Beacons National Park Management Plan 2010 – 
201516 was published in July 2010 and is the single most 
important policy document of the National Park area. The plan

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State

coordinates and integrates other plans, strategies and actions in 
the National Park that affect the Park purposes and its duty.  
3.59 
The document sets out in paragraph 1.1 that: 
'no major decision should be taken affecting the future of the Park 
without reference to the Management Plan'.  
3.60 
Of particular importance, the Management Plan identifies the 
special qualities of the Brecon Beacons National Park, which are 
summarised as follows:  
 
Peace and tranquillity - opportunities for quiet enjoyment, 
inspiration, relaxation and spiritual renewal; 
 
Vitality and healthfulness - enjoying the Park’s fresh air, 
clean water, rural setting, open land and locally produced 
foods; 
 
Sense of place and cultural identity – “Welshness”; 
 
Sense of discovery; 
 
Sweeping grandeur and outstanding natural beauty; 
 
Contrasting patterns, colours, and textures; 
 
Diversity of wildlife and richness of semi-natural habitats; 
 
Rugged, remote and challenging landscapes; 
 
Enjoyable and accessible countryside;  and 
 
Intimate sense of community.  
3.61 
These special qualities comprise the very reason why the area is 
designated as a National Park and thus any impact on any of these 
special qualities either individually or collectively has the potential 
to negatively impact upon the whole purpose of designating the 
area as a National Park. In determining the DCO the ExA has given 
due consideration, as set out in Sections 61 and 62(2) of the 
Environment Act 1995, to the impact of the proposal on the 
special qualities of the National Park17.  
3.62 
The Brecon Beacons National Park Local Development Plan (LDP) 
was adopted in December 2013 and sets out the policy basis for 
all planning applications within the National Park.  
3.63 
In addition, the National Park was designated as an International 
Dark Sky Reserve in 2013 by the International Dark Sky 
Association (IDA)18. Its mission is: 
'…to preserve and protect the night-time environment and our 
heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting.'

3.64 
As a consequence BBNPA is encouraging all residents and 
developers both within and on the outskirts of the National Park to 
have due regard to their lighting implications. BBNPA has 
produced a Lighting Management Plan which sets out the 
considerations that need to be taken into account and gives 
guidance on the types of lighting that may be considered 
appropriate. Whilst this has not been formally adopted as 
Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG), BBNPA is currently 
working towards an Obtrusive Light SPG which was due to be 
published for consultation in autumn 2014.  The "Dark Sky Status" 
is discussed further in Section 4 of this report. 
3.65 
The ExA has had due regard to the impact of the proposal on the 
National Park irrespective of the fact that the development is not 
included within the Park itself.  
Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council 
3.66 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) Local Development Plan(LDP) up to 
2021 was adopted by the Council in March 201119 and sets out: 
'.....the framework for decisions to be made up until 2021 on how 
land is used in the County Borough, for example what type of 
development is appropriate or desirable and how best to protect 
our environment'. 
3.67 
The LDP provides part of the Development Plan against which 
applications under the Town & Country Planning Act regime are to 
be determined, and parts may be relevant and important under 
the Planning Act 2008 regime. 
3.68 
Section 4 of the LDP sets out the Core Strategy for RCT and 
outlines the spatial strategy for guiding all future development and 
land use in the Borough.  Section 5 sets out detailed area wide 
policies, and Section 6 outlines specific policies for the northern 
and southern areas of the Borough. 
3.69 
The area of Hirwaun Industrial Estate proposed for the 
development of the Power Generation Plant is designated in the 
Proposals Map as Policy CS 9 - Waste Management. 
3.70 
The Hirwaun Industrial Estate is identified as a regional site that is 
able to accommodate a range of waste management options to 
meet the capacity requirements set out in the South East Wales 
Regional Waste Plan. The LDP notes that: 
'...in identifying Hirwaun Industrial Estate as a suitable site for 
waste management, it is not the intention that the employment 
uses at the site should cease.'

3.71 
The LDP identifies that the DCO application site is: 
 
Outside the settlement boundary of the key settlement of 
Hirwaun, and 
 
Forms part of an area allocated under policy CS 9 for regional 
waste management facilities. 
3.72 
Policies of the LDP of relevance to the proposed scheme are: 
 
CS1 – Development in the North, this emphasises building 
strong sustainable communities, partly by re-use of 
underused land and buildings, and partly by encouraging a 
strong, diverse economy; 
 
CS9 – Waste Management Hirwaun Industrial Estate is 
identified as a regional site for waste management, capable 
of accommodating a range of waste management options (in-
building processes only) (see paragraph 4.228 of this report); 
 
AW2 – Sustainable Locations Promotes development in 
sustainable locations (see paragraph 4.56 of this report), 
which include: 
 
sites within settlement boundaries; 
 
sites where there would be no unacceptable conflict 
with surrounding uses; 
 
sites with good accessibility by a range of transport 
modes; 
 
sites where development would support the roles and 
functions of key settlements; 
 
sites where development would support the 
development of strategic sites; and 
 
sites well-related to infrastructure, including gas and 
electrical services. 
 
AW4 – Community Infrastructure & Planning Obligations. 
Provides for planning obligations to be sought where 
necessary to make proposals acceptable in land use planning 
terms (see paragraphs. 7.157 - 7.159 of this report). 
 
AW5 – New Development provides amenity and accessibility 
criteria for new development; 
 
AW6 – Design and Place making.  Promotes good design in 
new development (see paragraph 4.59 of this report), 
including: 
 
A high standard of design; 
 
Appropriate to the local context; 
 
Landscaping; 
 
High level of connectivity and accessibility; 
 
Energy efficiency; and 
 
Good water management. 
 
AW8 – Protection and Enhancement of the Natural 
Environment. Aims to preserve and enhance natural heritage, 
partly by ensuring no unacceptable impact on natural 
resources such as air, water and soil. Ecological surveys and 
appraisal are required where protected and priority special 
would be affected (see paragraph 4.224 of this report);

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS IN RELATION TO POLICY 
AND FACTUAL ISSUES 
MAIN ISSUES IN THE EXAMINATION 
Preliminary Identification of Principal Issues 
4.1 
In accordance with s.88 of the Planning Act 2008, the ExA made 
an initial assessment of the principal issues arising from the ExA's 
consideration of the application documents [APP-001 to APP-049] 
and relevant representations [RR-001 to RR-020] received 
concerning the Hirwaun Power Project. This was sent to all 
Interested Parties and Affected Persons on 30 June 2014 [DEC-
004] and was part of the agenda for the Preliminary Meeting (PM) 
held on 23 July 2014. The ExA has had regard to all important and 
relevant matters in putting forward this recommendation to the 
SoS.  
4.2 
The ExA received no requests during the PM for any additions to 
be made to the list of principal issues [HR-001]. 
4.3 
The ExA confirmed that the principal issues have broad headings, 
and that all the issues would be covered by the relevant heading 
in the principal issues [DEC-005]. The ExA confirmed that these 
issues would be examined in accordance with national policy and 
under the procedure established in the Planning Act 2008, as 
amended, and relevant secondary legislation. 
4.4 
The selection of these issues informed the ExA's first round of 
written questions [DEC-006] and decisions as to which topics 
might require Issue Specific Hearings. The principal issues 
identified by the ExA were as follows: 
 
Compulsory Acquisition; 
 
Design, Layout and Visibility; 
 
Development Consent Order; 
 
Economic and Social; 
 
Environmental Impact Assessment; 
 
Habitats, Ecology and Nature Conservation; 
 
Historic and Archaeological; 
 
Operational and 
 
Traffic and Transport. 
4.5 
The following Sections (4.6 onwards of this report) deal with the 
matters that have emerged as the key issues in the Examination, 
which are of relevance to the SoS’s final decision. 
Issues arising from written submissions 
4.6 
Twenty Relevant Representations were received in the pre-
examination period [RR-001 to RR-020]. The issues raised 
informed the initial identification of the principal issues [DEC-004]. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.7 
The ExA's findings and conclusions to all the issues raised in the 
written and oral submissions are summarised in the remainder of 
Section 4 and also in Section 5 of this report. 
Issues arising in Local Impact Reports (LIRs) 
4.8 
Two LIRs have been submitted: 
 
Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCT) [REP-
(i)
025]; and 
 
Brecon Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA) [REP-024]. 
(ii)
4.9 
The issues arising from the RCT LIR were as follows: 
 
Compliance with national and local planning policy; 
(i)
 
The visual and landscape impact of the project, especially 
(ii)
with regard to the setting of the Brecon Beacons National 
Park, and associated mitigation proposed; 
 Consideration of the above in relation to both the “Rochdale 
(iii)
envelope” and the likely design and scale of the final project; 
 The impact on protected species, biodiversity and habitats; 
(iv)
 The effect of the project with regard to traffic, noise, air & 
(v)
water quality and other environmental effects; 
 The impact of the development during the construction 
(vi)
phase; 
 Socio-economic impacts including any employment and 
(vii)
regeneration impacts and 
 An assessment of the content of the DCO and relevant 
(viii)
conditions (“requirements”) that could be applied in the DCO. 
4.10 
The Applicant was the only commentator [REP-040] on RCT's LIR 
[REP-025]. The Applicant and RCT reached agreement on issues 
raised in the LIR via agreed requirements in the draft DCO [PD-
018] and Statement of Common Ground (SoCG) [REP-031]. 
4.11 
It is considered that the BBNPA is a Relevant Authority in 
accordance with Section 56(2) and Section 60 (2) (a) of the 
Planning Act 2008 as the boundary of the National Park adjoins 
the administrative boundary of Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council within which the development is located.  
4.12 
The issues arising from the BBNPA LIR were as follows: 
 
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment; 
(i)
 
Cultural Heritage; 
(ii)
 Ecological; 
(iii)
 Traffic and Transport; 
(iv)
 Noise and Vibration and 
(v)
 Socio Economic. 
(vi)
4.13 
The Applicant was the only commentator [REP-039] on BBNPA's 
LIR [REP-024]. The Applicant and BBNPA reached agreement on 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
32
 
 
issues raised in the LIR via agreed requirements in the draft DCO 
[PD-018] and SoCG [REP-035]. 
 
Conformity with local plan policies 
4.14 
RCT's LIR [REP-025] states on pages 15 and 20 respectively: 
'The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan up to 2021 was 
adopted by the Council in March 2011 and sets out the framework 
for decisions to be made up until 2021 on how land is used in the 
County Borough, for example what type of development is 
appropriate or desirable and how best to protect our environment'. 
In terms of the scheme’s overall performance in respect of 
compliance with policies in the LDP it is considered that, subject to 
appropriate safeguards being included within the DCO, it would 
have a minor / positive impact.' 
4.15 
The ExA has had no reason to disagree with the above statement. 
 
Statements of Common Ground (SoCG) 
4.16 
SoCGs were agreed between the Applicant and: 
 
Brecon Beacons National Park Authority [REP-035]; 
 
Natural Resources Wales [REP-036] and 
 
Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council [REP-031]. 
 
Conformity with NPSs and other key policy statements 
4.17 
The project is a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
comprising a generating station as defined in Sections 14(1)(a) 
and 15 (2) (a) of the 2008 Act. 
4.18 
National Planning Statement (NPS) EN-1 paragraph 3.1 states: 
'The UK needs all the types of energy infrastructure covered by 
this NPS in order to achieve energy security at the same time as 
dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
It is for industry to propose new energy infrastructure projects 
within the strategic framework set by Government. The 
Government does not consider it appropriate for planning policy to 
set targets for or limits on different technologies. 
The IPC should therefore assess all applications for development 
consent for the types of infrastructure covered by the energy NPSs 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
33
 
 
on the basis that the Government has demonstrated that there is 
a need for those types of infrastructure and that the scale and 
urgency of that need is as described for each of them in this Part. 
The IPC should give substantial weight to the contribution which 
projects would make towards satisfying this need when 
considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008.' 
 
4.19 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 states: 
'Fossil fuel power stations play a vital role in providing reliable 
electricity supplies: they can be operated flexibly in response to 
changes in supply and demand, and provide diversity in our 
energy mix. They will continue to play an important role in our 
energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon 
economy, and Government policy is that they must be 
constructed, and operate, in line with increasingly demanding 
climate change goals.' 
 
4.20 
The Applicant states in paragraphs 1.1.3 to 1.1.6 of the ES [APP-
0019] that: 
'The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide 
an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts electrical (MWe). The 
plant would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied to the Power 
Generation Plant Site by a new gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Gas Transmission system 
(NTS). 
Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a surge in 
demand for electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. 
where many people across the country boil kettles following the 
end of a popular television programme) or where there is a 
sudden drop in power being generated from plants which are 
constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage). 
Operating as a peaking plant, the Power Generation Plant would 
also help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity 
demand and will help to support the grid at times when other 
technologies (e.g. wind and solar farms) cannot generate 
electricity due to their intermittent operation and reliance on 
weather conditions. Peaking plant are therefore vital in ‘evening 
out’ the power in the grid. The Power Generation Plant would 
operate for up to 1500 hours per year. 
There is a considerable national need for this type of project, 
acknowledged at all levels of government policy.'

4.21 
The question of need was not raised elsewhere by any party 
during the course of the examination.  
4.22 
The impacts of the project and general conformity with the NPS 
EN-1 and EN-2 are discussed in the Sections 4 and 5 of this 
report. 
4.23 
The financial viability of the scheme, taking into account 
paragraph 4.1.9 of EN-1 4.1, is considered in Section 6 of this 
report. 
ADEQUACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT (ES) 
/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA)  
4.24 
The adequacy of the EIA/ES [APP-019] and the NSER [APP-045] 
and their assessment of potential impacts were highlighted in the 
initial identification of principal issues [DEC-004].  
4.25 
BBNPA, NRW and RCT raised concerns regarding the adequacy of 
the EIA/ES in their respective Relevant Representations [RR-010, 
RR-017 and RR-08]. 
4.26 
During the course of the examination the adequacy of the 
information provided in the ES [APP-019], NSER [APP-045] and 
Report to Inform Habitats Regulations Assessment [HR-015] has 
been resolved to the satisfaction of BBNPA [REP-033], RCT [REP-
031] and NRW [REP-032]. 
4.27 
The Habitats Regulations Assessment information is considered 
separately in Section 5. 
4.28 
The Applicant provided information on the environment and its 
assessment of these issues consisting of the following: 
 
ES [APP-019]; 
 
Six supporting volumes of appendices [APP-020 to APP-025]; 
 
Figures [APP-026 to APP-028] and 
 
A standalone Non-Technical Summary [APP-029].   
4.29 
NPS EN-1 Paragraph 4.2.4 states:  
'The IPC should request further information where necessary to 
ensure compliance with the EIA Directive.' 
4.30 
The ExA investigated the adequacy of the information provided in 
the ES and the Report to Inform Habitats Regulations Assessment, 
in the first [DEC-005] , second [DEC-009] and third [DEC-011] 
round of written questions and in their questions to the Applicant 
at the EIA and other Environmental Matters issue specific hearing 
[HR-017].

4.31 
The Applicant's responses to the ExA written questions can be 
found at [first round of questions, REP-030; second, REP-045 and 
third REP-048]. 
Conclusion on Adequacy of Environmental Statement 
(ES)/Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
4.32 
It is the view of the ExA that the overall environmental 
information supplied, is sufficient for the SoS to take into 
consideration before making a decision in compliance with the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulation 3(2)20.  
 
CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES  
4.33 
The EIA Regulations21 require that an ES should include an outline 
of the main alternatives that have been studied by the Applicant 
and an indication of the main reasons for its choices, taking into 
account the likely significant environmental impacts of each 
alternative.  
4.34 
NPS EN-1 (Para. 4.4.1-4.4.2) states: 
'From a policy perspective this NPS does not contain any general 
requirement to consider alternatives or to establish whether the 
proposed project represents the best option. Furthermore, it is not 
necessary to consider alternative technologies for generating 
stations.  
However: 
Applicants are obliged to include in their ES, as a matter of fact, 
information about the main alternatives they have studied. This 
should include an indication of the main reasons for the Applicant’s 
choice, taking into account the environmental, social and economic 
effects and including, where relevant, technical and commercial 
feasibility.' 
4.35 
In the case of the Project, the alternatives that have been 
considered are detailed in Section 5 of the ES [APP-019]:  
 
Alternative development sites;   
                                       
 
20 3.- Prohibition on granting consent without consideration of environmental information  
3.—(1) This regulation applies to— 
(a) every application for an order granting development consent for EIA development received by the 
Commission; and  (b) every subsequent application for EIA development received by a relevant 
authority on or after 1st March 2010.  
(2) Where this regulation applies, the Secretary of State or relevant authority (as the case may be) 
must not (in the case of the Secretary of State) make an order granting development consent or (in 
the case of the relevant authority) grant subsequent consent unless it has first taken the 
environmental information into consideration, and it must state in its decision that it has done so.

 
Alternative layouts;    
 
Alternative technologies for electricity generation;  
 
Alternative options for Gas Connections; and  
 
Alternative options for Electrical Connections. 
4.36 
The ExA addressed the adequacy of the information provided on 
alternatives, in the first round of written questions [DEC-006] 
(Question to Applicant, EIA03) and in their questions to the 
Applicant at the EIA issue specific hearing [HR-017].  
4.37 
The Applicant's responses can be found at [REP-030 and HR-015]. 
The Applicant argued that siting options that have been considered 
for the Project are discussed in Section 5.2 of the ES [APP-019], 
which summarises the criteria for the siting of the generating 
station. These options were consulted on during the EIA Scoping 
process [PD-005]. 
Conclusion on the consideration of alternatives 
4.38 
The ExA considers that the Applicant has addressed the case in 
relation to: 
 
Alternative sites; 
 
Alternative layouts; 
 
Alternative technologies; and  
 
Alternative options for gas and electrical connections.  
4.39 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended), state at Schedule 4, Part 1 (18) 
that the ES [APP-019] needs to provide: 
'An outline of the main alternatives studied by the Applicant and 
an indication of the main reasons for the Applicant's choice, taking 
into account the environmental effects.' 
4.40 
Under the EIA Regulations22 there is no requirement to assess all 
potential alternatives, only a requirement to provide a review of 
those alternatives that have actually been considered. 
4.41 
The ExA consider that the examination of alternatives has been 
addressed adequately and that the requirements of NPS EN-1 and 
the EIA Regulations are met. 
MITIGATION MEASURES 
4.42 
A series of mitigation measures have been proposed within the ES 
Sections [APP-019], Construction Environmental Management Plan 
(CEMP) [APP-020] and the Environmental Mitigation Roadmap 
[APP-060]. They have been secured through the draft DCO 
requirements [PD-018].

4.43 
All works on-site will be undertaken in compliance with the final 
CEMP as secured by Requirement 12 which is contained in Part 3 
of Schedule 1 to the draft DCO [PD-018]. 
4.44 
Section 7 of this report, contains a description of key draft DCO 
Requirements, and explanation of modifications either agreed by 
the Applicant or proposed by the ExA together with the 
identification of who has responsibility for discharge of specific 
requirements. 
SITING AND LAYOUT, DESIGN AND VISIBILITY 
4.45 
The siting and layout, design and visibility and the assessment of 
potential impacts was highlighted in the initial identification of 
principal issues [DEC-004].  
4.46 
The Applicant has carried out a Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (LVIA) and reported it in the ES [APP-019] at Section 
11, as required by paragraph 5.9.5 of EN-1. Twenty two 
viewpoints for photomontages were agreed in concert with RCT 
and BBNPA [HR-017] [APP-005 to APP-008]. 
4.47 
Both BBNPA and RCT raised concerns regarding the adequacy of 
the LVIA in their respective Relevant Representations [RR-010 and 
RR-08] and LIRs [REP-024 and REP-025]. 
4.48 
During the course of the examination the adequacy of the 
information provided in Section 11 of the ES [APP-019] has been 
resolved in SoCGs to the satisfaction of BBNPA [REP-033] and RCT 
[REP-031]. 
4.49 
An unaccompanied (22 July 2014) and accompanied (22 
September 2014) site visit [HR-003 and HR-004] have been 
undertaken by the ExA. 
4.50 
The ExA asked nine written questions in its first round of written 
questions [DLV01- DLV09 of DEC-006] in relation to the design 
layout and visibility of the proposed development. The Applicants 
responses can be viewed at [REP-030]. 
 
Siting and Layout 
4.51 
NPS EN-1 notes, at paragraphs 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, that there is no 
general requirement to consider alternatives or to establish 
whether the proposed project represents the best option. 
However, Applicants are obliged to include in the ES, as a matter 
of fact, information about the main alternatives they have studied, 
including an indication of the main reasons for the Applicant's 
choice.  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project

4.52 
The Applicant notes in the ES [APP-019], at Section 5.2, that the 
site is suited to the Project for various reasons: 
 
Acceptable proximity to national gas and electricity 
transmission networks; 
 
Located within an area incentivised by NGC for new electricity 
generation; and 
 
Compatible land use designations.  
4.53 
EN-1 requires, at paragraph 4.5.4, that Applicants should be able 
to demonstrate how the design process was conducted and how 
the proposed design evolved.  Section 5 of the ES [APP-019] and 
the Design and Access Statement (DAS) [APP-049] which formed 
part of the application, carry out this function.  
4.54 
EN-1 notes, at paragraph 4.5.1, that applying good design to 
energy projects should produce sustainable infrastructure sensitive 
to place, efficient in the use of natural resources and energy used 
in their construction and operation, matched by an appearance 
that demonstrates good aesthetics.  It continues, at paragraph 
4.5.3, by noting that the Applicant should take into account both 
functionality (including fitness for purpose and sustainability) and 
aesthetics (including its contribution to the quality of the area in 
which it would be located) as far as possible. It also notes, at 
paragraph 5.9.22, that materials and designs of buildings should 
always be given careful consideration.  
4.55 
The layout within the application site is largely driven by the 
requirements of the process, site access, gas delivery and grid 
connections. The ExA recognises these constraints.  
Conclusion on Siting and Layout 
4.56 
Given the evidence presented, the ExA is satisfied that the 
application, as submitted, meets the policy requirements of EN-1 
with regard to siting, efficiency and sustainability.  The ExA is also 
satisfied that the application, as submitted, meets the policy 
requirements of the RCT LDP Policy AW2 – Sustainable Locations, 
which promotes development in sustainable locations.  
 
Good design 
4.57 
The Design and Access Statement (DAS) [APP-049] contains an 
explanation of the design concept and its development.  As EN-1 
advises, at paragraph 4.5.5, the design was the subject of a 
Design Commission for Wales (DCfW) review, dated 12 February 
2014 [Appendix 01 of APP-049]. DCfW's review states: 
'This scheme demonstrates best practice in minimising the impact 
of an infrastructure on the environment.

Appointing architects at an early stage in the project has potential 
to add value through design. 
The coloured cladding scheme needs further refinement to create 
the desired effect of blending with the landscape. 
Environmental aspects have been important drivers in the 
planning and design of this scheme. The siting and arrangement of 
the different elements of the power station have been well 
planned, and demonstrate that the site has been carefully 
analysed. The arrangement minimises impact on views into and 
through the site by removing the existing white shed and creating 
visual permeability between structures. It improves the current 
condition23. 
The power station function is consistent with the allocation of the 
site for industry in the Local Development Plan, and the 
development aims to optimise the impact on the surrounding 
environment. The site is located for good connection to the 
electrical and gas networks. 
The designers have proposed a ‘worst case scenario’ which 
considers the greatest impact the project will have; and they are 
also taking into account cumulative visual and noise impact of 
other developments in the vicinity. It is good that they have been 
open about the need for flexibility, and it gives confidence that 
there will not be any unexpected results if/when the scheme is 
realised.' 
4.58 
The ExA endorses these points. 
Conclusion on Design  
4.59 
The ExA is encouraged by the design approach to the Project. This 
has been secured as far as possible in the draft DCO Requirements 
4 and 5 (Detailed design and Landscaping) [PD-018] and by the 
limits set on opportunities for subsequent change in Requirement 
18 [PD-018]. The design approach accords with the aims of NPS 
EN-1 and RCT LDP Policy AW6 – Design and Placemaking, by 
promoting good design in new development. Given the evidence 
presented, the ExA is content that a satisfactory design is likely to 
emerge.  
Visibility  
Landscape Character 
4.60 
The Applicant has carried out a Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (LVIA) and reported it in the ES [APP-019] at Section 
11.  In the SoCG [REP-033], at Section 2.7, BBNPA states that the 
                                       
 
23 ExA emphasis 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project

assessment can be relied upon as a reasoned explanation of the 
potential impacts of the proposed development.  
4.61 
The ExA agrees with BBNPA that the LVIA parameters, including 
the extent of the study area of 10 kilometre (km) radius, are 
appropriate given the topography and landscape designations.  
4.62 
National and local landscape character assessments are described 
in the ES, from paragraph 11.6.26 -11.6.40. There is one national 
landscape designations within the study area, the Brecon Beacons 
National Park, which is located approximately 250m north of the 
Project Site at its nearest point and continues beyond the LVIA 
Study Area boundary. Table 11.8 of the ES [APP-019] describes it 
as follows: 
'The Park contains some of the most spectacular and distinctive 
upland landforms in southern Britain. The bulk of the area is 
underlain by Old Red Sandstone, rocks of Devonian age and these 
form the characteristic north and north east facing escarpments, 
including the Black Mountain in the western area. The older 
Ordovician and Silurian rocks of Mid Wales cross into the north 
western corner of the Park, giving a landscape of southwest-
northeast trending ridges and valleys. Coal Measures outcrop 
along the Park’s southern boundary. 
Two landscape character types within the National Park lie within 
the LVIA study area: 
 
Landscape Character Area 3(LCA3): FForest Fawr (LCA3) 
 
Broad Landscape Type :Uplands 
 
LCA prescribed value: High 
The overall management strategy for LCA3 is to protect and 
enhance special qualities of the landscape including tranquillity, 
remoteness and relative wildness, and its historic features, long 
views and open skylines. 
 
Landscape Character Area 4: Waterfall Country and Southern 
Valleys (LCA4) 
 
Broad Landscape Type: Upland Valleys 
 
LCA prescribed value: High 
The overall management strategy for LCA4 is to maintain and 
enhance the special qualities of the landscape, in particular its 
historic features and magnificent waterfalls, resisting development 
which would impact on views from the area.' 
4.63 
In terms of local designations, the ES [APP-019] notes that the 
Hirwaun Common Special Landscape Area lies approximately 1 km 
to the south of the site at its nearest point. In Table 11.8 of the ES 
it describes the Area as follows: 
'Primary landscape qualities and features include:

 
High scarp along northern edge of coalfield; 
 
Series of well-defined steep glacial cirques cut into scarp; 
 
Very dramatic scenery overlooking Heads of Valleys and 
dwarfing the small settlement of Cwmaman in the valley 
bottom to south; 
 
Spectacular views from the Rhigos Road to north and Graig 
Road over from Aberdare; 


National Park; 


stratigraphy; 
 
Llyn Fawr is typical glacial lake; 
 
Forestry on slopes below Llyn Fawr are being opened up and 
more in keeping with special scenery, and backdrop to Tower 
Colliery remains; 
 
Steep slopes and tops are mainly open common land, with 
grassland and heather habitats; 
 
Cairns and other ancient monuments on tops are widespread 
evidence of early settlement; 
 
Coed Morgannwg Way passes through area, from Dare 
Country Park; and 
 
Areas of broadleaf woodland on lower slopes around Dare 
valley, blends with Country Park. 
 
SLA prescribed value: High' 
4.64 
BBNPA in its LIR [REP-024] acknowledges that the scheme had 
progressed in a favourable direction in terms of the proposed 35m 
maximum height of the stacks and possible treatment of the 
external appearance to lessen its visual impact and that controls 
are being proposed via relevant requirements.  Despite this, at 
paragraph 5.21 of the LIR it states: 
' However, it remains the case that the proposal will introduce new 
vertical features that break the existing built height line thus 
interrupting views out of and into the National Park, it can only 
therefore be concluded that this will have a negative impact on the 
National Park.' 
4.65 
BBNPA in its SoCG [REP-035] subsequently agreed at paragraphs 
2.7.11-2.7.13: 
'…that due to the principal concern being the stacks, and the 
topography and existing vegetation in the vicinity of the site acting 
to screen lower structures, the landscaping scheme (Figure 11.5 
ES, Document Ref 6.1.0) secured by Requirement 5 focuses on 
ecological benefit and the amenity of users of the industrial estate 
and does not provide screening to the stacks. Accordingly the 
Parties AGREE that Requirement 5 should remain for the approval 
of the relevant planning authority, RCTCBC, whereas the 
mitigation in respect of the stacks is set in the Design Principles 
and is secured by Requirement 4, which shall be for the approval 
of the relevant planning authority in consultation with the BBNPA.  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

… that in respect of potential visible emissions (e.g. smoke or 
steam), no emissions of combustion-related products is expected 
other than those issuing from the stack.  
… that the residual landscape and visual impact associated 
with the Power Generation Plant is negative but of minor 
magnitude.24 ' 
4.66 
In the RCT SoCG [REP-031], at paragraph 3.6, RCT agrees that 
the assessment can be relied upon as a reasonable explanation of 
the potential impacts of the proposed development. It notes, at 
paragraphs 3.6.6 and 3.6.7, that it minimises to an acceptable 
level any landscape impacts arising from the proposal upon 
landscape character.   
4.67 
The ExA agrees with RCT and BBNPA that the LVIA parameters, 
including the extent of the study area of 10 kilometre (km) radius, 
are appropriate (paragraph 11.4.22 of [APP-019]).  
4.68 
Mitigation of the project's impact through proposed landscaping is 
largely confined to perimeter planting.  Control is available 
through Requirement 5 of the draft DCO which specifies approval 
of a detailed landscaping scheme [PD-018].  
Conclusion on Landscape Character  
4.69 
Given the evidence presented, the ExA believes that taking these 
effects as a whole, the effects on the fabric, character and quality 
of the landscape would be minor. Subject to control of the lighting 
strategies, both during construction and operation, by the relevant 
planning authority through DCO Requirement 16 [PD-018], the 
Project would assume its place without harm in this setting at 
night.  
4.70 
The site has being previously used as industrial land, and the ExA 
believes the loss of landscape resource would be negligible.  
Visual Impact 
4.71 
The Power Generation Plant Site, which is currently made up of 
large manufacturing buildings in a poor state, is predominantly 
located within an industrial environment. There are no sensitive 
visual receptors within adjoining commercial premises [HR-003]. 
The Project buildings would appear within the context of existing 
industrial development.  
4.72 
The closest residential properties to the Power Generation Plant 
Site are those in Halt Close, located off the Rhigos Road 
approximately 750m west of the plant site. The housing 
development includes a range of medium sized detached

dwellings. The A465 passes to the north of the Power Generation 
Plant Site on an elevated embankment dividing the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate.  Much of the site is screened from road users by 
vegetation alongside the highway and within the industrial estate. 
Views are partial and in many cases, only the occasional glimpse 
of the area is available [HR-004]. 
4.73 
Road users driving north along the A4061 towards Hirwaun have 
extensive views out across the Hirwaun Valley and beyond to 
Mynydd-y- glog in the mid distance (other side of the valley) and 
then beyond to the Brecon Beacons. Those using the A4059 will 
have much more restricted views of the Project Site due to 
vegetation and the natural topography screening.  Local B Roads 
and trackways will have a variety of views of the Project Site. 
Many of the views from these roads are curtailed by local 
vegetation or buildings. 
4.74 
Important visual amenity considerations include public footpaths in 
the area and any Open Access Land (such as Hirwaun Common 
and Mynydd-y-glog). 
4.75 
In the RCT SoCG [REP-031], at paragraph 3.6, RCT agrees that 
the assessment can be relied upon as a reasonable explanation of 
the potential impacts of the proposed development. It notes, at 
paragraphs 3.6.6 and 3.6.7, that it minimises to an acceptable 
level any impacts arising from the proposal upon visual receptors. 
4.76 
BBNPA in its SoCG [REP-035] agrees at paragraph 2.7.10: 
'…that the scheme has evolved in a manner that seeks to reduce 
its landscape and visual impact by virtue of the proposed stack 
heights being a maximum of 35m rather than the 90m stack 
option as in early phases of public consultation, and confirmation 
that the Electrical Connection comprises an underground cable 
rather than the use of overhead lines. Therefore, given the site’s 
location within an existing industrial area, the principal concern is 
the visual impact of the proposed stack(s).' 
4.77 
BBNPA in its SoCG [REP-035] notes, at paragraphs 2.7.13 to 
2.7.16, that impacts arising from the proposal upon visual 
amenity: 
'….Will be negative but of minor magnitude'. 
Conclusion on Visual Impact  
4.78 
Overall, the Project would have a minor visual impact seen from 
close to the site. However, the effect would be within an existing 
and developing industrialised setting. In the ExA's view harm 
would be avoided appropriate mitigation proposals. 
4.79 
Control of these aspects would be the responsibility of RCT and 
BBNPA through the draft DCO [PD-018]:

Landscape and Visual Conclusions 
4.80 
Following the ExA’s amendment of Requirements 4 and 5 
(Appendix D) related to the control of design and appropriate 
mitigation, and given the evidence presented, the Project 
generally accords with policy in EN-1, and with the RCT LDP with 
respect to design (Policy AW6 – Design and Placemaking), layout 
and visibility. 
 
Combined Heat and Power  
4.81 
Paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1 states: 
'Under guidelines issued by DECC (then DTI) in 200625, any 
application to develop a thermal generating station under Section 
36 of the Electricity Act 1989 must either include CHP or contain 
evidence that the possibilities for CHP have been fully explored to 
inform the IPC’s consideration of the application. This should be 
through an audit trail of dialogue between the Applicant and 
prospective customers. The same principle applies to any thermal 
power station which is the subject of an application for 
development consent under the Planning Act 2008. The IPC should 
have regard to DECC’s guidance, or any successor to it, when 
considering the CHP aspects of applications for thermal generating 
stations.' 
4.82 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) opportunities and their 
assessment are described in the ES [APP-019] in Paragraphs 
5.3.21- 5.3.28 and in a separate CHP Assessment [APP-020] that 
accompanied the application. It was concluded that at this time, 
there were no identified feasible CHP opportunities. 
4.83 
Based on the information provided in the CHP Assessment [APP-
020], the Applicant concluded at paragraph 7.1.1 that there are 
three prohibitive barriers to the application of CHP at the site: 
 
'There is no existing regional heat market. From local 
(i)
searches, there are no suitable heat users of applicable scale 
to the unpredictable heat available.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
45
 
 
 
No potential future heat requirements in the area have been 
(ii)
identified and none that would match the operational pattern 
of a Peaking power station are anticipated. 
 The intermittent and peaking modes of operation of SCGT are 
(iii)
incompatible with the likely continuous demands of heat 
users.' 
4.84 
The ExA agrees that because of the lack of applicable heat 
demands, provisions in the Applicants scheme for exploiting any 
potential heat demand in the future can be excluded. 
Conclusion on Combined Heat and Power  
4.85 
The ExA believes the Applicants Design Note on CHP [APP-020] 
demonstrates that Hirwaun Power Project does not need to 
undertake further investigation of CHP for the proposed thermal 
generating station, and provides the necessary evidence as to why 
the proposed thermal generating station should be excluded from 
being CHP- Ready. 
4.86 
The ExA considers that CHP issues have been addressed 
adequately by the Applicant and meet the requirements of NPS 
EN-1.  
 
Operational mechanisms to not exceed 299MWe and Carbon 
Capture Readiness (CCR)  
4.87 
NPS EN-1 paragraphs 4.7.5 states: 
'All commercial scale fossil fuelled generating stations have to be 
carbon capture ready (see CCR Section below). …Operators of 
fossil fuel generating stations will also be required to comply with 
any Emission Performance Standards (EPS) that might be 
applicable, but this is not part of the consents process.' 
4.88 
In the CCR section of NPS EN-1 paragraph 4.7.10 states: 
'To ensure that no foreseeable barriers exist to retrofitting carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) equipment on combustion generating 
stations, all applications for new combustion plant which are of 
generating capacity at or over 300MW87 and of a type covered by 
the EU’s Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) 88 should 
demonstrate that the plant is “Carbon Capture Ready” (CCR) 
before consent may be given. The IPC must not grant consent 
unless this is the case. In order to assure the IPC that a proposed 
development is CCR, Applicants will need to demonstrate that their 
proposal complies with guidance issued by the Secretary of State 
in November 200989 or any successor to it…...'  
4.89 
It is noted that the Carbon Capture Readiness (Electricity 
Generating Stations) Regulations 2013 (the "CCR Regulations") 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
46
 
 
provide that the SoS must not make a DCO for the construction of 
a combustion plant26 with a “rated electrical output” of 300 
megawatts or more unless he has determined whether the "CCR 
conditions" are met in relation to that combustion plant. 
Determining whether the CCR conditions are met requires an 
assessment prescribed in regulation 2(2) of the CCR Regulations: 
'For the purposes of these Regulations, the CCR conditions are met 
in relation to a combustion plant, if, in respect of all of its 
expected emissions of CO2— 
(a) suitable storage sites are available; 
(b) it is technically and economically feasible to retrofit the plant 
with the equipment necessary to capture that CO2; and 
(c) it is technically and economically feasible to transport such 
captured CO2 to the storage sites referred to in sub-paragraph 
(a).' 
4.90 
The Power Generation Plant would be designed as a simple cycle 
gas turbine (SCGT) to provide a total output of up to 299 MWe at 
rated site conditions, and would be fired on natural gas. 
4.91 
The applicant has not done a CCR assessment that would have 
been required if the plant had a rated electrical output of 300MW 
or above. The SoS would then be precluded from making the DCO 
if it appeared that the rated electrical output exceeded 300 MWe.  
The operational mechanisms, to not exceed 300MWe, were 
therefore highlighted in the initial identification of principal issues 
[DEC-004]. 
4.92 
The Applicant in their response [REP-030] to the ExA first round 
question OM01 [DEC-006] states: 
'The Applicant proposes to procure a generating station with a 
rated electrical output of no more than 299MW according to BS 
ISO 2314:2009. At times when the actual site conditions are 
better’ than the reference conditions in BS ISO 2314:2009, 
a plant with a “rated electrical output” of 299MWe could 
have an “actual” output of more than 299MWe27, however, 
the “rated” output will always remain 299MWe so Schedule 1 of 
the DCO will always be complied with.' 
4.93 
The Applicant goes on to argue in response to OM01 [REP-
030]that: 
'The Applicant considers that the term “rated electrical output” in 
the CCR Regulations (which is undefined) must mean the electrical

output rated by using the UK industry standard approach (i.e. BS 
ISO 2314:2009). The terminology in the draft DCO matches that 
in the CCR Regulations to avoid any doubt that the DCO does not 
engage the provisions of the CCR Regulations requiring such 
assessments. 
It would be technically possible to place an artificial limit on the 
plant so that the “actual” output (as opposed to the “rated” 
output) could never exceed 299MWe, however, it is not considered 
this is necessary to comply with the draft DCO, nor the CCR 
Regulations. To do so would be to stifle the efficiency of the plant 
in favourable conditions (which also tend to be when it cold and 
the need for power is greatest).  No such artificial limit is currently 
proposed in the draft DCO. 
It is also noted that the output can be measured at different points 
within a generating station. British Standard BS ISO 2314 sets out 
definitions for electrical power measurement and provides for the 
calculation of both “gross electrical power” (the gross output of the 
gas turbine generators measured at the generator terminals) and 
“net electrical power” (the net output of the generating station 
taking account of step-up transformer losses measured at the 
point of connection to the National Electricity Transmission System 
(which is also the point of sale)). The Applicant considers that the 
reference to the rated electrical output of a "combustion plant" in 
the CCR Regulations means the rated electrical output of the 
generating station as a whole (i.e. the "net electrical power") and 
not the gross output of just the gas turbine generators 
themselves. This is reflected in revision 1 of the draft DCO.' 
4.94 
In the summary of the Applicants oral representations at the DCO 
issue specific hearing on the 23 September 2014 [HR-009] the 
Applicant volunteered in response to Agenda Item 6.4 a: 
 
Position Paper: mechanism to ensure that plant output of 
299MWe will not be exceeded [HR-009]. 
4.95 
In the Applicants summary of the Position Paper they state:  
'For these reasons, the Applicant considers that revision 2.0 of the 
draft DCO which is drafted to impose a limit of 299MWe based on 
the net "rated electrical output" of the generating station as a 
whole is appropriate. This will require the Applicant to procure gas 
turbine generators with a net electrical output, rated using ISO 
2314, of less than 299MWe and so secure compliance with the 
CCR Regulations.' 
4.96 
The ExA remained to be persuaded that the use of the term 
“declared net capacity28” or “rated electrical output” in Schedule 1 
                                       
 
28 The “declared net capacity”, in relation to a generating station, means the maximum capacity at 
which the station could be operated for a sustained period without causing damage to it (assuming

Revision 3.0 of the draft DCO [PD-010] would be sufficient to 
ensure that the SoS was not precluded from making a DCO by 
Regulation 3(1) of the CCR Regulations.  To this end the ExA 
asked a question (OM2 01) in its second round questions [DEC-
009] on this issue.  The Applicant responded [REP-045]  in their 
summary of their answer as follows: 
'However, regardless of the foregoing, the Applicant considers that 
whatever the precise definition of "rated electrical output", by 
using this exact language in the DCO, the Secretary of State will 
guarantee that the DCO will not be granted in breach of the CCR 
Regulations. Even if the ExA were not persuaded by the 
Applicant's position on the definition of "rated electrical output" 
the use of term itself is still the appropriate form of words in the 
DCO to ensure any breach of the CCR Regulations is avoided.'  
4.97 
The Applicant provided a definition of rated electrical output in 
response to an ExA third round of questions ([DEC-011] question 
DCO3-04). 
4.98 
The Applicant's starting point was that the phrase "rated electrical 
output" should not be defined.  The Applicant argued that if one 
looked at paragraph 4.7.5 of NPS EN-1 the references are made to 
300MW net. The CCS requirement referred to in the NPS in this 
context has the same EU Directive as its root. On that basis the 
Applicant considered that if a definition is to be inserted into the 
draft DCO, one should be inserted that referred to net output and 
not gross. 
4.99 
The ExA believes that the use of the term "gross" rather than 
"net" in the definition of rated electrical output would more 
accurately reflect the actual electrical output from the plant. 
4.100 The Applicant suggested the following definitions for consideration 
by the Examining Authority[REP-048]: 
'net rated electrical output" means the net electrical power as 
calculated by subtracting the energy used to operate the plant 
from the gross electrical power, and determined in accordance 
with standards agreed with the regulating authority under the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
(as amended) or subsequent legislation.' 
'gross rated electrical output" means the gross electrical power 
as measured at the generator terminals in accordance with 
standards agreed with the regulating authority under the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
(as amended) or subsequent legislation.' 
                                                                                                              
 
the source of power used by it to generate electricity was available to it without interruption) less the 
amount of electricity that is consumed by the plant; The Renewable Order 2009 (SO 2009/785)

4.101 The Applicant noted that Article 5 of the draft DCO would only 
allow the Applicant to carry out (Article 3) the "authorised 
development" (defined in Schedule 1).  Given that Schedule 1 
makes it clear that the ‘authorised development’ is a generating 
station with a rated electrical output of between 50.1 – 299MWe, 
the Applicant would be in breach of Article 5(1) if the generating 
station it constructed had a rated electrical output that exceeded 
299MW.  Accordingly, the capacity of the generating station is 
controlled by the description of the development that may be 
carried out (i.e. constructed) and there is no need to have a 
restriction controlling its ‘use’ to no more than 299MW. 
4.102 The ExA accepts that it is not necessary to have a cap on the rated 
electrical output as this would hinder the achievement of 
maximum efficiency in the operation of the generating station. 
4.103 An application for an Environmental Permit (EP) has yet to be 
submitted to NRW. An EP will need to be issued by NRW prior to 
first operation of the plant. In the NRW SoCG[REP-036] it states:  
'Both Parties AGREE that upon the information currently available, 
it appears that it would be possible in principle to grant consent 
for the Project. However NRW is unable to provide any binding 
commitments at this stage as to the subsequent determination of 
the application and it should be noted that consent may be 
granted or refused.' 
Conclusion on Operational mechanisms to not exceed 
299MWe and Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR)  
4.104 The ExA concludes that there is no evidence presented to indicate 
that the granting of any necessary licence under other regulatory 
regimes will be withheld, and that therefore based on NPS EN-1 
paragraph 4.10.8, the SoS as decision-maker should have no 
reason to withhold development consent on these grounds. 
4.105 In the ExA's recommended draft DCO (Appendix D), the ExA has 
inserted the definition in Article 2 of: 
' …"gross rated electrical output" means the aggregate of the 
gross electric power as measured at the terminals of each 
generator comprised in the generating station, ascertained in 
accordance with standards agreed with the regulating authority 
under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) or subsequent legislation.' 
and also inserted into Schedule 1 Authorised Development the 
word "gross" before "rated electrical output". The ExA believes 
that this would clarify intentions and powers and the 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D).

4.106 The ExA would not recommend a cap on the rated electrical output 
as this would hinder the achievement of maximum efficiency in the 
operation of the generating station. 
 
GRID CONNECTION 
4.107 NPS - EN-1 states at paragraph 4.9.1: 
'The connection of a proposed electricity generation plant to the 
electricity network is an important consideration for Applicant's 
wanting to construct or extend generation plant. In the market 
system, it is for the Applicant to ensure that there will be 
necessary infrastructure and capacity within an existing or planned 
transmission or distribution network to accommodate the 
electricity generated. The Applicant will liaise with National Grid 
who own and manage the transmission network in England and 
Wales or the relevant regional Distribution Network Operator 
(DNO) to secure a grid connection. It may be the case that the 
Applicant has not received or accepted a formal offer of a grid 
connection from the relevant network operator at the time of the 
application, although it is likely to have applied for one and 
discussed it with them. This is a commercial risk the Applicant may 
wish to take for a variety of reasons, although the IPC will want to 
be satisfied that there is no obvious reason why a grid connection 
would not be possible.' 
4.108 The grid connection element of the Project comprises of an 
underground electrical cable connection (referred to as the ‘Grid 
Connection’) to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant 
into the National Electricity Transmission System (NETS) operated 
by  National Grid at Rhigos Substation. As stated in paragraph 
5.1.19 of the Statement of Reasons, [APP-051], the Grid 
Connection is approximately 686m in length. The Grid Connection 
is identified in numbered work 5 in Schedule 1 to the draft DCO 
[PD-012].  It consists of a 400kV underground cable. The cable 
would run from the Power Generation Plant, alongside Main 
Avenue, to the south of a disused industrial warehouse, before 
heading north, alongside Fourteenth Avenue in between disused 
industrial warehouse buildings and extending into the site of the 
Rhigos Substation. 
4.109 Indicative Site Layout Plans shows the Grid Connection route 
corridor, the location of the Rhigos Substation, an indicative 
location for the Link Works and the location of the existing 400kV 
overhead line [APP-012]. 
4.110 The Applicant has provided a Grid Connection Statement [APP-
056], which has been prepared to comply with Regulation 
6(1)(a)(i) of the Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures 
(APFP) Regulations 2009,  which requires the Applicant to provide 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
51
 
 
a statement of who will be responsible for designing and building 
the connection to the electricity grid. 
4.111 National Grid will be responsible for the detailed design and 
construction of the National Grid Works and the Applicant will be 
responsible for design and construction of the Electrical Connection 
and the Link Works. This has been agreed in the terms of the 
Transmission Entry Capacity (TEC) agreement dated 4 July 2014 
[Section 3 of APP-056].  
4.112 Under section 115(1) of the Planning Act 2008, development 
consent may be granted for development which is: 
(a) 
'development for which development consent is required, or 
(b) 
associated development.' 
4.113 Whereas in England there are no statutory limitations on the types 
of development that could be "associated development", in Wales 
the categories for associated development are very narrow and 
none apply in the current circumstances (subsections 115(2) and 
115(4) of the Planning Act 2008). 
4.114 The Grid Connection is an essential part of the Power Generation 
Plant, as without the ability to export electricity to the National 
Grid there is no purpose in the Power Generation Plant generating 
electricity, and indeed it would not generate electricity without the 
Grid Connection (see paras. 7.88 to 7.92 of this report).  
4.115 The ExA believes that Grid Connection is considered to form an 
integral part of the NSIP development applied for. 
4.116 The ExA considers that Grid Connection issues have been 
addressed adequately by the Applicant and meet the requirements 
of NPS EN-1 and EN-5.  
 
GAS CONNECTION 
4.117 The Gas Connection is below the relevant size threshold to be 
categorised as a NSIP of itself. In line with recent determinations 
of NSIPs, it is considered that policies within NPS EN-4 are still 
likely to be important and relevant in the determination of the 
application. 
4.118 A new gas pipeline would be required to connect the Power 
Generation Plant to the National Transmission System (NTS) in 
order to provide a reliable supply of fuel.  The UK National Grid 
Gas system is split into two parts, the NTS and the LTS (Local 
Transmission System).  The NTS represents the infrastructure 
designed to transmit gas large distances around the country, these 
are generally large diameter pipelines (> 24”/600mm) operating 
at high pressure (~70barg).  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
52
 
 
4.119 Previous feasibility studies, carried out by the Applicant, 
discovered that feeder 2 on the NTS is the most appropriate 
connection option [APP-039]. No suitable connection points on the 
LTS were identified [APP-019]. 
4.120 The Gas Connection route corridor is approximately 0.9 km in 
length including one major road crossing, two minor road 
crossings, no major water crossings, four minor water crossings 
(e.g. field drains) and 0.19 km of in-road mainlaying [HR-004]. 
4.121 The pipeline begins at the Power Generation Plant Site heading 
south, past industrial buildings in the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, 
across Main Avenue and then under Rhigos Road; a single 
carriageway that runs along the entire south side of Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate. The route continues south of Rhigos Road into 
fields where it crosses under a set of overhead lines and continues 
heading south east where it then crosses two field drains. The 
route then turns east where it crosses under an unnamed minor 
road and another two field drains. It then turns south east again, 
and heads towards the A4061. The route runs alongside the A4061 
for approximately 0.2km before crossing under the A4061 in an 
easterly direction. The route reaches the NTS east of the A4061 at 
Grid Ref SN938055 [APP-019]. 
4.122 The actual diameter of the gas pipeline would be approximately 10 
inches/254mm.  The permanent right required for the Gas 
Connection would be approximately 10m in width, whereas the 
construction footprint required would be of the order of 30m in 
width on agricultural land but wider at crossing points. The 
location of the Gas Connection route corridor, Feeder 2 and the 
connection point / AGI are shown in Figure 4.2 of the ES [APP-
026]. 
4.123 The gas pipeline would be designed, constructed and tested to 
comply with the Institute of Gas Engineers’ (IGE) 
recommendations on Transmission and Distribution Practice – 
IGE/TD/1: Edition 5, 2009 - Steel Pipelines and Associated 
Installations for High Pressure Gas Transmission (IGE/TD/1) [HR-
017]. 
4.124 Connection to the NTS at any high pressure pipeline location will 
require two adjacent above ground facilities to be installed: 
 
a Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC), which would be 
designed, constructed, owned and operated by National Grid 
Gas, and 
 
a Pig Trap Facility (PTF) which would be designed, 
constructed, owned and operated by the Applicant (these two 
facilities together constitute the AGI).  
4.125 The Applicant has provided a Gas Connection Statement [APP-
039], which has been prepared to comply with Regulation 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
53
 
 
6(1)(a)(ii) of the APFP Regulations 2009, which requires the 
Applicant to provide a statement of who will be responsible for 
designing and building the  gas connection. 
4.126 The Applicant will be responsible for: 
 
Detailed design, construction and operation of the gas 
pipeline; and 
 
Detailed design, construction and operation of the PTF;  
4.127 National Grid Gas (NGG) will be responsible for the 
 
Detailed design, construction and operation of the MOC 
facility.  
4.128 Under section 115(1) of the Planning Act 2008, development 
consent may be granted for development which is: 
(a) 
'development for which development consent is required, or 
(b) 
associated development.' 
4.129 Whereas in England there are no statutory limitations on the types 
of development that could be "associated development", in Wales 
the categories are very narrow and none apply in the current 
circumstances (subsections 115(2) and 115(4) of the Planning Act 
2008). 
4.130 The Gas Connection is essential to bring fuel to the Power 
Generation Plant so that the Power Generation Plant can physically 
generate electricity.  
4.131 The ExA believes that Gas Connection is considered to form an 
integral part of the NSIP applied for (see paras. 7.88 to 7.92 of 
this report). 
4.132 The ExA considers that Gas Connection issues have been 
addressed adequately by the Applicant and meet the requirements 
of NPS EN-1 and EN-4.  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
Air quality and emissions 
4.133 NPS EN-2 states in paragraph 2.5.6: 
'In considering whether to grant consent, the IPC should take 
account of likely environmental impacts resulting from air 
emissions and that in the case of SOx, NOx or particulates in 
particular, it follows the advice in EN-1 on interaction with the EA’s 
regulatory processes.' 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
54
 
 
4.134 In the case of the Project, air quality and emissions that have 
been considered are detailed in Section 6 of the ES [APP-019]. The 
AQS Regulations 2010 specify a series of standards and objectives 
for air quality in the UK. The objectives are summarised in Table 
6.1 [APP-019] and consider pollutants that are the principal 
products of industrial combustion processes. These are the basis 
for the assessment of emissions for the operation phase.  
4.135 The assessment of potential air quality impacts was highlighted in 
the identification of principal issues [DEC-004]. 
4.136 Hirwaun and Penderyn Community Council (HPCC) raised specific 
concerns [REP-015 and HR-017] regarding the use of: 
 
Sennybridge (approximately 20km from the project site) air 
(i)
quality baseline information used in the assessment and 
 
Projects included in the EIA cumulative assessment. 
(ii)
4.137 The ExA addressed the adequacy of the information and the 
assessment provided in the ES [APP-019] in the first round of 
written questions (questions EIA10 and EIA11; OE06, OE07, OE08 
and OE09) [DEC-006] and in their questions to the Applicant at 
the EIA issue specific hearing on the 24 September 2014 [HR-
017].  
4.138 The Applicant's responses can be found at [REP-030 and HR-015].  
The Applicant specifically responded to HPCC concerns via: 
 
Dr Bethan Tuckett-Jones (Applicant's air quality expert 
witness) responded directly to HPCC at the EIA hearing on 
baseline data [HR-015] and 
 
A bespoke note on: 
'List of Projects Considered in the Cumulative Assessment within 
the EIA. Explain Why Any Were Scoped Out [HR-015]'. 
4.139 HPCC did not provide any comment on the Applicants responses 
during the examination. 
4.140 RCTs LIR [REP-025] concluded on page 33 that: 
'In respect of human health, the application has been assessed by 
the Council’s Public Health and Protection Section and no 
objections have been raised. The Applicant also submitted a 
“Health Impact Assessment” which has been consulted upon (by 
the Applicant). It is understood that Public Health England have 
responded (while this may seem strange, Committee is reminded 
that this is a UK national proposal rather than a Welsh national 
proposal) has concluded that there is no harm to human life as a 
result of the scheme.' 
4.141 The Applicant's assessment [APP-019] shows that overall, the 
project will have a negligible likely impact on air quality in relation 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
55
 
 
to human receptors29 during construction, operation and 
decommissioning. This applies both for the Project alone and 
cumulatively with other proposed facilities in the vicinity of the 
Project site. 
4.142 NRW have stated that [REP-019]: 
'Based on the information currently available, it appears that it 
would be possible in principle to grant a permit for the Project. 
However NRW is unable to provide any binding commitments at 
this stage as to the subsequent determination of the application 
and it should be noted that a permit may be granted or refused.' 
4.143 NRW have not raised any concerns with the Applicant's 
assessment of the impacts of air emissions as being negligible.  In 
paragraph 2.4.13 of the NRW SoCG [REP-036] it states: 
'Both Parties AGREE that the process contribution identified in the 
Assessments is not categorised as significant and it is unlikely that 
an emission at this level would make a significant contribution to 
air quality (according to EA H1 Annex F Guidance). ' 
 
Conclusion on Air Quality and Emissions  
4.144 NRW has not disagreed with the Applicant's assessment of the 
impact of air emissions as being insignificant. The ExA considers 
that the examination of air quality and emissions has been 
addressed adequately (including the baseline and cumulative 
issues raised by HPCC) and that the requirements of NPS EN-1 
and EN-2 are met together with the objectives of AQS Regulations 
2010. 
4.145 The ExA concludes that there is no evidence presented, that the 
granting of any necessary licence under other regulatory regimes 
will be withheld as a result of the effects of the project on air 
quality, and that therefore based on NPS EN-1 paragraph 4.10.8, 
the SoS as decision-maker should have no reason to withhold 
development consent on these grounds. 
 
Biodiversity and geological conservation 
4.146 Issues relating to Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) (NPS 
EN-1 Para. 4.3) are covered in Section 5, Conclusions Relating to 
Habitats Assessment, of this report. 
4.147 NPS EN-1 5.3.7 and 5.3.8 state: 
                                       
 
29 Impacts to ecological receptors are dealt with in paragraphs  4.146 to 4.171 and Section 5 of this 
report 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

'As a general principle, and subject to the specific policies below, 
development should aim to avoid significant harm to biodiversity 
and geological conservation interests, including through mitigation 
and consideration of reasonable alternatives (as set out in Section 
4.4 above); where significant harm cannot be avoided, then 
appropriate compensation measures should be sought. 
In taking decisions, the IPC should ensure that appropriate weight 
is attached to designated sites of international, national and local 
importance; protected species; habitats and other species of 
principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity; and to 
biodiversity and geological interests within the wider environment.' 
4.148 No geological conservation interests were identified in the course 
of the examination. 
4.149 The Applicant provided information on the baseline ecology and 
biodiversity and its assessment of these issues in Section 8 of the 
ES [APP-019] and in Volumes A and B of the ES appendices 8.1 -
8.3 [APP-020 and APP-021].         
4.150 The assessment of potential ecological and biodiversity impacts 
was highlighted in the identification of principal issues [DEC-004].  
4.151 The ExA investigated the adequacy of the information and the 
assessment provided in the ES in the first [DEC-006] and second 
[DEC-009] round of written questions and in its questions to the 
Applicant at the EIA issue specific hearing [HR-014] [HR-017].  
The Applicant's responses can be found at [REP-030; REP-045]. 
4.152 NRW raised points on ecology and biodiversity in their relevant 
representations [RR-017] and in their written representation with 
regards to Cors Bryn Y Gaer SSSI [REP-019].  
4.153 BBNPA at paragraph 5.26 of their LIR [REP-024] state: 
'The principal ecological impacts relate to the deposition of 
emissions emanating from the proposed stacks on ecological 
receptors within the National Park, especially having regard to the 
prevailing south westerly winds and the site’s juxtaposition with 
the National Park.' 
4.154 The Applicant's air quality assessment has predicted a process 
contribution of 0.056kgN/ha/yr to Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI, which is 
equivalent to 1.1% of critical load for the designated feature of 
lowland raised bog, for a 30m stack.  NRW considered this 
contribution from the Project would be considered to be 
insignificant and NRW would not advise that mitigation was 
required for this as part of the DCO application [REP-019]. 
4.155 NRW concerns regarding the European designated habitats issues 
are dealt with in Section 5 of this report.

4.156 RCT addressed ecology and biodiversity issues in their LIR [REP-
025].  RCT raised concerns with regards to the implications of 
development on the Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of Importance 
for Nature Conservation (SINC).  It should be noted that the SINC 
is not within the Order Limits or Order Land.  RCT had a concern 
that the basis for establishing the hydrological impacts on the 
SINC had not been sufficiently well explored in the ES and there 
was a remaining concern that mitigation measures identified may 
not be sufficiently specific with regards to impacts on the 
hydrology of the bog. 
4.157 RCT concluded on page 32 of their LIR [REP-025]: 
'In light of the comments raised by the Council’s Ecologist, these 
issues may be capable of being addressed through a 
“requirement” (condition) proposed as part of the DCO (such an 
amendment to the proposed Ecological Management Plan 
requirement) of the S106 agreement. It is considered that, while 
there is no fundamental objection to the scheme, there are a 
number of outstanding issues that need further clarification such 
that it is recommended that PINS consider the ecological impacts 
set out above in the issue specific hearings on environmental 
matters reserved for 24th & 25th September.'  
4.158 In the ExA's view RCT concerns on the Power Station Habitat 
Management will be addressed via Requirement 10 of the draft 
Development Consent Order, which requires the production of a 
written Ecological Management Plan (Appendix D). The measures 
to be included in the written Ecological Management Plan must 
include the measures identified in the ecological mitigation plan 
Figure 11.5 [APP-028] and section 8.7 of the environmental 
statement [AP-019].  Requirement 10 states that the Ecological 
Management Plan must be approved by the relevant planning 
authority (Rhondda Cynon Taff County Borough Council ("RCT") in 
consultation with BBNPA prior to commencement. General Power 
Station Habitat Management does not form part of the Section 106 
Agreement, as it will instead be delivered via Requirement 10. 
4.159 In addition a Section 106 Agreement has been agreed between 
RCT and the Applicant [REP-048].  The Section 106 Agreement 
does include specific provisions relating to various reinstatement 
activities in respect of a bog that is within the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC), but not 
within the Order Limits or the Order Land. 
4.160 The "Bog Reinstatement Activities Area" (as it is termed in the 
Section 106 Agreement) is to the north of the main power station 
site and is within the land ownership of the Applicant (the area is 
hatched blue on the plan contained in Appendix 1 to the Section 
106 Agreement).

4.161 It is agreed between the Applicant and RCT that RCT will carry out 
the "Bog Reinstatement Activities" (as defined in the Section 106 
Agreement).  Under paragraph 9, Schedule 1 of the Section 106 
Agreement, the Applicant provides RCT access to the Bog 
Reinstatement Activities Area in order to carry out the Bog 
Reinstatement Activities.  The activities include the possible 
implementation of hydrological monitoring, drain blocking and 
associated habitat management to help restore the bog. 
4.162 The Applicant and RCT have agreed that these activities should 
improve the hydrological balance of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC, by reducing the problem of excess drainage. Raising the 
water table would encourage the re-establishment of more 
ecologically diverse habitats and reduce the dominance of species 
such as purple moor-grass [REP-048]. This is in accordance with 
RCT policies in the adopted Local Development Plan (2011 – 
2021). 
4.163 RCT confirmed in the SoCG [REP-031] at paragraph 3.5.6 that 
there are no issues outstanding on this topic. 
4.164 NRW confirmed in the SoCG [REP-036] at paragraph 2.5.12 that: 
'Both Parties AGREE that the delivery of an agreed Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (“CEMP”) and Ecological 
Management Plan (“EMP”) (to be secured by requirements 12 and 
10 respectively in Schedule 2 of the draft DCO) is appropriate and 
should ensure the protection of habitats during and post-
construction. ' 
 
Impacts on Bats  
4.165 RCT raised concerns regarding impacts on bats in their LIR at page 
27 [REP-025]. They accepted that on the evidence of the bat 
survey reports, that the impacts on bat roosts will be able to be 
mitigated, it is also clear that specific mitigation will be required, 
and that this should extend beyond the direct impacts on those 
bat roosts to include details of site lighting (the principles of 
ecological sensitive lighting are set out in sections 6.2.6 to 6.2.9 of 
the applicant's “Outline Lighting Strategy” [APP-025]) and 
subsequent habitat management.  RCT accepted that this is 
capable of being governed by Requirement 10, but aftercare and 
monitoring must also be secured in the Section 106 agreement.  
4.166 NRW confirmed in the SoCG [REP-036] at paragraphs 4.2.2 and 
4.2.3 that: 
'Both Parties AGREE that surveys to reassess the use of buildings 
within the Project redline boundary by roosting bats will be 
required in the year prior to/during which demolition/construction 
commences. It is agreed that these surveys will need to be

undertaken in accordance with the guidance presented in Bat 
Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Bat Conservation Trust, 2012).  
Based on the current status of the bat roost and delivery of the 
commitments set out within the method statement and currently 
available information, both Parties AGREE that the proposed 
Project is unlikely to cause detriment to the maintenance of the 
favourable conservation status of the bat species present and 
therefore it appears that it would be possible in principle to grant 
the licence for the Project. However, NRW is unable to provide a 
binding commitment at this stage as to the subsequent 
determination of the application and it should be noted that a 
licence may or may not be issued. Both Parties AGREE that any 
changes in the bat roost status of buildings following the resurvey 
will require a review of the mitigation. At this stage, NRW is 
unable to provide any binding commitments to the subsequent 
determination of an application.'  
4.167 Bat Mitigation measures are secured via Requirement 10 of the 
draft Development Consent Order and via the CEMP which is 
secured via Requirement 12 of the draft Development Consent 
Order [PD-018]. This is consistent with the Mitigation 
Commitments Register (MCR), document reference MCR [HR-009], 
which is secured via Requirement 4(6) [PD-018]. 
4.168 Replacement bat roost provision will be in accordance with the 
draft ecological mitigation plan referred to in Requirement 10. 
4.169 Exact details of bat mitigation will be further secured via the 
requirement to obtain a European Protected Species (EPS) 
derogation licence from NRW under the Conservation of Habitats 
and Species Regulations (2010, as amended).  A draft EPS 
derogation licence was submitted with the Application [APP-020].  
NRW confirmed agreement in principle to this in Areas of 
Agreement Between Hirwaun Power Limited and the Natural 
Resources Body SoCG [REP-036] at paragraph 4.2.3.   
Conclusions on Biodiversity and Geological Conservation 
4.170 Given the evidence presented, the ExA considers that ecology and 
biodiversity issues have been adequately assessed, and that the 
requirements of NPS EN-1 are met.  
4.171 The ExA is satisfied that NRW, RCT and BBNPA concerns regarding 
effects on biodiversity have been dealt with adequately by the 
Applicant via DCO requirements and a Section 106 Agreement 
[REP-048]. 
 
Civil and Military aviation and Defence interests 
4.172 NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.4.16 states:

'There are statutory requirements concerning lighting to tall 
structures30. Where lighting is requested on structures that goes 
beyond statutory requirements by any of the relevant aviation and 
defence consultees, the IPC should satisfy itself of the necessity of 
such lighting taking into account the case put forward by the 
consultees. The effect of such lighting on the landscape and 
ecology may be a relevant consideration.' 
4.173 The CAA stated in their Relevant Representation [RR-001]: 
'Aviation Warning Lighting. Given the assumed maximum height of 
associated structures (35m) I do not believe there to be a need for 
aviation warning lighting.' 
4.174 At a maximum of 35m Above Ordnance Datum (AOD) high [APP-
019], there will be a requirement for the flue emission stacks, 
numbered works 2A,  to be promulgated and charted for civil 
aviation purposes. This is achieved through the developer 
providing, when construction time frames are known, related 
information to the Defence Geographic Centre, which manages the 
UK data-base of tall structures [RR-001]. This is addressed in the 
draft DCO [PD-018] by Requirement 20. 
Conclusion on Military Aviation and Defence interests   
4.175 The ExA considers that civil and military aviation interests have 
been adequately assessed and meet the requirements of NPS EN-
1. 
 
Climate change mitigation and adaptation 
4.176 NPS EN-1 states in paragraphs 4.8.1and 4.8.2: 
'Part 2 of this NPS covers the Government’s energy and climate 
change strategy, including policies for mitigating climate change. 
This part of the NPS sets out how Applicants and the IPC should 
take the effects of climate change into account when developing 
and consenting infrastructure. While climate change mitigation is 
essential to minimise the most dangerous impacts of climate 
change, previous global greenhouse gas emissions have already 
committed us to some degree of continued climate change for at 
least the next 30 years. If new energy infrastructure is not 
sufficiently resilient against the possible impacts of climate 
change, it will not be able to satisfy the energy needs as outlined 
in Part 3 of this NPS. 
Climate change is likely to mean that the UK will experience 
hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters. There is a

likelihood of increased flooding, drought, heatwaves and intense 
rainfall events, as well as rising sea levels. Adaptation is therefore 
necessary to deal with the potential impacts of these changes that 
are already happening.' 
 
4.177 NPS EN-2 in paragraph 2.3.13 states: 
'Part 2 of EN-1 covers the Government’s energy and climate 
change strategy, including policies for mitigating climate change. 
Section 4.8 of EN-1 sets out generic considerations that Applicants 
and the IPC should take into account, to help ensure that fossil 
fuel generating infrastructure is resilient to climate change.' 
4.178 Climate change was identified as an issue in the initial assessment 
of Principal Issues [DEC-004]. 
4.179 The ExA addressed the adequacy of the information and the 
assessment provided in the ES [APP-019] in the first round of 
written questions [DEC-006 Question EIA12]. 
4.180 The Applicant's response can be found at [REP-030].  EN-1 is 
considered in Section 2.4 of the ES [APP-019].  In particular 
information on how climate change should be assessed for 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects is detailed in 
Paragraph 2.4.8.  
4.181 Flood risk, including the implications of climate change has been 
explored in more detail within a standalone Flood Risk Assessment 
(FRA) [APP-041].  Climate change projections were incorporated 
into the FRA within calculations of runoff generated by future 
rainfall events to ensure that a suitable drainage solution could be 
developed for the site, now and for 25 years following 
construction.  The FRA concludes at para.5.3.1 that the Project will 
result in no increased flood risk to the site or people and 
properties outside of the site.  
Conclusion on climate change mitigation and adaptation 
4.182 Given the evidence presented, the ExA consider that climate 
change mitigation and adaptation issues have been adequately 
assessed by the Applicant and meet the requirements of NPS EN-1 
and EN-2. 
 
Dust and other potential nuisance 
4.183 Paragraph 4.14.2 of EN-1 states: 
'It is very important that, at the application stage of an energy 
NSIP, possible sources of nuisance under Section 79(1) of the 
1990 Act and how they may be mitigated or limited are considered 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

by the IPC so that appropriate requirements can be included in 
any subsequent order granting development consent. (See Section 
5.6 on Dust, odour, artificial light etc. and Section 5.11on Noise 
and vibration.)' 
4.184 EN-1 5.6.7 states: 
 
'The IPC should satisfy itself that: 
 
 
an assessment of the potential for artificial light, dust, odour, 
smoke, steam and insect infestation to have a detrimental 
impact on amenity has been carried out; and 
 
 
that all reasonable steps have been taken, and will be taken, 
to minimise any such detrimental impacts.' 
4.185 Odour, smoke, steam and insect infestation were not raised by 
any party in the course of the examination as potential impacts. 
4.186 RCT in their LIR [REP-025] raised dust and noise as potential 
nuisance issues. BBNPA in their LIR [REP-024] raised artificial 
lighting as an issue because of potential effects on BBNP's 
International Dark Sky Status. 
Dust 
4.187 RCT addressed dust impacts in its LIR [REP-025] at pages 23, 30 
and 31 in relation to human and ecological receptors. 
4.188 Dust is dealt with in Section 6 of the ES [APP-019] and in the 
Outline CEMP Appendix 4.1[APP-020].  
4.189 The RCT SoCG [REP-031] at Sections 3.5 and 3.9.1 concludes that 
the mitigation measures proposed will reduce impacts on sensitive 
receptors. 
Conclusion on Dust 
4.190 The ExA believes that only negligible dust effects are expected 
with respect to any phase of the operations and in respect of any 
receptor, because widely used and effective mitigation measures 
will be deployed through mitigation measures in the draft DCO via 
Requirement 12 (1)(c) [PD-018]. 
 
Noise and Vibration 
4.191 Noise and vibration is addressed in paragraphs 4.236 to 4.242 of 
this report.

Artificial Light 
4.192 The National Park was designated as an International Dark Sky 
Reserve in 2013 by the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). 
Its mission is: 
 '…to preserve and protect the night-time environment and our 
heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting.'  
4.193 The "dark sky status" of BBNP was highlighted in the identification 
of principal issues [DEC-004]. 
4.194 BBNPA raised the question of artificial light in its Relevant 
Representation [RR-010] and in its LIR [REP-024] at paragraphs 
5.16 - 5.17:  
'5.16...Whilst the content of the current Lighting Strategy is noted, 
the Authority is concerned over the impact of the development on 
its Dark Sky status. To this end, the Authority is aware that the 
Applicant is seeking to undertake such an assessment to include a 
review of the baseline lighting situation and the proposed 
development and additional information has very recently been 
submitted to the Authority for consideration (19 August 2014) and 
is being reviewed. 
5.17 It is recognised that the application site is located within an 
established industrial area with lighting emanating from nearby 
towns and villages and the local highway network, however until 
such time an assessment has been undertaken and a revised 
lighting strategy produced, the BBNPA is unable to accept that the 
development would not have a night-time visual impact. 
Nevertheless, it is accepted that the Applicant has now acceded to 
requests to formally include the BBNPA as a consultee for DCO 
Requirement 16 by agreeing to include the words “in consultation 
with the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority” after the words 
“approved by the relevant planning authority'. 
4.195 Artificial light is dealt with in Sections 8 (effects on bats) and 11 of 
the ES [APP-019] and in the CEMP [APP-020].  
4.196 The ExA addressed the issue of artificial light in its first round of 
written questions [DEC-006 Question DLV04]. The Applicant's 
response can be found at [REP-030]. 
4.197 The draft DCO [PD-018] contains Requirement 16 which addresses 
the control of artificial light emissions during construction and 
operation. 
Conclusion on Dust and other potential nuisance  
4.198 The ExA is satisfied that the potential dust and other nuisance 
have been considered adequately and appropriately by the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
64
 
 
Applicant, and that the draft DCO [PD-018] contains the necessary 
Requirements to mitigate nuisance: 
 
Requirements 12, 15 - noise nuisance;  
 
Requirement  12 - dust and 
 
Requirement 16 - lighting. 
4.199 Under these Requirements RCT will approve all mitigation and 
control plans before construction commences31. 
4.200 The defence of statutory authority for nuisance under s.158 of 
PA2008 will be available to the Applicant, subject to Article 34 in 
the draft DCO [PD-018], which provides a defence for noise 
nuisance as a consequence of construction or maintenance of the 
development.   
4.201 The ExA believes nuisance issues have been assessed adequately 
and that the mechanisms for the management of potential impacts 
are robust and sufficient and meet the requirements of NPS EN-1 
and EN-2 and RCT LDP Policy AW10 Environmental Protection and 
Public Health. 
 
Flood risk 
4.202 Section 5.7.9 of NPS EN-1 states: 
'In determining an application for development consent, the IPC 
should be satisfied that where relevant: 
 
the application is supported by an appropriate FRA; 
 
the Sequential Test has been applied as part of site selection; 
 
a sequential approach has been applied at the site level to 
minimise risk by directing the most vulnerable uses to areas 
of lowest flood risk; 
 
 the proposal is in line with any relevant national and local 
flood risk management strategy; 
 
priority has been given to the use of sustainable drainage 
systems (SuDs) (as required in the next paragraph on 
National Standards); and 
 
in flood risk areas the project is appropriately flood resilient 
and resistant, including safe access and escape routes where 
required, and that any residual risk can be safely managed 
over the lifetime of the development.' 
4.203 The assessment of potential flooding was highlighted in the 
identification of principal issues [DEC-004].

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State

4.204 In the case of the Project, flood risks that have been considered 
are detailed in Sections 3, 5 and 9 of the ES [APP-019] and also a 
separate FRA [APP-041] has been performed.  
4.205 The Applicant has reviewed indicative flood maps and the Strategic 
Flood Consequence Assessment (SFCA).  It was identified that the 
site is located within the low risk EA Flood Zone 1 / TAN15 Zone A 
with an annual probability of tidal and fluvial flooding of less than 
0.1% (1 in 1000)[APP-041]. 
4.206 The EA indicative surface water flood map shows a raised risk of 
surface water flooding at the site. However, this mapping does not 
fully take into account surface water drainage or the culverted 
Nant yr Ochain which flows around the eastern boundary of the 
Project Site. 
4.207 There are no known significant flood risks to the site from 
groundwater or overland flow and no known records of historical 
flooding within the site [APP-041]. 
4.208 The Applicant has assessed the project site to be at low risk of 
flooding. 
4.209 The NRW have not raised any concerns with the Applicant's 
assessment of flood risk in the SoCG [REP-036].  
Conclusion on flood risk 
4.210 The Project Site is situated in TAN15 Development Advice Zone A 
which defines Zone A as an area at little or no risk of fluvial 
flooding.  The ExA considers that the examination of flood risks 
has been addressed adequately, takes full account of the 
additional risk from climate change (see paragraphs 4.176-4.182 
of this report) and meets the requirements of NPS EN-1. 
 
Health 
4.211 EN-1 paragraph 4.13.2 states: 
'As described in the relevant Sections of this NPS and in the 
technology specific NPSs, where the proposed project has an effect 
on human beings, the ES should assess these effects for each 
element of the project, identifying any adverse health impacts, 
and identifying measures to avoid, reduce or compensate for these 
impacts as appropriate. The impacts of more than one 
development may affect people simultaneously, so the Applicant 
and the IPC should consider the cumulative impact on health. ' 
4.212 The assessment of potential health impacts was highlighted in the 
identification of principal issues [DEC-004]. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project

4.213 The Applicant has produced a standalone Health Impact 
Assessment (HIA) report to ensure that the health effects of the 
Project are clearly articulated in a concise way [APP-046].  The 
HIA draws on the methods as set out in the Health Impact 
Assessment: A Practical Guide32. 
4.214 The HIA report draws on other technical assessments prepared as 
part of the DCO application as necessary, such as the 
Environmental Statement [APP-0019].  The HIA report 
summarises the findings of these studies to provide a standalone 
document. 
4.215 RCT's LIR [REP-025] states on page 19 and 34: 
'Policy AW10 refers to environmental protection and public health. 
The proposal is considered to be broadly compliant with the 
criteria areas set out. No objection has been received from the 
Council’s Public Health and Protection section. 
In terms of noise, odour, dust, etc., during the construction phase, 
the Council’s Public Health and Protection Section are satisfied that 
any effects can be minimised through the imposition of a 
condition.' 
 
Conclusion on Health  
4.216 The ExA considers that the examination of health risks [APP-046] 
has been addressed adequately and that the requirements of NPS 
EN-1 are met. Based on the implementation of the proposed 
mitigation [PD-018], for the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project, the ExA considers there is no 
evidence that suggests that the proposed development will result 
in adverse public health impacts.  
 
Historic environment 
4.217 The effects of the project on historic and archaeological 
environment, including issues related to:  
 
The effects of the project on the settings of heritage assets ; 
 
The effects of the project on archaeological remains. 
were highlighted in the initial assessment of Principal Issues [DEC 
004]. In accordance with paragraph 5.8.8 of EN-1, the Applicant 
has provided a description of the significance of the heritage 
assets affected by the proposed development and the contribution 
of their setting to that significance [Section 14 of APP-019].

4.218 No listed buildings or scheduled monuments would be affected 
physically by the Project, although off site works carried out to 
install the gas and electricity connectors could potentially disturb 
undesignated historic assets [APP-019].  
4.219 A total of 16 heritage assets were identified within the 1 km Inner 
Study Area, which includes one Grade II Listed Building.  One 
heritage asset lies within the Power Generation Plant Site and this 
comprises a WWII Royal Ordnance Factory (HA06). Some 
buildings relating to this factory are still extant within Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate and may be affected by the development of the 
Power Generation Plant [APP-019]. 
4.220 In the wider 5km Outer Study Area, 18 Listed Buildings have been 
identified, all of which are Grade II Listed.  A total of 55 Scheduled 
Monuments have been recorded within the 5 km Study Area, 
although many of these are part of the same scheduling groups 
[APP-019]. 
4.221 The ExA asked four questions, ARC01-04 [DEC-006] relating to 
the historic environment, and the Applicant's responses can be 
viewed at [REP-030]. 
4.222 BBNPA state in their LIR [REP-024] at paragraph 5.25: 
'Whilst it is considered that clarification from the Applicant in 
relation to the above mentioned inaccuracies would be welcomed, 
it is considered similar to the BBNPA’s assessment of the 
Landscape and Visual Impact of the development that by virtue of 
the introduction of the development, in particular the stacks and 
their visibility from heritage assets within the National Park, that 
the proposal would have a negative impact on the setting of 
heritage assets, but in terms of the magnitude of that impact 
given the distances and possible mitigation measures as referred 
to in the landscape and visual impact section above, that the 
magnitude in relation to the setting of heritage assets 
would be minor and possibly could be reduced to a 
negligible magnitude subject to mitigation measures and 
the finer design details.33' 
 
4.223 The BBNPA SoCG [REP-035] states at paragraphs 2.9.5-2.9.6 
that: 
'The Parties AGREE that the response provided in the Applicant's 
response to the BBNPA LIR satisfactorily address the concerns 
raised in the LIR and demonstrates the assessment was robust. 
                                       
 
33 ExA emphasis 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State

The Parties AGREE that the residual effects are likely to be of 
minor magnitude and since the ES represents a worst case 
assessment and all reasonable mitigation is committed to within 
the Design Principles and secured by requirement 4(4) and 16(1) 
which BBNPA would be consulted on, with which the residual effect 
is likely to reduce to slight or negligible.' 
Conclusions on the Historic Environment 
4.224 Policy on the historic environment within EN-1 has been followed 
by the Applicant. This policy is broadly consistent with relevant 
saved policies in the Brecon Beacons National Park Management 
Plan 2010 – 2015, the Brecon Beacons National Park Local 
Development Plan (Approved December 2013) (the LDP) and the 
RCT LDP (2011) Policy AW8 Protection and Enhancement of the 
Natural Environment. 
4.225 In the ExA's view there is the potential for residual effects on the 
setting of historic assets within the Study Areas. A programme of 
archaeological mitigation prior to construction, secured via 
Requirements 11 and 4(3) [PD-018], combined with the distance 
to sensitive receptors and local topography will mean that these 
residual effects are unlikely to be significant.  
 
Land use 
4.226 Section 5.10 of EN-1 is relevant here.  
4.227 RCT's LIR [REP-025] states on page 3: 
'The proposed use is industrial in nature and sits within an 
established industrial estate and, therefore, raises little issue in 
respect of land-use compatibility. The application will occupy a 
large area of land that the LDP primarily identifies as suitable for 
employment in B1 (Light Industry), B2 (General Industry) and B8 
(Storage & Distribution) Use Classes. The proportion of likely jobs 
to land-take is low. If the development proceeds, this land would 
no longer be available (although the Council has a plentiful supply 
of industrial land within the County Borough). Nevertheless, if 
constructed, the scheme represents a significant inward 
investment within the northern part of the County Borough and, 
while the number of jobs that will be created through the 
operational phase of the development is low, there are significant 
opportunities during the construction phase to help support and 
enhance local suppliers.' 
4.228 The LIR prepared by RCT [REP-025] shows that the site of the 
works applied for is allocated for the development of the Power 
Generation Plant is designated in the Proposals Map as Policy CS 9 
- Waste Management. The Hirwaun Industrial Estate is identified 
as a regional site that is able to accommodate a range of waste 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

management options to meet the capacity requirements set out in 
the South East Wales Regional Waste Plan. 
4.229 The RCT 2011 Local Development Plan (LDP) notes that: 
 '…in identifying Hirwaun Industrial Estate as a suitable site for 
waste management, it is not the intention that the employment 
uses at the site should cease.' 
4.230 The scheme, if built, would effectively remove approximately 5 
hectares from the land allocated within the Industrial Estate to 
develop “waste” uses. While the proposed use would represent a 
loss, Policy CS 9 states that land at the respective sites is available 
for this type of use, in the case of Hirwaun it would not prevent 
other B1, B2 or B8 uses from using or developing the land for non-
waste related industrial uses.  In addition, the policy does not 
preclude any other site within the County Borough from being 
considered for “waste” uses. 
4.231 The loss of this site is not considered by RCT to be out of 
accordance with the aims and objectives of this policy and is 
considered to have a negligible / negative impact. The 
development, being within the boundaries of the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate and close to the main settlements of Hirwaun, 
Rhigos and Aberdare is considered by RCT to be a “sustainable 
location” and is broadly compliant with the criteria set out in Policy 
AW2. In terms of sustainability, the RCT believe the proposal is 
considered to have a moderate / positive impact [REP-025].  
4.232 Having considered the application against the LDP policies, the 
ExA has had no reason to disagree with the RCT conclusion that 
the application complies with the LDP Policies. 
4.233 The proposed development has no implications for green 
infrastructure, other than its temporary implications for footpaths.  
4.234 Several public footpaths link the west of the Hirwaun industrial 
estate with Rhigos, Bryn and Cefn Rhigos. To the south, the land 
is reclaimed colliery land and a public right of way runs east west 
between Bryn in the west and Hirwaun in the east. To the north 
west the industrial estate is connected by a public footpath to 
Pwll-y-Crochan Waterfall and the waterfalls north of 
Pontneddfechan.  Another footpath runs north from the industrial 
estate between Penderyn Reservoir and Pantcefnffordd onto the 
village of Penderyn (see Insert 13.5 of ES [APP-019]). 
Conclusion on Land Use 
4.235 The ExA concludes that the land use issues have been addressed 
adequately and meet the requirements of NPS EN-1. The ExA has 
had no reason to disagree with the RCT conclusion that the 
application complies with the LDP Policies.  The ExA concludes that

the implications for all footpaths are temporary and of minor 
adverse significance. 
Noise and vibration 
4.236 NPS EN-1 states at paragraph 5.11.9: 
'The IPC should not grant development consent unless it is 
satisfied that the proposals will meet the following aims: 
 
avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life 
from noise; 
 
 
mitigate and minimise other adverse impacts on health and 
quality of life from noise; and 
 
 
where possible, contribute to improvements to health and 
quality of life through the effective management and control 
of noise.' 
4.237 Noise and vibration issues were considered by the Applicant in 
Section 7 of the ES [APP-019]. 
4.238 RCT addressed noise and vibration issues in its LIR [REP-025].  
RCT LDP Policy AW10 – Environmental Protection and Public 
Health requires: 
 
'No unacceptable harm from a range of environmental risks, 
including air pollution (1), noise pollution (2), light pollution 
(3) and water pollution (7).' 
4.239 RCT’s Public Health and Protection Section concluded that the 
scheme is unlikely to have any noise implications through the 
operational phase but had concerns over the proposed hours of 
construction proposed as a “requirement” (condition) as part of 
the DCO [REP-025].  RCT requested that no works would 
commence before 7.00 on any morning nor would any works be 
carried out on Sundays or Bank Holidays [REP-025].  In terms of 
odour, dust, etc., during the construction phase, the Council’s 
Public Health and Protection Section are satisfied that any effects 
can be minimised through the imposition of a condition. 
4.240 Changes were made to noise limits (Requirement 15) and 
construction hours (Requirement 14) in the draft DCO [PD-018] in 
the course of the examination, arising from concerns raised 
initially by RCT in the LIR [REP-025] and in response to the ExA's 
first round of questions [DEC-006]. 
4.241 RCT in its SoCG [REP-031] has agreed that construction (Section 
3.7.3) and operation (Section 3.7.4) will have negligible noise and 
vibration impact through the embedded  mitigation in project 
design and the measures secured in the draft DCO Requirements 
14 and 15 [PD-018].

Conclusion on Noise and Vibration 
4.242 Given the evidence presented, the ExA believes that noise and 
vibration issues have been addressed adequately and meets the 
requirements specified in 5.11 of NPS EN-1. 
 
Pollution control and other environmental regulatory 
regimes 
4.243 Section 4.10 of EN-1 notes the need to ensure that the 
requirements of other consenting regimes are met. Paragraphs 
4.10.7 and 4.10.8 state: 
'The IPC should be satisfied that development consent can be 
granted taking full account of environmental impacts. Working in 
close cooperation with EA and/or the pollution control authority, 
and other relevant bodies, such as the MMO, Natural England, the 
Countryside Council for Wales, Drainage Boards, and water and 
sewerage undertakers, the IPC should be satisfied, before 
consenting any potentially polluting developments, that: 
 
the relevant pollution control authority is satisfied that 
potential releases can be adequately regulated under the 
pollution control framework; and 
 
the effects of existing sources of pollution in and around the 
site are not such that the cumulative effects of pollution when 
the proposed development is added would make that 
development unacceptable, particularly in relation to 
statutory environmental quality limits. 
The IPC should not refuse consent on the basis of pollution 
impacts unless it has good reason to believe that any relevant 
necessary operational pollution control permits or licences or other 
consents will not subsequently be granted.' 
4.244 A list of consents required under other regulatory regimes, 
including environmental regulatory regimes, is provided [APP-
044].  
4.245 An Environmental Permit application to NRW has not yet been 
made. Section 5.3.1 of the NRW SoCG [REP-036] states: 
'Both Parties AGREE that upon the information currently available, 
it appears that it would be possible in principle to grant consent 
for the Project. However NRW is unable to provide any binding 
commitments at this stage as to the subsequent determination of 
the application and it should be noted that consent may be 
granted or refused.'

Conclusion on Pollution control and other environmental 
regulatory regimes 
4.246 The ExA concludes that there is no evidence presented, that the 
granting of any necessary licence under other regulatory regimes 
will be withheld, and that therefore based on NPS EN-1 paragraph 
4.10.8, the SoS as decision-maker should have no reason to 
withhold development consent on these grounds. 
 
Safety 
4.247 NPS EN-1 at paragraphs 4.11.1 and 4.12.1 state: 
'HSE is responsible for enforcing a range of occupational health 
and safety legislation some of which is relevant to the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of energy 
infrastructure. Applicants should consult with the Health and 
Safety Executive (HSE) on matters relating to safety. 
All establishments wishing to hold stocks of certain hazardous 
substances above a threshold need Hazardous Substances 
consent. Applicants should consult the HSE at pre-application 
stage if the project is likely to need hazardous substances consent. 
Where hazardous substances consent is applied for, the IPC will 
consider whether to make an order directing that hazardous 
substances consent shall be deemed to be granted alongside 
making an order granting development consent. The IPC should 
consult HSE about this.' 
4.248 Ashtenne Industrial Fund (AIF) in their written representation 
[REP-010] raised safety concerns around the storage of hazardous 
substances i.e. natural gas on site. 
4.249 The Applicant responded [REP-030] that under: 
'Notification of Installations Handling Hazardous Substances 1982 
(NIHHS)” “(Planning) Hazardous Substance Regulations 1993” 
Both regulations refer to a minimum notifiable quantity of 15T of 
natural gas stored, we don’t get close to this amount either with 
the MOC or PTF (i.e. where the pipeline connects to the National 
Grid) (less than 0.5T of flowing gas in each site at any one time at 
worst case). Therefore the quantities of gas in the pipeline are well 
below the threshold and we consider that hazardous substances 
issues will not arise for the pipeline. 
For the site itself, again a threshold of 15T storage of natural gas 
would apply. We have calculated the likely ‘storage’ capacity of 
on-site pipelines and it is well below this figure. There are no 
storage needs for any other materials in quantities likely to exceed 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
73
 
 
the thresholds set out in the above regulations. For these reasons 
we consider we do not require HSC for the project.' 
4.250 Mrs Freeman in her written representation [REP-018] raised safety 
concerns regarding the operation of the gas pipeline. 
4.251 The Applicant responded [REP-038] noting that the gas pipeline 
was approximately 106m from Mrs Freeman's property. A number 
of consents are required from the HSE [APP-044] (items 7 and 13 
in Table 1), before the gas pipeline can become operational.  HSE 
will not give these consents unless the gas pipeline can be 
operated safely. 
Conclusion on Safety 
4.252 The ExA believes that safety issues have been addressed 
appropriately and meets the requirements specified in 4.11 and 
4.12 of NPS EN-1. 
 
Security considerations 
4.253 NPS EN-1 4.15 identifies possible issues of national security 
relating to energy infrastructure.  No representations were made 
in regard to national security considerations.  The ExA does not 
believe there to be any national security issues associated with 
this Application. 
 
Socio-economic impacts 
4.254 EN-1 5.12 states that: 
'Where the project is likely to have socio-economic impacts at local 
or regional levels, the Applicant should undertake and include in 
their application an assessment of these impacts as part of the ES 
(see Section 4.2). 
5.12.3 This assessment should consider all relevant socio-
economic impacts, which may include: 
 
the creation of jobs and training opportunities; 
 
the provision of additional local services and improvements to 
local infrastructure, including the provision of educational and 
visitor facilities; 
 
effects on tourism; 
 
the impact of a changing influx of workers during the 
different construction, operation and decommissioning phases 
of the energy infrastructure. This could change the local 
population dynamics and could alter the demand for services 
and facilities in the settlements nearest to the construction 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
74
 
 
work (including community facilities and physical 
infrastructure such as energy, water, transport and waste). 
There could also be effects on social cohesion depending on 
how populations and service provision change as a result of 
the development; and 
 
cumulative effects – if development consent were to be 
granted to for a number of projects within a region and these 
were developed in a similar timeframe, there could be some 
short-term negative effects, for example a potential shortage 
of construction workers to meet the needs of other industries 
and major projects within the region. 
5.12.4 Applicants should describe the existing socio-economic 
conditions in the areas surrounding the proposed development and 
should also refer to how the development’s socio-economic 
impacts correlate with local planning policies.' 
4.255 The Applicant addressed socio-economic issues in Section 15 of 
the ES [APP-019]. 
4.256 The ExA identified economic and social impacts as one of the 
principal issues to be examined in relation to this application. The 
Rule 6 letter [DEC-004] stated that these included issues related 
to: 
 
The impact on the local economy; and  
 
The impact on local services and facilities. 
4.257 The ExA examined this through: 
 
Consideration of the application documents and, in particular, 
Section 15 on ‘Socio-Economics’ in the ES [APP-019]; and 
 
Consideration of the LIRs [REP-024; REP-025]. 
4.258 It should be noted in giving the summary of aspects covered, that 
there were no representations or evidence presented challenging 
the Applicant’s analysis and conclusions on the socio-economic 
impacts of this proposal. 
4.259 Following consideration of the LIRs, the ExA concluded that there 
was no requirement for an Issue Specific Hearing (ISH) devoted to 
Economic and Social Impacts.  
4.260 The ExA had particular regard to Section 5.12 (Socio-Economic) of 
EN-1 and, in particular, whether: 
 
the Applicant has undertaken and included in its application 
an assessment of the impacts as part of the ES; 
 
whether that assessment has considered all relevant socio-
economic impacts; and 
 
whether mitigation measures are necessary to mitigate any 
adverse socio-economic impacts of the development. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State

4.261 The Applicant has concluded [APP-019] that the project: 
 
would provide a minor beneficial construction and operational 
employment impact; 
 
would have as a worst case scenario a ‘slight’ adverse impact 
on tourism; and 
 
would have as a worst case scenario a ‘slight’ adverse impact 
on community infrastructure facilities. 
4.262 BBNPA's LIR [REP-024] states: 
'In terms of Socio-Economic Impacts, it is considered that the 
proposal has the potential to impact upon tourism and the 
enjoyment of the National Park by virtue of the visual impact of 
the proposal on the local landscape and the effect that would have 
on the enjoyment of recreational users. The social-economic 
assessment concludes that in relation to tourism in general, the 
project would have a slight adverse impact. It is considered that it 
is reasonable to conclude that by virtue of the visual impact of the 
proposal on views from within the Park, that the development 
would have a negative impact on recreational users of areas of 
open access land and public rights of way with views to the site. It 
is considered therefore in combination with the Authority’s 
consideration of the landscape and visual effects that the effect of 
the development on tourism, particularly recreational users would 
be negative and of a moderate impact. However the magnitude of 
this impact could be reduced subject to the mitigation measures, 
including design principle proposals.'  
4.263 The BBNPA SoCG [REP-035] states at paragraph 2.10.4 that:  
'…following the clarifications and additional assessment made of 
landscape and night time lighting issues as documented elsewhere 
in this SoCG, the design mitigation secured in the Design 
Principles and Requirement 4 in the draft DCO constitutes 
reasonable mitigation and are likely to reduce the magnitude of 
this impact from moderate to slight or negligible' 
4.264 RCT's LIR [REP-025] states on pages 34-35: 
'The LDP has specifically allocated the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
for employment uses including B1 (Light Industry), B2 (General 
Industry) and B8 (Storage and Distribution) as well as part of it 
being specifically allocated for “waste” uses.  
While the visual appearance of the area would be improved 
through the redevelopment of this large building, the construction 
of the power plant would mean that between 5 and 7.5 hectares of 
land would no longer be available for development. Given the low 
number of employees required to operate the plant, the ratio of 
direct permanent jobs to land-take is very low. Given that the site 
(and the wider Estate) is excellently located in such close 
proximity to the A465 it would mean that, potentially, one of the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
76
 
 
most attractive development sites would be lost. It is considered 
that the loss of this land would have a moderate negative impact. 
While it is not part of the “normal” material planning 
considerations, a number of the larger schemes have included 
details of how they intend to include these local businesses within 
the construction and maintenance phases of the development and 
it is considered important that in reaching a decision, the 
SoS should include a requirement for the developer to 
demonstrate how local suppliers and services will be used 
in order to mitigate the loss of a significant area of 
employment land34. If it was possible to secure such a 
commitment the likely impact is considered to improve to 
moderate / positive. 
While the loss of this amount of land is of a concern, the County 
Borough currently has an oversupply of industrial land such that 
the loss would not have a strategic implication for this type of 
land. In light of the potential benefits from the construction 
process and subject to the Applicant demonstrating that its 
development would optimise the opportunities for employment 
uses, it is considered that on a County Borough wide basis, the 
likely impact of this loss would be neutral.' 
4.265 It has been agreed in the RCT SoCG [REP-031] at 1.2.1 that: 
 'RCTCBC offers its support in principle for the Project, having 
been developed in consultation with RCTCBC’s communities and 
representing a suitable location, being of a sufficient size, 
accessible, comprising previously-developed land away from 
environmentally sensitive areas.' 
4.266 It is also recognised within the RCT SoCG at paragraph 2.2.2 that: 
'…the proposal is broadly in compliance with the aims and 
objectives of the LDP and in particular is compliant with relevant 
LDP Policies, being CS 1, NSA 16, AW 2, AW 10 and AW 11” [AW 
11 being “Existing Employment and Retail Uses']. 
4.267 The Applicant agrees that their substantial inward investment 
should use local suppliers and services where permissible, as this 
would maximise the opportunities for direct and indirect 
(construction phase and operational phase) job creation and spend 
within the local area whilst also supporting other planning 
considerations such as traffic demand reduction [REP-040]. 
4.268 The Applicant has agreed in the RCT SoCG [REP-031] at paragraph 
3.16 (d) that the section 106 shall include a local 
services/procurement scheme. This directly addresses the request 
in the LIR [REP-025] on page 35 for the same, albeit via section 
                                       
 
34 ExA emphasis

106 rather than a DCO Requirement. The ExA believes that the 
provision of a section 106 agreement is consistent with RCT LDP 
Policy AW4 – Community Infrastructure & Planning Obligations, 
which provides for planning obligations to be sought where 
necessary to make proposals acceptable in land use planning 
terms. 
Conclusions on Economic and Social Impacts 
4.269 The ExA concludes that the Applicant has had adequate regard to 
the socio-economic impacts of the proposal and has provided 
sufficient evidence to support its assertions on the impacts. 
4.270 The ExA conclude that the proposal will create a range of jobs both 
in the construction phase and, to a lesser extent, in the 
operational phase and that these jobs will be created in an area 
which is currently affected by above national average 
unemployment.  
4.271 The final agreed section 106 agreement between the Applicant and 
RCT describes, in Schedule 4, the measures to assist businesses 
based in the vicinity of the Development to benefit directly from 
the opportunities arising from the Development [REP-048]. 
4.272 Given the evidence presented, the ExA conclude that the proposal 
has adequately addressed the requirements of EN-1 and EN-2 and 
would not have significant deleterious effects socially or 
economically. It also has the potential to support economic 
development in the area in line with the policies of the local 
authority. 
 
Traffic and Transport 
4.273 EN-1 states at paragraphs 5.13.7 and 5.13.8: 
'Provided that the Applicant is willing to enter into planning 
obligations or requirements can be imposed to mitigate transport 
impacts identified in the NATA/WebTAG transport assessment, 
with attribution of costs calculated in accordance with the 
Department for Transport’s guidance, then development consent 
should not be withheld, and appropriately limited weight should be 
applied to residual effects on the surrounding transport 
infrastructure. 
Where mitigation is needed, possible demand management 
measures must be considered and if feasible and operationally 
reasonable, required, before considering requirements for the 
provision of new inland transport infrastructure to deal with 
remaining transport impacts.'

4.274 The Applicant in its assessment of construction traffic impacts 
(section 13 of ES [APP-019]) concluded that the assessment 
reveals that the magnitude of traffic flow change as a result of the 
Project is considered to be very low, with moderate / minor effects 
for two junctions: 
 
A465, A4509, Rhigos Rd; 
(i)
 
A465, Hirwaun Rd, Brecon Rd. 
(ii)
 
and negligible effects for another two junctions: 
 
 
Fifth Avenue, Main Avenue; 
(i)
 
A4061, Rhigos Rd. 
(ii)
4.275 The ExA asked five questions (TT01-TT05) in its first round of 
written questions [DEC-006] and the Applicants responses can be 
viewed at [REP-030]. 
4.276 Traffic and transport issues were raised by a number of Interested 
Parties in their Relevant Representations.  RCT [RR-008], Network 
Rail [RR-016] and the Welsh Government [RR-007] all had 
particular concerns regarding construction traffic impacts. The 
Welsh Government (WG) proposed text for a requirement 
(Requirement 13 [PD-018]) to address Construction Traffic [RR-
007]. 
4.277 Requirement 13 secures the submission of a Construction Traffic 
Management Plan for approval by the relevant planning authority 
(in consultation with the Welsh Government). The provision 
specifies particular measures that the plan needs to contain. The 
approved plan must be implemented. The Welsh Government 
agreed the wording of this Requirement with the Applicant [RR-
07].  
4.278 RCT in their LIR [REP-025] accepted that given the low number of 
employees, that there is unlikely to be any noticeable impact on 
the highway network during the operational phase. 
4.279 However, they argued there is likely to be a considerable impact 
on the existing highway network during the construction phase 
although it is acknowledged that the proximity to the A465 will 
mean that any impacts will be localised in and around the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate and its environs. 
4.280 Cumulatively a number of consented developments (Enviroparks, 
Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm) could potentially begin / complete 
construction activities at the same time as the Project (see para. 
2.25 of this report). There may be considerable impacts on and 
around the Industrial Estate and Rhigos.  However, the likely start 
of construction for the project is in 2018 while the erection of the 
turbines for Pen Y Cymoedd will begin in 2015 and are proposed to 
be completed by 2017.

4.281 RCT in response to the ExA 2nd round question HA2-01 stated 
[REP-043]: 
'The (RCT’s) reference for the Enviroparks application is 08/1735.  
Committee considered the application in Spring of 2010 resolving 
to approve the application subject to the imposition of conditions 
and the Applicant entering into a S106 agreement. The S106 
agreement was subsequently completed and consent was issued 
by the Council on 21st December 2010.  
To avoid any misinterpretation of the latest current position, the 
Applicant (Enviroparks) were asked to give a brief statement of 
their position. They responded accordingly  
“You can advise that Enviroparks will be definitely be proceeding 
on the following outline programme:  
1. On site construction programmed to commence January 2015. 
NRW permit for Phase 1 now issued to Enviroparks.  
2. Phase 2 Gasifier programme construction commencement Q4 
2015. CfD applied for. EPCC and technology suite confirmed.  
3. On site Generation expected 2017' 
4.282 Following consideration of the Relevant Representations and LIRs, 
the ExA concluded that there was no requirement for an ISH 
devoted to Traffic and Transport Impacts.  
4.283 RCT in its SoCG [REP-031] agreed at Section 3.13.5, that the 
Applicant would produce a Construction Transport Management 
Plan (CTMP) to be approved by RCT in consultation with the WG. 
This would be secured by Requirement 13 in the draft DCO [PD-
018].  They also agreed (section 3.15.6 of [REP-031]) that Articles 
8-14 and Requirements 5-7 and 12 of the draft DCO supply 
sufficient control to RCT to manage all transport and highways 
matters. 
4.284 In mitigation for the highway impacts of the development, the 
Applicant has agreed to fund bus stop improvements close to the 
site to enable access to the site by means other than a car. The 
Applicant has also agreed to provide a financial contribution to 
provide improved vehicular crossovers at the Industrial Estate.  
This has been secured through a section 106 agreement (Schedule 
1 of [REP-048]). 
Conclusions on Traffic and Transport 
4.285 EN-1 at paragraph 5.13.7 states that provided the Applicant is 
willing to enter into planning obligations or requirements that can 
be imposed to mitigate transport impacts, development consent 
should not be withheld, and appropriately limited weight should be 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

applied to residual effects on the surrounding transport 
infrastructure.  It continues at Paragraph 5.13.8 by advising that 
where mitigation is needed, possible demand management 
measures must be considered and if feasible and operationally 
reasonable, required, before considering requirements for the 
provision of new inland transport infrastructure.  
4.286 This policy has been followed, including the agreement on a 
section 106 Agreement, whose obligations are detailed in 
Appendices D and E of [REP-048].   Subject to requirements set 
out within the draft DCO (Requirement 13 of [PD-018]), the 
Project meets EN-1 policy regarding traffic and transport in all 
other respects.  
 
Waste management 
4.287 Section 5.14 of NPS EN-1 and Section 2.9 of EN-2 is applicable. 
4.288 In the case of the Project, waste management issues have been 
considered and are detailed in Section 12 of the ES [APP-019] and 
the outline CEMP Appendix 4.1 of [APP-020]. 
4.289 The Applicant states in the ES Appendix 4.1 [APP-020] that the 
outline CEMP will be transferred to the appointed contractor(s) for 
refinement and discharge. The CEMP will include a Site Waste 
Management Plan (SWMP).   A SWMP will be prepared for use 
during the demolition and construction phase. This will ensure 
waste management provisions complement the demolition and 
construction activities on site and that wastes from the Project are 
dealt with in an appropriate manner and follow the waste 
hierarchy (placing waste prevention at the top and waste disposal 
at the foot of the hierarchy).  The SWMP will outline all waste 
types arising from the project, estimate quantities of each waste 
type and identify treatment. 
4.290 A Materials Management Plan (MMP) will form part of the CEMP 
and will be prepared for use during the demolition and 
construction phase, which will set out the requirements for storage 
of site-won materials on site to ensure that the environment is 
protected.  Typically this will involve creating an impermeable liner 
to place the material on and controls to ensure no losses of 
material from the stockpile except where reused. The MMP will 
also set out the acceptability criteria pertaining to reuse of site-
won materials. This will function to ensure that any materials 
designated for re-use are both chemically and geo-technically 
suitable and will not pose a risk to identified receptors [APP-019]. 
4.291 Asbestos present in the existing buildings at the Power Generation 
Plant Site which are to be demolished will be removed and 
disposed of by a suitably licensed asbestos contractor. All works 
would be subject to a detailed working method statement and 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
81
 
 
work would adhere to the “Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012” 
and associated guidance [APP-044]. 
4.292 All wastes generated as part of the operational phase will be 
handled and stored under appropriate waste management 
legislation, and substances handled during operational period 
would be managed under an appropriate spill response and site-
specific environmental management plan [APP-019]. 
4.293 There were no representations or evidence presented challenging 
the Applicant’s analysis and conclusions on the waste management 
impacts of this proposal. 
4.294 RCT and the Applicant agreed in the SoCG at Section 3.15 [REP-
031] that waste issues have been dealt with appropriately in the 
ES [APP-019]. 
4.295 Requirement 12 (1)(d) of the draft DCO [PD-018] requires a Site 
Waste Management Plan to be approved by RCT prior to the 
commencement of operation. 
Conclusion on Waste Management  
4.296 Given the evidence presented, the ExA considers that the issue of 
waste management has been addressed adequately and meets the 
requirements of NPS EN-1 and EN-2. 
 
Water quality and resources 
4.297 Section 5.15.5 of NPS EN-1 states: 
'The IPC will generally need to give impacts on the water 
environment more weight where a project would have an adverse 
effect on the achievement of the environmental objectives 
established under the Water Framework Directive.' 
4.298 Following consideration of the Relevant and Written 
Representations and LIRs, the ExA concluded that there was no 
requirement for an ISH devoted to Water Quality and Resource 
Impacts.  
4.299 In the case of the Project, water quality and resources issues have 
been detailed in Section 9 of the ES [APP-019] and the CEMP 
Appendix 4.1 [APP-020].  
4.300 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that all inland and 
coastal waters within defined river basin districts must reach at 
least ‘Good’ Status by 2015, and further defines how this should 
be achieved through the establishment of Environmental 
Objectives and Ecological Targets for surface waters.  As such it is 
essential that no works are carried out that could result in a

reduction of the WFD Status of affected watercourses / 
waterbodies and, if possible, any works along the watercourses / 
waterbodies should aim to improve the WFD Status where 
possible. 
4.301 As described in Section 9.5 of the ES [APP-019], the River 
Camnant / Sychryd is currently assessed to be at Moderate 
Ecological Status.  A section of this watercourse may be culverted 
beneath the Power Generation Plant Site, providing a potential 
pathway for contamination of the watercourse and a risk of 
structural damage to the culvert from construction of the Power 
Generation Plant. However, the combined effect of the embedded 
mitigation measures as outlined in paragraphs 9.4.15 – 9.4.20 of 
the ES [APP-019] and the specific mitigation measures outlined in 
section 9.8 should ensure that the potential impact is minimised. 
4.302 Under the Land Drainage Act 1991, as amended by the Flood and 
Water Management Act 2010, an Ordinary Water Consent (OWC) 
may be required from RCT [APP-044].  This may be required in 
relation to Work No. 2G in the Draft DCO (works likely to cause an 
obstruction to flow or restrict storage in connection with the 
existing culvert that underlies the Project Site.)  Due to survey 
limitations it has not been possible to establish sufficient 
information about those parts of the culvert lying within the site 
which is currently in use, to enable the draft DCO to take powers 
for OWC.   
4.303 For the above reasons, further details of the exact nature of the 
works is required before an application for OWC (including any 
necessary WFD assessment) can be made so this is not included in 
the DCO Application. 
4.304 RCT confirmed that the OWC requirements have been considered 
in the design of the Project to date [REP-031] and the Applicant 
will continue to engage with RCT to ensure the final design of any 
such works is compatible with OWC requirements. RCT confirmed 
that OWC consent will not be unreasonably withheld [REP-031]. 
4.305 Requirements 4, 8, 9 and 12 of the draft DCO [PD-018] put in 
place mechanisms to manage water quality and resources during 
design, construction and operation. 
Conclusion on water quality and resources 
4.306 The ExA considers that the water quality and resource issues have 
been addressed adequately and meets the requirements of NPS 
EN-1.

OVERALL CONCLUSION ON THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT 
4.307 The ExA concludes that whilst there are impacts of the scheme in 
terms of ecology and landscape and visual impact, the 
recommended draft DCO (Appendix D) contains sufficient 
measures to mitigate those impacts. It is concluded, therefore, 
that the benefits of this proposal would outweigh its impacts.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS IN RELATION TO HABITATS 
REGULATIONS  
INTRODUCTION 
5.1 
This Section of the report sets out analysis and findings relevant to 
Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA). 
5.2 
The application proposal engages the Habitats Directive, and the 
HRA process on the basis of its potential to adversely affect a 
number of European Sites and their features.   
5.3 
The European Sites relevant to this process are of the following 
type: 
 
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated pursuant to 
the Habitats Directive; 
5.4 
There are four broad stages for HRA (see advice provided in the 
Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 10: “Habitat Regulations 
Assessment relevant to nationally significant infrastructure 
projects”, where the process is set out in Figure 135). 
 
Screening: 
(i)
Deciding whether a project or proposal either alone or in 
combination with other plans or projects gives rise to a likely 
significant effect (LSE) on a European Site (or sites).  In 
determining whether there is an LSE, a precautionary test 
arising from the Waddenzee judgement should be applied36. 
 
Appropriate Assessment (AA): 
(ii)
Assessing whether, in view of the European Site’s 
conservation objectives, a project or proposal either alone or 
in combination with other plans or projects would risk an 
adverse effect on the integrity of the site. If it is found that it 
does not, the project or proposal may proceed37. 
 Consideration of Additional Requirements and 
(iii)
Alternatives: 
Steps that are only taken if a risk of adverse effect on 
integrity is found, under which mitigation of impacts and 
alternative solutions are reviewed. 
 If these steps do not have the effect of removing the risk of 
(iv)
adverse effect, then it becomes necessary to establish that 
the proposal and its acknowledged harm should proceed due 
to Imperative Reasons of Overriding Public Interest 
(IROPI) (including the provision of compensatory 
                                       
 
35 http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Advice-note-10-HRA.pdf  
36 European Court of Justice Case C-127/02 (the Waddenzee Judgment) which found “any plan or 
project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site is to be subject to an 
appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site’s conservation objectives if it 
cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective information, that it will have a significant effect on that 
site, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects”. 
37 The approach set out in the Waddenzee Judgement also applies to appropriate assessment.

measures). If IROPI and compensatory measures cannot be 
established the proposal should not proceed. 
5.5
When assessing a project, it is appropriate to take embedded 
mitigation that is provided for (see paras. 4.42- 4.44 of this 
report) in the application proposal and (where necessary) secured 
in the recommended DCO into account38.  It is an important part 
of the HRA process to identify LSEs which arise in combination 
with other projects or proposals39.   
5.6
The Examining Authority does not carry out an AA or any 
subsequent stage of assessment or decision making under HRA. 
This role is reserved to the SoS as the competent authority. 
However, the ExA have been mindful throughout the examination 
process of the need to ensure that the SoS has an adequate basis 
of information from which to carry out his duties as competent 
authority, informed by and compliant with the policy set out in 
NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.3.9 and NPS EN-3 paragraphs 2.6.58 to 
2.6.71. 
5.7
In accordance with the advice provided by PINS Advice Note 10, 
the ExA have adopted a standardised Planning Inspectorate 
procedure of drawing together all submitted evidence in respect of 
the HRA process into a Report on the Implications for European 
Sites (RIES) ([DEC-010]).  The RIES compiles, documents and 
signposts information provided within the DCO application, and 
the information submitted throughout the examination by both 
the Applicant and interested parties, up to the date of its release. 
The RIES was prepared and released on 22 October 2014.  
5.8
The Applicant accepts that project is not connected with or 
necessary to the management for nature conservation of any of 
the UK European sites considered within the assessment (see 
paragraph 5.2.2 of the Applicants No Significant Effects Report 
(NSER) [APP-045]).  As such it is clear that further consideration 
of the Project by way of a HRA screening is required40. 
PROJECT LOCATION 
5.9
The proposed development by Hirwaun Power Limited (the 
Applicant) is a new thermal generating station (hereafter referred 
to as the Power Generation Plant) on land at the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate, in Aberdare, South Wales (approximate grid 
reference SN 938 061). The site location and project red line

boundary is shown on the ES Figure 8. 1 [APP-027].  The site 
within which the Project is located is entirely within the 
administrative boundary of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough 
Council (RCT).  
5.10
The Applicant’s NSER [APP-045] identified the following UK 
European sites for which the UK is responsible for inclusion within 
the assessment:  
European Site 
Designated Features 
Blaen Cynon Special 
Area of Conservation 
Marsh fritillary butterfly Euphadryas 
(Eurodryas, Hypodryas) aurinia  
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte 
Special Area of 
Conservation  
Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and 
Blechnum in the British Isles 
Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes 
and ravines (priority feature)  
Cwm Cadlan Special 
Area of Conservation 
Molinia meadows on calcareous, 
peaty or clayey-silt laden soils 
(Molinion caeruleae)  
Alkaline fens 
5.11
NRW agree that the Applicant has considered all relevant 
European sites and features in their NSER [APP-045] report, in line 
with the guidance provided in the Environment Agency’s  
Horizontal Guidance (H1) Annex F (see NRW’s answer to the ExA  
first round question HA02 [REP-019]).  
5.12
These three sites are referred to collectively as the European 
Sites: 
Blaen Cynon SAC & Cors Bryn Y Gaer SSSI 
(i)
The Blaen Cynon SAC is located approximately 0.25 km north east 
from the site. 
Blaen Cynon contains an extensive complex of damp pastures and 
heaths supporting the largest meta-population of marsh fritillary 
(Euphydryas aurinia) on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons 
National Park (BBNP).   The Annex II primary qualifying feature 
and sole reason for the sites selection as an SAC is marsh fritillary 
butterfly. This SAC is considered to be the one of the best areas in 
the UK for marsh fritillary butterfly. The population of marsh 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
87
 
fritillary is considered to be between 501 and 1000 resident 
individuals41. 
The SAC encompasses an area of 66.81 ha and supports a variety 
of habitats. There are no Annex I habitats selected as the primary 
reason for selection or as a qualifying interest. The general site 
character of the SAC is made up of: 

humid grassland and mesophile grassland;

bogs, marshes, water fringed vegetation and fens;

dry grassland steppes;

heath, scrub, maquis and garrigue, phygrana;

improved grassland; and

broad-leaved deciduous woodland.
The Blaen Cynon SAC consists of two SSSIs (Cors Bryn-y-Gaer 
SSSI and the Woodland Park and Pontpren SSSI). 
Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI is of special interest42 for its lowland bog 
and for areas of soligenous flush, marshy grassland, dry neutral 
grassland and lowland acid grassland. These habitats occur in a 
complex with wet heath, swamp and semi-improved grassland. 
The site is also of special interest for the marsh fritillary butterfly 
Euphydryas aurinia. The site forms part of Blaen Cynon Special 
Area of Conservation.  The lowland raised bog feature is the most 
sensitive to the effects of nitrogen deposition and consequently 
has the lowest minimum critical load of the habitats present on 
site which is 5kg/N/ha/yr. 
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC 
(ii)
The Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC is located approximately 1.2 km 
north west from the site at its nearest point. 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte is an extensive area of woodland along a 
series of deeply incised valleys and ravines, situated to the north 
of Pontneddfechan in south Wales. The European (Annex I habitat) 
interests are the western sessile oak woodland and ash woodland. 
The whole site is biologically rich, with many woodland plant 
communities represented as well as a rich variety of ferns, lichens, 
mosses and liverworts. This SAC encompasses an area of 378.18 
ha43. 
 Cwm Cadlan SAC 
(iii)
The Cwm Cadlan SAC is located approximately 3 km north-north 
east from the site at its nearest point.

This SAC encompasses an area of 83.91 ha. Cwm Cadlan is a 
mosaic of wet grassland fields in a small valley to the north-west 
of Merthyr Tydfil.  Lime-rich waters flow through the reserve and 
sustain marshy grassland habitats, as well as a variety of 
specialised plants and animals. Marshy grassland and wetlands like 
this are now uncommon features of the wider countryside, with 
many areas having been drained and used for more intensive 
agriculture. 
There are two Annex I habitats identified as primary reasons for 
site selection, with no further qualifying interests. The two habitats 
are Molinia meadows on calcareous, peaty or clayey-silt-laden 
soils (Molinion caeruleae) and Alkaline Fens44. 
 
HRA IMPLICATIONS OF PROJECT   
5.13 
No direct disturbance or habitat loss will occur within the identified 
European sites as part of this proposed development.  However, 
the proposed development could have indirect impacts. Based on 
the information provided in Section 2 of this report, and within 
Appendix 2 of the Applicants NSER [APP-045] and the ExA RIES 
[DEC-010], it is possible to identify the potential indirect impacts 
that could result from the Project. 
5.14 
NRW agrees there are no direct impacts on any of the three 
European sites considered within the Applicant's screening 
assessment given the distance between the SAC sites and the 
development footprint [REP-019] [REP-036] [HR-017]. 
5.15 
The Applicant's assessment identifies varying potential for indirect 
impacts on the three SACs. [APP-045].  These are summarised 
below: 
 
Blaen Cynon SAC: changes in air quality (construction and 
operation), loss or disturbance of habitats outside the SAC 
potentially suitable to support marsh fritillary qualifying 
interest (temporary and permanent) and  hydrological effects 
(all stages of project); 
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC - changes in air quality 
(construction and operation), hydrological effects (all stages 
of project); and 
 
Cwm Cadlan SAC – changes in air quality (construction and 
operation), hydrological effects (all stages of project).

5.16
A Likely Significant Effect (LSE), has been explained by the 
European Court of Justice in the Waddenzee judgement45 (C-
127/02) as follows in paragraphs 47 and 45 respectively: 
'a) Significant: “Where a plan or project has an effect on that site 
but is not likely to undermine its conservation objectives, it cannot 
be considered likely to have a significant effect on that site”; and 
b) Likely: “if it cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective
information, that it will have a significant effect on the site...'. 
5.17
In response to questions from the ExA at the ISH of 24 September 
2014 the Applicant stated that they agree with the ExA’s 
Waddenzee definitions of ‘significant’ and ‘likely’ [HR-015, 
paragraph 5.6.1]. NRW also agreed with these definitions [HR-
016]. 
ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE PROJECT, 
ALONE AND IN COMBINATION  
5.18
There is agreement between NRW and the Applicant on the sites 
(and the features of those sites) that are likely to be significantly 
affected by the project (paragraphs 2.5.3 and 3.2 of the SoCG 
[REP-036]). 
5.19
There were no dissenting views from other interested parties. 
5.20
There was agreement between the Applicant and NRW on the 
baseline evidence (paragraphs 2.5 and 3.2 of the SoCG [REP-
036]). 
5.21
There were no dissenting views from other interested parties. 
5.22
There was agreement between the Applicant and NRW on the 
methodology used for assessing air quality effects (paragraph 3.2 
of the SoCG [REP-036]). 
5.23
There were no dissenting views from other interested parties. 
5.24
There are a range of environmental mitigation and monitoring 
measures included within the proposed design and development to 
ensure adverse impacts upon the environment are avoided (in the 
first instance) or minimised [APP-019][PD-018].

5.25 
Mitigation and monitoring measures proposed by the Applicant 
[APP-045] and directly relevant to the scope of potential effects 
described above include: 
 
The design has been significantly altered during the detailed 
design process, with the site red-line boundary being altered 
to avoid direct effects on wetland habitats within Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate SINC; 
 
Implementation of a CEMP secured via Requirement 12 in the 
draft DCO [PD-018]; 
 
Adherence to all relevant Environmental Permits, Best 
Practice Guidance / Regulations, British Standards, and 
monitoring in respect of air quality, noise and vibration, and 
water resources; 
 
Implementation of industry standard methods and 
procedures to ensure air quality impacts are minimised 
throughout all phases of the project [REP-019]; 
 
The 1.7 ha of the Hirwaun Common SINC affected by gas 
pipeline installation will be reinstated following installation of 
the pipeline; and 
 
A detailed Method Statement will be produced setting out 
how construction phase impacts on the SINC sites will be 
avoided or minimised and will be secured via Requirement 10 
- Ecological Management Plan in the draft DCO [PD-018]. 
5.26 
These measures were accepted by NRW [REP-036], BBNPA [REP-
035] and RCT [REP-031] and there were no dissenting views from 
other interested parties.  
5.27 
As a result of the screening assessment [APP-045], the Applicant 
concluded that the project is not likely to give rise to significant 
effects either alone or in combination,  on the European sites listed 
below: 
 
Blaen Cynon SAC; 
(i)
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC; and 
(ii)
 Cwm Cadlan SAC. 
(iii)
5.28 
The Applicant’s conclusions in relation to the effects on the 
designated features of Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC and Cwm 
Cadlan SAC were not disputed by any interested parties during the 
examination. 
 Effects from the Project alone 
5.29 
NRW stated in their written representations [REP-019] and SoCG 
[REP-036] that the effects  of aerial emissions, habitat 
loss/fragmentation and potential hydrological changes on the 
Blaen Cynon SAC, Coedydd  Nedd a Mellte SAC and Cwm Cadlan 
SAC would be negligible.  NRW came to this conclusion on the 
basis of the guidance in the Environment Agency Horizontal 
Guidance (H1) Annex F and the mitigation measures detailed in 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
91
 
 
paragraph 5.25 of this report, that there is no potential for likely 
significant effects from Hirwaun Power Station [REP-019].  No 
specific issues have been raised by interested parties in relation to 
other effects on these SACs.  
5.30 
The ExA in its first round of questions [DEC-006] addressed the 
adequacy of the Applicant's Stage 1 Screening assessment and 
conclusions [APP-045].  The ExA has no reasons to disagree with 
the Applicant's and NRW's conclusions regarding LSE on the 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC and Cwm Cadlan SAC. 
5.31 
The Applicant’s NSER [APP-045] states that the operation of the 
Hirwaun Power Plant has the potential to increase levels of 
nitrogen and acid deposition on the Blaen Cynon SAC, which could 
affect the broad habitat types used by marsh fritillary.  These 
changes could affect the various scabious species which are the 
larval food plant.  The air quality modelling undertaken by the 
Applicant demonstrated that, for a 30m stack, deposition onto 
suitable marsh fritillary habitats, alone would be less than 1% of 
the relevant critical load.  The modelling undertaken is stated by 
the Applicant to be precautionary in nature because it is based on 
the maximum annual operating hours for the project (1500 hours) 
rather than the 500 hours which is more likely.  Use of a 70% 
conversion factor of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen dioxide, while in 
line with EA guidance, is also argued to be precautionary.  The 
Applicant states that if recent trends in air quality continue this will 
also reduce the levels of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (see Hirwaun 
Power written representations [REP-030], Appendix 1, footnotes to 
Matrix 1, NSER Appendices 1 and 3 [APP-045]).  
5.32 
NRW advise that, on the basis of the Environment Agency’s H1 
Annex F guidance, V2.2 December, 2011, the emissions from the 
project alone will lead to increases in nitrogen deposition and acid 
deposition on the SAC which are insignificant.  Using the EPUK 
(2010) update guidance a process contribution of <1% is classed 
as imperceptible (see NRW's answer to question HA03 as part of 
their written representations, Annex A [REP-019]).   
5.33 
NRW initially raised concerns that the effect of the project would 
be to affect the opportunity for the Blaen Cynon SAC to return to 
favourable conservation status (see NRW Relevant 
Representations [RR-017]) but confirmed at the hearing [HR-016] 
that they felt that the contribution from the project alone would be 
so minute that it would not have any appreciable effect on the 
SAC. 
5.34 
NRW have highlighted the need for baseline monitoring of local air 
quality around the project site (NRW written representations, 
Annex A, Background Air Quality [REP-019]) and the Applicant has 
agreed to provide an air quality monitoring scheme secured 
through a Section 106 Agreement [REP-048].  Paragraphs 3 to 5 
(inclusive), Schedule 1 of the Section 106 Agreement and 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
92
 
 
paragraphs 1.4 to 1.5 (inclusive), Schedule 2 of the Section 106 
Agreement make provision for air quality monitoring in order to 
provide information on background concentrations of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) (including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide 
(NO)) over sensitive habitats in the Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI, to 
establish current and pre-operational baseline concentrations of 
these pollutants and determine temporal trends in their 
concentrations. The Applicant and NRW agree however that this is 
not intended as mitigation for effects on the Blaen Cynon SAC 
(NRW written summary of oral cases put at the specific issue 
hearing on environmental matters, 24 September 2014, responses 
to ExA questions OE06 and OE11[HR-016]). 
5.35 
Given the evidence presented, the ExA agrees with NRW and the 
Applicant that the project alone is not likely to give rise to any 
significant effects on the European sites. 
 
In combination effects 
5.36 
The Applicant has considered effects that are not significant alone, 
but could become significant when considered in combination with 
other plans or projects.  Agreement was reached between the 
NRW [REP-036], BBNPA [REP-035] and RCT [REP-031] and the 
Applicant on which plans or projects which should be considered 
for the in combination assessment with the project.  
5.37 
There were no dissenting views from any other interested parties 
on which projects to be included in the in combination assessment.  
5.38 
The following projects have been included in the in-combination 
assessment carried out by the Applicant [APP-045]: 
 
Rhigos Sub-station (RCTCBC planning reference 
10/0113/10). This comprises the construction of a sub-
station and one to two new towers with associated Overhead 
Lines (OHL); 
 
Green Frog 20MW liquid fuel power generation (RCTCBC 
planning reference 11/1191/10) This site comprises a series 
of diesel generators situated in an area of hardstanding south 
of Main Avenue, adjacent to the proposed Hirwaun gas 
connection; 
 
Enviroparks Energy from Waste Scheme (RCTCBC planning 
reference 08/1735/10); 
 
Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm (RCTCBC planning reference 
09/1311/04); 
 
Supermarket opposite Ferraris site (RCTCBC planning 
reference 12/0183/13); 
 
Dualling of A465 between Hirwaun and Abergavenny;


Extension of Selar open cast mine near Glynneath to extract
800,000 tonnes more material (Neath Port Talbot application
reference P/2013/720);

Hirwaun Energy Centre (RCTCBC planning reference
13/0416/10); and

Tower Open Cast Operation.
5.39
As a result of the screening assessment [APP-045], the Applicant 
concluded that the project is NOT likely to give rise to significant 
effects  in combination,  on the European sites listed below: 
 
Blaen Cynon SAC; 
(i)
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC; and 
(ii)
 Cwm Cadlan SAC. 
(iii)
5.40
The Applicant’s conclusions in relation to in-combination effects on 
the designated features of Coedydd  Nedd a Mellte SAC and Cwm 
Cadlan SAC were not disputed by any interested parties during the 
examination. 
5.41
NRW stated in their written representations [REP-019] and SoCG 
[REP-036] that the in combination effects of aerial emissions, on 
the Blaen Cynon SAC, Coedydd  Nedd a Mellte SAC and Cwm 
Cadlan SAC would be negligible.  NRW came to this conclusion on 
the basis of the guidance in the Environment Agency Horizontal 
Guidance (H1) Annex F and the mitigation measures detailed in 
paragraph 5.25 of this report, that there is no potential for likely in 
combination significant effects from Hirwaun Power Station [REP-
019].  No specific issues have been raised by other interested 
parties in relation to other effects on these SACs.  
5.42
The ExA in its first round of questions [DEC-006] addressed the 
adequacy of Applicants Stage 1 Screening assessment and 
conclusions [APP-045].  The ExA has no reasons to disagree with 
NRW's conclusions regarding LSE on the Coedydd  Nedd a Mellte 
SAC and Cwm Cadlan SAC.   
5.43
Given the evidence presented, the ExA agrees with NRW and the 
Applicant that the  project in combination will not give rise to any 
significant effects on the following European sites: 
 
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC; and 
(i)
 
Cwm Cadlan SAC.

imperceptible...as such it is considered that the project cannot 
contribute to a significant in-combination effect and no likely 
significant effects are predicted'. 
5.45
However, the ExA was not able to exclude likely significant effects 
from other projects in combination with the Project's nitrogen

emissions and acid deposition, on the Blaen Cynon SAC, because 
of the emissions levels detailed in Tables 6.24 and 6.25 of the ES 
[APP-019].   
5.46 
The ExA noted (Question HA19 [DEC-006]) that the Applicant's 
assessment for Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation shows 
that the in combination process contribution expressed as % 
critical load is substantially above 1% of critical load for both 
nitrogen deposition and acidification (see Tables 6.24 and 6.25 of 
the ES, [APP-019]).  Applying the criteria in Table 6.7 of the ES 
[APP-019] this would be classified as a “Substantial Adverse” 
effect. 
5.47 
The Applicant in its response [REP-030] to the ExA first round 
Question HA19 [DEC-006] stated: 
'In short, the Applicant's view is that the current situation is 
simply a case of other projects in the area giving rise to a likely 
significant in-combination effect but this Project, which does not 
make a perceptible contribution, is not part of that in combination 
effect. A common sense approach which recognises a de minimis 
threshold is supported by the Guidance and the AG's opinion in the 
Sweetman Case. To take a different view would involve holding 
parties responsible for impacts to which they make no material 
contribution which, to quote the AG in Sweetman, would be 
"legislative overkill.' 
5.48 
NRW confirmed it agrees with the conclusions of the NSER (SoCG 
paragraph 3.3 [REP-036]) regarding the in-combination LSE on 
the Blaen Cynon SAC. 
5.49 
The ExA queried NRW's46 advice to the AA for Enviropark Hirwaun 
Ltd 2009 submitted by Brecon Beacons National Park Authority 
(BBNPA) at Appendix I of [REP-026].  Enviropark Hirwaun Ltd 
(which is part of this Project's in combination assessment, see 
paragraph 5.38 of this report) was assessed to have had LSE 
alone, thereby triggering an AA.  NRW stated in its summary of its 
oral case put at the HRA hearing of the 24 September 2014 [HR-
016]: 
'NRW pointed out that the model output in section 3.1.1 of the 
Enviroparks Appropriate Assessment predicted output 
contributions in excess of 1% from Enviroparks which appeared to 
have led BBNPA to conclude that there were likely significant 
effects arising from that project alone [HR-016].  In 2009 the 
Environment Agency could not exclude the possibility of 
likely significant effects arising from the Enviroparks 
project, and that is why an appropriate assessment was 
                                       
 
46 NRW was formed in April 2013, largely taking over the functions of the Countryside Council for 
Wales, Forestry Commission Wales and the Environment Agency in Wales, as well as certain Welsh 
Government functions.

undertaken47.  However, the advice from EA was that there were 
technical solutions which could be imposed that would reduce 
emissions to an acceptable level (in the latter part of paragraph 
3.1.1. of the appropriate assessment).' 
5.50 
It remained the view of the Applicant, supported by NRW 
consultation and examination responses, that the Project will 
result in no LSE, either alone or in combination with other plans or 
projects. 
5.51 
The ExA explained in the Issue Specific Hearing of 24 September 
2014 [HR-017] that the evidential bar to identify a Likely 
Significant Effect, and so trigger the need for an AA, is very low48.  
At paragraph 49 of "Sweetman"49  it states: 
'The threshold at the first stage of Article 6(3) is thus a very low 
one. It operates merely as a trigger50, in order to determine 
whether an appropriate assessment must be undertaken of the 
implications of the plan or project for the conservation objectives 
of the site. The purpose of that assessment is that the plan or 
project in question should be considered thoroughly, on the basis 
of what the Court has termed ‘the best scientific knowledge in the 
field’. 
5.52 
The Applicant responded that in light of the discussion at the 
Hearing, the Applicant would be willing, if directed, to prepare a 
report to inform an AA [HR-015].  The Applicant however 
maintained the position that the Project would not give rise to any 
Likely Significant Effects that requires the Applicant to consider the 
need to provide information to support an AA of the Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.  
 
OVERALL CONCLUSIONS ON THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTS 
RESULTING FROM THE PROJECT, ALONE AND IN 
COMBINATION 
5.53 
It is for the competent authority, in this case the SoS, to 
determine whether or not an AA should be carried out before a 
decision is made on the Project.  The ExA therefore requested at 
the ISH on EIA/HRA that the Applicant provide a HRA Report which 
included information to support an AA.  This was to assist the ExA 
in making their recommendations and the SoS to undertake an 
Appropriate Assessment should that be deemed necessary [HR-
017].

5.54 
In the ExA's view the evidence presented in the examination does 
not allow the conclusion that there would be no likely significant 
effects on Blaen Cynon SAC as a result of the combined aerial 
emissions from the Project and other developments in the vicinity.  
Therefore the site and feature detailed in paragraph 5.12(i) of this 
report (Blaen Cynon SAC), has been taken forward to Stage 2 of 
the HRA process (as summarised in the RIES integrity matrices 
[DEC-010]). 
5.55 
The ExA has reached this view because: 
 
A project with a potential effect, which is insignificant on its 
(i)
own, is not free from the provisions of the Habitats 
Regulations until it has been checked in combination with the 
effects of other projects. Some projects may be unlikely to 
have significant effects on their own but effects in 
combination with other projects may be significant.  The 
protective measures of the Directive could be seriously 
undermined if these combinations of projects escaped 
assessment  [HR-017]; 
 
The Applicants assessment for Blaen Cynon Special Area of 
(ii)
Conservation shows that the in-combination process 
contribution expressed as % critical load is substantially 
above 1% of critical load for both nitrogen deposition and 
acid deposition (see Tables 6.24 and 6.25 of the ES, [APP-
019]).  Applying the criteria in Table 6.7 of the ES [APP-019] 
this would be classified as a “Substantial Adverse” effect  i.e. 
a likely significant effect; and 
 The AA for Enviropark Hirwaun Ltd 2009 submitted by Brecon 
(iii)
Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA) at Appendix I of 
[REP-026], was assessed to have had LSE alone, thereby 
triggering an AA.  Enviropark Hirwaun Ltd is part of this 
project's in combination assessment (see paragraph 5.38 of 
this report). The ExA adopting a "precautionary" approach", 
believes if it triggered an AA alone in 2009, it should be 
assumed that in combination with this project it triggers an 
AA now. 
 
CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES  
5.56 
European Site Conservation Objectives are those referred to in the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (the 
“Habitats Regulations”) and Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive 
1992. They are relevant for use when either the appropriate 
nature conservation body or competent authority is required to 
make an AA under the relevant parts of the legislation.  
5.57 
These conservation objectives are set for each designated 
habitat/species/ bird feature for a SAC and a SPA. Where the 
objectives are met, the site can be said to demonstrate a high

degree of integrity and the site itself makes a full contribution to 
achieving the aims of the Habitats and Birds Directive for those 
features.  
5.58 
Paragraph 5.12(i) of this report, identifies the qualifying features 
of the Blaen Cynon SAC which are relevant to the assessment of 
effects on integrity of the site. 
5.59 
The Conservation Objectives51 for Blaen Cynon SAC, Site Code: 
UK0030092,  for Feature 1: Marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas 
(Eurodryas, Hypodryas) aurinia (EU Species Code: 1065) are: 
"The vision for this feature is for it to be in a favourable 
conservation status, where all of the following conditions are 
satisfied: 
 
The site will contribute towards supporting a sustainable 
metapopulation of the marsh fritillary in the 
Penderyn/Hirwaun area. This will require a minimum of 
50ha of suitable habitat, of which at least 10ha must 
be in good condition, although not all is expected to be 
found within the SAC. Some will be on nearby land 
within a radius of about 2km.52 
 
The population will be viable in the long term, acknowledging 
the extreme population fluctuations of the species. 
 
A minimum of 30% of the total site area will be grassland 
suitable for supporting marsh fritillary. (As the total area of 
the SAC is 66.62 ha, 30% represents approximately 20 ha.) 
At least 40% of the suitable habitat (approximately 8 ha) 
must be in optimal condition for breeding marsh fritillary. 
 
Suitable marsh fritillary habitat is defined as stands of 
grassland where Succisa pratensis is present and where scrub 
more than 1 metre tall covers no more than 10% of the 
stands. 
 
Optimal marsh fritillary breeding habitat will be characterised 
by grassland where the vegetation height is 10-20 cm, with 
abundant purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea, frequent 
“large-leaved” devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis suitable 
for marsh fritillaries to lay their eggs and only occasional 
scrub. In peak years, a density of 200 larval webs per 
hectare of optimal habitat will be found across the site."

FINDINGS IN RELATION TO EFFECTS ON THE INTEGRITY OF 
EUROPEAN SITES  
5.60 
The ExA has identified the potential for an LSE on the feature of 
Blaen Cynon SAC i.e. Marsh fritillary butterfly Euphadryas 
(Eurodryas, Hypodryas) aurinia. This Section summarises the 
anticipated effects on the integrity of the Blaen Cynon SAC, in the 
context of their conservation objectives (see paragraphs 5.56-5.59 
of this report). 
5.61 
The matrices in Section 5 of the RIES [DEC-010] and the 
comments made on them by the Applicant are discussed in 
paragraphs 5.7, 5.13, 5.54 and 5.69 of this report. The Applicant 
considers that generally the RIES represents a fair summary of the 
implications of the Project on European sites [REP-047].  
5.62 
There is agreement between NRW and the Applicant on the sites 
(and the feature of the European site) that are likely to be 
significantly affected by the project (paragraphs 2.5 and 3.2 of the 
SoCG) [REP-036]. 
5.63 
There were no dissenting views from other interested parties. 
5.64 
There was agreement between the Applicant and NRW on the 
baseline evidence (paragraphs 2.5 and 3.2 of the SoCG) [REP-
036]. 
5.65 
There were no dissenting views from other interested parties. 
5.66 
There was agreement between the Applicant and NRW on the 
assessment methodology (paragraph 3.2 of the SoCG) [REP-036]. 
5.67 
There were no dissenting views from other interested parties. 
5.68 
There are a range of environmental mitigation and monitoring 
measures included within the proposed design and development 
(see paragraph 5.25 of this report) to ensure adverse impacts 
upon the environment are avoided (in the first instance) or 
minimised [APP-019][PD-012]. 
5.69 
Following the ISH on 24 September 2014, in response to questions 
from the ExA, the Applicant offered to provide an assessment of 
the effects on the integrity of Blaen Cynon SAC [HR-015].  The 
Applicant concluded that the project will NOT adversely affect the 
integrity of the  Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation  i.e. 
Marsh fritillary butterfly Euphadryas (Eurodryas, Hypodryas) 
aurinia, either alone or in combination with other plans/projects 
[HR-015] and in the revised integrity matrices submitted on 10 
October 2014 [DEC-010] concluded no likely adverse effects on 
any European sites. 
5.70 
The evidence to support this conclusion was the subject of the 
ExA's second round of questions on HRA matters issued on the 22 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
99
 
 
October 2014 [DEC-009].  The Applicants responses can be found 
at [REP-045]. 
5.71 
The Applicant's updated air quality assessment for the in-
combination effects on Blaen Cynon SAC has been revised in light 
of information that has become available in the course of the 
examination regarding two projects which are part of the in 
combination assessment [HR-015]: 
 
Enviroparks and 
(i)
 
Hirwaun Energy Centre.  
(ii)
5.72 
NRW stated in its summary of its oral case put at the HRA hearing 
of the 24 September 2014 [HR-016]: 
'NRW pointed out that the model output in section 3.1.1 of the 
Enviroparks Appropriate Assessment predicted output 
contributions in excess of 1% from Enviroparks which appeared to 
have led BBNPA to conclude that there were likely significant 
effects arising from that project alone [HR-016]...  However, the 
advice from EA was that there were technical solutions which 
could be imposed that would reduce emissions to an acceptable 
level (in the latter part of paragraph 3.1.1. of the appropriate 
assessment).' 
5.73 
In the Applicant’s view, the contribution of the Enviroparks 
development is likely to be limited so that contributions to 
nitrogen and acid deposition are likely to be less than 1% over 
any European site [HR-015].  
5.74 
The original planning application for Hirwaun Energy Centre has 
been amended to reduce its emissions and this has been reflected 
in an environmental statement addendum which was submitted to 
Rhondda Cynon Taff County Borough Council in July 201453.  The 
Applicant has updated their air quality modelling to reflect this 
[HR-015].  The new modelling shows significant reductions in, in 
combination air quality effects compared with the Applicant’s 
original assessment.  In addition, the Applicant re-stated the 
position that the contribution from the project to nitrogen and 
acid deposition will be imperceptible. 
5.75 
The updated modelling carried out by the Applicant [HR-015] 
predicts that the operation of the in combination assessment 
projects will contribute a minimum critical load for acid deposition 
as follows: 
 
5.5% from Green Frog; 
 
0.75% from Hirwaun Energy Centre;

Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
100
 
 
 
0.75% from Enviroparks; and  
 
0.3% from the Hirwaun Power Project.  
Combined this leads to a maximum deposition of up to 7.3% of 
the minimum critical load, although the Applicant expects that 
average annual deposition would be less than this.  Acid 
deposition from the project varies between 0.1% and 0.3% of 
minimum critical load for acid deposition. 
5.76 
For nitrogen the updated modelling predicts an in combination 
deposition of up to 1.6% of minimum critical load for the worst of 
the 5 years modelled (2008-2012).  In the Applicant’s view, the 
conservative approach used in the project air quality modelling 
will mean that actual deposition from the project is very likely to 
be lower (see NRW and Applicant's response to ExA second round 
questions HA2-08 and HA2-09 [REP-044] and [REP-045]).  The 
Green Frog plant also generates infrequently with expected 
operating hours up to 100 hours per year and its short-term 
inputs into annual levels of sulphur are, in the Applicant’s view, 
likely to be overstated by the air quality model.  The HRA Report 
[HR-015] concluded (as summarised in 5.3.4 - 5.3.10) that there 
will be no in-combination adverse effect on the integrity of any 
European site.  
5.77 
NRW agreed with the report's conclusions in their SoCG [REP-
036].  Paragraph 3.2.6 of the SoCG states: 
'[b]oth Parties AGREE as stated in the report to support an 
Appropriate Assessment that the Project will not lead to an 
adverse effect on the integrity of any European sites, either alone 
or in-combination with other developments.'  
5.78 
Table 4.2 of the Applicant’s HRA Report [HR-015] predicts: 
 
'a maximum deposition of 7.3% of minimum critical load for 
the in-combination acid deposition; and 
 
 'a maximum in-combination of up to 1.6% of minimum 
critical load” for the in-combination nitrogen deposition.'  
5.79 
Table 6.7 of the Environmental Statement [APP-019] would 
classify these as a moderate/slight adverse in combination effects 
on the integrity of the Blaen Cynon SAC.  
5.80 
The Applicant agrees in its response to ExA question HA2-08, that 
inputting the figures from Table 4.2 of the HRA Report into Table 
6.7 of the Environmental Statement [APP-019] would appear to 
identify a moderate/slight likely adverse effect for the purposes of 
the ES. However, the Applicant does not agree that: 
 
this is an appropriate application of the Environmental 
(i)
Protection UK (EPUK) guidance; or 
 
as set out in the HRA Report, that this means there is an 
(ii)
adverse in combination effect on the integrity of the Blaen 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
101
 
 
Cynon SAC.  
5.81 
NRW agrees, with reference to Table 6.7 of the Environmental 
Statement [APP-019], with the classification of the maximum 
deposition figures as moderate / slight adverse in combination 
effects on Blaen Cynon SAC (response to ExA question HA2-09 
[REP-044]). 
5.82 
NRW do not consider that the nitrogen or acid deposition from the 
Hirwaun Power Station would hinder the return of Blaen Cynon 
SAC to favourable conservation status because the predicted 
contribution is so minute that it would not have any appreciable 
effect on the SAC or its return to favourable conservation status 
(response to ExA question HA2-09 [REP-044]). 
5.83 
In addition the Applicant is of the opinion that land management 
mitigation secured by Requirement 10 of the draft DCO will result 
in sufficient positive benefits to the marsh fritillary population 
associated with the Blaen Cynon SAC, to confirm that the Project 
will result in a slight net benefit [PD-018] [HR-015].  The 
Applicant considers that, taking account of the Project’s potential 
worst case contribution to nitrogen/acid deposition, the proposed 
land management measures associated with the Project will have 
a net positive impact on the SAC. 
5.84 
The ExA believes that the land management measures focus on 
the habitat for the designated feature (not the designated feature 
itself). These measures are considered to be effective mitigation 
of any impacts on the marsh fritillary butterfly itself because the 
net suitable habitat available to the designated feature would 
increase (see paragraph 5.59 of this report). This position was 
supported by RCT Ecologist Richard Wistow at the EIA/HRA ISH 
[HR-017].   
 
CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS AND IROPI 
5.85 
The ExA provided the Applicant with the opportunity to detail its 
consideration of alternatives and IROPI in its second round of 
questions (Question HA2-12 [DEC-009]. The Applicant provided 
their response in [REP-045] for concluding:  
 
there are no alternative solutions; 
(i)
 
IROPI applies; and  
(ii)
 that satisfactory compensatory measures are available.  
(iii)
 
5.86 
The Applicant has prepared a NSER [APP-045] which concludes 
that the Project will not result in a likely significant effect on any 
European sites alone or in combination and this conclusion is 
supported by NRW (see paragraph 3.3.1 of the NRW SoCG) [REP-
036].  Following the environmental matters ISH [HR-017], the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
102
 
 
Applicant has also prepared a HRA Report [HR-015] in the event 
the SoS considers there was potential for a likely significant effect. 
The HRA Report concludes there will not be an adverse effect on 
the Blaen Cynon SAC alone or in combination and this conclusion 
is, again, supported by NRW (see paragraph 3.2.6 of the NRW 
SoCG [REP-036]).  
5.87 
The Applicant's position, supported by NRW, is that Regulation 62 
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (the 
"Habitats Regulations") is not engaged.  As such, it is not 
necessary or appropriate to conclude on the three tests identified 
in paragraph 5.85. Given that the Project has an imperceptible 
effect on the Blaen Cynon SAC – and taking account of the 
secured ecological enhancement measures which will have a net 
positive impact on the designated feature, the marsh fritillary 
butterfly – these tests are not applicable in the context of the 
Project. 
5.88 
However, to assist the ExA and to answer the question asked as 
far as possible, the Applicants response [REP-045] summarised 
below some of the key points which could be made in relation to 
each of the three tests (Question HA2-12 [DEC-009]) if the Project 
were to have a significant adverse effect on a European site as 
follows: 
 
Alternative Solutions  
(i)
The Applicant's parent company Watt Power Limited carried out a 
wide search throughout England and Wales to identify sites which 
are suitable for the development of gas-fired peaking plants such 
as the Project and the Project site was one of a small number 
identified as the most suitable. Proximity to sensitive ecological 
habitats was a key consideration in the site selection process. 
Alternative generation technologies were also fully and robustly 
considered and all appropriate mitigation measures are secured in 
the draft DCO [PD-018].  
A more detailed description of the alternatives considered for the 
Project is set out in section 5 of the Environmental Statement 
[APP-019] and the mitigation secured for the project in the draft 
DCO [PD-018]. 
 
 
IROPI Applies  
(ii)
A secure, economical, efficient and low-carbon energy source is an 
imperative of overriding public importance for reasons including 
maintaining human health, public safety and environmental 
protection as well as because such an energy source is 
fundamental to the sustainable development of our economy.  
The vital role of gas-fired generating stations in the UK energy mix 
is widely acknowledged in Government policy. Particular emphasis 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
103
 
 
is placed in Government policy on the increasing need for gas-fired 
peaking plants, like the Project. Gas-fired peaking plants meet 
peak demand and balance out intermittent low-carbon sources of 
generation (much of which is found in Wales and in RCT) thus 
playing a vital role in our transition to a low-carbon economy.  EN-
1 states at paragraph 3.6.1 that: 
'Fossil fuel power stations play a vital role in providing reliable 
electricity supplies: they can be operated flexibly in response to 
changes in supply and demand, and provide diversity in our 
energy mix. They will continue to play an important role in our 
energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon 
economy...'.  
A more detailed description of the need for, and policy support for, 
the Project is set out in section 4 of the Planning Statement [APP-
040].  
 Compensatory Measures  
(iii)
As identified in the Applicant's response to the ExA second round 
question HA2-07 [REP-045], the Applicant's proposals already 
secure ecological enhancement measures which the Applicant 
considers will result in a minor net beneficial effect on the 
designated feature associated with the Blaen Cynon SAC. 
Therefore no compensatory measures would be necessary, 
appropriate or proportionate54.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
5.89 
The Applicant has undertaken an extensive, precautionary and 
rigorous HRA evaluation in its application documentation and has 
supported this by undertaking the additional work requested of it 
during the examination.  The Applicant has also engaged 
effectively and taken careful account of extensive advice from the 
Statutory Nature Conservation Body i.e. NRW, which has 
substantially assisted the examination process. 
5.90 
The potential for adverse effects on site integrity arising from the 
application proposal on three European Sites has been tested.  
This has led to undisputed conclusions that the application 
proposal will not lead to effects on site integrity, alone or in 
combination on the following two European Sites: 
 
Coedydd  Nedd a Mellte SAC and  
(i)
                                       
 
54 The ExA believes the enhancement measures proposed would avoid or reduce potential effects from 
the project and as such they qualify as mitigation. However,  if these measures are being taken into 
account when effects on site integrity are being considered, and the conclusion is that site integrity 
would not be adversely affected then they cannot be considered at the compensatory measures stage 
also.

(ii)
5.91 
However, there was one European Site in respect of which there 
were outstanding disputed conclusions about in combination 
effects on site integrity: 
 
Blaen Cynon SAC i.e. Marsh fritillary butterfly Euphadryas 
(Eurodryas, Hypodryas) aurinia. 
5.92 
The ExA, through the review of representations, two rounds of 
questions and a hearing in respect of HRA matters, found that 
there will be no effect on integrity, either alone or in combination.   
5.93 
The ExA believes that the conservation objectives for the Blaen 
Cynon SAC European Site will not be significantly affected by the 
project because of: 
 
The mitigation measures secured by Requirements in the 
(i)
draft DCO [PD-018]. The land management measures focus 
on the habitat for the designated feature (not the designated 
feature itself). These measures are considered to be effective 
mitigation of any impacts on the marsh fritillary butterfly 
itself because the net suitable habitat available to the 
designated feature would increase.  These mitigation 
measures will ensure the avoidance of the deterioration of 
the habitats of the qualifying features, and the significant 
disturbance of the qualifying features, ensuring the integrity 
of the site is maintained.  Requirement 10 [PD-018] 
ecological management plan measures associated with the 
Project will have an indirect slight net positive impact on the 
SAC; 
 
The residual impacts of “a maximum deposition of 7.3% of 
(ii)
minimum critical load” for the in combination acid deposition; 
and  “a maximum in-combination of up to 1.6% of minimum 
critical load” for the in-combination nitrogen deposition will 
not be significant and  
 NRW do not consider that the nitrogen or acid deposition 
(iii)
from the Hirwaun Power Station would hinder the return of 
Blaen Cynon SAC to favourable conservation status because 
the predicted contribution is so minute that it would not have 
any appreciable effect on the SAC or its return to favourable 
conservation status. 
5.94 
The ExA believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that an 
adverse effect on the integrity of Blaen Cynon SAC will be avoided.

THE REQUEST FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION (CA) 
POWERS AND OTHER POWERS 
6.3 
The Applicant is seeking Compulsory Acquisition (CA) powers to 
secure certain lands, rights and interests within the Order Land to 
facilitate the Project [APP-051].  
6.4 
The Order Land covers an area of approximately 13.59ha and 
comprises the land required for the: 
 
Power Generation Plant; 
 
Gas Connection; and 
 
Electrical Connection. 
6.5 
The area required by the Power Generation Plant extends to 
6.56ha (the total area shown coloured pink on the Power 
Generation Plant Land Plan [PD-020]), is divided by Main Avenue 
and is accessed by public and adopted highways within the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate. The Book of Reference dated November 
2014 [APP-055] identifies seven plots in which the Applicant 
applies to acquire ‘all interests’ i.e. Freehold to be compulsorily 
acquired and in relation to which it is proposed to extinguish 
easements, servitudes and other private rights.  These plots are 
1_MS, 2_MS, 3_MS, 4_MS, 5_MS, 6_MS and 7_MS. These plots 
cover the Power Generation Plant, Main Site area and relate to 
works 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F and 2G. As such, they constitute 
land which is required for the development to which the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
106
 
 
development consent relates or is required to facilitate that 
development.  
6.6 
The Gas Connection route has an approximate length of 0.9 km 
and its direction and width varies to account for natural and man 
made features along the route, but generally provides for a 
working width of up to 50m (the permanent easement width being 
sought is generally 10m whereas the construction footprint 
required would be of the order of 30m in width on agricultural land 
but wider at crossing points). 
6.7 
The Book of Reference dated 3 December 2014 [APP-055] and 
Land Plans [PD-020] identifies thirty plots in which the Applicant 
applies to acquire land or rights for the gas connection: 
 
Freehold to be compulsorily acquired and in relation to which 
it is proposed to extinguish easements, servitudes and other 
private rights.  These plots are 10_GR and 11_GR.  These 
plots cover the Above Ground Installation (AGI) and relate to 
numbered works 4A; 
 
New rights to be compulsorily acquired and in relation to 
which it is proposed to extinguish easements, servitudes and 
other private rights. These plots are 1_GR, 2_GR, 3_GR, 
4_GR, 5_GR, 6_GR, 7_GR, 8_GR and 9_GR.  These plots 
cover the new underground gas pipeline and relate to 
numbered works 3; and 
 
Temporary use of land and in relation to which it is proposed 
to temporarily suspend easements, servitudes and other 
private rights. These plots are 1a_GR, 1b_GR, 2a_GR, 
3a_GR, 3b_GR, 4a_GR, 4b_GR, 5a_GR, 6a_GR, 6b_GR, 
6c_GR, 7a_GR, 7b_GR, 8a_GR, 8b_GR, 9a_GR, 9b_GR, 
10a_GR and 11a_GR.  These plots cover the new 
underground gas pipeline and relate to numbered works 3, 
4A and 4B. 
6.8 
Article 27 (Temporary use of land for carrying out the authorised 
development) seeks to authorise temporary possession of land 
(which is not a compulsory acquisition power)  for the purpose 
inter alia of providing a working width and construction site on 
plots as listed above (see para. 6.114 of this report). Article 27 
would authorise the applicant both to enter on and take temporary 
possession of the land but also to construct temporary or 
permanent works (subject to conditions including to reinstate and 
compensation). 
6.9 
The Electrical Connection extends to 0.59ha and is 
approximately 686m in length. The cable would run from the 
Power Generation Plant and lie within estate roads and pavements 
to the south and west of the area required for the Power 
Generation Plant, extending into the Rhigos Substation currently 
being built by National Grid.

6.10 
The Book of Reference dated December 2014 [APP-055] and Land 
Plans [PD-020] identifies six plots in which the Applicant applies to 
acquire: 
 
New rights to be compulsorily acquired and in relation to 
which it is proposed to extinguish easements, servitudes and 
other private rights. These plots are 1_ER, 2_ER, 3_ER, 
4_ER, 5_ER and 6_ER.  These plots cover the new 
underground 400kV electrical cable and relate to numbered 
works 5.  
6.11 
The land over which CA powers are sought in respect of the 
freehold is shown edged red and shaded pink on the Land Plans 
[PD-020]. This land is described in more detail, together with the 
reason for the acquisition, in Table 1, at paragraph 6.3.1 of the 
Statement of Reasons [APP-051].  Article 17 of the DCO is relied 
upon in respect of this land.  
6.12 
The land over which permanent rights and interests are being 
compulsory sought is shown edged red and shaded blue on the 
Land Plans [PD-020].  This land is described in more detail, 
together with the reason for the permanent right and/or interest 
being sought, in Table 2, at paragraph 6.4.2 of the Statement of 
Reasons [APP-051].  Article 21 of the DCO is relied upon in respect 
of these rights and interests.  
6.13 
The land over which temporary use is sought (this is not a CA 
power) is shown edged red and shaded yellow on the Land Plans 
[PD-020].  This land is described in more detail, together with the 
reason for the use being sought, in Table 3, at paragraph 6.5.2 of 
the Statement of Reasons [APP-051].  Articles 27 and 28 of the 
DCO are relied upon in respect of this land.  
6.14 
There are various matters which affect the Order Land and which 
the Applicant requires to suspend or extinguish in order to 
facilitate the Project. The matters are each described on a plot by 
plot basis, together with the reasoning why the matters need to be 
suspended or extinguished, in Table 4 at paragraph 6.6.2 of the 
Statement of Reasons [APP-051].  Articles 11 (Extinguishment of 
public rights of way), 19 (Statutory authority to override 
easements and other rights) and 22 (Private rights) of the DCO 
are relied upon in respect of these matters.  
6.15 
The Project will also interfere with the following publically adopted 
highways:  
 
Main Avenue affected by temporary use and permanent 
rights acquisition and/or creation for Gas Connection works 
and Electrical Connection works;  
 
Fourteenth Avenue affected by temporary use and permanent 
rights acquisition and/or creation for Electrical Connection 
works; 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project

 
Rhigos Road affected by temporary use and permanent rights 
acquisition and/or creation for Gas Connection works;  
 
The A4061 affected by temporary use and permanent rights 
acquisition and/or creation for Gas Connection works; and  
 
An un-named public footpath connecting Rhigos Road with 
Main Avenue affected by temporary use and permanent 
rights acquisition and/or creation for Gas Connection works.  
6.16 
The Applicant is not seeking formal rights of acquisition or new 
rights over the highways but is relying on Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, 
26, and 27 of the DCO [PD-018] in relation to street works to 
enter onto them and to lay and maintain apparatus in them, to 
construct means of access and to create temporary prohibitions 
and restrictions of the use of such streets to carry out such works. 
6.17 
In summary the CA powers sought are:  
 
to acquire the freehold;  
 
to acquire new rights over land; and  
 
to extinguish and/or override existing rights.  
6.18 
These powers are referred to collectively in this Section as the CA 
powers, save where the context requires otherwise. 
6.19 
The draft DCO [PD-018] seeks to incorporate the provisions of the 
Compulsory Purchase (General Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 
(Article 23) and the provisions set out in s.158 of the Act relating 
to the statutory authority and protection given to override 
easements and other rights (Article 19).  
 
THE LEGISLATIVE AND GUIDANCE CONTEXT 
The Requirements of the Planning Act 2008 (PA2008) 
6.20 
CA powers can only be granted if the conditions set out in sections 
122 and 123 of the Planning Act 2008 are met. DCLG has issued 
guidance on compulsory acquisition procedures55  (DCLG 
Guidance). 
6.21 
Section 122 (2) requires that the land must be either (a) required 
for the development to which the development consent relates or 
(b) is required to facilitate or incidental to the development.  As to 
(a), the DCLG Guidance states that, the land to be taken must be 
no more than is reasonably required, and as to (b) and the land 
take must be reasonably for the purpose and be proportionate.56

56 Guidance related to procedures for compulsory acquisition DCLG September 2013 Paragraph 11 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State

109
 
 
6.22 
Section 122(3) requires that there must be a compelling case in 
the public interest which means that the public benefit derived 
from the compulsory acquisition must outweigh the private loss 
that would be suffered by those whose land is acquired.   
6.23 
Section 123 requires that one of three conditions is met by the 
proposal57. The ExA is satisfied that the condition in s.123 (2) is 
met because the application for the DCO included a request for 
compulsory acquisition of the land to be authorised. 
6.24 
A number of general considerations also have to be addressed 
either as a result of following applicable guidance or in accordance 
with legal duties on decision-makers: 
 
all reasonable alternatives to compulsory acquisition must be 
explored; 
 
the Applicant must have a clear idea of how it intends to use 
the land and to demonstrate funds are available; and 
 
the decision-maker must be satisfied that the purposes 
stated for the acquisition are legitimate and sufficiently justify 
the inevitable interference with the human rights of those 
affected. 
 
HOW THE EXA EXAMINED THE CASE FOR COMPULSORY 
ACQUISITION  
6.25 
The ExA examined the case for compulsory acquisition through: 
 
Identifying CA, including issues related to:  
 
the requirement for the powers sought; 
 
the need to establish a compelling case in the public 
interest; and 
 
financial arrangements as a principal issue [DEC-004]; 
 
Specific questions on compulsory acquisition (questions CA01 
– CA19) in the first round of written questions issued on 29 
July 2014 [DEC-006]; 
 
Specific questions on compulsory acquisition (questions CA2- 
01 – CA2-02) in the second round of written questions issued 
on 22 October 2014 [DEC-009];  
 
Specific questions on compulsory acquisition (questions CA3-
01 – CA3-02) in the third round of written questions issued 
on 9 January 2015 [DEC-011]; and 
                                       
 
57 (1) An order granting development consent may include provision authorising the compulsory 
acquisition of land only if the Secretary of State is satisfied that one of the conditions in subsections 
(2) to (4) is met. 
(2) The condition is that the application for the order included a request for compulsory acquisition of 
the land to be authorised. 
(3) The condition is that all persons with an interest in the land consent to the inclusion of the 
provision. 
(4) The condition is that the prescribed procedure has been followed in relation to the land.

 
Holding a Compulsory Acquisition Hearing on 24 September 
2014 [HR-013]. 
ADEQUACY OF FUNDING 
6.26 
In considering the adequacy of funding, the ExA had regard to EN-
1, in particular para. 4.19 and to the DCLG Guidance, published in 
September 2013, in particular, paras. 9, 17 and 18. 
6.27 
The application documents submitted on 21 March 2014 included a 
fifty page Funding Statement [APP-036] and the adequacy, source 
and availability of the funding required for both acquiring the land 
and implementing the project for which the land is required was 
addressed in the ExA’s first written questions (CA-18 and CA-19 
[DEC-006]) and in the 24 September 2013 CA hearing [HR-013]. 
6.28 
The adequacy of funding was not raised by any affected persons or 
other interested parties during the course of the examination. 
The funding required for implementing the project 
6.29 
The current cost estimate for the Project is approximately £200m. 
This cost estimate includes demolition and construction costs, 
development costs since 2011, project management costs, 
financing costs and land acquisition costs [APP-036]. 
6.30 
The Applicant believes that through Noble Clean Fuels Ltd (NCFL) 
and Noble Group Limited58, it has the ability to procure the 
financial resources necessary to fund the works to be authorised 
by the Order, subject to final Board authority of Nobel Group 
Limited. Following approval of Noble Group Limited to fund the 
cost of the Project the funds would be released directly to NCFL to 
administer to the Applicant. There would be no further internal 
pre-conditions associated with the release of funds towards the 
Project. These funds would meet the capital expenditure for the 
cost of the Project, the cost of acquiring land for the Project which 
is identified in the Order (compulsorily or otherwise), and any 
compensation payable as a result of the Project and in accordance 
with the Order [HR-013]. 
Conclusion in relation to the funding required for 
implementing the project 
6.31 
The ExA is sufficiently confident that the resource implications of 
the implementation of the proposed scheme have been met 
adequately based on the detailed accounts for NCFL (2012) and 
Noble Group Limited (2013). The Applicant's parent company, 
                                       
 
58 Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL) is the Applicant for the Order. HPL is registered in England and is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Watt Power Ltd incorporated in Scotland. Noble Clean Fuels Limited (NCFL) 
is the parent undertaking of Watt Power Ltd. NCFL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Group 
Limited (incorporated in Bermuda), the ultimate holding company for the Noble group of companies.

Noble, has assets worth $5 billion dollars) provided in Appendices 
1 and 2 of the Funding Statement [APP-036]. 
The funding required for CA 
6.32 
Para 9 of the  DCLG Guidance states that the Applicant:  
'The applicant must have a clear idea of how they intend to use 
the land which it is proposed to acquire. They should also be able 
to demonstrate that there is a reasonable prospect of the requisite 
funds for acquisition becoming available. Otherwise, it will be 
difficult to show conclusively that the compulsory acquisition of 
land meets the two conditions in section 122'. 
6.33 
The Funding Statement did not contain any estimate of the 
amount of funding that would be required for compulsory 
acquisition.  However, the Applicant in response [REP-030] to the 
ExA first round question CA-19(a) and (b), estimated that the 
costs of acquisition of the necessary land and rights i.e. the pink 
and blue land shown on the land plans [PD-020], together with 
obtaining voluntary agreement to the temporary use of land i.e. 
the yellow land shown on the land plans, would be, 
£2,456,095.65.  
6.34 
In the Applicants response to CA-19(c), the Applicant did not 
consider that security was necessary. The Applicant argued that 
should the Applicant proceed to implement the DCO (such decision 
would be made with NCFL and Noble Group Limited), then funding 
would be available and ready to be drawn down from NCFL and 
Noble Group Limited without any further internal pre-conditions 
associated with the release of funds towards the Project. With 
funding therefore available now for the Project, and given the 
standing of the Applicant's ultimate parent company, the Applicant 
did not consider there was a justification for security in this 
instance [APP-036].   
6.35 
The ExA pursued the question of what security was being 
proposed to ensure that the costs of acquisition of land and rights 
could be met in the event that the DCO application was approved 
e.g. parent company guarantee, at the 24 September 2014 CA 
hearing [HR-013]. 
6.36 
The Applicants response was that because the value of land 
acquisition and compensation currently stood at £2.4 million, and 
compared with the funding available to the Applicant, it was not 
considered appropriate for security to be provided now [HR-012]. 
6.37 
However, the Applicant was prepared to include in the DCO [PD-
018] an Article that followed the Secretary of State's decision on 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
112
 
 
the North Killingholme Order, made on 11 September 201459. The 
Secretary of State imposed an Article (Article 7, Guarantees in 
respect of payment of compensation) that prevents the 
commencement of the authorised development and the undertaker 
from exercising the compulsory acquisition powers unless either a 
guarantee in respect of the liabilities of the undertaker to pay 
compensation under the Order or an alternative form of security 
for that purpose is in place and which has been approved by the 
relevant planning authority [HR-012].  This was included as Article 
40 in the Applicant's final draft DCO [PD-018]. 
6.38 
RCT did not make any representations relating to the proposed 
Article 40. 
Conclusion on Funding for CA 
6.39 
Article 40 does not tie the Applicant to providing any particular 
form of security. There would have been more certainty about 
funding for CA liabilities if the Applicant could have agreed a form 
of security now (whether parent company guarantee or 
otherwise).  
6.40 
However given the Applicant’s overall account of its company 
assets and parent company it is considered on balance reasonable 
to rely on Article 40 (and, therefore, on the role of the Local 
Planning Authority). 
 
THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND AND/OR RIGHTS 
ARE REQUIRED 
The Applicant's case 
6.41 
As noted in paragraph 6.32 of this report the DCLG Guidance 
states that, in addition to demonstrating that funds for acquisition 
are likely to be available, the Applicant must have a clear idea how 
it proposes to use the land which it proposes to acquire. 
6.42 
The Applicant's overall case for CA as given in the Statement of 
Reasons [APP-051] is that it is necessary so that the Applicant has 
the requisite powers to construct, operate and maintain the 
Project which is a nationally significant infrastructure project for 
which there is a pressing national need.  
6.43 
The Project itself has been the subject of an extensive consultation 
exercise [APP-015 to APP-018].  It is in line with national and local 
policy in respect of planning and energy generation. The Applicant 
has contracts in place to acquire a substantial part of the land 
                                       
 
59 http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/yorkshire-and-the-humber/north-killingholme-

required for the Project. A contract has been signed to acquire the 
land where the Power Generation Plant will be located and for part 
of the Gas Connection [PD-020].  Negotiations with regard to the 
purchase of land, the acquisition of and/or creation of easement 
rights and any other rights and interests required for the 
remaining Gas Connection and for the Electrical Connection are in 
progress (the land affected by these negotiations are shown on 
the Gas Connection Land Plan and the Electrical Connection Land 
Plan, both in [PD-020]).  Appendix A in the Applicant's response to 
the ExA third round question CA3-02 sets out the current 
negotiation status [REP-048]. 
6.44 
Although negotiations for the purchase of land, rights and 
interests are on-going in respect of the remaining Gas Connection 
and for the Electrical Connection, it is necessary for the Applicant 
to seek CA  powers to secure such land, rights and interests and 
to ensure that any third party interests or encumbrances affecting 
such land, rights and interests are acquired or overridden pursuant 
to the DCO, thereby ensuring that the Project can be constructed, 
operated and maintained in accordance with the powers sought 
under the DCO [HR-013]. 
6.45 
Whilst the Applicant has secured a contract to acquire the land 
where the Power Generation Plant will be located and for part of 
the Gas Connection, the Applicant is seeking CA powers over this 
land [PD-020] to ensure that the certain easements and other 
private rights identified as affecting that land are extinguished so 
as to facilitate the construction and operation of the Project 
without hindrance (see sections 1.2, 1.3, 2.2 and 2.3 of the Book 
of Reference [APP-055]. 
6.46 
In addition, there may be unknown rights, restrictions, easements 
or servitudes affecting that land which also need to be overridden, 
removed and/or extinguished in order to facilitate the construction 
and operation of the Project without hindrance. 
6.47 
The Applicant considers that there is a compelling case in the 
public interest, in accordance with section 122(3) of the Act, for 
the making of the DCO and the inclusion of powers of compulsory 
acquisition to enable the Project to be constructed, operated and 
maintained [APP-051]. 
6.48 
The Applicant has been seeking to acquire the remaining land, 
temporary use of land and rights (shown edged red and shaded 
pink, yellow and blue respectively on the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection Land Plans [PD-020]) by private treaty, in 
order to ensure implementation of the Project. However, it has not 
yet been possible to acquire all of the land, the temporary use of 
land and the rights required by private treaty. In addition, the 
Applicant requires certain matters to be suspended, overridden or 
extinguished within the Order Land so as to ensure there are no 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
114
 
 
impediments to the construction, operation and maintenance of 
the Project. 
6.49 
In the absence of powers of CA, the Applicant argues that the 
Order Land may not be assembled, uncertainty will continue to 
prevail and the Applicant considers that its objectives and 
Government policy objectives would not be achieved. 
6.50 
The Applicant's justification for seeking CA powers, in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act, is to secure land, the temporary use 
of land, the rights and other interests required to enable the 
Applicant to construct, operate and maintain the Project within a 
reasonable commercial timeframe. The inclusion of powers of 
compulsory acquisition in the DCO is sought in order to ensure 
that this can be achieved. The land and rights together with the 
land required for temporary use is no more than that is required to 
facilitate the Project, its construction and future maintenance. The 
necessary powers, together with powers to suspend, override and 
extinguish rights and other interests in or over land, are contained 
in Part 3 and Part 5 of the draft DCO [PD-018]. 
6.51 
The Statement of Reasons [APP-051] makes full reference to the 
tests set in legislation and in guidance for compulsory acquisition. 
The Applicant states at para. 11.4 that: 
'All reasonable alternatives to compulsory acquisition have been 
explored. Given the national and local need for the Project and the 
support for it found in policy, as well as the suitability of the Order 
Land (for the reasons outlined above), compulsory acquisition of 
the land, temporary use of land, permanent rights and other 
interests together with the suspension and extinguishment of 
matters affecting the Order Land identified by HPL for the Project 
is justified.' 
6.52 
No evidence has been submitted to the Examination questioning 
the overall need for the project. (see para. 4.21 of this report).  
6.53 
The ExA has taken into account the overall need as one factor in 
assessing whether there is a compelling case in the public interest 
(s.122(3) of the Planning Act 2008 as amended) to justify 
compulsory acquisition. 
6.54 
The case for compulsory acquisition for specific plots is set out 
later in this section of this report. 
 
ALTERNATIVES 
6.55 
Para. 8 of the DCLG Guidance related to procedures for the 
compulsory acquisition of land states that: 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
115
 
 
'The Applicant should be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Secretary of State that all reasonable alternatives to 
compulsory acquisition (including modifications to the scheme) 
have been explored.' 
6.56 
Section 4 (paras. 4.33 to 4.41 of this report) has considered the 
overall issue of the consideration of alternative sites for the 
project. The ExA has concluded that it: 
'…considers that the examination of alternatives has been 
addressed adequately and that the requirements of NPS EN-1 and 
the EIA Regulations are met (para 4.41).' 
6.57 
The ExA has considered this in terms of the selection of the site, 
the scale of the development proposed, the specific characteristics 
of the development and then in relation to the proposed 
acquisition of each parcel of land (in the sections on those parcels 
described in this report). 
6.58 
Paragraph 25 of the DCLG Guidance states that applicants should 
seek to acquire land by negotiation wherever practicable, and that 
as a general rule, authority to acquire land compulsorily should 
only be sought if attempts to acquire by agreement fail.  The 
Statement of Reasons [APP-051] states at para. 3.2.5 that: 
'Whilst land, rights and interests will be secured by agreement 
wherever possible, and negotiations continue with all identified 
owners, it is essential that compulsory purchase60 powers are 
available to HPL to enable the Project to be constructed at the 
earliest opportunity.' 
6.59 
The Applicant has demonstrably sought to purchase interests by 
agreement. The ExA have seen evidence of a range of contacts 
between parties involved in issues of CA and sees no reason to 
doubt that, in general, this approach has been adopted [REP-048]. 
6.60 
The ExA concludes that overall and in general all reasonable 
alternatives to compulsory acquisition (including modifications to 
the scheme) have been explored.  
 
SPECIFIC GROUPS OF AFFECTED PERSONS AND TYPES OF 
LAND 
6.61 
This part of this section deals with specific groups of affected 
persons and types of land: 
 
Statutory Undertakers; 
 
Crown Land; and

 
Special category land. 
 
Statutory Undertakers-Section 127 
6.62 
The following Statutory Undertakers are potentially affected  by 
the application: 
 
National Grid (National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGET), 
National Grid Gas (NGG), National Grid Property Holdings 
(NGPH); 
 
Western Power Distribution (South Wales) plc (WPD); 
 
Dwr Cymru Cyfyngefig (DCC - Welsh Water); 
 
South Wales Electricity Ltd (SWEL); 
 
Wales and West Utilities (WWU); and 
 
British Telecommunications plc (BT). 
 
National Grid ((NG) and, for the avoidance of doubt, 
National Grid plc and National Grid Property Holdings Ltd) 
6.63 
Statutory undertaker NG land is included for the purposes of the 
Electrical Connection (the Applicant is seeking consent to install 
part of the cable within the Rhigos Substation currently being 
constructed by NGET). The Applicant has finalised an agreement 
with NGET regarding the Electrical Connection [AS-022]. 
Protective provisions have been agreed with National Grid 
Electricity Transmission (NGET) plc and are included at Schedule 
9, Part 1 of the draft DCO [PD-018].  
6.64 
All outstanding matters between the parties have now been 
resolved and National Grid are satisfied that their interests in the 
Order Land will be adequately protected.  NGET and NGG (and, for 
the avoidance of doubt, National Grid plc and National Grid 
Property Holdings Ltd) have withdrawn all representations in 
respect of the DCO application, and under s127 and s138 of the 
Planning Act 2008 [AS-022]. 
Western Power Distribution (WPD) (South wales) plc 
6.65 
The Order Land includes two un-numbered Western Power 
Distribution sub stations:  
 
The substation within plot 6_MS will not be demolished under 
the Project proposals; and 
 
The substation within plot 2_MS will be demolished under the 
Project proposals. 
6.66 
In addition, there are various assets belonging to WPD in the 
buildings within plots 1_MS and 3_MS which will be affected by the 
Project proposals.  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project

6.67 
The Order Land also contains various overhead electricity lines, 
however, these will not be affected by the Project.  Protective 
provisions have been agreed with Western Power Distribution 
(South Wales) plc and are included at Schedule 9, Part 2 of the 
draft DCO [PD-018].  
6.68 
WPD (South Wales) plc has confirmed to the Examining Authority 
in its Written Representation dated 21 August 2014 [REP-009] 
that the agreed protective provisions are considered to be 
appropriate for the proposed impact of the development on 
Western Power's assets. Western Power also confirms in its letter 
that it no longer wishes to be considered an interested party and 
has no objection to the terms of the DCO, including CA powers.  
Dwr Cymru Cyfyngefig (DCC - Welsh Water) 
6.69 
Protective provisions have been agreed with Dwr Cymru 
Cyfyngefig (DCC - Welsh Water) and are included at Schedule 9, 
Part 7 of the draft DCO [PD-018]. This was confirmed by Pinsent 
Masons on behalf of  DCC in an email dated 22 December 2014 
where they stated [AS-025]: 
'Dŵr Cymru Cyfyngedig, Welsh Water (“DCC”) has agreed the 
terms of protective provisions with the Applicant. All outstanding 
matters between the parties have now been resolved and DCC is 
satisfied that their interests in the Order Land will be adequately 
protected. Accordingly, I have DCC’s consent to write to notify you 
that DCC withdraws all representations in respect of the DCO 
application, and under s127 and s138 of the Planning Act 2008 
with immediate effect.' 
South Wales Electricity Ltd (SWEL), Wales and West 
Utilities Limited (WWU) and British Telecommunications plc 
(BT) 
6.70 
South Wales Electricity Ltd (SWEL), Wales and West Utilities 
Limited (WWU) and British Telecommunications plc (BT) have not 
had any engagement with the Applicant.  The most recent update 
on the position with SWEL, WWU and BT was provided by the 
Applicant on 16/01/2015 in response to the Examining Authority's 
third round of questions [REP-048].  As no representation has 
been made by either SWEL WWU or BT, s127 of the Planning Act 
2008 is not engaged in relation to these parties.  
Summary 
6.71 
There is no representation by a statutory undertaker which has 
not been withdrawn and accordingly the provisions of section 127 
are not engaged.

Extinguishment of Rights, and Removal of apparatus of 
statutory undertakers etc. - Section 138 
6.72 
Part 3 of Schedule 9 of the draft DCO contains protective 
provisions which provide protection for SWEL and WWU's 
apparatus. Part 4 of Schedule 9 of the draft DCO contains 
protective provisions which provide protection for BT's apparatus. 
The exact location of all of SWEL, WWU and BT's apparatus and 
rights is not yet known.  The Applicant does not anticipate that the 
authorised development will interfere in any way with SWEL, WWU 
or BT's apparatus and/or rights but at this stage the possibility 
cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the Applicant has included powers 
to extinguish any right or remove any apparatus (contained in 
Article 29 of the draft DCO [PD-018]) but made subject to the 
protective provisions in Schedule 9.  
6.73 
Given the protective provisions in Schedule 9, the Secretary of 
State can be satisfied that any extinguishment or removal would 
be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the authorised 
development (s138).  
Crown Land 
6.74 
The Book of Reference which accompanied the application [APP-
037] showed the Welsh Government (WG) as having a Part 1, 
(category 2) interest in all the plots 1_MS, 2_MS, 3_MS, 4_MS, 
5_MS, 6_MS , 7_MS and 4_ER. Those plots were also shown as 
subject to Part 2 (category 3) and Part 3 Welsh Government 
interests. 
6.75 
Revision 3 of the Book of Reference relocated the Welsh 
Government's interests in all the plots listed above from Part 2 
(category 3) and Part 3 (Easements or other private rights 
proposed to be interfered with, suspended or extinguished) to Part 
4 (Crown interests) in the Main Site and Electrical Connection 
[APP-055]. 
6.76 
The ExA in coming to a view on Crown Land, set out in the 
subsequent paragraphs of this sub-section, has considered the 
statutory position set out in s.135 and s.227 of the Planning Act 
2008 (as amended) and has had regard to the guidance contained, 
in particular, in paras. 39 and 40 and in Annex B of the DCLG 
Guidance. 
6.77 
The relevant parts of s.135 are that:  
'(1) An order granting development consent may include provision 
authorising the compulsory acquisition of an interest in Crown land 
only if— (a) it is an interest which is for the time being held 
otherwise than by or on behalf of the Crown, and b) the 
appropriate Crown authority consents to the acquisition.  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
119
 
 
(2) An order granting development consent may include any other 
provision applying in relation to Crown land, or rights benefiting 
the Crown, only if the appropriate Crown authority consents to the 
inclusion of the provision.' 
6.78 
The relevant representation submitted by the Welsh Government 
[RR-007] does not relate to its rights in the Order land, rather to 
transport matters. The Welsh Government has not raised an 
objection. 
6.79 
The Applicant has confirmed that it is not compulsorily acquiring 
the rights of the Crown. For plots 1_MS to 7_MS (inclusive), Part 1 
of Section 1 to Revision 3 of the Book of Reference makes it clear 
that the interests owned by the WG are excepted. Similarly, for 
plot 4_ER, Part 1 of Section 3 to Revision 3 of the Book of 
Reference makes it clear that the interests owned by the Welsh 
Government are also excepted [REP-048]. 
6.80 
In response to the ExA’s third round question CA3-03 [DEC-011], 
the Applicant responded on the application of s.135 as follows 
[REP-048]: 
'The Welsh Government's consent is not required as the draft 
Development Consent Order (latest revision being Revision 6) has 
carved the Crown out of the provisions referred to in the ExA's 
Question CA3-03.  The nature of the Crown's interest is, in all 
cases, rights to run services through any conduits and, in the case 
of plot 5_MS, a restrictive covenant not to obstruct the access way 
onto Main Avenue and to use reasonable endeavours to prevent it 
being obstructed.  
The draft Development Consent Order has excluded the Crown 
from Article 22 (Private Rights) as follows: 
 
Under Article 22(1), where the Applicant acquires the 
freehold, then all private rights are extinguished. Article 
22(9)(a)(xi), makes it clear that the Article, and therefore 
this provision, does not apply to the Crown. 
 
Under Article 22(2), where the Applicant acquires rights, then 
all private rights are suspended and unenforceable, or, where 
so notified by the Applicant, extinguished in so far as in 
either case their continuance would be inconsistent with the 
exercise of the right. Article 22(9)(a)(xi), makes it clear that 
the Article, and therefore this provision, does not apply to the 
Crown. 
 
Under Article 22(4), where the Applicant takes temporary 
possession under the Order (i.e. under Article 27 (temporary 
use of land for carrying out the authorised development) and 
Article 28 (temporary use of land for maintaining the 
authorised development), then all private rights over such 
land are suspended and unenforceable for as long as the 
applicant remains in lawful possession of the land and in so 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
120
 
 
far as their continuance would be inconsistent with the 
exercise of the temporary possession of that land. Article 
22(9)(a)(xi), makes it clear that the Article, and therefore 
this provision, does not apply to the Crown.' 
 
Conclusion on Crown Land  
6.81 
The applicant states they are not compulsorily acquiring any crown 
rights (Applicants response to CA3-03 para. 1a [REP-048]). This is 
confirmed in Revision 3 of the BoR [APP-0054].   
6.82 
However, Articles 17(1) and  21(1) enable the acquisition of the 
land and rights: 
'The undertaker may acquire so much of the Order Land as is 
required for the authorised development or to facilitate it, or as is 
incidental to it' 
 ''The undertaker may acquire compulsorily the existing rights over 
land…described in the book of reference and shown on the land 
plans' [PD-018].   
The description in the BoR of each plot in which the WG have an 
interest now includes the words: 
'except for those interests owned by the Welsh Government'.  
6.83 
The ExA recommends the addition of a paragraph to Articles 17 
and  21 to the effect that: 
'Nothing in this article authorises the acquisition of rights or other 
interests in land owned by the Crown'. 
6.84 
The ExA believes that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows these alterations (Appendix D). 
Special Category Land 
6.85 
No land belonging to the National Trust, open space, common land 
or field garden allotment is included in or affected by the Order 
Land. 
 
THE APPLICANT'S CASE FOR SPECIFIC PARCELS OF LAND 
6.86 
This part of this section deals first with CA of land and rights which 
the Applicant maintains is necessary for the development. 
6.87 
There were few representations made to the ExA by affected 
persons because extensive discussions took place between the 
Applicant and affected persons to deal with their concerns [REP-
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
121
 
 
048]. This was achieved with a number of affected persons by 
agreements and proposed agreements of various sorts but in 
many cases the concerns were addressed by Protective Provisions 
as set out in Part 5 of Schedule 9 of the draft  DCO [PD-018]. 
6.88 
They were formulated to address the concerns of the following 
parties in particular: 
 
The Honourable John Crichton -Stuart; 
 
Celtic Energy; 
 
Wales and West Utilities Ltd; 
 
Eftec Ltd; 
 
Walters Plant Hire; 
 
Swan Mill Ltd and 
 
Tallyspace Ltd. 
6.89 
However, the Protective provisions as set out in Part 5 of Schedule 
9 of the draft DCO are for the benefit of all affected persons [PD-
018]. 
6.90 
Representations were submitted by a number of parties (other 
than statutory undertakers) as follows: 
Ashtenne (AIF) Ltd (in respect of subsoil) 
6.91 
The Revision 3 of the Book of Reference, [APP-055], shows AIF as 
having a category 1 interest in the plots numbered 1_ER and 
3a_GR in respect of subsoil, and a category 2 interest in the plots 
numbered 5 ER and 6_ER.  These plots are required for numbered 
works 5. 
6.92 
AIF summarised their concerns in their written representation as 
follows [REP-010]. This was re-iterated in [REP-041]: 
'AIF’s concerns in relation to the proposed Hirwaun Power Station 
relate to detailed matters and their impact on the on-going 
operation and redevelopment potential of their land and estates at 
Hirwaun. It is likely these can be dealt with following this 
submission and without having to take up any further time within 
any of the hearing sessions.' 
6.93 
Ashtenne's interest is only in respect of the subsoil and the 
Applicant does not intend to carry out below surface works on this 
plot. A key concern of Ashtenne is ensuring that the easement 
does not permanently reduce the ability to access its existing 
estates or land in any way, or would hinder its on-going operation 
or redevelopment potential [REP-010].  
6.94 
The Applicant has confirmed that the easement would not 
permanently reduce Ashtenne's ability to access its estates or land 
or hinder its on-going operation or redevelopment potential [REP-
045].  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
122
 
 
6.95 
To protect rights of access and rights to connect to, use, maintain, 
repair or renew services, the Applicant has included protective 
provisions in Schedule 9, Part 5 of the draft DCO which require the 
provision of substitute rights before any interference, suspension 
or extinguishment can occur[PD-018].  
6.96 
On 27 October 2014, solicitors for Ashtenne wrote to confirm that 
it continued to negotiate with the Applicant in relation to its 
interests in land that might be affected by the DCO. The 
Applicant's solicitor received detailed comments on the proposed 
option agreements and easements from the solicitor acting for 
Ashtenne in October 2014 and responded to these at the 
beginning of November 2014 [REP-045].  
Recommendation in respect of Ashtenne Industrial Fund 
(AIF) 
6.97 
By virtue of the Applicant's direct functional need for the land for 
their underground gas pipeline and electrical connection, the ExA 
considers that the tests set out in guidance relating to legitimacy, 
proportionality, reasonableness, and necessity are met. Taking 
into account the correspondence cited in the preceding paragraphs 
and the protective provisions included by the Applicant in the draft 
DCO, the ExA recommends that the SoS can authorise compulsory 
acquisition of AIF interests in plot numbers 1_ER, 3a_GR, 5_ER 
and 6 ER. 
Tower Regeneration Limited (TRL) (incorporating Tower Colliery 
Limited) 
6.98 
The Revision 3 of the Book of Reference, [APP-055], shows TRL as 
having a category 1 interest in all  the plots numbered 9_GR, 
9a_GR, 10_GR, 10a_GR,  11_GR and 11a_GR and a category 2 
interest in plots 11_GR and 11a_GR. These plots are required for 
numbered works 4A and 4B. 
6.99 
TRL in its relevant representations stated [RR-014]: 
'…Subject to timing, the proposed AGI as identified intercepts 
existing drainage channels essential to the working of the western 
coal extraction area as approved in planning permission 
10/0292/10 in addition to potentially hindering or preventing the 
implementation of excavation, drainage and restoration works 
both within the AGI and adjacent land of planning permission ref: 
10/0292/10. 
 
Further, a full planning application to revise the extraction area 
approved under planning consent 10/0292/10 was submitted to 
RCTCBC in August 2013 (planning application ref: 13/0859/15). 
This seeks permission to extend the limit of excavation for coal 
extraction up to the western extent of Tower Colliery planning 
permission ref: 10/0292/10). The proposed AGI for the Hirwaun 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
123
 
 
Power Station is partly contained within the proposed revised 
extraction area and therefore, subject to timing, could prevent 
extraction of the mineral in that area in addition to preventing the 
implementation of excavation, drainage and restoration works of 
adjacent land within planning application ref: 13/0859/15. In 
addition, the above revised extraction area application (planning 
application ref: 13/0859/15) necessitates the diversion of the gas 
pipeline which is not accounted for within the Hirwaun Power 
Station submission. 
 
This is contrary to paragraphs 11-20 of Mineral Planning Policy 
Wales, paragraphs 8, 22 and 34-43 of Minerals Technical Advice 
Note 2 and RCTCBC Local Development Plan (LDP) Policy AW 14, 
all of which seek to safeguard mineral deposits from sterilisation. 
We trust that these comments will be duly considered in the 
determination process.' 
6.100 The Applicant in response to the ExA first round question CA15 
[DEC-006] stated [REP-030]: 
'15.5. The amount of coal reserves associated with numbered 
works 3, 4A and 4B cannot be quantified at this time. The volume 
of coal reserves which would be sterilised is a function of the 
length of the pipeline, the diameter of the pipeline and the quality 
of the ground conditions in this area. The sterilised reserves would 
be best thought of as a trapezoidal prism with the top short edge 
being where the pipeline would be located. The height and angle 
of the trapezoids sides would be dependent on the depth of the 
coal reserves in the area and the load bearing strength of the 
particular ground conditions. 
15.6. Stranded reserves can also be viewed as sterilised reserves 
depending on the mechanics of the mining approach. Therefore it 
is not possible at this time of the Project development to 
confidently specify the volume of reserves that might be sterilised. 
15.7. The Applicant understands that consultants on behalf of TRL 
has estimated 60,534 tonnes of coal could be sterilised by 
numbered works 3, 4A and 4B. The Applicant had not had sight of 
this report and notes that TRL does not own the majority of the 
land required for numbered work 3 and, as explained in this 
answer, there is currently no planning permission permitting coal 
extraction from the land required for numbered works 4A and 4B 
and if the S73 Application were to be granted the timing of HPL’s 
operations would not sterilise the consented extraction.' 
6.101 TRL in response to the ExA second round question CA2-02 [DEC-
009] stated [REP-046]: 
'To provide protection for Tower in relation to potential 
interference with storage bunds and drainage channels in relation 
to Tower’s current mining operations (albeit the Applicant 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
124
 
 
considers these could be worked around subject to the necessary 
consents being obtained) and as agreed between Tower and the 
Applicant at the issue specific hearing on Compulsory Acquisition, 
Part 6 of revision 3.0 of the draft Order includes protective 
provisions  in Part 6 of Schedule 9 that restrict the Applicant from:  
1. vesting the land identified in the book of reference and the land 
plans by plot reference numbers 10_GR and 11_GR in itself;  
2. exercising the powers conferred on it by Article 27 in respect of 
the land identified in the book of reference and the land plans by 
plot reference numbers 10_GR, 10a_GR, 11_GR and 11a_GR; or 
commencing the authorised development on the land identified in 
the book of reference and the land plans by plot reference 
numbers 10_GR, 10a_GR, 11_GR and 11a_GR, until on or after 1 
January 2018 by which time, according to the approved plans, the 
mining operations will have moved away from the AGI Site.  
3. The Applicant and Tower are continuing to actively and 
positively engage and further meetings to discuss the commercial 
terms of any voluntary agreement are currently being arranged for 
November 2014. The Applicant has also confirmed that it will be 
responsible for the fees incurred to date by Tower Regeneration 
Limited and Tower’s anticipated fees.' 
6.102 At the CA Hearing on 24 September the Applicant repeated its 
commitment that in the next draft of the DCO a protective 
provision would be included that restricts the Applicant from 
vesting Plots 10_GR and 11_GR in itself and commencing any part 
of the authorised development on those plots until 1 January 
2018.  This protective provision can be found at Schedule 9, Part 6 
of the draft DCO [PD-018].  Tower Regeneration Limited at the 
Hearing stated they were largely content with this proposal [HR-
013]. 
6.103 The Applicant has pointed out that TRL submitted an application 
under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (ref 
13/0859/15) ") to amend the area where the excavation of 
minerals is permitted to allow extraction to be carried out in 
respect of plots numbered 10_GR, 10a_GR, 11_GR and 11a_GR. 
This application was refused on 28 October and, as far as the 
Applicant is aware, no appeal has been lodged. As such, the 
Applicant can confirm that it will not be interfering with any rights 
of Tower to excavate minerals.  
6.104 TRL responded to the above stating [REP-046]: 
'This is not correct. No ‘rights’ have been lost. Planning permission 
has been refused, and this can be appealed, up to 28th April 2015. 
At present, an appeal can progress with the sole ‘obstacle’ being 
the refusal of planning permission, and it is clear that RCTCBC 
considers the principle of the extension acceptable, but has 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
125
 
 
refused the application because of a lack of environmental 
information. ' 
6.105 A meeting to progress the heads of terms was held on 1 October 
2014 and an updated offer was subsequently made by the 
Applicant in writing [REP-048].  On 11 November 2014 the 
Applicant's solicitors agreed to give a further undertaking to Tower 
Regeneration Limited in relation to incurred and anticipated fees. 
As at 15 January 2015, TRL and the Applicant confirm that the key 
principles for an agreement have been agreed and that TRL has 
agreed to the Applicant preparing a draft commercial agreement 
that reflects the agreed key principles. The Applicant is therefore 
preparing this commercial agreement, following which it 
anticipates that negotiations will take place with TRL over the 
drafting leading to a document to be completed by both parties 
[REP-048]. 
Conclusion in respect of Tower Regeneration Ltd. 
6.106 By virtue of the Applicant's direct functional need for the land for 
its underground gas pipeline and AGI, the ExA considers that the 
tests set out in guidance relating to legitimacy, proportionality, 
reasonableness, and necessity are met. Taking into account the 
correspondence, responses to ExA written questions and the 
exchanges at the CA hearing, cited in the preceding paragraphs 
and that an agreement has been agreed in principle, the ExA 
recommends that the Secretary of State can authorise compulsory 
acquisition of TRL interests in plot numbers 9_GR, 9a_GR, 10_GR, 
10a_GR, 11_GR and 11a_GR. 
The Coal Authority 
6.107 Revision 3 of the Book of Reference, [APP-055], shows The Coal 
Authority as having a category 2 interest in numbered plots in 
10_GR and 10a_GR, and interests unknown in 7_GR and 7a_GR. 
These plots are required for numbered works 3. 
6.108 The Coal Authority in its Relevant Representations [RR-005] 
stated: 
'Accordingly, The Coal Authority does not object to this application 
for a Development Consent Order, but would request that the 
undertaking of, and submission of details of, the recommended 
site investigations and any necessary remedial measures are made 
a requirement of the Development Consent Order.' 
6.109 The Relevant Representation was concerned with the imposition of 
a Requirement on the draft DCO which has since been agreed 
between the Applicant and the Coal Authority (Requirement 22 
Appendix D).  
6.110 The Coal Authority has been in discussions with the Applicant and 
has not objected to the application [RR-005]. The Coal Authority 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

has confirmed that it has no concerns with the approach in the 
draft DCO regarding the loss of potential mineral working area in 
respect of these plots [REP-028].  
Recommendation in respect of The Coal Authority 
6.111 By virtue of the Applicant's direct functional need for the land for 
their underground gas pipeline, the ExA considers that the tests 
set out in guidance relating to legitimacy, proportionality, 
reasonableness, and necessity are met. Taking into account the 
correspondence cited in the preceding paragraphs and the 
requirement 9A agreed by the Applicant and The Coal Authority in 
the draft DCO, the ExA recommends that the SoS  can authorise 
compulsory acquisition of The Coal Authority interests in plot 
numbers 7_GR, 7a_GR,  10_GR and 10a_GR.  Requirement 9A has 
been renumbered Requirement 22 in the ExA's recommended draft 
DCO (Appendix D). 
 
TEMPORARY POSSESSION POWERS 
6.112 The DCO at articles 27 and 28 respectively seeks powers to take 
temporary possession of land to carry out the authorised 
development and to maintain it [PD-018]. The land which is 
subject to these powers is described in Revision 3 of the Book of 
Reference [APP-055] and shown on the revised Land Plans [PD-
020]. The nature of the power is also described in the Book of 
Reference and the purpose and justification for these powers is set 
out in the Statement of Reasons [APP-051].  The Funding 
Statement [APP-036] submitted with the application concludes 
that there will be no funding shortfall in meeting any 
compensation payments. 
6.113 As indicated above these powers are not compulsory acquisition 
powers and accordingly the tests under sections 122 and 123 are 
not applicable.  However, the use of the power must be justified in 
order to enable the proposed development to be implemented and 
maintained, the inevitable interference with human rights must be 
justified and there must be adequate compensation provisions in 
place for those whose land is affected. 
6.114 The Human Rights Act considerations have been addressed above 
and the ExA is satisfied that the powers are needed both to 
facilitate implementation of the proposed development and to 
maintain it and that there are also adequate compensation 
provisions in place in articles 27 and 28 of the draft DCO.  The ExA 
accordingly recommends to the SoS that the temporary powers be 
granted

HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998 CONSIDERATIONS 
6.115 In considering specific plots and specific parties the ExA has had 
particular regard to Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European 
Convention on Human Rights, as embodied in the Human Rights 
Act 1998, which states that: 
‘Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment 
of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions 
except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided 
for by law and by the general principles of international law. 
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the 
right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to 
control the use of property in accordance with the general interest 
or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or 
penalties.’ 
6.116 The ExA in relation to Article 1 First Protocol is satisfied that the 
proposed interference with the individual's rights would be lawful, 
necessary, proportionate and justified in the public interest  
6.117 The ExA has also had regard to Article 8 dealing with the right to 
respect for private and family life. None of the applications for 
compulsory acquisition relate to the compulsory acquisition of a 
house or dwelling. 
6.118 The ExA concludes that, the process of examining this application, 
including the opportunities to submit representations, a series of 
written questions and the opportunities to be heard at hearings all 
means that those whose rights may be affected have been given 
access to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law for the 
purpose of Article 6. 
 
THE EXA'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GRANTING OF CA 
POWERS 
6.119 The ExA’s approach to the question whether and what compulsory 
acquisition powers it should recommend to the Secretary of State 
to grant has been to seek to apply the relevant sections of the 
Planning Act 2008, notably s.122 and s.123, the Guidance61, and 
the Human Rights Act 1998; and, in the light of the 
representations received and the evidence submitted, to consider 
whether a compelling case has been made in the public interest, 
balancing the public interest against private loss.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
128
 
 
6.120 The ExA understands, however, that the draft DCO deals with both 
the development itself and compulsory acquisition powers. The 
case for compulsory acquisition powers cannot properly be 
considered unless and until the ExA has formed a view on the case 
for the development overall, and the consideration of the 
compulsory acquisition issues must be consistent with that view. 
6.121 The ExA has shown in the conclusion to Section 4 of this report 
that it has reached the view that development consent should be 
granted. The question therefore that the ExA addresses here is the 
extent to which, in the light of the factors set out above, the case 
is made for compulsory acquisition powers necessary to enable the 
development to proceed. 
The public benefit and private loss 
6.122 The benefits of providing for a large scale energy project are set 
out clearly in NPS EN-1 and NPS EN-2. The project would 
contribute to the achievement of the objectives of Planning Policy 
Wales. There is a need to secure the land and rights required to 
construct the development. There would be some private loss of 
land or rights in relation to the: 
 
Main site; 
 
installation of the underground gas pipeline and  
 
the 400kV underground electric cable.  
 
The case in the public interest for the project is compelling. There 
is no disproportionate or unjustified interference with human 
rights such as to conflict with the provisions of the Human Rights 
Act 1998.  
6.123 The ExA is satisfied that all of the land is required for the 
development to which the development consent relates or is 
required to facilitate the development.  The ExA is also satisfied 
that the land to be taken is no more than is reasonably required 
and is proportionate.62 
6.124 The ExA is satisfied that the condition in s.123 (2) of the Planning 
Act, 2008 is met because the application for the DCO included a 
request for compulsory acquisition of the land to be authorised. 
6.125 Having regard to all the particular circumstance in this case for 
CA, there would be a compelling case in the public interest (s122 
(3)) for the grant of the CA powers sought by the Applicant in 
respect of the CA land as shown coloured pink and blue on the 
Land Plans and for the grant of temporary powers in respect of 
land coloured yellow [PD-020].

6.126 Lastly, with regard to the incorporation of other statutory powers 
pursuant to s120 (5)(a) of the Planning Act, 2008, the ExA is 
satisfied that as required by section 117(4), the DCO has been 
drafted in the form of a statutory instrument and further that no 
provisions of the DCO contravene the provisions of s126, of the 
Planning Act, 2008 which precludes the exclusion of compensation 
provisions.

DRAFT DEVELOPMENT CONSENT ORDER 
INTRODUCTION 
7.1 
A draft DCO [APP-033] and Explanatory Memorandum (EM) [APP-
034] were submitted with the application for development 
consent. The EM describes the purpose and form of the draft DCO 
and each of its articles and schedules. The draft DCO is based on 
the Infrastructure Planning (Model Provisions) (England and 
Wales) Order 2009, but with differences. 
7.2 
During the examination, several further drafts of the DCO and EM 
[PD-023] were submitted by the applicant incorporating 
progressive changes arising from the ExA's written questions, 
points made by interested parties, and from the proceedings at 
the DCO hearing held on 23 September 2014 [HR-010].  The ExA 
asked 40 questions on the DCO in its three rounds of written 
questions [DEC-006] [DEC-009][DEC-011] and the Applicant's 
responses can be viewed at [REP-030], [REP-045] and [REP-048]. 
7.3 
All versions of the DCO were subject to comment and revisions 
were made to address changes sought by interested parties in 
their written or oral representations [REP-024] [REP-025][REP-
026][REP-029]. Comments were also provided in response to the 
ExA written questions on drafting or seeking justification for the 
powers sought in the DCO or in response to questions raised at 
the DCO hearings [HR-010]. 
7.4 
The draft DCO constitutes the consent sought for the proposed 
development.  It sets out the authority to be given to the 
Applicant, including: 
 
The permanent compulsory acquisition of land and interests 
in land; 
 
The obligations that the applicant is prepared to accept to 
facilitate the development; 
 
The further approvals [APP-044] that are required before 
particular works can commence; 
 
The protective provisions necessary to safeguard the interest 
of other parties; and 
 
The requirements (corresponding to planning conditions) to 
be met when implementing the consent.  
7.5 
Section 120(5)(a) of the Planning Act 2008 provides that a DCO 
may apply, modify or exclude a statutory provision which relates 
to any matter for which provision may be made in the DCO. If the 
Order includes such provision, s 117(4) requires that it must be in 
the form of a statutory instrument. The ExA confirms that the DCO 
is in the form of a statutory instrument. 
7.6 
Version 6 [PD-018] and a tracked copy showing changes from the 
Rev.5 and Rev.6 [PD-019] were submitted on the 16 January 2015 
as the final version of the applicant's draft DCO.

Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
131
 
 
7.7 
The ExA has used Version 6 to inform this report. 
7.8 
The ExA has prepared a version of the draft DCO, which it 
recommends to the Secretary of State, (Appendix D). All of the 
suggested changes were considered in the Examination.  
7.9 
Much of the draft DCO was not the subject of objection. Some 
proposed alterations are made for the purposes of clarification, for 
the correction of minor errors, or to reflect changes proposed 
elsewhere in the draft DCO. Those aspects of the draft DCO which 
are contentious or to which substantial alterations are proposed 
are considered in the following paragraphs.  
7.10 
In the event that the DCO is made, the following plans and 
documents would require certification in accord with Article 36: 
(a) 
the book of reference [APP-055]; 
(b) 
the land plans [PD-020]; 
(c) 
the works plans [APP-011]; 
(d) 
the rights of way, streets and access plan [APP-014]; 
(e) 
the environmental statement [APP-019]; 
(f) 
the flood risk assessment [APP-041]; 
(g) 
the design principles statement (contained in Appendix 02 of 
the design and access statement [APP-0049]); 
(h) 
the mitigation commitments register [HR-009]; 
(i) 
ecological mitigation plan (Requirement 10); 
(j) 
outline construction environmental management plan[APP-
020] and 
(k) 
outline lighting strategy (Requirement 16). 
 
ARTICLES 
7.11 
The principal powers sought in the DCO are for the construction, 
operation and maintenance of the Works described in Schedule 1 
of the draft DCO. 
7.12 
The numbering of articles reflects that of the Applicant's final draft 
DCO, Version 6 [PD-018].  
Article 2 - Date of final commissioning 
7.13 
Article 2(1) of the submission draft DCO [APP-033] stated: 
'“date of final commissioning” means the date on which the 
authorised development commences operation by generating 
power on a commercial basis'. 
7.14 
The ExA questioned how couldthis be objectively ascertained by a 
third party e.g. a landowner, served with notice under Article 
27(3) ([DEC-006] question DCO09). 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
132
 
 
7.15 
The Applicant has included a new Requirement 19 in its final 
version of the draft DCO, that the Applicant must notify Rhondda 
Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCT) of the date of final 
commissioning so that anyone affected by the DCO can obtain the 
"date of final commissioning" from Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council [REP-030]. 
7.16 
The ExA agrees that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Article 2 - Definition of gross rated electrical output 
7.17 
Paras. 4.87 to 4.106 of this report have discussed in detail 
operational mechanisms to not exceed 299MWe. 
7.18 
In the ExA's recommended draft DCO (Appendix D), the ExA has 
inserted the definition in Article 2 of: 
' …"gross rated electrical output" means the aggregate of the 
gross electric power as measured at the terminals of each 
generator comprised in the generating station, ascertained in 
accordance with standards agreed with the regulating authority 
under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) or subsequent legislation.' 
and has also inserted into Schedule 1 Authorised Development, 
the word "gross" before "rated electrical output". 
7.19 
The ExA believes that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
7.20 
The ExA would not recommend a cap on the rated electrical output 
as this would hinder the achievement of maximum efficiency in the 
operation of the generating station. 
Article 2 - Interpretation of Maintain 
7.21 
The ExA queried the definition of 'maintain', which includes adjust, 
alter, remove, reconstruct, replace and improve, and seems to 
extend the normal meaning of ‘maintain' ([DEC-006]  question 
DCO10).  
7.22 
The applicant responded that Article 2 of the draft DCO includes a 
definition of "maintain" which is the same as the definition in the 
Model Provisions63  save for the addition of “refurbish” and 
"improve" [REP-030].  
                                       
 
63 Infrastructure Planning (Model Provisions) (England and Wales) Order 2009 (now repealed) contains in Schedule  
(Model Provisions for Railways) the following definition “maintain” and any of its derivatives include to inspect repair, 
adjust, alter, remove, reconstruct or replace the authorised project and any derivative of “maintain” shall be 
construed accordingly. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
133
 
 
7.23 
The Applicant's reason for extending the definition to include the 
words “refurbish” and "improve" is to ensure that when 
maintenance involves replacing worn out parts of the Project that 
the latest technology can be used rather than trying to source an 
identical like for like replacement. The Applicant considers that it is 
inherent in the normal meaning of maintain that it does not mean 
just preserving the asset in it's as-built state, but also that during 
maintenance the asset will be brought up to date (if possible and 
within the parameters of the DCO). 
7.24 
The Applicant has pointed out [REP-030] by way of example that: 
 
The Daventry International Rail Freight Interchange 
Alteration Order 2014 contains a definition of "maintain" 
which includes both "improve" and "refurbish"; 
 
The East Northamptonshire Resource Management Facility 
Order 2013 contains a definition of "maintain" which includes 
both "improve" and "refurbish"; and 
 
The Kentish Flats Extension Order 2013 contains a definition 
of "maintain" which includes "refurbish". 
7.25 
The ES [APP-019] assesses the Project as described in section 4 of 
the ES.  Section 4 describes the construction, operation and 
decommissioning  of each element of the Project and in describing 
the operation there are the following specific subsections 
describing maintenance activities: 
 
Power Generation Plant: paragraphs 4.5.53 – 4.5.61; 
 
Gas Connection: paragraph 4.6.14 and paragraphs 4.6.25 – 
4.6.34; and 
 
Electrical Connection: paragraphs 4.7.7 – 4.7.10. 
7.26 
The ExA accepts that it is clear from these sections in the ES [APP-
019] that the types of maintenance activities anticipated (and 
hence assessed) are appropriately described by the current 
definition of "maintain".  
Article 2(2) - Reference to Restrictive Covenants 
7.27 
The applicant has not proposed to impose any restrictive 
covenants (the only covenants referred to in the BoR [APP-055] 
are covenants to which the Order land is subject).  Similarly the 
amendments to the CA statutes in Schedule 7 makes no mention 
of covenants in paragraph 1, yet the other paragraphs do.  The 
Applicant states in the table of amendments that accompanied 
HPL's letter of 10 September [AS-013]: 
'… that references to restrictive covenants remain in [Schedule 7] 
as the Applicant is currently in discussions with various 
landowners over the rights to be acquired.  The Applicant will 
revert on whether the references to restrictive covenants are to be 
deleted by deadline 4".   
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
134
 
 
None of the amendment tables accompanying the subsequent DCO 
revisions mention Schedule 7 again.   
Article 3 - Development consent etc granted by the Order;  
Article 4 - Maintenance of authorised development; and 
Article 5 - Operation of authorised development. 
7.28 
No issues were raised with respect to Articles 3, 4, and 5 during 
the course of the examination.  
Article 6 - Benefit of the Order 
7.29 
The ExA queried how Article 6(2) would work in practice as both 
the undertaker and National Grid are given the benefit of the order 
for numbered work 4A  ([DEC-006]  question DCO12).  
7.30 
The Applicant explained that Articles 7(1) and 7(4)(1) allow the 
benefit of the Order to be transferred to a statutory undertaker 
without seeking the consent of the SoS.  For clarity, Article 6(2) 
specifically provides that the provisions of the Order in relation to 
numbered work 4A are also for National Grid. This is because it is 
already known that National Grid will construct and subsequently 
own and operate this element of the Project [HR-009]. 
7.31 
The ExA is satisfied that above explanation clarifies the Articles 
intention. 
Article 7 - Consent to transfer benefit of the Order 
7.32 
The ExA was concerned that as initially drafted [APP-033] Article 
7(4)(b)(iii) – (v) could be interpreted as meaning that, provided at 
least one claim had been compromised etc. , SoS consent was not 
required.  The ExA argued that the intention is that SoS consent 
will continue to be required until all outstanding claims have been 
settled or dismissed ([DEC-006] question DCO13).   
7.33 
The Applicant redrafted Article 7(4)(b) (iii) – (v)  to refer to all 
such claims having been either compromised, withdrawn, settled 
etc. , rather than any. 
7.34 
The ExA agrees that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Articles 8 to 14 - Part 3 Streets 
7.35 
RCT were concerned that any decision will be “deemed” to be 
made if a deadline is not met. Given the long run in period prior to 
any construction, it should be feasible for the Applicant to agree, 
where necessary, an appropriate extension of time [REP-029]. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
135
 
 
7.36 
The ExA expressed concern that a number of provisions e.g. 
Article 8 to 14, confer deemed consent if a consultee does not 
respond within 28 days (a‘guillotine’).  The ExA queried whether 
those provisions contain an express requirement that the 
application for consent should contain a statement drawing the 
consultee’s attention to the "guillotine" ([DEC-006] question 
DCO24). 
7.37 
The Applicant amended  Articles 8, 12 and 38 (Procedure in 
relation to certain approvals etc.) to provide a procedure in 
relation to consents and approvals required pursuant to the Order 
i.e. 28 days was changed to 56.  It applies to all such consents 
etc., bar those for which applications are to be made to the 
relevant planning authority, where a separate more detailed 
procedure is provided for in Schedule 10.  
7.38 
Article 38(3) provides that Schedule 10 applies to all consents to 
be granted by the relevant planning authority. This provides for 56 
days but also paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 10 provides that the 
parties may agree a longer time period. 
7.39 
This position has been agreed between the Applicant and the 
relevant planning authority (RCT) as set out in paragraph 3.17.1 
of the SoCG between the Applicant and RCT [REP-031]. 
7.40 
The ExA agrees that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Article 15 - Discharge of Water 
7.41 
Article 15(7) referred to 'controlled waters' [APP-033].  Regulation 
12 of the Environmental Permitting 2010 Regulations64 requires an 
environmental permit for water discharge activities and 
groundwater activities as defined in Schedules 21 and 22 of the 
Regulations.  The definitions of those activities do not refer to 
‘controlled waters’, although that phrase is used in other parts of 
the Regulations. The ExA requested that in the interests of clarity, 
the provision should be amended to reflect the terms of Regulation 
12 [DEC-006]. 
7.42 
The Applicant redrafted Article 15(7) to refer to 'water discharge 
activities or groundwater activities' rather than 'controlled waters'. 
7.43 
The ExA agrees that this would clarify the provision.  Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D).

Article 16 - Authority to survey and investigate the land 
7.44 
No issues were raised with respect to Articles 16 during the course 
of the examination.  
Article 17 - Compulsory Acquisition of Land 
7.45 
To protect the interests of the Crown in respect of Crown Land 
(see paras. 6.34-6.42 of this report) the ExA recommends the 
addition of a paragraph to Article 17 of the draft DCO to the effect 
that: 
'Nothing in this article authorises the acquisition of rights or other 
interests in land owned by the Crown'. 
7.46 
The ExA believes that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Article 18 - Compulsory acquisition of land - incorporation 
of the mineral code 
7.47 
Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Land Act 1981 (minerals) provides that 
minerals are not compulsorily acquired unless expressly 
purchased.  However, Part 3 provides that the undertaker may 
prevent working of the minerals, subject to compensation being 
given.   
7.48 
The  applications EM [APP-034] in relation to this Article merely 
stated: 
'Should any mines and minerals below the authorised development 
be proposed to be worked at a future date, it would be appropriate 
for the undertaker to have the power to restrict the working …in 
accordance with the Statutory Code so as to protect the 
authorised development'. 
7.49 
The ExA queried why would it be ‘appropriate’ or necessary to do 
so in this particular case ([DEC-006] question DCO18). 
7.50 
In the Applicants revised EM [PD-023] it explained that Article 18 
is a model provision providing for the incorporation of the 
Statutory Minerals Code set out at Schedule 2 of the Acquisition of 
Land Act 1981 into the draft Order. This is because the authorised 
development is in an area with mining activity and because mines 
and minerals in the land are excluded from some freehold titles. 
The Code effectively provides flexibility for the Applicant to allow 
the owner of the mines and minerals to work the mines and 
minerals or, where they would affect the authorised development, 
to prevent the working of the mines and minerals with 
compensation payable instead.  
7.51 
The ExA agrees that revised text in the EM has clarified the 
intentions and powers.

Articles 19-20 Powers of Acquisition 
7.52 
No issues were raised with respect to Articles 19 to 20 during the 
course of the examination.  
Article 21 Compulsory acquisition of rights etc. 
7.53 
To protect the interests of the Crown in respect of Crown Land 
(see paras. 6.34-6.42 of this report) the ExA recommends the 
addition of a paragraph to Article 21 of the draft DCO to the effect 
that: 
'Nothing in this article authorises the acquisition of rights or other 
interests in land owned by the Crown'. 
7.54 
The ExA believes that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Article 22 - Private Rights 
7.55 
The Applicant has confirmed that it is not compulsory acquiring the 
rights of the Crown. For plots 1_MS to 7_MS and 4_ER.  Part 1 of 
Section 3 to Revision 3 of the Book of Reference makes it clear 
that the interests owned by the Welsh Government are also 
excepted [APP-0055]. 
7.56 
The Applicant argues that the Welsh Government's consent is not 
required as the draft Development Consent Order [PD-018] has 
carved the Crown out of the provisions referred to in the ExA's 
Question CA3-03 [DEC-011]. The nature of the Crown's interest is, 
in all cases, rights to run services through any conduits.  
7.57 
The draft Development Consent Order has carved out the Crown 
from Article 22 (Private Rights) as follows: 
 
Under Article 22(1), where the Applicant acquires the 
freehold, then all private rights are extinguished. Article 
22(9)(a)(xi), makes it clear that the Article, and therefore 
this provision, does not apply to the Crown. 
 
Under Article 22(2), where the Applicant acquires rights, then 
all private rights are suspended and unenforceable, or, where 
so notified by the Applicant, extinguished in so far as in 
either case their continuance would be inconsistent with the 
exercise of the right. Article 22(9)(a)(xi), makes it clear that 
the Article, and therefore this provision, does not apply to the 
Crown. 
 
Under Article 22(4), where the Applicant takes temporary 
possession under the Order (i.e. under Article 27 (temporary 
use of land for carrying out the authorised development) and 
Article 28 (temporary use of land for maintaining the 
authorised development), then all private rights over such 
land are suspended and unenforceable for as long as the 
applicant remains in lawful possession of the land and in so

far as their continuance would be inconsistent with the 
exercise of the temporary possession of that land. Article 
22(9)(a)(xi), makes it clear that the Article, and therefore 
this provision, does not apply to the Crown.  
7.58 
The relevant representation submitted by the WG [RR-007] does 
not relate to its rights in the Order land, rather to transport 
matters. The WG has not raised an objection.  
7.59 
The ExA believes that the amendment to Articles 17(3) and 21(6) 
(see paras. 7.45 and 7.53 of this report) would clarify intentions 
and powers. Its recommended draft DCO shows this alteration 
(Appendix D). 
Articles 23 to 26 - Acquisition Powers 
7.60 
No issues were raised with respect to Articles 23 to 26 during the 
course of the examination.  
Article 27 - Temporary use of land for carrying out the 
authorised development 
7.61 
The ExA were concerned that Article 27(1)(d), which refers to 
“other mitigation works”, was too vague and the works that can be 
constructed should be limited by what was assessed in the EIA 
([DEC-006] question DCO021). 
7.62 
The Applicant clarified that the "other mitigation works" referred to 
are limited to those mitigation works envisaged in the ES or 
required pursuant to the requirements in Schedule 2 to the DCO. 
Mitigation works envisaged in the ES or required pursuant to the 
DCO requirements have been assessed in the EIA [REP-030]. 
7.63 
The ExA is satisfied with the above explanation and has not made 
any change to this Article in the recommended DCO (Appendix D). 
Articles 28 - 34 
7.64 
No issues were raised with respect to Articles 28 to 34 during the 
course of the examination.  
Article 35 - Protective Provisions 
7.65 
This is discussed in detail in paras.7.89 to 7.99 of this report. 
Article 35 provides for Schedule 9, which protects the interests of 
statutory undertakers, persons who hold rights which may be 
extinguished, suspended or interfered with by the Order, and 
Tower Regeneration Limited – to have effect. 
Article 36 - Certification of plans etc. 
7.66 
The first draft of the DCO [APP-033] limited certification to: 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
139
 
 
 
the book of reference[APP-055];  
 
the land plans [PD-020];  
 
the works plans [APP-011]; and  
 
the rights of way, streets and access plan [APP-014]. 
 
7.67 
The Applicant's final draft now also includes the: 
 
the environmental statement [APP-019]; 
 
the flood risk assessment [APP-041]; 
 
the design principles statement (contained in Appendix 02 of 
the design and access statement [APP-049]); 
 
the mitigation commitments register [HR-009 ]; 
 
ecological mitigation plan (Requirement 10); 
 
outline construction environmental management plan 
(Requirement 12); 
 
outline lighting strategy (Requirement 16). 
7.68 
The ExA recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix 
D). 
Article 37 - Service of notices 
7.69 
No issues were raised with respect to Article 37 during the course 
of the examination.  
Article 38 - Procedure in relation to certain approvals etc 
7.70 
The ExA queried Article 38(1) as to how this provision could bind 
the consenter to do so in writing, as it purports to do [APP-033].  
The ExA was concerned that if an oral consent was to be 
ineffective, then the 28 day guillotine would then apply, such that 
any conditions on the oral consent would be circumvented ([DEC-
006] question DCO24). 
7.71 
The Applicant noted that Article 38(1) is identical in all material 
respects to Article 46 of The Hinkley Point C (Nuclear Generating 
Station) Order 2013. It was considered appropriate that any 
consent etc. given should be in writing for reasons of certainty and 
transparency [REP-030]. 
7.72 
However, the Applicant agreed that Article 38(1) should be 
amended so it is clear that any decision, whether approval or 
refusal, by a consenting body will only be taken as a valid decision 
for the purposes of the Applicant complying with the Articles 
where such decision is in writing. This will place the consenting 
body on notice that unless it provides its decision in writing, then 
the guillotine provision will apply (deemed approval).  
7.73 
The ExA also expressed concern that a number of provisions e.g. 
Article 8 to Article 14, confer deemed consent if a consultee does 
not respond within 28 days (a‘guillotine’).  The ExA queried 
whether those provisions contain an express requirement that the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
140
 
 
application for consent should contain a statement drawing the 
consultee’s attention to the "guillotine" ([DEC-006] question 
DCO24). 
7.74 
The Applicant amended  Article 38 (Procedure in relation to certain 
approvals etc. ) to provide a procedure in relation to consents and 
approvals required pursuant to the Order i.e. 28 days was 
changed to 56. It applies to all such consents etc., bar those for 
which applications are to be made to the relevant planning 
authority, where a separate more detailed procedure is provided 
for in Schedule 10. The applicant also added paragraph 38(4) to 
require the applicant to draw the consenting body's attention to 
the guillotine when making such an application. 
7.75 
Article 38(3) provides that Schedule 10 applies to all consents 
granted by the relevant planning authority. This provides for 56 
days but also paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 10 provides that the 
parties may agree a longer time period. 
7.76 
This position has been agreed between the Applicant and the 
relevant planning authority (RCT) as set out in paragraph 3.17.1 
of the Statement of Common Ground between the Applicant and 
RCT [REP-031]. 
7.77 
The ExA agrees that this would clarify intentions and powers. Its 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Article 39 - Arbitration 
7.78 
No issues were raised with respect to Article 39 during the course 
of the examination.  
Article 40 - Guarantees in respect of payment of 
compensation 
7.79 
The ExA pursued the question (see paras. 6.33 to 6.41 of this 
report) of what security is being proposed to ensure that the costs 
of acquisition of land and rights can be met in the event that the 
DCO application is approved (e.g. a parent company guarantee), 
at the 24 September 2014 CA  hearing [HR-013]. 
7.80 
The Applicants response was that because the value of land 
acquisition and compensation currently standing at £2.4 million, 
and compared with the funding available [APP-036] to the 
Applicant, it was not considered appropriate for security to be 
provided now [HR-012]. 
7.81 
However, the Applicant was prepared to include in the draft of the 
DCO [PD-012] an Article that follows the SoS's decision on the 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
141
 
 
North Killingholme Order, made on 11 September 201465. The SoS 
imposed an Article (Article 7, Guarantees in respect of payment of 
compensation) that prevents the commencement of the authorised 
development and the undertaker from exercising the compulsory 
acquisition powers unless either a guarantee in respect of the 
liabilities of the undertaker to pay compensation under the Order 
or an alternative form of security for that purpose is in place and 
which has been approved by the relevant planning authority [HR-
012].  
7.82 
RCT did not make any representations relating to the proposed 
Article 40. 
7.83 
Article 40 does not tie the Applicant to providing any particular 
amount or form of security. There would have been more certainty 
about funding for CA liabilities if the Applicant could have agreed a 
form of security now (whether a parent company guarantee or 
otherwise).  
7.84 
However given the Applicant’s overall account of its company 
assets and parent company it is considered on balance reasonable 
to rely on Article 40 (and, therefore, on the role of the Local 
Planning Authority in assessing the amount and form of security). 
 
SCHEDULE 1 - AUTHORISED DEVELOPMENT 
7.85 
The development which would be authorised by the DCO is 
described in Schedule 1 of the Order. The nationally significant 
infrastructure project66 is identified as numbered works 1 to 5. It 
is described as a generating station with a rated electrical output67 
of between 50.1 - 299MWe.  
7.86 
The matters for which development consent is sought can be 
summarised as follows:  
 
A simple cycle gas turbine power generation plant with a 
rated electrical output of between 50.1 and 299 MWe;  
 
An integral underground electrical cable connection line to 
export electricity from the power generation plant into the 
National Grid at Rhigos Substation; and  
 
An integral underground gas pipeline connection to bring 
natural gas to the power generation plant from the existing 
high pressure gas network, including an above ground 
installation and new access.  
                                       
 
65 http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/yorkshire-and-the-humber/north-killingholme-
power-project/ 
66 As defined in s14 and s15 of the PA2008 
67 In the ExA's recommended draft DCO it has inserted into Schedule 1 Authorised Development the 
word "gross" before "rated electrical output". 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
142
 
 
7.87 
A further, more detailed, description of the various elements of the 
authorised development is provided in Schedule 1 of the Order 
and in Section 4 of the ES [APP-019].  
7.88 
The ExA explored whether all the numbered works would be an 
integral part of the generating station in its first round written 
question DCO05 [DEC-006] and at the DCO hearing [HR-007, HR-
009 and HR-010]. 
7.89 
The Applicants response can be viewed at [REP-030] and [HR-
009]. The ExA pursued the following questions at the DCO 
hearing: 
 
Is the generating station by itself the NSIP, with the 
infrastructure required to provide its fuel and to transmit 
electricity once generated being ancillary development? 
 
 
Or is there in reality one project, with the generating station 
and other development forming part of that NSIP? 
7.90 
The Applicant argued that the latter is the appropriate definition of 
the NSIP for the following reasons: 
 
First, this holistic approach is consistent with the wording of 
(i)
the Act: 
 
S.31of the Planning Act 2008 is clear that a DCO can 
and must authorise "development which is or forms 
part of a nationally significant infrastructure project"; 
 
Development involving the simple, physical 
construction of a generating station is clearly caught 
by the relevant s.14 identification of an NSIP; 
 
In the case of a generating station, it also requires a 
fuel supply in order to generate otherwise it cannot 
operate. It would therefore be artificial to suggest that, 
in this case, the gas pipe-line and Above Ground 
Installation that provide that fuel were not part of the 
project for the construction of a generating station; 
 
By the same logic, a generating station needs a means 
of transmitting its generated electricity to the national 
grid, otherwise what is the point of it operating?  
 
Again, it would be artificial to suggest that the electric 
cable that links the generating station to the National 
Grid substation compound was not part of the project 
for the construction of a generating station; 
 
Without the gas pipeline, Above Ground Installation 
and the electric cable, the generating station is simply 
incapable of generating electricity at all.

Second, this approach follows the Secretary of State's 
(ii)
decision on Brechfa, the Order being made on 12 March 
201368. The Order is for a generating station for the purposes 
of s14 of the Planning Act 2008. As part of the decision 
making process, the Secretary of State found that a sub-
station and an access track were not "associated 
development" which would require separate planning 
permission in Wales, but were an integral part of the project, 
the "construction of a generating station." As such, because 
these developments formed an integral part of the Project 
(though strictly speaking they did not directly involve the 
construction of the generating station and did not serve a 
generation purpose) they could even in Wales be made the 
subject of the DCO and 
 Finally, this holistic approach is consistent with the aims and 
(iii)
objectives of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
7.91 
The relevant planning authority, RCT, agrees with this position, as 
set out in paragraph 2.1.2 of the Statement of Common Ground 
with RCT [REP-031]. 
7.92 
The ExA concluded in paras 4.107 to 4.132 of this report, that all 
the numbered works would be an integral part of the generating 
station without which it would not be able to operate.  
7.93 
The text in the final paragraph after Numbered Work 5 in Schedule 
1 could be perceived as been too widely drawn. The ExA is 
satisfied that the flexibility allowed is reasonable because: 
1. It does not allow “any materially new or materially different 
environmental effects from those assessed in the environmental 
statement”. The ES is subject to Certification under Article 36; 
2. It will be constrained by Requirement 4 – Detailed Design and 
3. It will be constrained by Requirement 18 – Amendments to 
approved details. 
 
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS 
7.94 
Schedule 9 of the applicant’s final draft DCO [PD-018] contains 
draft Protective Provisions for the protection of:  
 
National Grid (Part 1); 
 
Western Power Distribution (Part 2);

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
144
 
 
 
Electricity, Gas, Water and Sewerage Undertakers to cover 
SWEL and WWU (Part 3);  
 
Electronic Communications Code Networks to cover BT (Part 
4); 
 
Affected Persons (Part 5);  
 
Tower Regeneration Limited (Part 6) and 
 
Dwr Cymru Cyfyngedig (Welsh Water (Part 7)  
7.95 
The status of these draft Protective Provisions is as follows.  
7.96 
National Grid has withdrawn its representations in relation to 
s.127 and s.138 [AS-022].  The draft Protective Provisions, which 
are in an agreed version, should be incorporated into the final 
DCO.  
7.97 
WPD has withdrawn its representations in relation to s.127 and 
s.138 [REP-009]. The draft Protective Provisions, which are in an 
agreed version, should be incorporated into the final DCO. 
7.98 
The Protective Provisions for Electricity, Gas, Water and Sewerage 
Undertakers to cover SWEL and WWU were not in an agreed 
version by the time that the examination closed.  As no 
representation had been made by either company, s127 of the 
Planning Act 2008 is not engaged.  Given the protective provisions 
in Schedule 9, Part 3 the SoS can be satisfied that any 
extinguishment or removal would be necessary for the purpose of 
carrying out the authorised development (s138(4)). 
7.99 
The Protective Provisions for Electronic Communications Code 
Networks to cover BT were not in an agreed version by the time 
that the examination closed.  As no representation has been 
made, s127 of the Planning Act 2008 is not engaged.   Given the 
protective provisions in Schedule 9, Part 4 the SoS can be satisfied 
that any extinguishment or removal would be necessary for the 
purpose of carrying out the authorised development (s138(4)). 
7.100 Schedule 9, Part 5 provides protective provisions for the protection 
of affected persons with rights or other interests in land which 
may be extinguished, suspended or interfered as a result of the 
authorised development or the powers conferred on the 
undertaker by the Order. 
7.101 Schedule 9, Part 6 provides protective provisions for the protection 
of Tower Regeneration Limited (TRL),  that restricts the 
Applicant from vesting Plots 10_GR and 11_GR in itself and 
commencing any part of the authorised development on plots 
10_GR, 10a_GR, 11_GR and 11a_GR until 1 January 2018.  From 
the responses given by Tower Regeneration Limited at the CA 
Hearing, the ExA believes that TRL is content with this proposal 
[HR-013]. 
7.102 Dwr Cymru Cyfyngedig (Welsh Water DCC) has withdrawn its 
representations in relation to s.127 and s.138 [AS-025].  The draft 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
145
 
 
Protective Provisions, which are in an agreed version, should be 
incorporated into the final DCO.  
7.103 Thus the Protective Provisions for SWEL, WWU, BT and TRL were 
not in an agreed version by the time that the examination closed.  
7.104 The ExA recommends the protective provisions for these parties 
should be endorsed by the SoS for the reasons outlined in paras. 
7.93 to 7.94 of this report, and that, therefore, Schedule 9, Parts 
3, 4, 5 and 6 of the applicant's draft DCO have been incorporated 
into the ExA's recommended DCO (Appendix D). 
 
OTHER SCHEDULES 
7.105 Schedule 3 (Streets subject to permanent and temporary 
alteration of layout) sets out the streets to be permanently altered 
(Part 1) or temporarily altered (Part 2).  
7.106 Schedule 4 (Streets subject to street works) sets out the streets 
that would be subject to street works (including reference to the 
relevant plan, the location and the specific street).  
7.107 Schedule 5 (Temporary prohibition or restriction of the use of 
streets) sets out the streets that will be subject to a temporary 
prohibition or restriction on the use of that street (including 
reference to the relevant plan, the location and the extent of the 
temporary prohibition or restriction on use).  
7.108 Schedule 6 (Access) sets out those parts of accesses that are to be 
maintained at public expense or by the street authority (Parts 1 
and 2 respectively) and those parts of works to restore temporary 
accesses that are to be maintained at public expense or by the 
street authority (Parts 3 and 4 respectively) which are referred to 
in Article 10 of the Order.  
7.109 Schedule 7 (Modification of compensation and compulsory 
purchase enactments for creation of new rights) modifies existing 
compensation legislation including the Land Compensation Act 
1973 and the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965. Schedule 7 [APP-
0033] appeared to be have been taken straight from Schedule 7 of 
the East Anglia One DCO. That DCO sought the ability to 
compulsorily impose restrictive covenants as well create new 
rights, and the Schedule is constructed accordingly. As the 
Hirwaun DCO does not otherwise refer to restrictive covenants, 
the ExA requested that Schedule 7 be corrected in the draft 
version of the DCO ([DEC-006] question DCO32).  The ExA 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
7.110 Schedule 8 (Land of which temporary possession may be taken) 
sets out the land temporary possession of which may be taken 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
146
 
 
pursuant to Article 27. It also makes clear the purpose for which 
such temporary possession may be taken. 
7.111 Schedule 10 (Procedure for discharge of requirements) provides a 
clear procedure for the discharge of requirements by the relevant 
planning authority. It sets out clear time limits for decisions to be 
made within and makes provision for appeals to be made in the 
event of a refusal of an application in relation to a requirement or 
if the relevant planning authority requires further information to 
be provided in relation to that application. It also includes 
procedure for seeking input of statutory consultees.  
7.112 At the ExA's request [DEC-009] a deadline for the SoS in 
Paragraph 3(2)(b) for the appointment of a person to conduct and 
decide an appeal was replaced with the following: 
'… as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the appeal 
documentation.'   
The Applicant noted that this reflects the wording of the Hinkley 
Point C (Nuclear Generating Station) Order 2013 (paragraph 4(1) 
(c) of Schedule 14). The ExA recommended draft DCO shows this 
alteration (Appendix D). 
 
SCHEDULE 2 - REQUIREMENTS 
7.113 Key requirements set out in Schedule 2 of the draft DCO, and 
those which were found to be contentious in the Examination, are 
described in the following paragraphs. An explanation of 
modifications to those set out in the applicant's first draft DCO, 
either agreed by the applicant or suggested by the ExA, are given.  
7.114 The numbering of requirements reflects that of the applicant’s final 
draft DCO, Revision 6 [PD-018].  
Requirement 1 - Interpretation, Definition of commence 
7.115 The term commence is used in the Requirements in Schedule 2 to 
the DCO as the trigger point for complying with certain 
Requirements.  The ExA requested that the Applicant provide a 
definition of commence ([DEC-006] question DCO11). 
7.116 The Applicant provided the following definition of "commence" in 
Schedule 2 as follows: 
' …"commence" means the carrying out of a material operation, as 
defined in section 155 of the Planning Act 2008 (which explains 
when development begins), comprised in or carried out for the 
purposes of the authorised development and the words 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
147
 
 
"commencement" and "commenced" and cognate expressions 
shall be construed accordingly.' 
7.117 The ExA agrees that this would clarify intentions and powers.  The 
ExA has inserted the above definitions in Article 2 (1). The ExA 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Requirement 2 - Time limits; and 
Requirement 3 - Numbered Works 
7.118 No issues were raised with respect to Requirements 2 and 3 during 
the course of the examination. Requirement 2 sets a time limit of 
5 years for the commencement of development; requirement 3 
provides that references in the requirements to numbered works 2 
and 4 encompass works 2A-2G and 4A-4B respectively. 
Requirement 4 - Detailed Design 
7.119 Requirement 4(1) sets out a list of plans in accordance with which 
the authorised development must be carried out. The requirement 
also notes that any documents approved pursuant to the 
requirements themselves will need to be complied with. This is 
more robust wording than that used in the Model provisions but 
carries the model provision principle through.  
7.120 Requirement 4(2) sets a series of parameters for certain buildings 
or structures in order to set the maximum and minimum 
parameters of these. This was introduced in order to align with the 
Environmental Statement [APP-019] and to provide certainty.  
7.121 Requirement 4(3) and 4(4) require details of the layout, scale and 
appearance of numbered work 2 and 4 to be submitted and 
approved by the relevant planning authority (in consultation with 
the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA) was inserted 
following BBNPA request [REP-026]) prior to work commencing on 
that numbered work (insofar as not already approved under 
requirement 6 which provides for approval of new accesses). This 
is because these details will not be known until the technology 
choice has been finalised post-consent. 
7.122 Requirement 4(5) draws in the Design Principles Statement 
(Appendix 02 of [APP-049]) and ensures that relevant numbered 
works are designed substantially in accordance with this. 
7.123 Requirement 4(6) requires that the authorised development is 
carried out substantially in accordance with the mitigation 
measures identified in the Mitigation Commitments Register [HR-
009].  The Mitigation Commitments Register [HR-009] is based on 
the Environmental Mitigation Roadmap [APP-060] which identified 
the mitigation commitments in the Environmental Statement and 
set out how each was secured in the draft Order.

Report to the Secretary of State
Hirwaun Power Project
 
148
 
 
7.124 NRW requested to be named as a consultee in relation to 
Requirements 4, 5, 12 and 16 [REP-019] (in addition to 
Requirements 9 and 10 in which NRW are already a named 
consultee). It was agreed by all IPs that it was not necessary for 
NRW to be consulted in relation to Requirement 5 because this 
relates to localised landscaping only [HR-010]. It was agreed at 
the DCO hearing [HR-010] in relation to Requirements 4(3), 12(1) 
and 16(1) that instead of NRW being named as a consultee, the 
Applicant would update Schedule 10, paragraph 1(7) so that if RCT 
exercises its discretion to consult NRW in relation to the discharge 
of a requirement then, if directed by RCT, the Applicant will 
provide NRW with a copy of the application materials. This was to 
relieve the administrative burden on RCT. The ExA recommended 
draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D). 
Requirement 5 - Provision of landscaping 
7.125 Requirement 5 secures the landscaping proposals set out in the ES 
[APP-019] through the submission of a landscaping plan (which 
must be broadly in accordance with the landscaping mitigation 
proposals set out in Figure 11.5 of the ES [APP-028]) for the 
approval of the relevant planning authority. Landscaping works 
then have to be carried out in accordance with this approved plan 
and to the timescales set out in that plan. This is in the interest of 
avoiding any material effects which were not anticipated and 
assessed through the environmental information presented to the 
examination. 
7.126 The requirement also requires that if any tree or shrub dies or 
becomes seriously damaged or diseased within 5 years of planting 
it must be replaced. This follows the principle of the model 
provision, tailored to reflect the specific details of the authorised 
development. 
Requirement 6 - Highway accesses 
7.127 No issues were raised with respect to Requirement 6 during the 
course of the examination.  
Requirement 7 - Fencing and other means of enclosure 
7.128 Requirement 7 secures the submission of details on all proposed 
permanent and temporary enclosures to the relevant planning 
authority for approval and to be implemented thereafter. This 
follows the model provision save that temporary enclosures must 
be removed within three months of the completion of 
development, rather than on completion to allow flexibility.  
7.129 Requirement 7(5) also secures a set back for permanent gates and 
was included at the request of the RCT [REP-029].  The ExA 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration (Appendix D).

Requirement 8 - Surface and foul water drainage; and 
Requirement 9 - Contaminated land and groundwater 
7.130 No issues were raised with respect to Requirements 8 or 9 during 
the course of the examination.  
Requirement 10 - Ecological Management Plan 
7.131 Requirement 10  is based on a model requirement and requires a 
written ecological management plan covering each numbered work 
to be submitted to the relevant planning authority for approval (in 
consultation with NRW) and to be implemented thereafter. The 
plan is to reflect the mitigation and enhancement measures 
contained in the ES [APP-019] and the ecological mitigation plan. 
The relevant planning authority (RCT) at paragraph 3.8.2 of its 
SoCG with the Applicant agrees that all reasonable mitigation is 
shown in Figure 11.5 and secured in requirements 10 (EMP) and 
12 (CEMP)[REP-031]. 
7.132 Requirement 10(1) originally referred to numbered works 2-5, but 
the ExA requested it was amended to 1-5 [HR-010].  Figure 8.5 
(ecological mitigation) was submitted at Deadline 2 (and 
incorporated into the definition of "environmental statement" in 
revision 2.0 of the draft DCO [PD-008]). The ExA recommended 
draft DCO shows these alterations (Appendix D). 
Requirement  11 - Archaeology 
7.133 No issues were raised with respect to Requirement 11 during the 
course of the examination.  
Requirement 12 - Construction Environment Management 
Plan (CEMP) 
7.134 Requirement 12 is not a model provision, although it does 
incorporate several separate provisions. The requirement secures 
the submission for approval by the relevant planning authority of a 
management plan for the construction phase of the authorised 
development. The plan must be substantially in accordance with 
revision 1.0 of the outline CEMP contained in the ES [APP-019] 
and approved by the relevant planning authority.  Thus the CEMP 
would relate substantially to an outline form on which consultation 
has taken place.  
7.135 The requirement also specifies particular measures that the CEMP 
must contain. The approved CEMP must be implemented for all 
construction works. 
Requirement 13 - Construction traffic 
7.136 Requirement 13 secures the submission of a Construction Traffic 
Management Plan for approval by the relevant planning authority 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Report to the Secretary of State 
Hirwaun Power Project

(in consultation with the Welsh Government). The provision 
specifies particular measures that the plan needs to contain. The 
approved plan must be implemented. The Welsh Government 
agreed the wording of this Requirement with the Applicant [RR-
07]. The ExA recommended draft DCO shows these alterations 
(Appendix D). 
Requirement 14 - Construction hours 
7.137 Requirement 14 is based on a model provision and specifies the 
hours within which construction works and the delivery and 
removal of materials can take place. The requirement does not 
prevent the undertaker from undertaking these works outside the 
specified hours but this must be done with the prior, written 
approval of the relevant planning authority. 
7.138 Requirement 14(3) defining start up and shut down periods was 
removed at the request of RCT because of their concerns over 
noise [REP-031]. The ExA recommended draft DCO shows these 
alterations (Appendix D). 
Requirement 15 - Control of noise during the operational 
phase 
7.139 Requirement 15 is based on a model provision and specifies the 
noise limits for the operational phase of the authorised 
development and a complaints procedure. 
7.140 At the ExA's suggestion [DEC-006] a requirement for some action 
to be taken in respect of the measurements, e.g. for them to be 
submitted to the relevant planning authority at (specified) regular 
intervals (Requirement 15(3)) was inserted. 
7.141 RCT agreed the wording of this Requirement with the Applicant 
[REP-031]. The ExA recommended draft DCO shows these 
alterations (Appendix D). 
Requirement 16 - Control of artificial light emissions 
7.142 Requirement 16 is based on a model provision and requires the 
submission of a written scheme for the management and 
mitigation of artificial light emissions (which must be substantially 
in accordance with the outline lighting strategy) for the approval of 
the relevant planning authority (in consultation with the BBNPA). 
The approved scheme must be implemented. 
7.143 Appendix 11.2 (lighting strategy) was submitted at Deadline 2 
(and incorporated into the definition of "environmental statement" 
in revision 2.0 of the draft DCO), compliance with which is secured 
by Requirement 16 [AS-011].  
____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Report to the Secretary of State 
Hirwaun Power Project

7.144 BBNPA has agreed to Requirement 16 in the draft DCO, as 
confirmed in paragraph 2.7.8 of the SoCG between the BBNPA and 
the Applicant [REP-033]. 
Requirement 17 - Decommissioning strategy 
7.145 No issues were raised with respect to Requirement 17 during the 
course of the examination.  
Requirement 18 - Amendments to approved details 
7.146 Requirement 18 is based on a model provision and allows the 
relevant planning authority to approve amendments to details or 
plans already specified or approved. This is to allow flexibility but 
only within the parameters that have been assessed in the ES 
[APP-019]. 
7.147 Requirement 18(1) originally dealt only with amendments to 
“other plans, details or schemes”. The ExA requested that it also 
deal with other ‘matters’ –such as approvals to out of hours 
working under Requirement 14. The Applicant agreed to this 
amendment. The ExA believes that enabling the LPA to vary the 
plans and parameters that have been subject to examination and 
the eventual SoS decision is inappropriate, as it could be seen to 
be circumventing the statutory process for modification of DCOs69.   
7.148 Requirement 18(2) originally only applied to amendments to the 
parameters in Requirement 4(2). The ExA requested that it also 
apply to all approvals by the relevant planning authority, so as to 
ensure that the development as built will be within the confines of 
what was assessed in the ES [APP-0019]. The Applicant agreed to 
this amendment. 
7.149 The ExA believes Requirement 18 provides a reasonable but 
limited degree of flexibility in implementation of Requirement 4, 
which will in the first instance have been subject to approval by 
the relevant planning authorities (RCT and BBNPA). The ExA does 
not consider that it will enable fundamental changes to be made to 
the nature of the development.  Requirement 18(2) now explicitly 
limits such flexibility to be applied to be within the parameters 
considered in the ES. Such amendments are restricted to those for 
which there would be no materially different environmental 
effects. 
7.150 The ExA recommended draft DCO shows these alterations 
(Appendix D).

Requirement 19 - Date of final commissioning and 
cessation 
7.151 The Applicant has included a new Requirement 19 in its final 
version of the draft DCO, that the Applicant must notify Rhondda 
Cynon Taf County Borough Council of the date of final 
commissioning so that anyone affected by the DCO can obtain the 
"date of final commissioning" from Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council [REP-030]. 
7.152 The ExA agrees that this would clarify intentions and powers. Our 
recommended draft DCO shows this alteration. 
7.153 No issues were raised with respect to Requirement 19 during the 
course of the examination.  
 
Requirement 20 - Provision of details to the Ministry of 
Defence 
7.154 A new Requirement 20 was included in revision 2.0 of the draft 
DCO [PD-008]. This is in the form requested by the Defence 
Infrastructure Organisation, subject to removing part (f) because 
the Applicant has confirmed there will be no lighting requirements. 
7.155 The CAA in their Relevant Representation [RR-001] and their 
Written Representation [REP-011] confirm they do not believe 
there is a need for lighting. 
Requirement 21 - Operational limits 
7.156 Requirement 21 was inserted at the request of the ExA (Question 
OM2-02 [DEC-009]).  It secures that in any calendar year the 
operation of the gas turbine generators comprised in numbered 
work 2A shall not exceed 1500 hours in total. This is the maximum 
number of hours assessed in the ES [APP-019] and so this 
requirement ensures that the authorised development is operated 
in accordance with the worst case scenario assessed. 
Requirement 22 - Site investigation 
7.157 Requirement 22 secures the carrying out of a geotechnical site 
investigation and preparation of a report for approval by the 
relevant planning authority in respect of numbered work 4A and 
for the authorised development to be carried out in accordance 
with the ground precautions recommended in the approved report. 
This requirement was included at the request of the Coal Authority 
who approved the wording [RR-005]. This Requirement was 
originally numbered 9A. The ExA recommended draft DCO shows 
this alteration (Appendix D).

OTHER LEGAL AGREEMENTS 
7.158 The applicant and RCT, International Greetings UK and HSBC have 
agreed a section 106 Agreement under the 1990 Act (Appendices 
E1-E3 of [REP-048]).  It contains obligations relating to the 
following matters: 
 
Bus stop improvements; 
(i)
 
Landscaping and amenity improvements; 
(ii)
 Vehicular Crossover reinstatement 
(iii)
 Monitoring contribution to NRW; 
(iv)
 Local services scheme; 
(v)
 Young recruits programme and  
(vi)
 Bog reinstatement activities. 
(vii)
7.159 The obligation meets the aims of local RCT LDP Policy AW4 – 
Community Infrastructure & Planning Obligations, which provides 
for planning obligations to be sought where necessary to make 
proposals acceptable in land use planning terms.  The matters 
covered by the section 106 are important and relevant and have 
been accorded appropriate weight in this report. 
7.160 The tests for the acceptability of planning obligations are that they 
should be necessary to make the development acceptable in 
planning terms; directly related to the development; and fairly and 
reasonably related in scale and kind to the development. The ExA 
considers that the obligations within the section 106 Agreement 
satisfy these tests.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
8.1 
The Examining Authority (ExA) considers that the application is in 
line with, and supports, the Governments policy objectives for 
energy as set out in National Policy Statements EN-1 (Overarching 
National Policy Statement for Energy) and EN-2 (Fossil Fuel 
Electricity Generating Infrastructure). 
8.2 
The ExA considers that this project contributes to meeting the 
need for energy capacity and, in doing so, will bring benefits to the 
area in terms of economic activity. 
8.3 
The ExA considers that the application fulfils the relevant legal 
requirements including the UK Government’s relevant international 
obligations. 
8.4 
The ExA also had regard to the Local Impact Reports (LIRs) 
submitted by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCT) 
and Brecon Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA).  
8.5 
In the ExA's view the evidence presented in the examination does 
not allow the conclusion that there would be no likely significant 
effects on Blaen Cynon SAC as a result of the combined aerial 
emissions from the Project and other developments in the vicinity.  
Therefore, the SoS, as the competent authority, will need to carry 
out an Appropriate Assessment (AA). Taking into account the 
Applicant's initial assessment, additional material provided during 
the Examination and the proposed mitigation measures secured 
through the DCO, the ExA accepts the Applicant's and NRW's 
conclusion that the project would not put the UK in breach of the 
Habitats Directive and that there would be no significant adverse 
effect on the integrity of the European site identified.  
8.6 
The ExA concludes that whilst there are impacts of the scheme in 
terms of ecology and landscape and visual impact, the 
recommended draft DCO (Appendix D) contains sufficient 
measures to mitigate those impacts. It is concluded, therefore, 
that the benefits of this proposal would outweigh its impacts.  
8.7 
The ExA concludes that the project as applied for conforms to, and 
supports, Welsh and local planning policy. 
8.8 
The ExA have considered the requests for powers to compulsorily 
acquire land and rights which formed part of the application. It 
concludes that, in respect of all the plots, the requests for powers 
meet the tests set out in statute and in guidance.  
8.9 
The ExA therefore recommends that the Secretary of State should 
give consent to the application in the terms of the draft DCO 
attached at Appendix D.

An application has been made to the Secretary of State in accordance with the Infrastructure 
Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(a). 
The application was examined by a single appointed person (appointed by the Secretary of State) 
in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the Planning Act 2008(b) (“the 2008 Act”). 
The single appointed person, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and 
the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 83 of the 
2008 Act, has submitted a report to the Secretary of State.  
The Secretary of State, having considered the report and recommendation of the single appointed 
person, and decided the application, has determined to make an Order giving effect to the 
proposals comprised in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of 
State do not make any substantial change to the proposals. 
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 103, 114, 115, 120 and 122 
of the 2008 Act, makes the following Order— 
(a) S.I. 2009/2264 as amended by the Localism Act 2011 (Infrastructure Planning) (Consequential Amendments) Regulations 
2012 (S.I. 2012/635) and the Infrastructure Planning (Prescribed Consultees and Interested Parties etc) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/522). There are other amendments to the Regulations which are not relevant to this Order.

taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the 
street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic. 
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), a court is, in particular, to have regard to 
the following matters— 
(a) the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use 
it; 
(b) the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such 
traffic; 
(c) the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;

condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to 
users of the street; and 
(e) where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the 
street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been 
displayed. 
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the undertaker had arranged for a 
competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the street to which 
the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given that person proper 
instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that those instructions had been 
carried out.

physically stopped up by the undertaker in connection with the carrying out of the authorised 
development, the public rights of way over the aforementioned section will be extinguished. 
(2) The undertaker must not stop up the public right of way described in sub-paragraph (1) 
unless and until it has constructed and made available for public use the alternative replacement 
section of the public right of way shown marked by a pecked blue line on the rights of way, streets 
 
10
 
and access plan and, with effect from the date of opening of such replacement section of public 
right of way to the public following completion of any works relating thereto, public rights of way 
of the same type, namely use as a footpath, over the replacement section will be deemed to be 
created.

(a) any street specified in paragraph (4) without first consulting the street authority; and 
(b) any other street without the consent of the street authority which may attach reasonable 
conditions to any consent. 
(6) If a street authority fails to notify the undertaker of its decision within 56 days of receiving 
an application for consent under paragraph (5)(b) that street authority is deemed to have granted 
consent.

under sections 1, 9 or 22BB of the 1984 Act. 
Access to works 
13.—(1) The undertaker may, for the purposes of the authorised development—

to a compulsory purchase order, the acquiring authority must include the particulars 
specified in subsection (3) in a notice which is— 
(a) given to every person with a relevant interest in the land with respect to which the 
declaration is to be made (other than a mortgagee who is not in possession); and 
(b) published in a local newspaper circulating in the area in which the land is situated.
”. 
(4) (In that section, in subsection (2), for “(1)(b)” there is substituted “(1)” and after “given” 
there is inserted “and published”. 
(5) In that section, for subsections (5) and (6) there is substituted— 
“(5) For the purposes of this section, a person has a relevant interest in land if— 
(a) that person is for the time being entitled to dispose of the fee simple of the land, 
whether in possession or in reversion; or 
(b) that person holds, or is entitled to the rents and profits of, the land under a lease or

Acquisition of subsoil only 
24.—(1) The undertaker may acquire compulsorily so much of, or such rights in, the subsoil 
of the land referred to in paragraph (1) of article 17 (compulsory acquisition of land) and 
paragraph (1) of article 21 (compulsory acquisition of rights etc.) as may be required for any 
purpose for which that land may be acquired under that provision instead of acquiring the 
whole of the land. 
(2) Where the undertaker acquires any part of, or rights in, the subsoil of land under paragraph 
(1), the undertaker is to not be required to acquire an interest in any other part of the land. 
(3) Paragraph (2) does not prevent article 25 (acquisition of part of certain properties) from 
applying where the undertaker acquires a cellar, vault, arch or other construction forming part of a 
house, building or manufactory. 
Acquisition of part of certain properties 
25.—(1) This article applies instead of section 8(1) of the 1965 Act (other provisions as to 
divided land) (as applied by section 125 of the 2008 Act) where— 
(a) a notice to treat is served on a person (“the owner”) under the 1965 Act (as so applied) in 
respect of land forming only part of a house, building or manufactory or of land 
consisting of a house with a park or garden (“the land subject to the notice to treat”); and 
(b) a copy of this article is served on the owner with the notice to treat. 
(2) In such a case, the owner may, within the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which 
the notice was served, serve on the undertaker a counter-notice objecting to the sale of the land 
subject to the notice to treat which states that the owner is willing and able to sell the whole (“the 
land subject to the counter-notice”). 
 
17
 
(3) If no such counter-notice is served within that period, the owner is to be required to sell the 
land subject to the notice to treat. 
(4) If such a counter-notice is served within that period, the question whether the owner is 
required to sell only the land subject to the notice to treat is to be, unless the undertaker agrees to 
take the land subject to the counter-notice, referred to the tribunal. 
(5) If on such a reference the tribunal determines that the land subject to the notice to treat can 
be taken— 
(a) without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice; or 
(b) where the land subject to the notice to treat consists of a house with a park or garden, 
without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice and 
without seriously affecting the amenity and convenience of the house, 
the owner is to be required to sell the land subject to the notice to treat. 
(6) If on such a reference the tribunal determines that only part of the land subject to the notice 
to treat can be taken— 
(a) without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice; or 
(b) where the land subject to the notice to treat consists of a house with a park or garden, 
without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice and 
without seriously affecting the amenity and convenience of the house, 
the notice to treat is to be deemed to be a notice to treat for that part. 
(7) If on such a reference the tribunal determines that— 
(a) the land subject to the notice to treat cannot be taken without material detriment to the 
remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice; but 
(b) the material detriment is confined to a part of the land subject to the counter-notice, 
the notice to treat is to be deemed to be a notice to treat for the land to which the material 
detriment is confined in addition to the land already subject to the notice, whether or not the 
additional land is land which the undertaker is authorised to acquire compulsorily under this 
Order. 
(8) If the undertaker agrees to take the land subject to the counter-notice, or if the tribunal 
determines that— 
(a) none of the land subject to the notice to treat can be taken without material detriment to 
the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice or, as the case may be, without 
material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice and without 
seriously affecting the amenity and convenience of the house; and 
(b) the material detriment is not confined to a part of the land subject to the counter-notice, 
the notice to treat is to be deemed to be a notice to treat for the land subject to the counter-
notice whether or not the whole of that land is land which the undertaker is authorised to 
acquire compulsorily under this Order. 
(9) Where, by reason of a determination by the tribunal under this article, a notice to treat is 
deemed to be a notice to treat for less land or more land than that specified in the notice, the 
undertaker may, within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the determination 
is made, withdraw the notice to treat; and, in that event, must pay the owner compensation for any 
loss or expense occasioned to the owner by the giving and withdrawal of the notice, to be 
determined in case of dispute by the tribunal. 
(10) Where the owner is required under this article to sell only part of a house, building or 
manufactory or of land consisting of a house with a park or garden, the undertaker must pay the 
owner compensation for any loss sustained by the owner due to the severance of that part in 
addition to the value of the interest acquired. 
 
18
 
Rights under or over streets 
26.—(1) The undertaker may enter upon and appropriate so much of the subsoil of, or air-
space over, any street within the Order limits as may be required for the purposes of the 
authorised development and may use the subsoil or air-space for those purposes or any other 
purpose ancillary to the authorised development. 
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the undertaker may exercise any power conferred by paragraph (1) 
in relation to a street without being required to acquire any part of the street or any easement or 
right in the street.

(4) Subject to paragraph (5), any person who is an owner or occupier of land in respect of which 
the power of appropriation conferred by paragraph (1) is exercised without the undertaker 
acquiring any part of that person’s interest in the land, and who suffers loss by the exercise of that 
power, is to be entitled to compensation to be determined, in case of dispute, under Part 1 of the 
1961 Act. 
(5) Compensation is not be payable under paragraph (4) to any person who is an undertaker to

development—

OPERATIONS 
Felling or lopping of trees 
31.—(1) The undertaker may fell or lop any tree or shrub near any part of the authorised 
development, or cut back its roots, if it reasonably believes it to be necessary to do so to 
prevent the tree or shrub— 
(a) from obstructing or interfering with the construction, maintenance or operation of the 
authorised development or any apparatus used in connection with the authorised 
development; or 
(b) from constituting a danger to persons using the authorised development. 
(2) In carrying out any activity authorised by paragraph (1), the undertaker must do no 
unnecessary damage to any tree or shrub and must pay compensation to any person for any loss or 
damage arising from such activity.

amount of compensation, is to be determined under Part 1 of the 1961 Act. 
 
PART 7 
MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL 
Application of landlord and tenant law 
32.—(1) This article applies to— 
(a) any agreement for leasing to any person the whole or any part of the authorised 
development or the right to operate the same; and 
(b) any agreement entered into by the undertaker with any person for the construction, 
maintenance, use or operation of the authorised development, or any part of it, 
so far as any such agreement relates to the terms on which any land which is the subject of a 
lease granted by or under that agreement is to be provided for that person’s use. 
(2) No enactment or rule of law regulating the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants 
prejudices the operation of any agreement to which this article applies. 
(3) Accordingly, no such enactment or rule of law applies in relation to the rights and 
obligations of the parties to any lease granted by or under any such agreement so as to— 
(a) exclude or in any respect modify any of the rights and obligations of those parties under 
the terms of the lease, whether with respect to the termination of the tenancy or any other 
matter; 
(b) confer or impose on any such party any right or obligation arising out of or connected 
with anything done or omitted on or in relation to land which is the subject of the lease, in 
addition to any such right or obligation provided for by the terms of the lease; or 
(c) restrict the enforcement (whether by action for damages or otherwise) by any party to the 
lease of any obligation of any other party under the lease. 
Cases in which land is to be treated as not being operational land 
33. Development consent granted by this Order insofar as it relates to numbered works 2 and 
4A described in Schedule 1 is to be treated as specific planning permission for the purposes of 
section 264(3)(a) of the 1990 Act (Cases in which land is to be treated as not being operational 
land).

Defence to proceedings in respect of statutory nuisance 
34.—(1) Where proceedings are brought under section 82(1) of the Environmental Protection 
Act 1990 (summary proceedings by persons aggrieved by statutory nuisances)(a) in relation to 
a nuisance falling within paragraph (g) of section 79(1) of that Act (noise emitted from 
premises so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance) no order is to be made, and no fine may 
be imposed, under section 82(2) of that Act if— 
(a) the defendant shows that the nuisance— 
(i) relates to premises used by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with 
the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that the nuisance 
is attributable to the carrying out of the authorised development in accordance with a 
notice served under section 60 (control of noise on construction sites), or a consent 
given under section 61 (prior consent for work on construction sites) or 65 (noise 
exceeding registered level), of the Control of Pollution Act 1974(b); or 
(ii) is a consequence of the construction or maintenance of the authorised development 
and that it cannot reasonably be avoided; or 
(b) the defendant shows that the nuisance is a consequence of the use of the authorised 
development and that it cannot reasonably be avoided. 
(2) Section 61(9) (consent for work on construction site to include statement that it does not of 
itself constitute a defence to proceedings under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 and section 65(8) of that Act (corresponding provision 
in relation to consent for registered noise level to be exceeded), is not to apply where the consent 
relates to the use of premises by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the 
construction or maintenance of the authorised development.

SCHEDULE 7 
Article 21 
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY 
PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS 
Compensation enactments 
1. The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the
compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, 
in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right 
as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in 
land. 
2.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 1 1, the Land Compensation Act 
1973(a) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2) and (3). 
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for 
injurious affection under section 7 of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 4— 
(a) for the words “land is acquired or taken” there are substituted the words “a right or 
restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and 
(b) for the words “acquired or taken from him” there are substituted the words “over which 
the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”. 
(3) In section 58(1) (determination of material detriment where part of house etc. proposed for 
compulsory acquisition), as it applies to determinations under section 8 of the 1965 Act as 
substituted by paragraph 5— 
(a) for the word “part” in paragraph (a) and (b) there are substituted the words “a right over 
or restrictive covenant affecting land consisting”; 
(b) for he word “severance” there are substituted the words “right or restrictive covenant over 
or affecting the whole of the park or garden”; 
(c) for the words “part proposed” there are substituted the words “right or restrictive 
covenant proposed”; and 
(d) for the words “part is” there are substituted the words “right or restrictive covenant is”. 
Application of the 1965 Act 
3.—(1) The 1965 Act has effect with the modifications necessary to make it apply to the 
compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the 
imposition under this Order of a restrictive covenant, as it applies to the compulsory acquisition 
under this Order of land, so that, in appropriate contexts, references in that Act to land are read 
(according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including 
references to— 
(a) the right acquired or to be acquired; or 
(b) the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable. 
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-paragraph (1), Part 1 of the 1965 Act applies in 
relation to the compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right 
with the modifications specified in the following provisions of this Schedule. 
4. For section 7 of the 1965 Act (measure of compensation) there is substituted the following
section— 
“7. In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard 
must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right 
(a) 1973 (c.26). 
47
is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition 
of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by 
the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously 
affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”. 
5. For section 8 of the 1965 Act (provisions as to divided land) there is substituted the
following section— 
“8.—(1) Where in consequence of the service on a person under section 5 of this Act of a 
notice to treat in respect of a right over land consisting of a house, building or manufactory 
or of a park or garden belonging to a house (“the relevant land”)— 
(a) a question of disputed compensation in respect of the purchase of the right or the 
imposition of the restrictive covenant would apart from this section fall to be 
determined by the Upper Tribunal (“the tribunal”); and 
(b) before the tribunal has determined that question the tribunal is satisfied that the 
person has an interest in the whole of the relevant land and is able and willing to 
sell that land and— 
(i) where that land consists of a house, building or manufactory, that the right 
cannot be purchased or the restrictive covenant imposed without material 
detriment to that land; or 
(ii) where the land consists of such a park or garden, that the right cannot be 
purchased or the restrictive covenant imposed without seriously affecting the 
amenity or convenience of the house to which that land belongs, 
The Hirwaun Power (Gas Fired Power Station) Order 201[X] (“the Order”) ceases, in 
relation to that person, to authorise the purchase of the right and be deemed to authorise the 
purchase of that person’s interest in the whole of the relevant land including, where the land 
consists of such a park or garden, the house to which it belongs, and the notice is deemed to 
authorise the purchase of that person’s interest in the whole of the relevant land including, 
where the land consists of such a park or garden, the house to which it belongs, and the 
notice is deemed to have been served in respect of that interest on such date as the tribunal 
directs. 
(2) Any question as to the extent of the land in which the Order is deemed to authorise the 
purchase of an interest by virtue of subsection (1) of this section must be determined by the 
tribunal. 
(3) Where in consequence of a determination of the tribunal that it is satisfied as 
mentioned in subsection (1) of this section the Order is deemed by virtue of that subsection 
to authorise the purchase of an interest in land, the acquiring authority may, at any time 
within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the date of the determination, withdraw the 
notice to treat in consequence of which the determination was made; but nothing in this 
subsection prejudices any other power of the authority to withdraw the notice.”. 
6. The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in
various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that 
is to say— 
(a) section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey); 
(b) paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity); 
(c) paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and 
(d) paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land), 
are modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to 
be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive 
covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority. 
7. Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified as to secure that, as from the date
on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right it has power, 
48
exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the 
purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this 
purpose to have been created on that date of service of the notice); and sections 12 (penalty for 
unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are 
modified correspondingly. 
8. Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will, etc.) applies with the
modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in 
that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be 
compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account 
only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely 
to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in 
question. 
9. Section 22 of the 1965 Act (protection of acquiring authority’s possession where by
inadvertence an estate, right or interest has not been got in) is modified as to enable the 
acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to 
continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as 
respects compensation.

SCHEDULE 9 
Article 35 
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS 
PART 1 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL GRID 
Application 
1. For the protection of National Grid as referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following
provisions shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, 
have effect. 
Interpretation 
2. In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means appropriate alternative apparatus to the satisfaction of National 
Grid to enable National Grid to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner no less efficient than 
previously; 
“apparatus” means 
(a) electric lines or electrical plant as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(a), belonging to or 
maintained by National Grid; 
(b) mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by National Grid for the 
purposes of gas supply; 
“authorised development” has the same meaning as in article 2 of this Order and (unless 
otherwise specified) for the purposes of this Schedule shall include the use and maintenance of 
the authorised development; 
“commence” has the same meaning as under section 56 of the 1990 Act and means the earliest 
date on which any material operation comprised in the authorised development begins to be 
carried out and commencement shall be construed to have the same meaning; 
“functions” includes powers and duties; 
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to 
apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over, across, along or upon such land; 
“plan” or “plans” include all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil 
reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably 
necessary properly and sufficiently to describe and assess the works to be executed; 
“National Grid” means either— 
(a) National Grid Electricity Transmission PLC (Company No. 2366977) whose registered 
office is at 1-3 Strand, London, WC2N 5EH; or 
(b) National Grid Gas PLC (Company No. 200600) whose registered office is at 1-3 Strand, 
London, WC2N 5EH, 
as the context shall require. 
3. Except for paragraphs 4 (apparatus in streets subject to temporary prohibition or
restriction), 8, 9 (retained apparatus: protection), 10 (expenses) and 11 (indemnity) this 
(a) 1989 (c.29). 
54
Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker 
and National Grid are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act. 
Apparatus of National Grid in streets subject to temporary prohibition or restriction 
4. Notwithstanding the temporary prohibition or restriction under the powers of article 12
(temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), National Grid shall be at liberty at all 
times to take all necessary access across any such street and/or to execute and do all such works 
and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to 
enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that 
street. 
Acquisition of land 
5.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or 
contained in the book of reference to the Order the undertaker must not acquire any land 
interest or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than 
by agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld). 
(2) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication 
between the provisions set out in this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of 
apparatus/including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such 
relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, 
agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid as of right or other 
use in relation to the apparatus then the provisions in this Schedule shall prevail. 
Removal of apparatus 
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph (5) or in 
any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any 
apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and 
any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land shall not be extinguished until 
alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of 
National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works comprised in the authorised development in, on, 
under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker 
requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid 56 days’ 
advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the 
proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if 
in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid 
reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker shall, subject to sub-paragraph 
(3), afford to National Grid to their satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 7 sub-paragraph (1) 
below) the necessary facilities and rights for— 
(a) the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and 
(b) subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from 
the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain 
the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed 
save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its 
compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this 
Schedule shall be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between National Grid and the undertaker. 
55
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been 
agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to 
in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into 
operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the 
undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule. 
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus 
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to National Grid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the 
undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities 
and rights shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the 
undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid 
than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless 
agreed by National Grid. 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with National Grid 
under paragraph 7 sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms 
and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on 
the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to 
be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the 
matter shall be referred to arbitration and, the arbitrator shall make such provision for the payment 
of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable 
having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. In respect of the appointment of an 
arbitrator under this sub-paragraph (2), article 39 of the Order shall apply. 
Retained apparatus: protection of National Grid as Gas Undertaker 
8.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any authorised development 
authorised by this Order that involves activities or works specified in National Grid’s 
“Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas pipelines

proximities described therein to any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by 
the undertaker under paragraph 6 sub paragraph (2) or otherwise, the undertaker must submit to 
National Grid a plan. 
(2) In relation to works which will be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in 
any direction of any apparatus to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, or (wherever situated) impose 
any load directly upon any such apparatus or involve embankment works within 15 metres of any 
such apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) shall show— 
(a) the exact position of the works; 
(b) the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed; 
(c) the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of 
plant etc.; 
(d) the position of all apparatus; 
(e) by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such 
apparatus;

56
(a) may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-
paragraph (5) or (7); 
(b) must not be unreasonably withheld. 
(5) In relation to a work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) applies, National Grid may require

securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus. 
(6) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) shall be executed only in accordance with 
the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub paragraph (2), as amended from 
time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such 
reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (4), (5), (7) and/or (8) 
by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing 
access to it, and National Grid shall be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works. 
(7) Where National Grid requires protective works to be carried out either themselves or by the 
undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works shall be carried 
out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised development (or 
any relevant part thereof) and National Grid must give 56 days’ notice of such works from the date 
of submission of a plan in line with sub-paragraph (1) or (2) (except in an emergency). 
(8) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) and in consequence of the 
works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives 
written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 7 shall apply as if 
the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6 sub-paragraph 
(2). 
(9) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less that 56 days before commencing the execution of any works, a 
new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this 
paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan. 
(10) The undertaker shall not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to 
carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National 
Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and shall— 
(a) comply with sub-paragraph (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances; and 
(b) comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times. 
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order comply with National 
Grid’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in

(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3)— 
(a) may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-
paragraph (5) or (8); 
(b) must not be unreasonably withheld. 
(6) In relation to a work to which sub-paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may 
require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose

(10) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any works, a 
new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this 
paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan. 
(11) The undertaker shall not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to 
carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National 
Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and shall 
(a) comply with sub-paragraph (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances; and 
(b) comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times. 
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order comply with National 
Grid’s policies for development near over headlines ENA TA 43-8 and the Health and Safety 
Executive’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”. 
Expenses 
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker shall pay to 
National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by 
that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, 
alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may 
be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this 
Schedule including without limitation— 
(a) any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the 
acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including 
without limitation in the event that National Grid elects to use compulsory purchase 
powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 6 sub-paragraph (3) all costs 
incurred as a result of such action; 
(b) in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of 
any alternative apparatus; 
(c) the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant 
apparatus; 
(d) the approval of plans; 
(e) the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of 
maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; 
(f) the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the 
installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of 
the execution of any such works referred to in this Schedule. 
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the 
alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or in default of 
agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) of the Order to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of 
this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had 
been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, 
59
the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue 
of sub-paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not 
possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or 
place at the existing depth in which case full costs shall be borne by the undertaker. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus shall 
not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus; and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be 
necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole shall be 
treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in 
respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) shall, if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
Indemnity 
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any works authorised by this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, 
use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the 
undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed 
or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works (including without limitation 
works carried out by the undertaker under this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any 
of these works), any material damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other 
than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal 
for the purposes of those works) or property of National Grid , or there is any interruption in 
any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid , or National Grid 
becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker shall— 
(a) bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by National Grid in making good 
such damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, 
claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in 
consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any 
third party as aforesaid. 
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the 
undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any 
requirement of National Grid as a consequence of the authorised development or under its 
supervision shall not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under 
the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) where the undertaker fails to carry out and execute the 
works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a 
manner that does not materially accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the 
undertaker and National Grid. 
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of— 
(a) any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of 
National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and 
(b) any authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Schedule carried 
out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit 
of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act or under Article 6 of the Order 
subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any 
works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3(b) shall be subject to 
the full terms of this Schedule including this paragraph 11 in respect of such new 
apparatus. 
60
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and 
no settlement or compromise shall be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering 
their representations. 
(5) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to 
minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this 
paragraph 11 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, National Grid shall provide an 
explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this 
paragraph 11 for claims reasonably incurred by National Grid. 
Enactments and agreements 
12. Nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall affect the provisions of any enactment or
agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made. 
Co-operation 
13. National Grid and the undertaker must each use their best endeavours to co-ordinate with
the other party on the timing and method of execution of any works carried out under the Order 
or this Schedule (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to paragraph 6 sub-paragraph 
(2) and paragraphs 8 or 12) in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution 
of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient 
operation of the other party’s operations. 
Access 
14. If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 5 sub-
paragraph (1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially 
obstructed, the undertaker shall provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as 
will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible 
before such obstruction. 
Arbitration 
15. Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 6(2), 6(4), 7(1), 8 and 9 any
difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Schedule 
shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be 
determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) of the Order. 
61
PART 2 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF WESTERN POWER DISTRIBUTION 
16. For the protection of WPD as referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following
provisions, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and WPD, have effect. 
17. In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable WPD to fulfil its 
statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously; 
“alternative rights” means all and any necessary legal easements, consents, or permissions 
required by WPD in order to permit or authorise a diversion; 
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant as defined in the Electricity Act 1989, 
belonging to or maintained by WPD; 
“diversion” means an alteration to the WPD Network in order to enable or facilitate the 
authorised development; 
“WPD” means Western Power Distribution (South Wales) PLC (company number 02366985) 
whose registered office is at Avonbank, Feeder Road, Bristol BS2 0TB; 
“WPD Network” means WPD’s distribution network operated pursuant to its distribution 
licence issued pursuant to section 6 of the 1989 Act; and 
for the avoidance of doubt, all other terms are as defined in Part 1 of the Order. 
18. This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations
between the undertaker and WPD are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act. 
19. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
20.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under 
this Part of this Schedule and any right of WPD to maintain that apparatus in that land must not 
be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the 
reasonable satisfaction of WPD. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, it must give to WPD written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and 
section of the work proposed. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed as a consequence of 
the removal of apparatus placed on the land referred to in sub-paragraph 20(2), WPD must on 
receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its 
reasonable endeavours to obtain the alternative rights in other land in which the alternative 
apparatus is to be constructed. 
(4) WPD must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or 
settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 of the Order and after the grant to WPD of any 
alternative rights, proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the 
alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be 
removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule. 
(5) In respect of apparatus on plots numbered 1_MS and 3_MS in the book of reference and land 
plans— 
(a) if requested by the undertaker, WPD must remove any of its apparatus within a building 
on those plots (or relocate such apparatus as applicable) within 56 days of the undertaker 
making such a request, unless factors outside the control of WPD prevent such a removal 
or relocation within the 56 day time period (for the avoidance of doubt the 56 day period 
62
shall only begin once all necessary consents and permissions for the relevant removal or 
relocation have been granted); and 
(b) WPD and the undertaker may agree for the undertaker to remove or relocate as applicable 
any of such apparatus; and 
(c) following the removal or relocation by WPD or the undertaker (as applicable) under sub-
paragraph 20(5)(a) or 20(5)(b), the undertaker may demolish such building(s). 
21.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may 
affect any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under 
paragraph 20(2), the undertaker must submit to WPD a plan, section and description of the 
works to be executed. For the avoidance of doubt, if any works referred to require any 
diversion or require WPD to obtain any alternative rights, the undertaker shall give WPD 
sufficient notice to obtain any such alternative rights and shall not commence works of the type 
described unless or until any such alternative rights have been obtained. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub-paragraph 21(1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub-paragraph 21(3) by WPD for the alteration or otherwise for the 
protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it. 
(3) Any requirements made by WPD under sub-paragraph 21(2) must be made within a 
reasonable period beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-
paragraph 21(1) are submitted to it. 
(4) If WPD in accordance with sub-paragraph 21(3) and in consequence of the works proposed 
by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the 
undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 16 to 20 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had 
been required by the undertaker under paragraph 20(2)). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than the reasonable period provided for in sub-paragraph 21(3) before 
commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, 
section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph 
apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph 21(1) in a case of emergency 
but in that case it must give to WPD notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section 
and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply 
with sub-paragraph 21(1)) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. 
22.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to 
WPD the proper and reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by WPD in, or in connection 
with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus. 
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of the Schedule is to be 
deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph 22(1), that value being calculated after 
removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the 
placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default 
of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 of the Order 
to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this 
Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus 
placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as 
63
the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to 
WPD by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph 22(3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to 
be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus; and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to WPD in respect of 
works by virtue of sub-paragraph 22(1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on WPD any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the 
ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
23. The undertaker will indemnify WPD and keep them indemnified in respect of any losses,
costs, claims or liabilities arising out of, or as a consequence of anything done under this Part 
of this Schedule. 
64
PART 3 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, GAS, WATER AND SEWERAGE 
UNDERTAKERS 
24. For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule (save
for National Grid, which is protected by and as defined in Part 1 of this Schedule, WPD, which 
is protected by and as defined in Part 2 of this Schedule and DCC, which is protected by and as 
defined in Part 7 of this Schedule), the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise 
agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertakers concerned. 
25. In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in 
question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously; 
“apparatus” means— 
(a) in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the 
Electricity Act 1989), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker; 
(b) in the case of a gas undertaker, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or 
maintained by a gas transporter for the purposes of gas supply; 
(c) in the case of a water undertaker— 
(i) mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker 
for the purposes of water supply; and 
(ii) any water mains or service pipes (or part of a water main or service pipe) that is the 
subject of an agreement to adopt made under section 51A of the Water Industry Act 
1991(a); 
(d) in the case of a sewerage undertaker— 
(i) any drain or works vested in the utility undertaker under the Water Industry Act 
1991; and 
(ii) any sewer which is so vested or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt given 
under section 102(4) of that Act or an agreement to adopt made under section 104 of 
that Act, 
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 of that Act) 
or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming 
part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is 
or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus; 
“functions” includes powers and duties; 
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to 
apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and 
“utility undertaker” means— 
(a) any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989; 
(b) a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(b), 
(c) a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and 
(d) a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991, 
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility 
undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained. 
(a) 1991 (c.56). Section 51A to the 1991 Act was inserted by section 92(1) of the Water Act 2003(c.37). 
(b) 1986 (c.44). A new section 7 was substituted by section 5 of the Gas Act 1995 (c.45), and was further amended by section 
76 of the Utilities Act 2000 (c.27). 
65
26. This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations
between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of 
the 1991 Act. 
27. Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers
conferred by article 12 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), a utility 
undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to 
execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be 
reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of 
the prohibition or restriction was in that street. 
28. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
29.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is 
enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that 
apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility 
undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be 
extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to 
it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in 
accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7). 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that 
requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position 
of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of 
the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to 
remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility 
undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other 
land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written 
notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours 
to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be 
constructed. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this 
Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by 
arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration). 
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or 
constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration), 
and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in 
sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation 
the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to 
be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule. 
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the 
utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in 
connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, 
that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker 
without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction 
of the utility undertaker. 
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, 
bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling 
66
around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the 
apparatus. 
30.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the 
undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and 
maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to 
be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may 
be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of 
agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration). 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative 
apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be 
granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in 
question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and 
the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make 
such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as 
appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular 
case. 
31.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may 
affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under 
paragraph 29(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section 
and description of the works to be executed. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or 
otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker 
is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works. 
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within 
a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-
paragraph (1) are submitted to it. 
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works 
proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written 
notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 24 to 30 apply as if the removal of the 
apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 29(2). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new 
plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and 
having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section 
and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but 
in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably 
practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable 
subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances. 
32.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a 
utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in 
connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the 
construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of 
any such works as are referred to in paragraph 29(2). 
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated 
after removal. 
(3) in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
67
 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of 
agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of 
this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had 
been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, 
the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in 
question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to 
be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such 
works as are referred to in paragraph 29(2); and

consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in 
respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
33.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 29(2), any damage is caused to any 
apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its 
intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is 
any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility 
undertaker, the undertaker must— 
(a) bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such 
damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, 
damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, 
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption. 
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility 
undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand 
and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it 
withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any 
proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand. 
34. Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement 
regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is

be transferred to the undertaker by way of a deed of transfer from DCC at the undertaker’s 
expense and on such terms as DCC reasonably requires.

53. DCC shall be entitled to instruct the undertaker to suspend the works if in DCC’s 
reasonable opinion the actions of the undertaker, or those of its contractor(s) or 
subcontractor(s) in carrying out the works, have caused damage to any DCC apparatus and/or 
are likely to cause or result in damage to any DCC apparatus and/or have caused or are likely to 
cause damage to the environment arising as a result of damage to DCC apparatus. In the event 
of such instruction being given by DCC: 
(1) the undertaker shall procure that it and its contractor(s) and subcontractor(s) shall forthwith 
suspend or cease the works having due regard to health and safety factors and shall discuss and 
agree with DCC the remedial actions required prior to resuming the works; 
(2) the undertaker and DCC shall act reasonably and without delay in discussing and agreeing 
any remedial actions required prior to resuming the works;

instruction to suspend the works shall be void and the undertaker shall be entitled to recommence 
the works; and 
(5) DCC shall commence, carry out and complete any remedial works pursuant to sub-paragraph

ability of the undertaker to carry out the development or DCC to carry out its statutory 
functions, the parties shall use reasonable endeavours to cooperate with one another in order to 
align work streams so to minimise or avoid disruption to the other party’s works. In respect of 
the references to ‘work’ and ‘works’ in this sub-paragraph 54(1), to the extent that this refers to 
‘work’ or ‘works’ to be undertaken by DCC, the definition of works in paragraph 49 of this 
Part does not apply.

under this Schedule shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and DCC, be 
determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) of the Order.

paragraph 55(2) shall take precedence over works to be carried out by the undertaker and, in such 
circumstances, the undertaker shall reschedule its works accordingly. 
(4) In respect of the references to ‘work’ and ‘works’ in this paragraph 55, to the extent that this 
is ‘work’ or ‘works’ to be undertaken by DCC, the definition of works in paragraph 49 of this Part 
does not apply. 
Insurance 
56. The undertaker shall not commence any works under paragraph 52(1) to this Part unless 
and until the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance. 
Damage to DCC apparatus 
57.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs 57(3), (4) (5) and (6), the undertaker shall indemnify and 
hold harmless DCC against all claims demands costs damages expenses penalties and losses 
which DCC may have or sustain or become liable for in consequence of works under paragraph 
52(1) to this Part in respect of: 
(a) the commencement, carrying out, execution or retention of the works or any breach of 
this Part relating to the performance of the works and shall pay compensation for loss, 
damage or injury caused by the actions or default of the undertaker, its contractors,

limited to pollution and/or contamination; and 
 
76
 
(c) any breach of any stipulation or otherwise of any deeds of grant (or any renewal of any of 
the deeds of grant made on substantially the same terms provided that DCC has supplied 
the undertaker with a copy of the new document) arising from the works; and 
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs 57(3), (4) (5) and (6), the undertaker shall bear and pay the costs 
reasonably incurred by DCC in making good damage to DCC apparatus or restoring an 
interruption in the supply provided by DCC. 
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph 57(1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker with respect to 
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of DCC, 
its officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
(4) DCC shall give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no 
settlement or compromise shall be made without the consent of the undertaker. . 
(5) Nothing in this Part shall affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the 
relations between the undertaker and DCC in respect of any DCC apparatus laid or erected in land 
belonging to the undertaker on the date on which the Order is made. 
(6) DCC must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any 
costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 57 
applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, DCC shall provide an explanation of how the 
claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 57 for claims 
reasonably incurred by DCC.

Further information 
2.—(1) In relation to any part of the application to which this Schedule applies, the relevant 
planning authority has the right to request such further information from the undertaker as is 
necessary to enable it to consider the application. 
(2) In the event that it considers such further information to be necessary it must, within twenty 
one (21) business days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the 
further information required and (if applicable) to which part of the application it relates. In the 
event that the relevant planning authority does not give such notification within this twenty one 
(21) day period it is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and 
thereafter is not entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the 
undertaker. 
(3) Where further information is requested under this paragraph 2 in relation to part only of an 
application, that part is to be treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the 
purposes of calculating time periods in paragraph 1(1)(b), paragraph 1(3) and paragraph 2. 
Appeals 
3.—(1) 3.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that— 
(a) the relevant planning authority refuses (including a deemed refusal pursuant to paragraph 
1(3)) an application for any consent, agreement or approval required by an article or 
requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions; 
(b) on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 2 the undertaker 
considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the 
relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or 
(c) on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies 
the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional 
information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the 
application. 
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows— 
(a) The undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must 
on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning 
authority and any requirement consultee; 
(b) The Secretary of State must appoint a person as soon as reasonably practicable after 
receiving the appeal documentation and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the 
identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for his 
attention should be sent; 
(c) The relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee must submit written 
representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within twenty (20) 
business days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations 
are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the 
appointed person; 
(d) The appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 
twenty (20) business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph 
(c) above; and 
(e) The appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with 
reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty (30) business 
days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (d). 
The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (b) may be undertaken by a person 
appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State. 
79
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to 
enable him to consider the appeal he must, within five (5) business days of his appointment, notify 
the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required. 
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the 
undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee 
on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person 
must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The 
revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the 
appointed person within ten (10) business days of the specified date but must otherwise be in 
accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraph (2)(c)-(e). 
(5) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may— 
(a) allow or dismiss the appeal, or 
(b) reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the 
appeal relates to that part of it or not), 
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance. 
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such 
written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits. 
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have 
been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to 
enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case. 
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, 
and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are 
brought by a claim for judicial review. 
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be 
an approval for the purpose of Schedule 1 of this Order as if it had been given by the relevant 
planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the 
appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to 
give it in identical form) is not be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s 
determination. 
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the 
appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the 
appointed person must be met by the undertaker. 
(11) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person 
may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of 
the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on 
which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Welsh Government Circular 
NAFWC 07/2003 Planning (and analogous) Appeals and Call-in Procedures or any circular or 
guidance which may from time to time replace it.
