Half year report 2012
Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to report that the business performed 
well in the ﬁrst half of the year. With a strong 
operating performance we delivered ﬁrst half 
proﬁts in line with expectations, after additional 
domestic coal and biomass fuel cost pressures.
As a result of our overall performance during 
the ﬁrst half of 2012, and in line with our dividend 
policy, shareholders will receive an interim ordinary 
dividend of 14.4 pence per share in October, 
equivalent to approximately £53 million.
In June, we completed our £100 million, ﬁve year 
steam turbine modernisation programme. 
We replaced the ﬁnal three low pressure modules 
during the ﬁrst of our two major planned unit 
outages in 2012. It is the largest steam turbine 
modernisation programme in UK history and is a 
key component of our carbon abatement strategy. 
The whole programme has been delivered on 
time and to budget. This achievement is a real 
testament to the diligence, expertise and teamwork 
of our engineers. 
Finally, I am delighted to report that we now 
have the green light to turn our stated ambition 
to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled 
generator into reality. The Government’s decision 
to award an appropriate level of support for 
converting individual generating units to run fully 
on biomass, combined with the excellent technical 
progress we have made in proving the feasibility 
of unit conversion at Drax, means that we can 
now put our plans into action.
We have long believed that generating electricity 
from sustainable biomass has great potential 
and that it should have an important role as a 
low carbon, cost-effective and reliable renewable 
technology in the future energy mix of the UK. 
We now look forward to realising that potential.
With a pleasing result for the ﬁrst half of the year, 
I should like to conclude by offering my sincere 
thanks to all Group staff for their continued 
commitment to the business.

Our business model
Our overriding objective is to maximise the value of the 
Drax business whilst increasing our electricity generation 
from biomass, and so reducing our carbon footprint.
Our proﬁtability is determined by both the difference 
between the price at which we sell our power and 
the cost of coal and carbon, known as the “dark 
green spread”, and increasingly by the “bark spread”, 
which is the difference between power price and 
renewable support plus the cost of biomass.
From this starting point there are several steps 
in the Drax value chain, with each one adding 
incremental value and ultimately maximising 
the value of our business and delivering our 
gross margin.

Fuel
We now make use of a range of fuels, including 
coal, biomass and others which are economically 
advantageous.
Trading
Through keeping a constant eye on the commodity 
markets within which we operate we are able to 
optimise the commercial despatch of our power.
Retail
Our retail business is focused on providing 
businesses of all sizes with cost-effective, 
tailored electricity supply backed by dedicated 
customer support.
Generation
Drax Power Station is the largest, cleanest and 
most efﬁcient coal-ﬁred power station in the UK. 
Over time we plan to transform Drax into a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled generator.
Environment
We work towards reducing our impact on the 
environment with a policy of regarding compliance 
with legislation as a minimum level of achievement.

Introduction
Reporting on recent events ﬁrst, on 25 July the 
Government published its decisions on the future 
support levels for renewable technologies. The 
support available for burning sustainable biomass in 
place of coal in existing power stations favours full 
conversion of individual generating units rather than 
co-ﬁring, with the award of 1ROC/MWh for converted 
units as opposed to lower, but graduated, support 
for varying degrees of co-ﬁring.
We continue to make very good progress with 
our biomass research and development work. 
During recent combustion trials we successfully 
operated a single unit on a fully converted basis 
for a sustained period. We have also been very 
encouraged by our engineering optimisation work, 
which gives us the full conﬁdence that we can 
deliver reliable and ﬂexible renewable power 
through converted units at attractive rates of 
efﬁciency and output.
As a result of the Government’s conclusions 
on support levels, and our excellent technical 
progress, we can now move forward with our 
plan to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled 
generator. We expect to convert progressively 
three of our six generating units to biomass within 
the next ﬁve years, the ﬁrst in the second quarter 
of 2013. We have secured the rights to 2 million 
tonnes of biomass for delivery in the 2013/14 
Renewables Obligation compliance period to 
complement this unit conversion.
In February, we outlined our strategic capital 
investment plan to deliver the transformation of the 
business. Our strong balance sheet, with net cash of 
£233 million, continues to provide a good foundation 
for our funding requirements. I am also very pleased 
to report that, in July, we took the ﬁrst steps towards 
funding the biomass transformation project when 
we secured the commitment to a new £100 million 
term debt facility with the M&G UK Companies 
Financing Fund. 
Chief Executive’s statement
05
Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
Our operational performance has continued 
to be good during the ﬁrst half of the year, 
and we have achieved high availability and output. 
This has supported both our contracted position 
and our ability to take advantage of market 
opportunities. The reduction in underlying 
proﬁts in the ﬁrst half of 2012, compared to the 
same period last year, reﬂects contracts placed 
in 2011, when margins available to coal-ﬁred 
generators were weaker.
Commodity market conditions for coal-ﬁred 
generators improved in the ﬁrst six months of 
this year. In response we have more than doubled 
our forward sales for 2013, taking advantage of 
the improved margins. At the start of the year 
we had already secured a hedge for over 85% 
of 2012 production, providing us with protection 
against adverse commodity price movements. 
We are now virtually fully hedged for 2012 and 
well advanced for 2013.
Commodity markets
In the ﬁrst half of the year we have seen 
signiﬁcantly lower international coal prices, 
driven by excess supply. As a result dark green 
spreads, the difference between the price of 
power and the cost of coal and carbon, have been 
good for coal-ﬁred generators. However, it should 
be noted that a combination of high gas and oil 
prices and low international coal prices has 
resulted in signiﬁcant ﬁnancial challenges for 
the UK’s domestic coal producers, and we 
remain cautious in our outlook for domestic 
coal deliveries and prices. 
As a consequence of lower power prices, 
bark spreads, the difference between power 
price and renewable support under current 
regulations and the cost of biomass, have 
weakened this year, particularly in the second 
quarter. Throughout the ﬁrst half of the year, 
most traded biomass commanded lower 
margins than coal.
Operating performance
We have enjoyed continued good operational 
performance at Drax Power Station during the ﬁrst 
half of the year. Our load factor was again high 
compared to other thermal plants. This was 
driven by our high efﬁciency, continued use of 
economically advantageous fuels and the quality 
and competitiveness of the system support 
services we are able to offer the National Grid.
Industry-leading safety statistics alongside 
considerable project activity and outage work 
continue to demonstrate the emphasis we place 
on safety. The ﬁrst of our two major planned unit 
outages for 2012 was completed on time and to 
budget. The ﬁnal stage of our turbine upgrade, 
which commenced in 2007, has now been 
completed. The new low pressure and high 
pressure turbine modules of all of our six 
generating units are operating as expected, and 
the improved overall efﬁciency of the power station 
will now deliver a reduction in carbon dioxide 
(“CO2”) emissions of 1 million tonnes a year.
Retail performance 
Downstream, our retail business, Haven Power 
Limited (“Haven Power”) continues to provide 
us with a valuable, credit efﬁcient alternative to 
trading through the wholesale market. We have 
seen good growth so far this year in retail sales, 
although competition in many key segments of 
the business market has increased and as such 
margins are under pressure. Nevertheless, we 
remain conﬁdent in our ability to continue to grow 
direct power sales to business customers through 
Haven Power, which remains the key priority for 
the business. We now expect Haven Power to incur 
a modest loss up to 2015, and we will continue to 
invest to grow our retail sales base.

Biomass procurement
In addition to securing the rights to 2 million tonnes 
of good quality biomass fuel for delivery in the 
2013/14 Renewables Obligation compliance period, 
we are making further progress on fuel supply 
agreements beyond 2013, including in strategic 
partnerships for forestry sources. Our momentum 
in this area will increase in the light of the 
Government’s decisions on support levels. 
We continue to make good headway in developing 
vital areas of the biomass fuel supply chain, namely 
port, shipping and rail arrangements, where we 
have progressed key agreements. Our evaluation 
of opportunities for direct investment in biomass 
pellet plants has identiﬁed potential projects with 
attractive returns. Given the lead times involved 
with such construction projects there were certain 
preparatory steps that needed to be taken as we 
planned ahead for our biomass fuel requirements. 
To that end we have submitted our ﬁrst planning 
and permit applications, and expect to be in a 
position to make our ﬁrst investment decisions 
towards the end of 2012. 
The work we are doing on sustainability criteria 
for the biomass we procure continues to be 
industry-leading. We calculate the life cycle carbon 
footprint of all the biomass we buy and we are 
conﬁdent that our biomass fuel sourcing strategy 
will meet the UK mandatory standard which comes 
into effect in April 2013. 
Legislative and regulatory framework
Draft Energy Bill 
The draft Energy Bill, published in May, will 
implement the Government’s chosen Electricity 
Market Reform mechanisms. The mechanisms aim 
to minimise the additional costs to end consumers 
of providing affordable, sustainable and secure 
electricity supplies, whilst providing pragmatic 
solutions to investor concerns surrounding the 
securing of project ﬁnance for low carbon 
investments.
Drax supports the introduction of Feed-in Tariffs 
with Contracts for Difference to replace the 
Renewables Obligation and a broad market-based 
capacity mechanism. However, there are some 
areas of detail which we believe need to be 
addressed to ensure that the aims of the reform 
package are fully delivered. We will continue our 
working level engagement with the Government 
on these matters with a view to arriving at effective 
and efﬁcient arrangements.
Industrial Emissions Directive
Our work on the assessment of the options 
available to us for compliance with the more 
stringent emissions standards of the Industrial 
Emissions Directive from 2016 is well advanced. 
The fuel mix and ﬂexibility of the power plant are 
key factors in determining the optimal solution 
for compliance.
Carbon Capture and Storage
Together, Alstom UK Limited, Drax and BOC 
(a member of The Linde Group) have formed a 
consortium in support of the White Rose Carbon 
Capture and Storage (“CCS”) Project, a proposed 
426MW oxyfuel CCS demonstration project based 
at the Drax Power Station site. At the beginning of 
July the consortium, in conjunction with National 
Grid Carbon Limited, submitted a bidder proposal 
for funds through the UK CCS Commercialisation 
Programme, which was launched in April. Last year, 
the project submitted an application for funding 
under the European NER 300 programme. 
The project will be dependent on successful 
outcomes both from the UK and European funding 
processes as well as the proposed Electricity 
Market Reform mechanisms to incentivise low 
carbon technologies.
Chief Executive’s statement

Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
Looking ahead
Near-term dark green spreads have strengthened 
this year, but there remains little visibility beyond 
2013 in the commodity markets in which we trade. 
Under Phase III (2013–2020) of the EU Emissions 
Trading System we will not receive an allocation 
of CO2 emissions allowances. We will also face 
the increased cost of the carbon price support 
mechanism from April 2013. Both of these 
inﬂuences are reﬂected in market forecasts. 
Delivering leading operating and cost performance 
will continue to be a key focus of our efforts. 
Finally, we are delighted that recent conﬁrmation 
of the new support levels for biomass provides 
the clarity we need to move forward with our plans 
to transform the business. We expect to convert 
our ﬁrst unit in the second quarter of 2013 and a 
second unit in the following year. We will continue 
to work with the Government and the industry’s 
regulator, Ofgem, on the design of practical and 
efﬁcient regulations for the implementation of the 
Government’s decisions.

Half year report 2012
Introduction
EBITDA was £154 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2012 compared to £190 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2011. Our results for 
the ﬁrst half of 2012 were supported by continued 
strong operational performance, reﬂected in our 
high availability and load factor. Our reported 
proﬁts are in line with market expectations and 
include approximately £15 million more in biomass 
research and development (“R&D”) costs for the 
ﬁrst half than we originally envisaged. As described 
in the Chief Executive’s statement, these biomass 
trials have been invaluable, with the results 
conﬁrming that we can fully convert Drax units to 
burn biomass, and we expect to incur an additional 
£5 million for further trials in the second half. 
The reduction in proﬁtability compared to last year 
reﬂects the timing of our forward sales, with higher 
margins captured on power sales delivered in the 
ﬁrst half of 2011.
Looking forward, we have taken advantage of 
improved dark green spreads this year, and doubled 
our forward sales for 2013 at good margins. 
The strategic objective for Haven Power Limited 
(“Haven Power”), our retail business, is to deliver a 
credit efﬁcient route to market for our power, and 
as such sales growth remains its key business 
priority. Haven Power has continued to deliver 
good volume growth, with sales of 2.5TWh in the 
six months to 30 June 2012 compared to 1.4TWh 
during the same period in 2011. As expected, Haven 
Power recorded a small loss in the ﬁrst half.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with £233 million 
net cash at 30 June. In July, we took the first steps 
towards funding our biomass plans when we secured 
the commitment to a new £100 million term loan 
facility with the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund. 
This facility will form an important component of the 
funding solution for our plans to transform Drax into 
a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator.

Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
The Board has resolved to pay an interim dividend 
for 2012 of 14.4 pence per share (£53 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2012, compared 
to 16.0 pence per share (£58 million) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2011. 
This review provides further explanation and 
commentary in relation to our principal performance 
indicators and the results for the half year.
Generation results
Revenue
Total generation revenue for the six months 
ended 30 June 2012 was £794 million compared 
to £821 million in 2011. Total generation revenue 
in 2012 includes power sales of £766 million (2011: 
£802 million), ROC and LEC sales of £17 million 
(2011: £7 million), ancillary services income of 
£6 million (2011: £8 million) and other income 
of £5 million (2011: £4 million). 
Net power sold increased to 13.6TWh in the six 
months ended 30 June 2012, compared to 13.1TWh 
in 2011, but at a lower average achieved price of 
electricity of £52.0 per MWh this year, compared 
£55.3 per MWh in 2011, resulting in the overall 
reduction in power sales.
Our average achieved price of electricity reﬂects 
our contracted position at the start of the year, as 
well as power prices during the ﬁrst six months of 
the year. 2011 beneﬁted from earlier forward sales 
captured at high margins, as well as higher power 
prices in the ﬁrst half of last year that were driven 
up in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.
Margins available to coal-ﬁred generators have 
improved so far this year, largely as a result of 
lower international coal prices. Our high availability 
and superior efﬁciency in comparison to other 
coal-ﬁred generators has allowed Drax to take 
advantage of the good margins available, resulting 
in an increase in net power sold. 
ROC and LEC sales have increased from £7 million 
in the six months to 30 June 2011 to £17 million in 
2012, including sales to Haven Power of £6 million, 
driven by the timing of our contracting for 
ROC sales.
Generation revenue also includes income from 
the provision of ancillary services and the sale of 
by-products (ash and gypsum). In the six months 
ended 30 June 2012 these revenues were 
£11 million compared to £12 million in 2011.
Fuel costs (coal and other fuels)
Fuel costs in respect of generation were £456 million 
during the six months ended 30 June 2012 (2011: 
£446 million) with approximately 4.6 million tonnes 
of coal burnt in both periods. This coal was purchased 
from a variety of domestic and international sources 
under either fixed or variable priced contracts with 
different maturities. 
In 2012, we also burnt 0.5 million tonnes of biomass 
(2011: 0.6 million tonnes) and 0.4 million tonnes of 
pond ﬁnes (2011: 0.3 million tonnes). Pond ﬁnes are 
a coal mining residue, which trades at a signiﬁcant 
discount to coal, requiring speciﬁc blending and 
handling techniques to burn in large volumes. 
Coal comprised around 87% of total fuel burnt 
(by energy content) in the six months ended 
30 June 2012 compared to 88% in 2011. 
Biomass comprised 7% of total fuel burnt in 
2012 compared to 8% in 2011. 
The vast majority of this year’s biomass burn 
(0.4 million tonnes) related to our R&D trial work. 
Very little commercial biomass was burnt during 
the six months to 30 June 2012, as the margins 
remain weak at current support levels. 
Fuel purchased to support these critical trials 
has resulted in the Group incurring approximately 
£15 million more in R&D costs for the ﬁrst half of 
2012 than originally envisaged, with the fuel burnt 
at a loss relative to the equivalent cost of coal and 
the current support level of 0.5ROC/MWh. As 
noted earlier, we expect to incur an additional 
£5 million for further trials in the second half.
Our average cost of fuel per MWh (excluding CO2 
emissions allowances) was £30.7 for the six months 
ended 30 June 2012, compared to £29.8 in 2011. 
The increase in average fuel prices was a function 
of the timing of purchases under domestic and 
international contracts in the forward and 
near-term markets, of commodity price 
movements, and of fuel mix.
Operational and ﬁnancial performance

Half year report 2012
Fuel costs (CO2 emissions allowances)
For Phase II of the EU ETS (2008–2012), Drax 
has an allocation of 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 
emissions allowances per annum under the UK 
NAP. We purchase CO2 emissions allowances 
under ﬁxed price contracts with different 
maturity dates from a variety of domestic and 
international sources.
Our CO2 emissions allowances requirement for 
the six months ended 30 June 2012, including 
those allocated under the UK NAP, was 
approximately 11.2 million tonnes compared 
to approximately 10.6 million tonnes in 2011, 
as a result of higher generation levels.
The average price expensed for purchased CO2 
emissions allowances during the six months ended 
30 June 2012 was £5.9 per tonne compared to 
£13.0 per tonne in 2011, reﬂecting the timing of 
purchases under ﬁxed price contracts in the 
forward and near-term markets. Carbon prices fell 
signiﬁcantly during 2011, driven by anticipated over 
supply. During the ﬁrst six months of 2012 prices 
have remained low, with any Phase II surplus 
bankable into Phase III pricing remains largely 
driven by political and macroeconomic factors, 
such as the renewable generation build rate and 
the pace of economic recovery.
Cost of power purchases
We purchase power in the market when the cost 
of power in the market is below our marginal cost 
of production in respect of power previously 
contracted for generation and delivery by us, and to 
cover any shortfall in generation. For the six months 
ended 30 June 2012, the net cost of purchased 
power for the generation business was £58 million 
compared to £78 million incurred in 2011.
Grid charges
Generation grid charges for the six months 
ended 30 June 2012 were £32 million compared 
to £26 million in 2011. The increase is a result of 
higher generation levels and an increase in the rate 
charged by National Grid Company to reﬂect the 
impact of increased intermittent generation on 
system balancing costs.
As a result of these factors, generation gross 
proﬁt for the six months ended 30 June 2012 was 
£248 million compared to £272 million in 2011.
Operating and administrative expenses
Generation other operating and administrative 
expenses before depreciation and amortisation 
were £91 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2012 compared to £82 million in 2011, with the 
increase including planned spend on our biomass 
R&D work. We continue to carefully control our 
cost base, with our full year Group operating cost 
guidance (including retail operating costs) 
unchanged at £205 million.
Generation EBITDA for the six months ended 
30 June 2012 was therefore £157 million 
compared to £190 million in 2011.
Retail results
Revenue
Retail sales volumes have increased from 1.4TWh 
in the six months ended 30 June 2011 to 2.5TWh in 
the six months ended 30 June 2012. This reﬂects 
planned growth in Haven Power’s industrial and 
commercial (“I&C”) customer base from 0.7TWh 
at 30 June 2011 to 1.5TWh at 30 June 2012, along 
with growth in our sales to the small and medium 
enterprise (“SME”) market. As a result, retail sales 
revenue increased to £219 million for the six 
months to 30 June 2012, compared to £115 million 
in 2011. 
Cost of power purchases
Retail cost of power purchases for the six months 
ended 30 June 2012 were £139 million compared 
to £69 million incurred in 2011, reﬂecting the rise 
in sales volume. 
Grid charges 
There have been substantial increases in the rates 
charged by distribution network operators and 
National Grid Company during 2012. Combined 
with the higher retail volumes, this has resulted 
in a rise in grid charges for the retail business to 
£49 million in the six months to 30 June 2012, 
from £24 million in 2011.

Other retail cost of sales 
Other retail costs include broker fees, ROCs, LECs, 
metering and Feed-in Tariff (“FiT”) costs and were 
£25 million in the six months ended 30 June 2012, 
compared to £13 million in 2011. In addition to 
higher volumes, costs have increased in 2012 
due to the much higher than expected uptake of 
the subsidy for solar photovoltaic panels, which 
has resulted in very large increases to the FiT 
levelisation costs being charged to suppliers.
As a result of these factors, retail gross proﬁt 
for the six months ended 30 June 2012 was 
£7 million compared to £9 million in 2011.
Operating and administrative expenses
Retail other operating and administrative expenses 
before depreciation and amortisation were 
£10 million for the six months ended 30 June 2012 
compared to £9 million in 2011, as we continue 
to invest in the growth of this business.
Retail EBITDA for the six months ended 
30 June 2012 was, therefore, a loss of £3 million 
compared to a loss of £1 million in 2011.
Central costs
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation was £28 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2012 and 
£29 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011. 
Unrealised gains and losses 
on derivative contracts
The Group recognises unrealised gains and losses 
on forward contracts which meet the deﬁnition of 
derivatives under IFRSs. Where possible, we take the 
own use exemption for derivative contracts entered 
into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage 
requirements, including forward biomass and 
domestic coal contracts. As such, the net unrealised 
gains and losses recognised in the balance sheet 
principally relate to the mark-to-market positions on 
our forward contracts for power yet to be delivered, 
net of mark-to-market positions on ﬁnancial coal 
and foreign exchange contracts. The following table 
describes the movements in unrealised gains and 
losses and where they are recorded in our ﬁnancial 
statements.

Power price rises through the ﬁrst six months of 
last year were the most signiﬁcant factor behind 
fair value losses of £39 million recognised through 
the hedge reserve in the ﬁrst six months of 2011, 
resulting in a net unrealised loss of £75 million in 
the balance sheet at 30 June 2011.
The unwind of unrealised losses on a proportion 
of ﬁnancial coal contracts during 2011 drove the 
£90 million gain on derivative contracts recognised 
in the income statement in the year ended 
31 December 2011. This, combined with a fall 
in power prices in the second half of 2011, resulted 
in a net unrealised gain in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2011 of £31 million. 
During 2012, power prices rose in the ﬁrst quarter, 
but then fell back in the second to similar levels 
to the year end. The unwind of unrealised losses 
on further ﬁnancial coal contracts has driven 
the £21 million net unrealised gain recognised in 
the income statement in 2012, and resulted in a 
net unrealised gain in the balance sheet at 
30 June 2012 of £52 million.
In considering mark-to-market movements, it is 
important to recognise that proﬁtability is driven 
by our strategy to deliver market level dark green 
spreads, not by the absolute price of electricity at 
any given date.
Operational and ﬁnancial performance
15
Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
After allowing for depreciation, amortisation 
and unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts, operating proﬁt for the six months 
ended 30 June 2012 was £147 million compared 
to £187 million in 2011.
Interest
Net ﬁnance costs for the six months ended 30 June 
2012 were £5 million compared to £18 million in 
2011. The higher costs in 2011 reﬂect interest for the 
ﬁrst six months of 2011 on our term loan, which was 
repaid in full on reﬁnancing in July 2011. The 
reﬁnancing also accelerated the unwind of 
deferred ﬁnance costs in relation to our previous 
bank facilities, resulting in a one-time interest 
charge of £5 million recognised in the six months 
ended 30 June 2011. 
Tax
The tax charge for the six months ended 30 June 
2012 was £20 million (an effective rate of 14%). 
This includes the impact of the reduction in the 
corporation tax rate to 24% from April 2012 on 
current and deferred tax liabilities and a revision 
to previous years’ capital allowances claims now 
agreed with HMRC, resulting in a further £8 million 
tax credit recognised in the period. The tax charge 
for the ﬁrst six months of 2011, before exceptional 
items, was £35 million (an effective rate of 21%), 
and included the impact of the reduction in the 
corporation tax rate to 26% from April 2011 on 
current and deferred tax liabilities. 
The exceptional tax credit recognised in the six 
months to 30 June 2011 arose following agreement 
reached with HMRC over the Eurobond tax position 
which resulted in full recognition of the Eurobond 
settlement of £180 million, and a further £18 million 
in relation to other legacy issues. 
Proﬁt for the period and earnings per share
As a result of the above factors, proﬁt 
attributable to equity shareholders for the 
six months ended 30 June 2012 was £121 million, 
compared to £332 million in 2011, and basic 
and diluted earnings per share were 33 pence 
compared to 91 pence in 2011.
Underlying proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders 
(that is proﬁt excluding the after tax impact of 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 
and exceptional items) was £106 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2012 compared to £117 
million in 2011. Underlying basic and diluted 
earnings per share were 29 pence in 2012 
compared to 32 pence in 2011.

Notes:
(1) The forced outage rate is expressed as a percentage of planned capacity 
available (that is, it includes a reduction for planned losses). The planned 
outage rate is expressed as a percentage of registered capacity. Accordingly, 
the aggregation of the forced outage rate and planned outage rate will not 
equate to the total outage rate. 
The load factor for the six months ended 30 June 
2012 was 82% compared to 80% in 2011, reﬂecting 
an increase in electrical output (net sales) to 
13.6TWh in 2012 compared with 13.1TWh in 2011. 
Plant availability of 85% for the six months ended 
30 June 2012 (2011: 86%) demonstrates our 
leadership position in the coal-ﬁred generation 
sector. The plant despatch dynamics described 
in Generation results – Revenue above drove our 
load factor to 82% for the period, which was 
signiﬁcantly higher than the average for the 
rest of the fossil fuel ﬂeet.
The forced outage rate and Winter forced outage 
rate for the six months ended 30 June 2012 were 
4.4% and 4.1% respectively, compared to 4.2% 
and 3.7% in 2011. The 2012 forced outage rate 
is in line with our long-term target of 5%.

Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
Operational and ﬁnancial performance
The planned outage rate achieved for the six 
months ended 30 June 2012 was 10.8% compared 
to 9.8% in 2011. Our maintenance regime includes 
a major planned outage for each of our six units 
once every four years. Consequently, there is 
an irregular pattern to planned outages and 
associated expenditure, since in two of the four 
years two units will each undergo a major planned 
outage. We have completed the ﬁrst of two 
planned unit outages for this year in the ﬁrst six 
months of 2012. Only one unit underwent a major 
planned outage in 2011. 
Health and safety
Our lost time injury rate and total recordable injury 
rate were 0.04 and 0.13 respectively for the six 
months ended 30 June 2012 compared to 0.05 and 
0.09 in 2011. Our safety record is industry-leading, 
and we continue to work hard on our commitment 
to deliver a positive health and safety culture. 
Liquidity and capital resources
Net cash including short-term investments was 
£233 million at 30 June 2012 compared to 
£225 million at 31 December 2011 and £198 million 
at 30 June 2011. Cash and short-term investments 
net of overdrafts were £241 million as at 30 June 
2012 compared to £233 million at 31 December 
2011 and £300 million at 30 June 2011. An analysis

Cash generated from operations was £163 million 
in the six months ended 30 June 2012 compared 
to £131 million in 2011, driven by a working capital 
inﬂow of £18 million in 2012 compared to an 
outﬂow of £31 million in 2011, offset by the decrease 
of £36 million in EBITDA as described above.
The 2012 working capital inﬂow was driven by a 
seasonal reduction in the receivables, partially 
offset by an increase in coal stocks of 0.6 million 
tonnes (up to 2.0 million tonnes) in the ﬁrst half 
of this year. The coal stock build is linked to our 
biomass plans, as we prepare for a rail delivery 
system outage to facilitate plant modiﬁcations.
17
Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
A working capital outﬂow is probable in the second 
half of the year as we also build biomass stocks 
ahead of the ﬁrst unit conversion, which we expect 
to operate from the second quarter of 2013.
The working capital outﬂow of £31 million in 
2011 was driven by an increase in coal stocks of 
0.4 million tonnes over the ﬁrst six months, to meet 
forecast generation for the second half of the year. 
Net income taxes paid were £30 million in 
the six months ended 30 June 2012 compared to 
£42 million in 2011. 2011 and 2012 payments included 
settlement of the 2010 and 2011 liability, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities includes 
payments in respect of capital expenditure of 
£77 million in the six months ended 30 June 2012 
and £14 million in 2011 (see Capital expenditure). 
2012 includes a decrease of £20 million in 
short-term investments compared to an increase of 
£50 million in 2011, comprising cash deposits with a 
maturity of more than three months at inception. 
Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities was £43 million 
in the six months ended 30 June 2012, being equity 
dividends paid. The 2011 net cash used in ﬁnancing 
activities of £99 million includes equity dividends 
paid of £65 million and term loan repayments of 
£34 million, in relation to our previous banking 
facilities which were repaid on reﬁnancing in July 
2011 (see Capital resources and reﬁnancing).
The increase in cash and cash equivalents was, 
therefore, £29 million in the six months ended 
30 June 2012, compared to a decrease of 
£81 million in 2011. Drax’s policy is to invest 
available cash in short-term bank, building 
society or other low risk deposits.
Capital resources and reﬁnancing
In July 2011, we completed a reﬁnancing of our 
letter of credit, working capital and term loan 
facilities. These facilities were replaced with a 
£310 million revolving credit facility which matures 
in April 2014, and which can be used for both 
letters of credit and working capital purposes. 
We subsequently drew down £10 million against 
the revolving credit facility, which remains 
outstanding at 30 June 2012. 
In July 2012, we took the ﬁrst steps towards 
funding our biomass plans when we secured the 
commitment to a new £100 million amortising term 
loan facility with the M&G UK Companies Financing 
Fund. The facility has a six to eight year maturity 
proﬁle, is competitively priced and will form an 
important component of the funding solution for 
our plans to transform Drax into a predominantly 
biomass-fuelled generator.
Our strong balance sheet, with net cash of 
£233 million at 30 June 2012, provides a solid 
foundation for our remaining funding requirements.
Going concern
We acknowledge guidance on going concern for 
companies preparing ﬁnancial statements. We have 
signiﬁcant headroom in our banking facilities, a 
recent history of cash generation and good visibility 
in medium-term forecasts, due to our progressive 
hedging strategy. After considering the principal 
risks and uncertainties set out below, the directors 
are satisﬁed that the Group has sufﬁcient resources 
to begin its investment in its biomass strategy and to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a 
period of not less than 12 months from the date of 
this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Half year report. 
Seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices 
and despatch in the Winter period and lower despatch 
in the Summer months, when prices are lower and 
plant availability is affected by planned outages.
Accordingly, cash ﬂow during the Summer months 
is materially reduced due to the combined effect 
of lower prices and output, while maintenance 
expenditures are increased during this period due 
to major planned outages. As noted above (Capital 
resources and reﬁnancing), we have a £310 million 
revolving credit facility, and it is envisaged that this 
facility may assist in managing the cash low points 
in the cycle if required.

Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
Capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions were £90 million in the 
six months ended 30 June 2012 compared to 
£16 million in 2011. 
2012 includes the ﬁnal instalment of our turbine 
upgrade project, which was completed on time and 
to budget. Since 2007, we have invested around 
£100 million to upgrade the high pressure and 
low pressure turbine modules on all six generating 
units to improve efﬁciency. The technology is 
performing to guarantee with all units achieving 
an overall baseload efﬁciency (that is, the ratio 
of energy out to energy in when operating at 
full capacity) approaching 40% at full load. 
This represents a 5% improvement on original 
baseload efﬁciency of around 38%, and annual 
savings of 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions 
allowances and approximately half a million 
tonnes of coal.
Additions in 2012 also include £70 million for 
biomass infrastructure. We have commenced 
construction of new biomass fuel delivery, storage 
and distribution systems at the Drax Power Station 
site. These are required to support our plans 
to convert progressively three generating units 
fully to biomass, which will require between 
7 and 8 million tonnes of fuel per annum. 
Construction work is phased for completion by 
mid-2014, and we expect to be in a position to 
operate the ﬁrst converted unit in the second 
quarter of 2013. Including the investment made 
in the ﬁrst half of this year, we expect capital costs 
to be in the region of £170 million for the biomass 
project this year. On a similar basis, we expect 
total Group capital expenditure to be around 
£200 million for the full year.
Although our central plan is now to convert 
progressively three generating units fully to 
biomass, rather than enhanced co-ﬁring, we 
remain conﬁdent in the overall scale of the total 
£650 million – £700 million strategic capital 
investment plan set out in the 2011 Annual report 
and accounts. Approximately half of the total 
capital cost is the investment in downstream 
plant and equipment described above, largely 
at the Drax site. The remainder is investment in 
upstream supply chain infrastructure, mainly 
pelleting facilities, and any necessary work to 
ensure the plant is compliant with the Industrial 
Emissions Directive. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
We manage the commercial and operational risks 
faced by the Group in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board. We set out in our 2011 
Annual report and accounts (pages 32–35) the 
principal risks and uncertainties that could impact 
performance. These remain unchanged, and are 
as follows:
 – Commodity market risk
 – Counterparty risk
 – Ratings risk
 – Electricity wholesale market risk
 – Biomass strategy risk
 – Plant operating risk
 – Regulatory and political risk

We continue to follow our stated trading strategy 
of making steady forward power sales with 
corresponding purchases of CO2 emissions 
allowances and fuel purchases. Our aim is to deliver 
market level dark green spreads across all traded 
market periods and, as part of this strategy, we 
retain power to be sold into the prompt (within

300MW baseload contract which commenced 
on 1 October 2010. 
Fixed margin power sales include approximately 
3.6TWh in 2012 and 2.6TWh in both 2013 and 2014 
in connection with the above contracts.
Under these contracts the Group will supply power 
on terms which include Centrica paying for coal, 
based on international coal prices, and delivering 
matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting 
in aggregate to approximately 7.2 million tonnes 
in 2012 and approximately 2.4 million tonnes in 
2013 and 2014. 
The contracts provide the Group with a series 
of ﬁxed dark green spreads, with the spreads on 
the ﬁrst contract having been agreed in the ﬁrst 
quarter of 2006 and with those in the second 
contract having been agreed in October 2009.
Distributions
Distribution policy
The Board has previously committed to target a 
pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying earnings (being 
proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders adjusted 
to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts and exceptional 
items) in each year. For the half year, underlying 
earnings per share on this basis were 29 pence 
per share. 
Dividends paid
On 20 February 2012, the Board resolved, subject 
to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 18 April 2012, to pay a ﬁnal dividend 
for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 11.8 pence 
per share (£43 million). The ﬁnal dividend was 
subsequently paid on 11 May 2012.
Dividends proposed
On 30 July 2012, the Board resolved to pay 
an interim dividend for the six months ended 
30 June 2012 of 14.4 pence per share (£53 million), 
representing 50% of underlying earnings for the 
period. The interim dividend will be paid on or 
before 12 October 2012 and shares will be marked 
ex-interim dividend on 26 September 2012.
This Operational and ﬁnancial performance review 
was approved by the Board on 30 July 2012.

Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
1. General information
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. 
The Company and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and 
supply industry within the UK. The address of the Company’s registered ofﬁce and principal 
establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
2. Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared using accounting policies 
consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and in accordance with IAS 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting”.
The information for the year ended 31 December 2011 does not constitute statutory accounts as deﬁned 
in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not qualiﬁed, did 
not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements under Section 
498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements were approved by the Board on 30 July 2012.
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In 2011, a number of new standards and interpretations became effective as noted in the 2011 Annual 
report and accounts (page 87). The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had 
a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group. Since the Annual report and accounts 
was published no signiﬁcant new standards and interpretations have been issued.
3. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s 
Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011.
4. Segmental reporting
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment 
decisions is organised into two operating segments. The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 are 
as follows:
 – Generation – the generation of electricity at the Drax Power Station.
 – Retail – the supply of electricity to retail customers in the small and medium enterprise and industrial 
and commercial markets.
The measure of proﬁt or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular basis is 
EBITDA, with sales between segments being carried out at arm’s length. Assets and working capital are 
monitored on a Group basis with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management 
accounts, and hence no separate asset disclosure is provided in this Half year report.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies 
which are described in the Group’s latest Annual report and accounts. All revenue and results arise from 
operations within Great Britain therefore no separate geographical segments are reported. The revenue 
and results of both segments are subject to seasonality as detailed in the “Operational and ﬁnancial 
performance review – Seasonality of borrowing” section.
Major customers
Total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2012 includes an amount of £217.5 million derived from 
one customer (2011: £243.9 million and £135.9 million derived from two customers), representing 10% 
or more of the Group’s revenue for the period. 
5. Taxation
The income tax expense reﬂects the estimated effective tax rate on proﬁt before taxation for the Group 
and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the period, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement. 
Exceptional items
The 2011 comparative ﬁgures include an exceptional tax credit of £197.9 million, following agreement 
reached with HMRC on 5 April 2011, resulting in the resolution of the Eurobond tax position and certain 
other smaller legacy tax matters. The 2011 income statements for the six months ended 30 June 2011, 
and year ended 31 December 2011, therefore include a current tax credit of £149.5 million, and a deferred 
tax credit of £48.4 million.

Half year report 2012
Changes in the rate of corporation tax
Following the announcement of the 2011 Budget, the Finance Act 2011 (the “Act”) was enacted by 
Parliament in July 2011. The Act conﬁrmed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 27% to 26% 
from April 2011, and from 26% to 25% from April 2012, both of which were enacted during the year 
ended 31 December 2011.
The Finance Bill 2011–12 (the “Bill”), which followed the announcement of the 2012 Budget, was presented 
to Parliament on 26 March 2012. The Bill proposed a further reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 
25% to 24% from April 2012, which was passed by resolution with immediate statutory effect. In addition 
the Bill proposed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 24% to 22% by 2014–15 which had not 
been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It is currently expected that each future Finance 
Bill enacted will reduce the corporation tax rate by 1% until the rate of 22% is reached.

6. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. In calculating diluted 
earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is 
adjusted, when relevant, to take account of share options and contingently issuable shares in relation to 
the Group’s share-based incentive plans. The underlying earnings per share has been calculated after 
excluding the after tax impact of marking-to-market derivative contracts which are not hedged and 
exceptional items.

During the previous year, a scheduled term loan repayment of £33.8 million was made on 30 June 2011.
Reﬁnancing 
On 28 July 2011, we completed the reﬁnancing of our letter of credit, working capital and term loan 
facilities, which were due to mature in December 2012. These facilities were replaced with a £310 million 
revolving credit facility which matures in April 2014, which can be used for both letters of credit and 
working capital purposes. The margin over LIBOR on our new facility was reduced from 3.5% to 2%. 
The existing term loan was repaid in full out of cash in hand and we subsequently drew down £10 million 
against the new revolving credit facility, this balance remains outstanding as at 30 June 2012.
In July 2012 we secured the commitment to a new £100 million amortising term loan facility with M&G 
UK Companies Financing Fund, as part of our longer term funding solution for the conversion of Drax 
into a predominantly biomass-fuelled power station. The facility is competitively priced, with a six to eight 
year maturity proﬁle.
9. Hedge reserve
The Group’s cash ﬂow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power), 
forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. Amounts are recognised in the hedge 
reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion 
of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve 
are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts proﬁt or loss. 
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
The expected release from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows:

Drax Group plc
Half year report 2012
We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of ﬁnancial statements in the 
half-yearly ﬁnancial report for the six months ended 30 June 2012 which comprises the Condensed 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and related notes 1 to 10. We have read the other 
information contained in the half-yearly ﬁnancial report and considered whether it contains any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of 
ﬁnancial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with International Standard on Review 
Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Our work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it 
in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our review work, 
for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors’ responsibilities
The half-yearly ﬁnancial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly ﬁnancial report in accordance with the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority.
As disclosed in note 2, the annual ﬁnancial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of ﬁnancial statements included in this 
half-yearly ﬁnancial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 
“Interim Financial Reporting,” as adopted by the European Union.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of ﬁnancial 
statements in the half-yearly ﬁnancial report based on our review.
Scope of review 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK 
and Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of 
the Entity” issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim 
ﬁnancial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for ﬁnancial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all signiﬁcant 
matters that might be identiﬁed in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of ﬁnancial statements in the half-yearly ﬁnancial report for the six months ended 30 June 2012 is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted 
by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Services Authority.
