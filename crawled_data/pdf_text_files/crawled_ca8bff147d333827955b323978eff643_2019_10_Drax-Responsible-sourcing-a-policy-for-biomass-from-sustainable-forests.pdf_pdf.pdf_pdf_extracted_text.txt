Responsible 
sourcing: 
A policy for biomass  
from sustainable forests
www.drax.com
Drax is enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
Sustainably sourced forest biomass 
is at the heart of our purpose: 
Enabling a zero carbon, lower  
cost energy future. 
By supplying the country 
with flexible, affordable and 
renewable power now and looking 
to a future with bioenergy carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS), 
Drax is at the heart of the energy 
transition – central to a net zero 
UK by 2050. Today, we produce 
enough renewable electricity to 
power four million homes using 
biomass – more than any other 
power generator in the nation.
As Drax – and the UK – powers 
past coal, our sustainably-
sourced forest biomass can 
do more to accelerate the 
decarbonisation of the UK’s 
economy and put the nation 
at the global vanguard of the 
technology needed to combat  
the climate change crisis. 
 
By pioneering ground-breaking 
BECCS technology, we want to 
become the world’s first carbon 
negative power station. This 
will place the UK at the centre 
of global efforts to develop 
negative emissions technology 
at scale. The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) and the UK Committee 
on Climate Change (CCC) have 
recognised these steps as 
vital to meeting the UK’s Paris 
Agreement commitments.
In transforming two-thirds of Drax Power 
Station to use forest biomass instead of coal, 
we are playing a crucial role in decarbonising 
the UK’s energy system. 
THE BENEFITS  
OF FOREST BIOMASS
At Drax we use sustainably-
sourced wood pellets from 
managed forests, primarily in 
the US South but also in Europe, 
Canada and South America, to 
generate low-carbon, renewable 
electricity.
Biomass delivers both a 
decarbonised economy and 
healthy forests. 
•  Managed forests can 
absorb more carbon: Managed 
forests often absorb more 
carbon than forests that are 
left untouched: Increasing 
sustainable harvesting can 
lead to more investment in 
woodland, better growth, 
greater carbon storage and 
stronger communities.
•  Healthy demand for wood 
contributes to growing 
forests: Drax sources wood 
from sustainably-managed 
forests, contributing to 
increasing forest growth 
locally and regionally.
•  Surplus growth has 
quadrupled in the US South: 
Over the last 25 years, the US 
South has not only increased 
its total wood supply, but the 
surplus annual growth each 
year has quadrupled.

REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS
MAXIMISING CARBON BENEFITS
We will continue to reduce 
emissions across our supply chain 
where possible, through investment 
in rail infrastructure instead of 
road haulage and by partnering 
with organisations like the Smart 
Green Shipping Alliance to reduce 
shipping emissions.
Using:
•  Responsibly sourced  
sawmill residues.  
•  Forest residues from regions 
with high rates of decay, 
or where this material is 
extracted to roadside as 
part of standard harvesting 
practice. 
•  Thinnings that improve the 
growth, quality or biodiversity 
value of forests. 
Only using roundwood that: 
•  Helps to maintain or improve 
the growing stock, growth rate 
and productivity of forests. 
•  Helps to improve the health 
and quality of forests, for 
example by using storm, pest 
or fire damaged wood.  
•  Is not merchantable to a  
saw-timber market.
Not using:
•  Biomass that drives harvesting 
decisions that would adversely 
affect the long-term potential 
of forests to store and 
sequester carbon. 
•  Biomass that increases 
harvesting above the 
sustainable capacity of 
forests.  
•  Biomass that displaces solid 
wood product markets. 
•  Biomass that comes from 
stumps.
A recent report by Forest 
Research – the UK’s principal 
organisation for forestry and 
tree-related science − identified 
sourcing practices that maximise 
the positive carbon contribution 
sustainable biomass can deliver.
Our sourcing choices are led by  
these recommendations. In order 
to ensure our biomass reduces CO2 
emissions in the most effective 
way possible, at Drax we commit to:
We are committed to ensuring the biomass we 
use makes a positive contribution to tackling 
the climate change crisis and fulfilling the UK’s 
Paris Agreement targets.

Guided  
 by science 
We will keep our 
sourcing guidelines 
under review by 
following the 
latest science and 
continually developing 
best practices. 
Our Independent Advisory 
Board – an independent group of 
scientists, academics and civil 
society – will help us determine 
future sourcing choices in line 
with new evidence and scientific 
research so we continue to 
improve our practices as  
science evolves.
ESTABLISHING AN 
INDEPENDENT ADVISORY 
BOARD
Drax is establishing an 
Independent Advisory Board 
of scientists, civil society 
and leaders in the field of 
sustainability to provide 
impartial advice on sustainable 
biomass and its role in Drax’s 
transition to net zero emissions.
The Independent Advisory Board 
will provide advice on feedstock 
options, forest science and 
how Drax can optimise carbon 
benefits. The group will also give 
advice on the role of biomass in 
Drax’s climate change mitigation 
activities and in supporting the 
transition to a net zero energy 
system.
It will also share insights on 
the societal expectations for 
responsible and sustainable 
biomass. The group will 
feedback and make public 
recommendations on Drax’s 
sustainable biomass approach 
and performance.

We recognise our 
duty to keep forests 
thriving, to respect 
the many benefits 
they bring as carbon 
sinks and areas of 
recreation, as well  
as their critical role in 
fostering biodiversity. 
We will further develop an 
evidence base to demonstrate 
that our biomass meets the 
following commitments:
OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECT  
THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
OUR COMMITMENT TO 
PROTECT THE NATURAL 
ENVIRONMENT
When sourcing wood pellets  
we will:
•  Avoid damage or disturbance 
to high carbon forest and soils. 
•  Avoid damage or negative 
impact to designated or 
known sensitive sites or high 
biodiversity areas.  
•  Avoid deforestation or 
degradation of the forest 
resource. 
•  Avoid being the cause of 
direct or indirect land use 
change, which would lead to 
an adverse climate impact. 
•  Maintain the protective 
functions of forests and 
ecosystem services, including 
following best practice for 
protection of water and soil 
quality. 
•  Implement practices which 
help to reduce the risk 
of forest fires, pests and 
diseases. 
•  Ensure that our suppliers have 
appropriate systems to track 
and trace the material that 
they buy, back to the forest  
of origin.
We work with 
our suppliers 
to ensure the 
biomass we use 
contributes to 
the protection 
and enhancement 
of the natural 
environment.”

OUR COMMITMENT TO 
BUILDING A ROBUST 
EVIDENCE BASE
 We will:
 •   Work with independent 
experts to improve 
monitoring and reporting. 
•   Use established certification 
where appropriate, and work  
with certification schemes 
to improve their quality and 
rigour. 
 •   Employ new technologies, 
such as remote sensing, 
to assist in evidencing our 
commitments. 
 •   Improve our transparency 
through expanding the type 
and quality of data available 
on our websites.
Building     
a Robust    
Evidence Base
New and developing technologies, 
such as remote sensing, are 
enabling innovation and 
improving the availability and 
understanding of data, leading to 
a more accurate picture of forest 
health. Coupled with continued 
monitoring and investment 
in scientific research, we are 
committed to building a better 
understanding of our impact on 
the natural environment.
Technology is 
changing the way 
we can measure 
our impact on the

From state-owned 
forests, to small 
holdings and from the 
US Southeast to the 
Baltics, forest owners, 
forest workers and 
communities in our 
sourcing areas are 
bound by their common 
reliance on forests for 
employment, wellbeing 
and quality of life.
OUR COMMITMENT TO 
SUPPORTING PEOPLE  
AND COMMUNITIES 
We will:
•  Promote and ensure respect 
for human rights through all 
levels of our supply chains, 
including safeguarding the 
labour rights of workers and 
not engaging in any form of 
discrimination, compulsory 
labour or child labour.  
 
•  Verify that legal, customary 
and traditional tenure and use 
rights of indigenous people 
and local communities related 
to forests, are identified, 
documented  
and respected. 
•  Verify that food and water 
supplies, or the subsistence 
needs of local communities, 
are not compromised due to 
forest biomass sourcing. 
•  Ensure that all biomass  
used is fully compliant  
with international and  
local legislation.
As part of our duty to support 
the communities in the areas 
we source from, we will ensure 
we buy biomass responsibly:
We will verify 
that appropriate 
safeguards
are in place to 
uphold health 
and safety 
standards in 
forests and 
pellet mills.”
