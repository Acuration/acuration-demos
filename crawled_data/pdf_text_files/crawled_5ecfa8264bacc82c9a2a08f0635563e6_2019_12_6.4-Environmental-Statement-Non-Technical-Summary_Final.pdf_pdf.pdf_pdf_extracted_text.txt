Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Non-Technical Summary (NTS) of the Environmental 
Statement (ES) (ES NTS) for the Millbrook Power Project (hereafter referred to 
as the Project). It has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on 
behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) (the "Applicant"). 
1.1.2 
The Project would be located in an area known as ‘the Marston Vale’ between 
Milton Keynes and Bedford with the approximate centre of the Project Site at 
grid reference 501373, 240734, The Project would comprise: 
� 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with an 
exhaust gas flue stack and balance of plant, which are located within 
the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment"); 
 A new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
"Access Road" or the “Short Access Road”);  
 A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
� 
A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System (the "Gas 
Connection"); and 
� 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the "Electrical 
Connection").  
1.1.3 
The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  The boundary of the Project Site 
falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC) areas.  
1.1.4 
The location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1 of the ES.  
1.1.5 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  
1.1.6 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the “Project” and are all 
ES Non-Technical Summary

required for the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that electricity 
to the NETS. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred 
to as the ‘Project Site’. 
1.1.7 
All elements of the Project are shown on Figure 1.2 of the ES.  
1.1.8 
The Generating Equipment would operate as a ‘peaking plant’, meaning it would 
operate intermittently. This could be at any time during the year and for any 
length of time up to but not exceeding 2,250 hours and not exceeding 1,500 
hours on a 5 year rolling average. 
1.1.9 
A peaking plant is designed to operate when there is a surge in demand for 
electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. when a large number of people 
boil their kettles following the end of a popular TV programme) or when there is 
a sudden drop in power being generated from power stations which are 
constantly in operation. It will also support intermittent forms of renewable 
energy which are weather dependent (e.g. wind and solar). 
1.1.10 The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008, which means that a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The proposed DCO 
Application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate who 
will make a recommendation on whether the DCO should be granted by the 
Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of 
State) with whom the final decision lies. The ES and this ES NTS have been 
prepared in accordance with Regulation 2 and 10 of the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact) Assessment Regulations 2009 (the "EIA Regulations").  
They present information specifically aimed at describing the nature, scale and 
location of the Project and an assessment of any likely significant environmental 
impacts resulting from the Project.

1.2 
Purpose of this Document 
1.2.1 
The Project requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 
accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations).  
1.2.2 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 2009 before 
the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA 
Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the 
Project. 
1.2.3 
EIA is an assessment of the Project’s likely significant environmental effects.

The Applicant 
1.3.1 
The Applicant for the Project is MPL, an energy development company 
established for the Project and a wholly owned subsidiary of Drax Group plc 
(Drax). 
1.3.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via 
Drax power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers 
and is committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal 
off the system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created 
by intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.

1.4 
Need for the Project 
1.4.1 
There is a considerable national need for this type of project, acknowledged at 
all levels of government policy. National planning policy supports the need for 
new electricity infrastructure due to the current ageing and inevitable closure of 
older coal fired power plants and the likely increase in demand for electricity 
over the coming decades. 
1.4.2 
The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs).  NPS EN-1 (the overarching energy NPS) states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector - providing vital 
flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply (Paragraph 3.6.2)". 
1.4.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants provide back-up to power generation 
from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly 
prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired power plants are 
among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity generation. 
1.4.4 
The recommendations and needs case set out in NPS EN-1 are also reflected 
in the ‘Updated Energy and Emissions Projections’ – 2016 (BEIS 2017). The 
projections describe how, under current policy, emissions from the power sector 
fall by 52% from 113 MtCO2e in 2015 to 54 MtCO2e in 2020. Low carbon 
generation is projected to increase from 47% of the generation mix in 2015 to 
61% in 2020. The projections also realise that in the short to medium term, an 
increase in flexible gas generation is required to maintain system flexibility given 
likely increases in renewable generation and decreases in coal generation 
(Figure 5.1).

1.5 
Planning Policy Context 
1.5.1 
The ES and this ES NTS have been prepared with reference to all relevant 
European, national, regional and local policy.   Details of these are contained in 
Chapter 2 of the ES.  
1.5.2 
As referred to in Paragraph 1.4.2 above, the Department for Energy and Climate 
Change (now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) has 
published a number of NPS’ in relation to energy infrastructure, which were 
designated by the Secretary of State in July 2011. These NPS’ set out national 
policy against which proposals for NSIPs are assessed and decided on. 
1.5.3 
Due to the nature of the Project (which will generate over 50 MW of electricity), 
four of the designated NPS’ are considered relevant to the determination of the 
proposed DCO Application: 
� 
NPS for Energy EN-1: This sets out national policy for energy infrastructure 
as defined by the Planning Act 2008, which provides the primary basis for 
decisions by the Secretary of State; 
� 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure EN-2: This sets out 
policies specific to the determination of applications for fossil fuel electricity 
generating infrastructure; 
� 
NPS for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This 
sets Government policy on the relevant considerations and factors that 
should be taken into account as to route selection for developers for, inter 
alia, gas pipelines; and 
� 
NPS for Electricity Networks Infrastructure EN-5: This provides the primary 
basis for decisions taken by the Secretary of State on applications it 
receives for electricity network NSIPs, including the relevant considerations 
and factors that should be taken into account related to route selection. The 
Electrical Connection is underground rather than overhead but various 
policies may still be considered by the Secretary of State to be important 
and relevant in the determination of the Application for Development 
Consent. 
1.5.4 
NPS EN-1 states that consideration may be given to planning policy outside the 
NPS’ where it is important and relevant to the Secretary of State's decision. 
Other national planning policies have therefore been considered in the 
preparation of the ES as these may be relevant to the determination of the 
proposed DCO Application.

Site and Project Description 
2.1 
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is shown in ES Figure 1.2 and encompasses all elements of 
the Project described in Section 1.1 of this ES NTS. 
2.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection would be situated on land within former clay pits known as ‘The 
Rookery’. The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes 
and Bedford, approximately 3 km north-west of Ampthill, and 7 km south west 
of Bedford.  
2.1.3 
The Rookery comprises two pits: Rookery North and Rookery South. The 
Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area, Short Access Road and parts of the 
Access Road, Gas Connection and Electrical Connections would be located 
within Rookery South Pit. Part of the Access Road would lie within Rookery 
North Pit. 
2.1.4 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within the 
areas identified on Figure 1.2 of the ES and would extend from Rookery South 
Pit into agricultural land to the south. 
2.1.5 
To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, which 
provides indoor and outdoor community amenities. There is a Forest Centre 
within the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park located just to the south of 
Stewartby Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor and outdoor 
community amenities. In addition, the Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle 
testing facility, is located to the south west of the Project Site. 
2.1.6 
The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 150m to the west of the Project Site 
Boundary. To the north of Green Lane and The Rookery, lies Stewartby. Other 
neighbouring residential areas include Houghton Conquest, approximately 1.5 
km to the east; Marston Moretaine, approximately 1.2 km to the west; 
Stewartby, approximately 400 m to the north west, Lidlington, approximately 
400 m south west and Millbrook approximately 400 m to the south of the Project 
Site boundary. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.1.7 
The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) for which landowner this responsible.  This was the subject of a separate 
planning permission and would be taking place regardless of the Applicant's 
proposals for the Project. The objective of the LLRS is to restore the former clay 
workings to low grade agriculture. This would be achieved through the 
restoration of The Rookery at a low level (i.e. below pre-excavation ground 
levels), with measures included in the restoration to enhance biodiversity and 
landscape. Further details of the LLRS are described in Section 3.1 of the ES.

2.2 
Generating Equipment Technology 
2.2.1 
The Generating Equipment would provide a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW, operate as a peaking plant fired on natural gas, and could run up to a 
maximum of 2,250 hours in any given year, provided that the five year rolling 
average does not exceed 1,500 hours. Given these parameters, it has been 
determined that an OCGT plant is the preferred and most appropriate 
technology choice for the Generating Equipment for the Project. Further detail 
is provided in Section 3.3 and Section 3.3 of the ES and a schematic showing 
OCGT operation is shown below in Insert 1. 
2.2.2 
An ‘industrial’ type gas turbine would be used for the Project. This type of turbine 
has been selected as it is suited to generating up to 299 MW using only one 
unit, thereby reducing potential effects of noise, air quality and visual impacts. 
Additionally, they are suitable for frequent and fast start-ups, flexibility, and high-
availability maintenance techniques.   
2.2.3 
The main equipment in an OCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, including the 
following components: 
� 
Gas turbine generator; 
� 
Air inlet filter house; 
� 
Air inlet duct; 
� 
Exhaust diffuser; 
� 
Auxiliaries including: 
 Lube oil system; 
 Air dryers; 
 Fuel gas filter package; 
 Instrument air system;  
 Compressor washing; and 
 A stack with an exhaust silencer will also be part of the OCGT.  
2.2.4 
Air is compressed in the gas turbine and natural gas is injected. The fuel will 
then burn in the combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. This 
gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine, which drives the electrical 
generator to produce electricity.  
2.2.5 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released to the 
atmosphere via the stack.  
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
11 
 
2.2.6 
A stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project which has 
determined that the minimum stack height for the Power Generation Plant, 
required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air quality 
targets is 32.5 m. The maximum stack height would be 35 m. Further information 
on this is provided in Chapter 6 of the ES. 
2.2.7 
In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator at the Generating Equipment Site, the 
following balance of plant and buildings will also be present and can be seen on 
Insert 2 below: 
� 
Raw / Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank would be designed to 
comply with the relevant fire regulations and would be installed together with 
fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable extinguishers; 
� 
Demineralised Water Tank: Required to store demineralised water for the 
Generating Equipment (used for e.g. blade washing); 
� 
Control Room / office / workshop Building: Required in order to monitor the 
plant operation and house plant controls; 
� 
Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc.; 
� 
Electrical Transformer Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Generating Equipment to transformers before export 
to the NETS; 
� 
Natural Gas Receiving Station: Required to ensure that gas coming from 
the National Transmission System feeds into the Generating Equipment 
Site at the right flow and pressure conditions;  
� 
Telemetry apparatus including electrical cabinets; 
� 
Fin-fan coolers to provide cooling to the Generating Equipment; 
� 
Emergency Generator: a small diesel-fired generator used to safely shut 
down and control the Plant in the event of an outage of auxiliary power; and 
� 
Maintenance Compound: a small area of hard standing for use during 
maintenance procedures.

2.3 
Access Road 
2.3.1 
An agricultural access track is already in existence at the Project Site, linking 
Green Lane to Rookery South Pit.  The LLRS, as described in paragraph 2.1.7 
includes work to build a new ramp into the Rookery South Pit itself. 
2.3.2 
The Covanta RRF Project (which may be developed to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site) includes provision to upgrade this track further, to 
a tarmac road suitable for 594 traffic movements a day for the delivery of waste 
via HGV.  Should this road be developed as part of the Covanta RRF Project 
prior to the development of this Project, it would be suitable to meet both the 
needs of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project. In this instance, there would 
be a requirement for a short section of new Access Road (‘Short Access Road’) 
of up to 1.4 km in length connecting the end of the Covanta RRF road to the 
Generating Equipment Site. References in this ES NTS to the "Access Road" 
mean the up to 2.2 km access road referred to below and includes the Short 
Access Road. References to the "Short Access Road" refer only to the 
approximately 1.4 km length road that MPL would construct in the event that the 
Covanta scheme commenced ahead of the Project. The Short Access Road 
would be constructed from tarmac bordered by a concrete kerb. The tarmac 
surface would be 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic. It is bordered on one 
side by a footway.  
2.3.3 
However, because it is not certain when the Covanta RRF Project will be 
implemented, the Applicant has also included the provision of a complete 
Access Road from Green Lane to the Power Generating Site within this Project. 
If the Covanta RRF Project is not built before construction commences for the 
Project, then the complete Access Road would be built. This complete 2.2 km 
long Access Road would be constructed from tarmac bordered by a concrete 
kerb. The tarmacked surface would be 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic. It

would be bordered in part on one side by a footway where there is no existing 
footpath. 
2.3.4 
The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the alignment of 
the access road proposed within the LLRS and Covanta RRF Project along the 
existing access track which borders Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery 
South Pit, the Access Road (as would also be the case for the Covanta RRF 
Project's access road) would use the access ramp (built to agricultural standard 
as part of the LLRS as described below) to enter into the pit and cross through 
the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site.  
2.3.5 
Should the Access Road for the Project be constructed first, it would not prevent 
the Covanta RRF Project or other developments from progressing at a later 
date, although it may mean that the Access Road would be upgraded as part of 
the other scheme(s). The upgrade of the Access Road would be the 
responsibility of Covanta in the event that the permission for that scheme is 
implemented after any DCO for the Project. 
2.4 
Gas Connection 
2.4.1 
A new underground gas pipeline is required to connect the Generating 
Equipment to the existing National Transmission System to provide a reliable 
supply of fuel. Connection to the National Transmission System would require 
two above ground facilities to be installed, a minimum offtake connection facility 
(containing monitoring and control equipment), which would be owned by 
National Grid Gas, and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge launching facility (required 
for maintenance operations on the Pipeline) which would be owned by MPL. 
Together these form the above ground installation (AGI). 
2.4.2 
The pipeline begins at the AGI, which would allow connection into the National 
Transmission System Feeder 9, east of the Millbrook Proving Ground 
approximately 1.8 km south of the Generating Equipment Site. The Pipeline 
crosses a farm track which is connected to Lower Farm, National Transmission 
System Feeder 9, a PROW, drainage ditches, Millbrook Road and then an oil 
pipeline. The route then turns down into Rookery South Pit before terminating 
at the gas receiving facility within the Generating Equipment Site.   
2.4.3 
Construction of the Gas Connection would likely take place within a 50 m wide 
strip of land along the Gas Connection, which would be increased or decreased 
in size, where required (for example, decreased adjacent to nature conservation 
areas). It is expected that the Pipeline will be constructed using standard open-
cut cross-country pipeline construction techniques (i.e. a trench). Trenchless 
techniques (e.g. Drilling) may be used in some locations to reduce impacts on 
sensitive areas or public highways.  
2.5 
Electrical Connection 
2.5.1 
A new electrical connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Generating Equipment to be exported to the NETS. The most suitable point 
of connection would be a new substation (located adjacent to the Generating 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
14 
 
Equipment within Rookery South Pit), which would connect into the existing 
National Grid 400 kV overhead line which runs from Sundon to Grendon.  The 
400 kV line is located approximately 320 m south west of the Rookery South 
Pit, as shown on Figure 1.2 of the ES.  
2.5.2 
The Electrical Connection would comprise an underground double circuit Tee-
in. This would require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and 
be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, 
thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would also require two 
SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 
metres in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). In conjunction with the 
construction of the Electrical Connection a temporary diversion of the existing 
400 kV line located adjacent to the three most westerly existing transmission 
towers within the Project Site will be required.  It is anticipated that the temporary 
diversion is likely to be constructed as a single circuit outage of the existing 400 
kV line. The circuit is likely to comprise one temporary tower(s), being 
approximately up to 55 m high. The temporary works may also include the 
temporary erection of scaffolding over Station Lane.  
2.5.3 
Access for the purposes of installing and dismantling the temporary diversion 
would be as described for the Electrical Connection above. At this stage, it is 
anticipated that the installing and dismantling of the temporary works may 
require a closure of Station Lane for a number of hours and that the temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line would be in place for approximately five 
months.

2.5.5 
The Power Generation Plant would be designed to have an operational life of 
approximately 25 years, after which time it will be decommissioned or re-
powered depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy mix at 
the time. The Electrical Connection, AGI and respective cables and pipelines 
will be designed to be operational for the life of the Power Generation Plant. For 
the purposes of the EIA, it has been assumed that all these elements will be 
decommissioned at the end of the operational life of the Power Generation 
Plant, whenever that may be. 
2.6 
Alternatives 
Sites 
2.6.1 
The site selection process considered a range of factors, in accordance with 
Section 4.4 (Alternatives) of NPS EN-1 and Section 2.2 (Factors influencing site 
selection by developers) of NPS EN-2. This process included the following main 
phases, in order to identify a number of potential sites and refine this set of sites 
through increasingly detailed selection criteria: 
� 
Identification of a large number of potential sites across the UK through 
existing data sources; 
� 
Refinement of this set of sites, driven mainly by the need for electrical 
generation capacity to be located as closely as possible to the main 
sources of demand in the UK; 
� 
Further refinement based on the layout of the electricity and gas 
transmission networks in the UK, to ensure proximity to these networks; 
and 
� 
Assessment of the remaining sites based on technical, environmental and 
economic factors, as well as consideration of whether or not a proposed 
Project would be in accordance with local planning policy. 
2.6.2 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons:  
� 
Close proximity to the National Transmission System; 
� 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead line); 
� 
The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, lying 
below ground level; 
� 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
� 
It has a well-developed road network for access to the Project Site; 
� 
The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; and  
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
17 
 
� 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
balance of plant. 
2.6.3 
As a result of the site selection process outlined above, Drax is bringing forward 
three other power generation projects through the PA 2008 process. They are: 
Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk (www.progresspower.co.uk): 
Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk): and 
Abergelli 
Power 
Ltd 
at 
Abergelli 
in 
South 
Wales 
(www.abergellipower.co.uk).  The first two projects listed received DCOs in July 
2015. It is anticipated that Abergelli Power Ltd will submit an application for its 
NSIP to the Planning Inspectorate in 2018. 
Generating Equipment  
2.6.4 
Other technology choices were considered for the Generating Equipment, 
including Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; Reciprocating Gas 
Engine (RGE) plant and CHP Plant. However, OCGT is considered to be the 
most suitable technology choice for generating up to 299 MW as a peaking plant 
based on the following environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
� 
Visual impact: OCGT plants require a shorter stack compared to Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in 
views from the surrounding environment; 
� 
Water resources: the water requirement of a OCGT plant is significantly 
lower than for CCGT plants; 
� 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a OCGT plant would typically 
be lower than for a Reciprocating Gas Engine (RGE) plant. A larger number 
of RGE units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to 
generate up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
� 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that the 
Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly cost 
effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
� 
Start-up times: OCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to 
meeting variable demands. 
Gas Connection 
2.6.5 
The Scoping Report for the Project1 described a gas connection ‘opportunity 
area’, to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which a new gas 
pipeline and AGI would be developed. Since the publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies refined this opportunity area such that there were two

18 
 
remaining Gas Connection options presented during the Phase 1 Statutory 
Consultation and presented in the 2014 PEIR.  
2.6.6 
These options were chosen as the most direct connections between the 
Generating Equipment Site and the National Transmission System, avoiding 
obstructions such as roads, large changes in elevation, waterbodies and 
protected sites as much as possible.  
2.6.7 
Based on further refinement and feedback received during the Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation, this has been narrowed down further to one option as 
shown on Figure 1.2 of the ES and described above in Section 2.4. This option 
was selected because it is shorter (and therefore less expensive and less 
damaging to agricultural land), it also avoids crossing the midland mainline 
railway line.  
Electrical Connection 
2.6.8 
The Scoping Report for the Project described an Electrical Connection 
opportunity area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Following publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies were undertaken to refine the available options.  
2.6.9 
Based on these studies, it was determined that the most suitable location for 
the substation is likely to be next to the Generating Equipment Site within 
Rookery South Pit. However, a number of options still existed on the best way 
to connect the substation to the NETS. These included the use of an overhead 
line connection requiring new pylons.    
2.6.10 Following further refinement studies and feedback received during Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation, it was determined that the most appropriate method of 
connecting into the NETS would be via underground cables and SECs. 
2.6.11 As a result of further consultation in 2017, along with discussions with National 
Grid, the Electrical Connection was refined to one option which includes two 
SECs and a double circuit tee-in, as described in section 2.5 above.

Assessment Findings  
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
This section sets out, by topic area, a summary of the assessment of likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project. Further detail can be found in 
the ES topic chapters (6-15).  
3.1.2 
In accordance with Planning Act 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA process 
for the Project incorporates the following (further detail is provided in Chapter 3 
of the ES): 
� 
Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including obtaining 
a Scoping Opinion from the Secretary of State; 
� 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental alternatives; 
� 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing baseline 
environmental conditions for the Project Site and the relevant study areas 
for each topic; 
� 
Identifying the likely significant environmental impacts resulting from the 
Project; 
� 
Determining how the likely significant environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
� 
Assessing the significance of the likely significant environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the Project and those from other 
neighbouring developments and / or sources (in-combination and 
cumulative impacts); and 
� 
Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored. 
3.1.3 
As part of the EIA for the Project, MPL requested a Scoping Opinion from the 
Secretary of State in June 2014, who then consulted bodies such as CBC, 
Natural England and the Environment Agency to agree the scope of the 
assessment. The formal Scoping Opinion was received in July 2014 and is 
included in Appendix 2.1 of the ES. Further consultation was subsequently 
undertaken based on the 2014 PEIR, which was issued in October 2014. This 
provided preliminary environmental information up to the point of the Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation, based on the environmental surveys undertaken up to 
that point. 
3.1.4 
Because the DCO application for the Project was put on hold in 2015, MPL then 
prepared a revised PEIR and undertook a further round of statutory consultation 
in 2017.

3.1.5 
Throughout the following sections, the terms construction, operation and 
decommissioning have been used. These are defined as follows: 
� 
Construction – Construction of the Project. Depending on the final plant 
selection, this is anticipated to take approximately 22 months, starting 2020; 
� 
Operation – Operation of all aspects of the Project, including maintenance. 
The Project is anticipated to have a lifetime of approximately 25 years; and 
� 
Decommissioning – Removal of some plant items and site reinstatement 
when the Project has reached the end of its operational life. This is 
anticipated to take a similar time to construction. 
3.1.6 
The following assumptions have been made prior to and in the carrying out of 
the assessment: 
� 
Embedded mitigation will be employed - namely design/standard control 
measures, such as working within best practice guidance, which will 
routinely be incorporated for the Project or for most similar projects 
constructed in the UK, and as such will be used to produce the initial 
assessment as to the likely significant effects of the Project. Embedded 
mitigation includes the implementation of a Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP), which is a document designed to ensure best 
practice working methods are maintained on construction sites so that any 
risk of causing environmental harm is minimised as far as is reasonably 
practicable, such as spill prevention plans, correct storage of waste and 
prevention of pollution to land, air and water.  
� 
A worst case scenario for assessment has been undertaken for each topic. 
For the majority of topics this worst case scenario assumes one Gas 
Turbine Generator will be built on the Generating Equipment Site, with a 
stack of up to 35 m in height. For air quality and ecology, a worst case 
scenario has been assessed assuming that one Gas Turbine Generator will 
be built on the Generating Equipment Site, with a stack up to 32.5 m in 
height. This is because a lower stack gives rise to potentially more 
significant emissions. Further detail is provided in Section 6.4 and 8.4 of the 
ES.. All Chapters have assumed that the full length Access Road will be 
built out.  
� 
The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at the 
end of its operational life; 
� 
The Gas Pipeline will be left in situ at the end of its operational life;  
� 
The decommissioning phase will be similar in duration to the construction 
phase; 
� 
The Generating Equipment would operate intermittently for up to 2,250 
hours per year. This could be at any time during the year and for any 
length of time up to but not exceeding 2,250 hours and not exceeding 
1,500 hours on a five year rolling average; 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project

� 
The Power Generation Plant will have a rated electrical output of between 
50 and up to 299 MW; 
� 
Current surrounding land uses do not change, with the exception of the 
developments to be cumulatively assessed with the Project that have been 
identified as referred to in Paragraph 3.1.13 below; and 
� 
Assessments are based on published sources of information and primary 
data collection. 
3.1.7 
The assessments consider the sensitivity of a receptor and the magnitude of 
impact on a receptor. The significance of the effect on the receptor is then 
determined. Further detail is provided in the methodology section for each 
environmental topic in the ES (Chapters 6 - 15). A brief summary is provided 
below. 
3.1.8 
The sensitivity of a receptor is categorised from very high (for example an 
internationally designated site such as a Special Area of Conservation), high 
(for example a nationally designated site such as a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest), medium (for example a regionally designated site), low (for example a 
locally designated nature conservation site) to negligible (no sensitivity to 
change). The magnitude of impact on a receptor is categorised from major, 
moderate, minor, negligible to no change. The significance of the effect is then 
determined following the method shown below:

3.1.15 As part of the initial scoping of the EIA it was determined that certain topics are 
more likely to give rise to likely significant cumulative effects than others, based 
on the nature of the Project and surrounding development proposals. Therefore, 
certain topic assessments have focused specifically on quantitative potential 
cumulative effects and interactions.  These topics are air quality, noise and 
traffic and transport.  
3.2 
Air Quality 
Introduction  
3.2.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect air quality both through the generation of dust and particulate 
matter during the construction and decommissioning phases and the generation 
of stack emissions during operation. 
3.2.2 
A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling has been 
carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from the Project 
on identified human receptors within 10 km of the Project Site and ecological 
receptors within 2 km of the Project Site. These include properties at South 
Pillinge Farm, Stewartby and Houghton Conquest and Rookery Clay Pit County 
Wildlife Site. The assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 6 of the ES. 
A brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline  
3.2.3 
The nearest Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) to the Project Site is within 
Ampthill, approximately 4 km south of the Project Site. This is a specially 
designated area where national air quality objectives designed to protect human 
health are not being met or are in danger of not being met.   
3.2.4 
Monitored concentrations of pollutants within the 10 km of the Project Site (the 
study area) are presented in Section 6.6 of the ES. However, no exceedances 
of air quality objectives have been identified.  
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
25 
 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.2.5 
The main potential effects resulting from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project on air quality are from dust and particulate matter generated from 
construction activities (e.g. excavation for new foundations, stockpiling, 
materials transport, excavation of the gas pipeline route and excavation for the 
electrical cable and SECs). There is also a small potential for effects arising 
from exhaust emissions from construction traffic. Potential receptors are 
humans and ecological sites.  
3.2.6 
Despite this, it is considered unlikely that levels of dust or particulate matter 
would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to 
human or ecological receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site. Although the 
potential for dust generation through construction of the Project is large (given 
the scale of the Project Site) when taken into consideration alongside the low 
sensitivity of the study area (largely agricultural land, with scattered small scale 
residential development and the potential for bare soils during normal use) as 
well as the fact that the LLRS works will be responsible for the majority of site 
preparation, together with the nature of the Gas Turbine Generator which is 
such that it is largely pre-fabricated, means that risks of dust generation and 
deposition are low for all project elements.  
3.2.7 
The limited numbers of vehicle movements associated with the Project also 
means that there are not anticipated to be any impacts from exhaust emissions 
and in accordance with best practice guidance, these potential impacts were 
scoped out of the assessment.  
3.2.8 
Impacts would be minimised through implementation of a CEMP, which would 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather. 
Additionally, the majority of particulates from construction activities settle within 
a very short distance of the construction site. Therefore, there are expected to 
be no likely significant effects during construction and decommissioning on 
human and ecological receptors relating to dust.  
Operation 
3.2.9 
The main potential effects arising from operation of the Project are associated 
with the stack emissions arising as a result of the combustion of natural gas in 
the Generating Equipment. Emissions from the stack which have the potential 
to cause impacts on human or ecological receptors are limited to Nitrous Oxides 
(NOx), which can increase ground level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
which could impact human receptors or lead to nitrogen and acid deposition 
which could impact sensitive ecological habitats.  
3.2.10 However, modern gas fired power plants are inherently clean and produce far 
lower emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. coal) when compared 
on an energy output basis. Emissions of NOx are strictly limited under national 
and international guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED). 
Operation of the Generating Equipment will also be regulated by the 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
26 
 
Environment Agency under an Environmental Permit, which will limit emissions 
in line with national guidelines.  
3.2.11 Air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height which will 
achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits and prevent any 
likely significant effects to identified receptors is between 32.5 m and 35 m. It is 
concluded that there are expected to be no likely significant effects during 
operation of the Generating Equipment on human or ecological receptors.  
3.2.12 In terms of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, they will not directly 
generate any emissions during operation. Only very infrequent maintenance 
visits will take place, generating very few traffic movements. There is therefore 
considered to be a negligible effect on air quality from operation of the Gas 
Connection or Electrical Connection or from traffic emissions and these have 
been scoped out of the assessment.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.2.13 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of air 
quality.  
3.2.14 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.13 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for air quality are the Integrated Waste 
Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta RRF 
Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.2.15 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
air quality as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to consider 
the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise between it 
and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in relation to 
cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be assessed 
as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for the 
proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.2.16 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that although there were 
potential 
impacts 
arising 
from 
air 
quality 
during 
construction 
or 
decommissioning from dust, the implementation of embedded mitigation 
measures such as adhering to a CEMP would negate any effects on air quality. 
3.2.17 Similarly, potential impacts from dust deposition were identified for the Project. 
However, applying the embedded mitigation described in this Chapter, there are 
expected to be no likely significant effects arising from the construction and de-
commissioning of the Project from deposition of dust either. Based on 
professional judgement and experience and knowledge of other schemes, there 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
27 
 
are therefore not anticipated to be any likely significant effects from construction 
related dust deposition cumulatively from both projects. 
3.2.18 It is concluded that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation along with the implementation of embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF project, no potential cumulative likely significant 
effects will arise in relation to dust as part of construction and decommissioning.  
3.2.19 The proposed Covanta RRF project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site will release both oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide from the 
combustion process.  However, the exhaust stack for the Covanta RRF will be 
much higher than the stack for the Project (105 m compared to 32.5 m) and 
therefore the location of maximum ground level concentrations will be different 
from those associated with the Project.   
3.2.20 Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and the 
Generating Equipment together and the results are contained in Appendix 6.1 
of the ES.  There are not predicted exceedances of the assessment levels for 
human health impacts for the two plants operating together and therefore the 
cumulative effect is expected to be negligible and not significant. 
3.2.21 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the ES, along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise as between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.13. 
Conclusions / Residual Impacts 
3.2.22 No likely significant effects are anticipated on air quality, human or ecological 
receptors as a result of the construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed in the vicinity or in 
isolation.  
3.3 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
3.3.1 
The construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect local noise levels and generate vibration, which may affect 
sensitive receptors (e.g. residential properties) in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
3.3.2 
Noise surveys and noise modelling have been undertaken at the nearest noise 
sensitive receptors to the Project Site to assess the potential noise effects that 
may be caused by the Project. The assessment for this topic is provided in 
Chapter 7 of the ES. A brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.3.3 
The baseline noise climate in the area of the Project Site is largely dominated 
by distant road traffic / railway traffic / farm traffic and animal noise. Construction 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
28 
 
works associated with the LLRS are also ongoing which currently contribute to 
the background noise climate.  
3.3.4 
Background noise measurements were made at two residential properties 
deemed to be Noise Sensitive Receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site in 
order to determine the existing baseline noise climate (refer to the ES for further 
information). One of these locations was concentrated on the Power Generation 
Plant Site and Electrical Connection (South Pillinge Farm) and one was the 
closest residential property to the Gas Connection AGI (Lower Farm). These 
locations were agreed in consultation with CBC and are shown in Figure 7.1 of 
the ES. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.3.5 
Construction and decommissioning activity inevitably leads to some degree of 
noise disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities. Noise at the 
Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from e.g. 
excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation of the trenches to 
lay the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. This will however be a 
temporary source of noise. Based on a conservative, worst case assessment, 
where numerous large plant items are operating simultaneously across the 
Project Site, the significance of the overall effect of construction and 
decommissioning noise from the Project is predicted to be neutral for the Power 
Generation Plant, slight adverse for the Electrical Connection and slight adverse 
for the Gas Connection (and therefore not significant in all cases).  
3.3.6 
For the project as a whole, the effect is predicted to be slight adverse (and 
therefore not significant) at all receptor locations following the implementation 
of embedded mitigation measures, including the implementation of a CEMP, 
which will include (but is not limited to) the following measures:  
� 
All construction activities would be undertaken in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS 5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on 
Construction and Open Sites’ Part 1 Noise and Part 2 Vibration; 
� 
Only plant conforming with relevant national or international standards, 
directives or recommendations on noise or vibrations emissions would be 
used; 
� 
Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately, having 
regard to the manufacturer’s written recommendations or using other 
appropriate operation and maintenance programmes which reduce noise 
and vibration emissions; and 
� 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps would be 
positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance (e.g. as far away as 
practicable from sensitive receptors). If necessary, temporary acoustic 
barriers or enclosures would be provided. 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
29 
 
3.3.7 
It is considered that there would be no likely significant effects from noise 
generated by construction traffic using existing local roads given that the 
increase in traffic flow during construction would not be significant.   
3.3.8 
Given the distances involved between the Project Site and sensitive receptors 
(over 90m away), any vibration impact (e.g. from piling activities) has been 
scoped out of further assessment. 
Operation 
3.3.9 
During operation, noise disturbance could potentially occur from the rotating 
components of the Generating Equipment (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator unit 
and cooling equipment) when operational. There may also be a limited amount 
of noise from the Access Road from the small number of vehicles associated 
with the operation of the Generating Equipment, although this will not be 
significant when compared to the existing traffic noise.  
3.3.10 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken at 
the nearest sensitive residential receptors was modelled alongside noise levels 
predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the 
Project.  
3.3.11 Calculations indicated that noise levels at the nearest sensitive residential 
receptors would be below the measured background noise levels and therefore, 
no likely significant effects are anticipated.  
3.3.12 During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the AGI. 
This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the AGI regulates the 
flow of gas from the National Transmission System to the Power Generation 
Plant.  
3.3.13 This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to the AGI. 
Given that the closest residential property is over 100 m away, it is considered 
that the operational noise from the Gas Connection would be neutral. 
Operational noise from the Gas Connection and AGI was scoped out of further 
assessment due to this. 
3.3.14 No impacts are anticipated from operation of the Electrical Connection, given 
the typically imperceptible noise levels generated from an underground 
electrical cable. Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has therefore 
not been modelled as, although there will be a low level electrical hum produced 
at the substation this will not be perceptible at the Noise Sensitive Receptors. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.3.15 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
ES Non-Technical Summary

30 
 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of 
noise and vibration during construction, decommissioning or operation.  
3.3.16 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.13 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for noise and vibration are the Integrated 
Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.3.17 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
noise and vibration as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be 
assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for 
the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.3.18 A cumulative noise assessment has been undertaken with the Project and the 
Covanta RRF project for construction and operation, assuming that the 
construction and operational phases of the projects would occur simultaneously. 
The results of the modelling are presented in Chapter 7 of the ES. It is 
considered that provided the noise limits detailed within the ES are achieved no 
likely significant effects are likely to arise with both projects operating together.   
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.3.19 Provided that the measures and limits identified in the ES are met no likely 
significant effects are anticipated from noise as a result of the construction, 
operation and maintenance or decommissioning of the Project.  These 
measures and limits will be secured within the CEMP and as DCO 
Requirements. 
3.4 
Ecology 
Introduction 
3.4.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect ecological receptors (e.g. flora and fauna). The Project also 
has the potential to provide ecological value, for example, through the 
introduction of screen planting, which could provide additional habitat for some 
species. 
3.4.2 
In order to assess the potential for the Project to affect sensitive ecological 
receptors, desk studies and site walkover studies known as “Phase 1 habitat 
surveys” were undertaken.  
3.4.3 
Once the Phase 1 habitat surveys were completed, the resulting information 
obtained from them was then used to inform species specific surveys. These 
surveys involved field based assessments to determine the presence / absence 
of notable species and their population size if present. 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
31 
 
3.4.4 
Phase 2 surveys have been undertaken for the following species:  
� 
Invertebrates; 
� 
Great Crested Newts; 
� 
Breeding Birds; 
� 
Reptiles; 
� 
Bats; 
� 
Otters and Water Voles; and  
� 
Badgers.  
3.4.5 
The study area is 10 km from the Project Site for European and nationally 
designated sites, 2 km for local/non-statutory designated sites and up to 1 km 
for desk study records of protected and notable species (extended to 10 km 
from the Project Site for bat species). Field surveys were undertaken in 
individually defined survey areas.  
Baseline  
3.4.6 
Baseline conditions at the Generating Equipment Site comprise the Rookery 
South Clay Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS.  Part of the 
Access Road is located adjacent to Rookery North Pit (also a former clay pit 
which has been flooded). The Gas and Electrical Connections are mainly 
located within agricultural land interspersed with ditches, hedgerows and 
woodland.  
3.4.7 
The Extended Phase 1 surveys undertaken in both 2014 and 2017 confirmed 
that the base of the south western corner of Rookery South Pit presently 
comprises sparsely vegetated ground, swamp vegetation (including drying 
reedbeds) and bare ground.   
3.4.8 
Desk studies identified that there are no Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), 
Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or Ramsar sites within 10 km of the Project 
Site. 
3.4.9 
There is one SSSI within 2 km of the Project Site, Coopers Hill SSSI, which is 
approximately 1.4 km to the south east.   
3.4.10 A further 11 non-statutory designated sites are present within 2 km of the Project 
Site.  These include the large water bodies that dominate the base of the 
Marston Vale as well as woodland and grassland sites which are present both 
in the base and on the sides of the Marston Vale.  
3.4.11 The grid references and principal reasons for designation of these sites are set 
out in Appendix 8.1 of the ES. 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
32 
 
3.4.12 At the time that the Project is constructed, it is assumed that all great crested 
newts and reptiles will have been removed from the base of the Rookery South 
Pit and surrounding area as part of the translocation operation which has 
recently been completed.  In addition, the LLRS re-profiling works will replace 
any terrestrial habitat currently suitable for great crested newts, reptiles, 
breeding birds and/or invertebrates within Rookery South Pit with clay, 
rendering it of negligible nature conservation value for these species.   
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.4.13 The potential effects on ecological receptors during the construction and 
decommissioning phases are likely to be from indirect noise, vibration and 
lighting, as well as direct disturbance of habitats or indirect impacts from 
pollution (e.g. silt entering watercourses). The impacts could lead to effects on 
habitats and species within and adjacent to the Project Site.  
3.4.14 However, work is being carried out (as part of the LLRS scheme) to translocate 
certain ecological species, (for example, Great Crested Newts) from the Project 
Site so that by the time the Project starts construction, the Power Generation 
Plant Site will be of negligible ecological value. Furthermore, the areas where 
the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located have been 
found to be of limited ecological value due to intensive agricultural practices on 
the land.  
3.4.15 Furthermore, mitigation measures would be put in place to further limit potential 
impacts to ecology, including the careful timing of vegetation removal and 
maintaining an appropriate buffer around sensitive ecological sites during 
construction works. Compensatory planting and ponds would also be created 
as part of the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
(LEMMS) for the Project (see Appendix 11.3 of the ES). Therefore, no likely 
significant effects are predicted as a result of construction or decommissioning 
of the Project.  
Operation 
3.4.16 During operation, the main potential effects on ecological receptors are likely to 
result from stack emissions impacting on sensitive ecological sites. An increase 
in nitrogen deposition can cause a change in plant communities. An increase in 
acid deposition above the critical load can cause a decrease in soil base 
saturation and may cause toxicity to plants.  
3.4.17 However, air quality modelling (see Section 3.2 of this ES NTS and Chapter 6 
of the ES) has shown that setting the stack height at between 32.5 and 35 m 
will not result in any impacts to sensitive ecological sites. Therefore, no likely 
significant effects are predicted from operation of the Project on ecological 
receptors on the basis that the stack will be a minimum of 32.5 m in height.

Cumulative Effects 
3.4.18 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the 2 km study area for this topic 
within which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered 
that no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in 
respect of ecology during construction, decommissioning or operation.  
3.4.19 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.13 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for ecology are the Integrated Waste 
Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta RRF 
Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.4.20 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
ecology as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to consider the 
Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise between it and 
the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in relation to 
cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be assessed 
as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for the 
proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.4.21 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
likely significant effects arising from construction, operation or decommissioning 
of the project on ecology.  
3.4.22 The Landscape Strategy associated with the Covanta RRF has been taken into 
account when designing the outline LEMMS in Appendix 11.3 of the ES.  All 
areas of planting and habitat creation proposed associated with the Covanta 
Scheme has been taken into account in the context of the Strategy. Where 
planting associated with the Covanta Project is disturbed by the Project it would 
be replaced or an equivalent volume planted elsewhere. This will ensure that 
the biodiversity enhancements proposed associated with the Covanta Scheme 
can still be delivered.  
3.4.23 Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and the 
Generating Equipment together and the results are contained in Appendix 6.1 
of the ES.   
3.4.24 For the ecological features, all but one of the predicted annual mean oxides of 
nitrogen process contributions is insignificant, i.e. above 1% of the assessment 
level when the plants are operating simultaneously. In one case, (at Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS) there is a minor breach in annual mean oxides of nitrogen 
process contributions, at 1.7% of the assessment level. However, when 
combined with the background concentrations, no breaches of the critical level 
are predicted to occur and therefore the significance of effect is minor and not 
significant. The predicted daily mean oxides of nitrogen concentrations are not 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
34 
 
significant in EIA terms, and when added to the background concentrations, no 
breaches of the daily mean critical level are predicted to occur.  
3.4.25 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of mitigation described in the ES along with mitigation in the Covanta RRF 
Project, no likely significant cumulative effects will arise as between the Project, 
the Covanta RRF Project and the other developments referred to in Paragraph 
3.1.13. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.4.26 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on 
ecological receptors as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed 
in the vicinity or in isolation.  
3.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
3.5.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect water quality and resources, for example through introduction 
of pollutants and sediments to water bodies or for the Project to be impacted by 
flooding, or to cause flooding elsewhere.  
3.5.2 
It is however noted here that the Power Generation Plant would utilise air 
cooling, substantially reducing the need for water during operation. 
3.5.3 
A desk based assessment has been carried out with regards to water quality 
and resources. This has identified all surface water resources within the vicinity 
of the Project Site, as well as previous pollution incidents which may have 
impacted on water bodies. The potential for the Project to be impacted by 
flooding, or for development of the Project to result in an increased likelihood of 
flooding occurring elsewhere has also been fully assessed by undertaking a 
detailed Flood Risk Assessment including hydraulic modelling (Document 
Reference 5.4). 
Baseline 
3.5.4 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows to the north and west of the Project Site, close 
to the western boundary of Rookery South Pit, and drains a predominantly rural 
catchment of approximately 4.5 km2. It passes through a culvert beneath the 
Marston Vale Railway Line and ultimately outfalls to Stewartby Lake a further 
400 m downstream.  A tributary watercourse draining a catchment of 1.5 km2 
joins the Mill Brook to the east of South Pillinge Farm. These constitute the main 
watercourses in the vicinity of the Project Site and are shown in Figure 9.1 of 
the ES. 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
35 
 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.5.5 
The main potential impacts that may result from construction and 
decommissioning of the Project are contaminated material entering a surface 
water body or for the Generating Equipment Site to become inundated with flood 
water. 
3.5.6 
However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified (see Figure 9.1 of the ES) as best practice working methods and 
mitigation will be employed. These mitigation measures include having 
appropriate spill response plans in place, the refuelling of vehicles away from 
watercourses, and the siting of stockpiles and materials away from 
watercourses. These mitigation measures will be contained within the CEMP. 
The Gas Connection will need to cross two minor watercourses (drainage 
ditches). In order to minimise adverse effects best practice would be employed 
during construction of the Gas Connection to protect the water environment, in 
accordance with guidelines published by the Environment Agency and Internal 
Drainage Board. These include re-routing of drainage ditches if necessary and 
undertaking work at a time of year when ditches are likely to have lowest flow 
(e.g. summer) wherever possible.  
3.5.7 
It is predicted that following the implementation of embedded mitigation and 
best practice construction methods referred to above, any effects on water 
quality and resources will be negligible. Therefore, no likely significant effects 
are predicted as a result of construction or decommissioning of the Project. 
Operation 
3.5.8 
During operation, the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a 
surface water drainage system (which would tie into the drainage system 
developed as part of the LLRS) and a sewerage system which would feed to a 
septic tank, with waste tankered off site. The surface water drainage system 
would remove any potentially polluted runoff through the use of oil interceptors 
and silt traps, prior to discharge into an attenuation pond created as part of the 
LLRS.  
3.5.9 
Due to the very limited water demand of the Power Generation Plant once 
operational (only required for fire water tanks and cleaning the blades of the 
Gas Turbine Generator), all water is anticipated to be tankered to the Power 
Generation Plant Site and stored in water storage tanks adjacent to the 
administration buildings. However, there is also the possibility that MPL would 
connect into a mains water supply brought to the Covanta RRF project site, 
immediately north of the Generating Equipment Site. In either instance no 
surface water or groundwater abstraction would be required. 
3.5.10 Any water generated during washing of turbine blades will be retained on the 
Power Generation Plant Site in a storage tank and subsequently tankered off-
site by a licensed contractor. 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
36 
 
3.5.11 The Project will lead to an increase in the amount of runoff from within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary due to the increase in hardstanding. However, 
part of the LLRS works to Rookery Pit mean that any excess surface water (e.g. 
from a large storm event) will be effectively managed through the construction 
of a new surface water drainage system, which will discharge to an attenuation 
pond, therefore posing no risk to the Project Site from flooding. Further details 
regarding the LLRS drainage strategy are provided in Section 9.6 of the ES.  
3.5.12 Neither the Gas Connection nor Electrical Connection will require water during 
operation, nor will they have any impact on flooding or run off rates. It is 
anticipated that soakaway drains will surround the AGI and SECs which will 
effectively manage increased surface water runoff from an increased amount of 
hardstanding.  
3.5.13 It is predicted that there will be no likely significant effects on water quality and 
resources during operation of the Project. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.5.14 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur (1km). As such it is considered 
that no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in 
respect of water quality and resources during construction, decommissioning or 
operation.  
3.5.15 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.13 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for water quality and resources are the 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and 
the Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.5.16 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
water quality and resources as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will 
have to consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will 
arise between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future 
in relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would 
be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process 
for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.5.17 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on water quality and resources.  
3.5.18 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the ES along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other

developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.13 in respect of water quality and 
resources. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.5.19 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on water 
quality and resources or from flooding as a result of the construction, operation 
or decommissioning of the Project either cumulatively with other projects 
proposed in the vicinity or in isolation.  
3.6 
Ground Conditions 
Introduction 
3.6.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect ground conditions, for example, the removal of agricultural 
land or from contamination (existing or created) impacting on human health and 
other sensitive receptors. 
3.6.2 
A desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline geology 
and ground conditions underlying the Project Site. The assessment studied 
information regarding previous land uses of the Project Site and the surrounding 
area, the soils and geology present at the Project Site, any potential 
contamination issues resulting from former site uses and any potential ground 
stability hazards. Groundwater monitoring was also undertaken to establish 
groundwater quality in the study area (1km from Project Site) and previous site 
investigations were also studied to assess ground conditions.  
Baseline 
3.6.3 
Baseline conditions at the Power Generation Plant Site comprise the Rookery 
South former clay extraction pit. The Gas and Electrical Connections are mainly 
located within agricultural land to the south of the pit interspersed with ditches, 
hedgerows and woodland.  
3.6.4 
The geological sequence underlying the Project Site broadly comprises the 
Oxford Clay formation overlying the Kellaways Formation (sand and clays) 
which overlie Blisworth clay and limestone. Superficial deposits of alluvium have 
also been recorded across the Project Site. There are no significant 
groundwater bodies underlying the Project Site.   
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.6.5 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential impacts 
on ground conditions will be from; 
� 
Disturbance of any existing contamination and therefore causing effects to 
receptors through the creation of pollution pathways;  
� 
Unstable slopes associated with deep excavations or cuttings into the 
sides of Rookery South Pit; 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
38 
 
� 
Uplift from high groundwater levels; and 
� 
Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages. 
3.6.6 
Further information is provided in Section 10.6 of the ES.  
3.6.7 
However, embedded mitigation measures such as working within best practice 
guidelines and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be employed to prevent any 
contamination or pollution incidents impacting on ground conditions. This will 
include having an appropriate spill response plan (should any spillage of 
hazardous material occur), correct re-fuelling of vehicles and plant on 
hardstanding and the correct storage of potentially hazardous substances in 
bunded storage tanks. Thus there are expected to be no likely significant 
effects.  Furthermore, given the historical extraction of clay undertaken in the 
Power Generation Plant Site there are no designated geological sites or 
minerals or fertile agricultural land underlying the Power Generation Plant Site 
which could be affected or lost during construction. 
3.6.8 
Construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection will result in the 
loss of a small amount of agricultural land. However, this will be a relatively 
narrow corridor and most effects would be temporary as the land would be re-
instated. The area for the SECs and the AGI would be affected long term (for 
the lifetime of the Project) although these are small areas (0.32ha and 0.5ha 
respectively). Additionally, the land is deemed to be of moderate agricultural 
quality and in the case of the SECs has already been taken out of agricultural 
tenancy. It is therefore not anticipated that there would be a significant impact 
on soil resources or agricultural land as a result of the Project. 
Operation 
3.6.9 
The assessment has highlighted the potential for high groundwater levels in 
Rookery South Pit, which may have the potential to result in ground heave in 
the base of buried structures (e.g. foundations) associated with the Generating 
Equipment. If it occurred, this could result in the potential for uncontrolled 
release of groundwaters. However, given the placement of engineered low 
permeability fill across the base of the Rookery South Pit as part of the LLRS, 
widespread heave is not expected to occur. However, this cannot be confirmed 
until further ground investigations have been undertaken (as described in 
Section 10.9 of the ES) and therefore a precautionary approach has been taken 
to the assessment.  
3.6.10 These further assessments will form part of the additional mitigation measures 
required and will include Phase 2 investigations to confirm findings of Phase 1 
studies to date, along with the determination of an appropriate foundation 
solution and a subsequent reappraisal of risk. These measures will be secured 
within the CEMP and as DCO Requirements. There are not expected to be any 
likely significant effects following the implementation of these additional 
mitigation measures.

Cumulative Effects 
3.6.11 The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur (1km). As such it is considered 
that no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in 
respect of ground conditions during construction, decommissioning or 
operation.  
3.6.12 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.13 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for ground conditions are the Integrated 
Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.6.13 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
ground conditions as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would be 
assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process for 
the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
3.6.14 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on ground conditions.  
3.6.15 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the ES along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise as between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in Paragraph 3.1.13 in respect of ground conditions. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.6.16 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on ground 
conditions as a result of construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed in the vicinity or in 
isolation.  
3.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
Introduction 
3.7.1 
The Project has the potential to affect the landscape and people’s views and 
visual amenity due to the processes involved in construction (e.g. ground 
clearance, use of large plant), operation from the introduction of new large 
structures into the landscape (e.g. the stack of the Generating Equipment and 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
40 
 
SECs associated with the Electrical Connection) and decommissioning (e.g. 
dismantling structures, restoring land). 
3.7.2 
A desk based assessment and site visits have been undertaken to determine 
the baseline landscape character in which the Project would sit and the sensitive 
receptors which may be affected by the visual appearance of the Project. This 
study identified landscape character areas, landscape designations (such as 
registered parks and gardens and conservation areas), public rights of way, 
residential settlements and existing infrastructure. 
3.7.3 
Photographs were taken from a range of representative viewpoints in order to 
produce photographic models (photomontages) showing how the Project would 
look in the landscape. Key viewpoints were agreed with consultees and include, 
amongst others, residential areas, public rights of way and historic monuments. 
In line with best practice guideline, all the viewpoints are from publicly 
accessible locations. 
Baseline  
3.7.4 
Baseline conditions at the Generating Equipment Site comprise the Rookery 
South Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. The Access Road is 
located adjacent to Rookery North Pit (also a former clay pit which has been 
flooded). The Gas and Electrical Connections are mainly located within 
agricultural land to the south of the pit interspersed with ditches, hedgerows and 
woodland.  
3.7.5 
Most of the Project Site lies within National Character Area 88: Bedfordshire 
and Cambridgeshire Claylands but the southern part of the Project Site 
(including, e.g. the AGI) is within National Character Area 90: Bedfordshire and 
Greensand Ridge.  
3.7.6 
There are a number of footpaths surrounding the Project Site, as well as several 
small groups of residential properties. Key sensitive visual receptors include 
Houghton House, Ampthill Park House and footpath 7 which lies within the 
Project Site.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.7.7 
The main potential sources of landscape and visual effects during construction 
of the Project are earthworks, site clearance works, removal of vegetation (in 
the case of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection), presence of 
construction traffic, the presence of construction site lighting and the temporary 
diversion of footpaths. Given the limited construction period (22 months) and 
the relatively modest construction operations, these effects are considered to 
be not significant in the majority of cases.  
3.7.8 
However, from several distant and medium distance viewpoints and a small 
number of local viewpoints to the south and south-east, significant visual effects 
are anticipated.  
3.7.9 
These are from:

� 
From Katherines Cross, Ampthill; 
� 
Cottages near to Houghton House; 
�

� 
Public Footpath near Ampthill Park House; 
�

� 
Marston Vale Millennium Country Park; 
� 
Footpath within the Country Park near the railway; and 
� 
Footpath 7, near to Vehicle Proving Ground, to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
3.7.10 There will be also significant landscape effects on public rights of way and 
woodlands, trees and hedgerows during construction as footpaths will be 
temporarily diverted and there will be some loss of vegetation.  
3.7.11 However, these effects will be temporary.  
Operation 
3.7.12 During operation, effects on landscape and visual amenity will result from the 
introduction of permanent structures, particularly the stack of the Generating 
Equipment, which will be the largest structure on the Power Generation Plant 
Site. 
3.7.13 However, the Project will be largely screened from views as a large proportion 
is sited within the Rookery South Pit.  The Project will also be viewed in the 
context of other industrial development such as large towers of the former 
Stewartby Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line and 
towers and the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park.   
3.7.14 The stack of the Generating Equipment will be visible in some views from the 
south and south-east, particularly along the Greensand Ridge and from 
Footpath 7. However, the only significant visual effects during the operational 
phase will be the local viewpoints due to their proximity to the Project.  
3.7.15 It is anticipated that 15 years after commencement of operation of the Project 
all but one of these effects will have reduced to not significant as new mitigation 
planting including woodland belts and hedgerows will have matured to provide 
effective screening. 
3.7.16 Most of the significant landscape effects on public rights of way and woodlands, 
trees and hedgerows during the construction period will have reduced to not 
significant during operation. By year 15 these will have become significant 
benefits with the maturing of new woodland areas and hedgerows.

Cumulative Effects 
3.7.17 Construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, 
the assessment has shown that in the majority of cases there will be no 
significant effects on landscape or visual amenity arising from the Project during 
construction, operation or decommissioning alongside other planned 
developments.   
3.7.18 However, significant effects are predicted in views from the south, particularly 
Footpath 7, and in views from the south-east. Should construction of other 
developments occur simultaneously, then a significant cumulative effect may 
arise. However, the implementation of appropriate mitigation will limit these 
effects. Furthermore, other developments would also be required to mitigate any 
construction effects, such as through screen planting or use of hoardings.  
3.7.19 During operation, there is the potential for cumulative effects to arise from the 
Project together with other planned developments. The most significant of these 
other planned developments, from a landscape and visual impacts perspective, 
are anticipated to be from large scale industrial or power developments such as 
the Covanta Rookery RRF Project.  
Conclusions  
3.7.20 Based on the assessment, most of the predicted significant landscape and 
visual effects will occur during the construction period. Few significant effects 
persist into the operational period and some significant benefits are predicted 
with the maturing of new woodlands and hedgerows. 
3.8 
Traffic and Transport 
Introduction 
3.8.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect the local transport network, through the generation of 
additional traffic movements to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
3.8.2 
A desk based assessment and on-site traffic count has been carried out as part 
of the EIA. This identified and assessed the following: 
� 
Pedestrian and cycle facilities; 
� 
Public transport services including bus and rail services; 
� 
Private transport services including parking provision; 
� 
Highways networks and junctions; 
� 
Road safety and collision statistics; and

Impacts from increased traffic movements as a result of construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
Baseline 
3.8.3 
Access to the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed from the north near 
Stewartby via Green Lane. Green Lane links to Bedford Road and the A421 to 
the west, and Stewartby Way and the B530 to the east. There is a junction on 
Green Lane leading to an access track on the previously unexcavated land on 
the western side of Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery 
South Pit.  
3.8.4 
A new purpose built access road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
"Access Road") (should the Covanta RRF project not be constructed prior to the 
Project). The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the 
existing track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching 
Rookery South Pit, the Access Road (as would also be the case for the Covanta 
RRF Project's access road) would use the access ramp (built to agricultural 
standard as part of the LLRS) to enter into the pit and cross through the base 
of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site. It is proposed that the 
2.2 km long Access Road would be bitumen construction formed with kerbs and 
footway where needed, and would be approximately 6 m wide allowing for two-
way traffic.  
3.8.5 
Should the Covanta RRF project be constructed ahead of the Project, their 
access road would be suitable for use for the Project together with the Covanta 
RRF project. However, MPL would also construct the ‘Short Access Road’ from 
the Covanta RRF project site to the Generating Equipment Site, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection.  
3.8.6 
Two access routes will be used with regard to access for the Gas Connection, 
depending on which part of the Gas Connection is being accessed.  These 
access routes are shown on Figure 12.2 of the ES, and are as follows:  
� 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site; or 
� 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road. 
3.8.7 
Two access routes will be used for construction access for the Electrical 
Connection, depending on which part of the Electrical Connection is being 
accessed.  They are shown on Figure 12.2 of the ES and are as follows:  
� 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant Site; or 
� 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7 km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
44 
 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and 
Station Lane. The secondary access into the southern side of Rookery 
South Pit that is being constructed as part of the LLRS would then be used 
to access the Electrical Connection. One or two short spur tracks would be 
created to allow permanent access to the SECs from the LLRS secondary 
access track. 
3.8.8 
Any off-road site construction access would be temporary in nature, and would 
be removed following completion of the Access Road. In addition, any 
operational access requirement would have minimal and short-term ephemeral 
usage. 
3.8.9 
The Public Rights of Way (PROW) in the vicinity of the Generating Equipment 
Site are shown on the plan in Appendix 12.3 of the ES. 
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.8.10 During construction, the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to require up to 
40 HGV movements and 118 car movements per day during normal 
construction works. Construction / decommissioning of the Gas Connection will 
require up to 13 HGV and 41 car movements at the construction peak, and the 
Electrical Connection will require approximately 9 HGV and 25 car movements.  
3.8.11 The construction / decommissioning of the Project will also require the delivery 
/ removal of large plant items such as the Gas Turbine Generator, stack, cables 
associated with the Electrical Connection and sections of gas pipeline. There is 
therefore the potential to impact on the surrounding road network through for 
example, temporary road closures and requirement for escort vehicles.  
3.8.12 The increase in daily traffic flows on the surrounding road network has been 
calculated in terms of percentage increase over existing flows. The impact of 
these increases has then been calculated on sensitive receptors including 
KIimberley College, the Water Sports Club on Green Lane, footways and 
cyleways on Green Lane and users of footpaths and public rights of way.  
3.8.13 In terms of Pedestrian Severance, Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and 
Intimidation the assessment has shown that all of these relatively limited-
duration construction movements are generally well below the level at which 
changes can be perceived, and the significance of effect is therefore no greater 
than slight at any receptors and therefore not significant.  
3.8.14 Although peak construction movements on Green Lane are anticipated to be 
around 125 HGVs for a short period of time (1 to 2 days), the effect of this has 
been calculated as slight and therefore not significant.  
3.8.15 In addition, the relatively minor traffic flows associated with construction 
movements forecast are all below the level at which changes in road user delay 
or accidents and safety can be perceived or measured, and the significance of 
effect is therefore neutral and not significant. 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
45 
 
3.8.16 Notwithstanding, to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles on local 
towns and villages (particularly Stewartby), the Applicant would agree a 
contractor's Route Management Plan at the detailed design stage of the Project, 
to ensure the vehicles stick to agreed access routes and avoid built up 
residential areas as far as reasonably practical.  
3.8.17 Given these measures, together with the temporary nature of the construction 
phase, and the relatively few numbers of abnormal loads anticipated the effects 
on traffic and transport are predicted to be neutral and therefore there are 
predicted to be no likely significant effects during construction and 
decommissioning of the Project.  
Operation 
3.8.18 During normal operation of the Project, up to five members of staff would be 
working at the Generating Equipment Site at any one time. Three shifts per day 
are assumed, to provide 24 hour coverage. These shift changes would be timed 
to avoid the network peak hour i.e. morning and evening rush hours, hence the 
highway impact would be minimised. Additionally, there will be infrequent 
maintenance visits by one or two engineers.  
3.8.19 During the annual maintenance of the Generating Equipment, there may be up 
to 40 additional staff on site for a typical maintenance period of one month. It is 
assumed that all these trips would all be made by car, assuming 1.6 occupants 
per car, as per the average Journey to Work car occupancy within the National 
Travel Survey. Reflecting the typical working hours on construction sites, it is 
assumed that majority of these movements would be made outside of the 
network peak. However, in order to provide a robust assessment, it has been 
assumed that up to 25% of these movements would occur at peak times and a 
further 4 HGV movements per day are assumed during maintenance. 
3.8.20 Neither the Gas Connection, nor Electrical Connection will be manned. They 
will have very infrequent service and maintenance visits (less than 1 per week).  
3.8.21 Even during the higher traffic generating periods in the short-term maintenance 
period, all of these operational phase movements are so low that they are well 
below the level at which changes can be perceived, and that they are therefore 
neutral and not significant. 
3.8.22 Therefore, normal operation of the Project is not anticipated to have any likely 
significant effects on the local road network. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.8.23 The Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13.  
3.8.24 The projects which are considered to be of relevance to the cumulative 
assessment have been agreed with consultees and the traffic numbers 
generated by these developments have been built into predicted ‘future year 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
46 
 
growth forecasts’ which set out likely traffic numbers on the local road network 
taking into consideration future developments proposed for the area.  
3.8.25 The total cumulative traffic generation anticipated from projects included in the 
future year growth forecast are compared have been compared to the likely 
traffic generation from the Project during construction, operation and 
decommissioning. 
3.8.26 This analysis has shown that the trip generation from other developments is 
significantly greater than that from the Project. 
3.8.27 The small increase in traffic movements generated by the Project, together with 
the relatively low sensitivity of the surrounding road network, mean that the 
addition of the Project makes no difference to the level of effect resulting from 
all other developments and therefore the cumulative effect of the Project is not 
significant.    
3.8.28 Given the proximity of the Covanta RRF project and the potential for overlapping 
construction and operational phases, the likely worst case potential cumulative 
effects would arise from the operation of Covanta RRF Project (779 vehicles) 
with the peak in construction of the Project (288 vehicles). The CTMP (Appendix 
12.1 of Document Reference 6.2) provides for a traffic management scheme at 
the Green Lane level crossing taking into account Covanta RRF traffic which 
would limit any impacts so that they are not significant. Key to this traffic 
management scheme is timing of construction movements so they do not 
coincide with the busiest times of waste delivery for the Covanta RRF.   
3.8.29 The Covanta RRF ES concluded that whilst an increase in vehicle movements 
along the A421 and Green Lane would result in a significant increase in terms 
of percentage change for HGVs, traffic levels would remain relatively low in 
absolute terms and as such the traffic levels were deemed to be at an 
acceptable level.  
3.8.30 Further to this, the TA (Appendix 12.1 Document Reference 6.2) provides an 
assessment of potential impacts on junction capacity taking into consideration 
the Project cumulatively with other proposed projects in the vicinity. Junctions 
assessed were Green Lane / Project Access Road and Bedford Road / Green 
Lane. This assessment has concluded that the impact on the links is shown to 
be minimal and that the junctions both operate well within capacity with minimal 
queuing or delay. 
3.8.31 Taking the above into consideration, the Project is not anticipated to give rise to 
any significant cumulative effects with other projects in the vicinity of the Project 
Site. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.8.32 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated from traffic 
and transport as a result of the construction, operation or decommissioning of

the Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed in the vicinity or in 
isolation.  
3.9 
Historic Environment 
Introduction 
3.9.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect both above ground and buried archaeological assets, as well 
as the potential to affect the setting and appreciation of assets of Cultural 
Heritage importance, including, for example, surrounding Listed Buildings, 
Registered Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation 
Areas. 
3.9.2 
An archaeological desk based assessment and site visit were carried out as 
part of the archaeological assessment which identified archaeological and 
cultural heritage assets in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
3.9.3 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Chapter 13 of the ES. A brief 
summary of the likely significant effects identified is provided below. 
Baseline 
3.9.4 
The Power Generation Plant is depicted on historic maps as being agricultural 
fields until the 1970s when the Rookery Pits are first shown. By 1988-89 
Rookery north and south were both disused. Land on which the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection will be sited has remained as undeveloped land 
according to the earliest historical mapping data available.  
3.9.5 
No significant features or structures of archaeological or historic interest have 
been recorded on the Bedfordshire Historical Environmental Record (HER) 
within the Power Generation Plant Site, representative of the fact that the 
majority of it is located within a former clay extraction pit.   
3.9.6 
A number of crop marks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the vicinity of the Gas Connection, although previous excavations in the 
area did not reveal any archaeological remains.  
3.9.7 
A number of cropmarks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the vicinity of the Electrical Connection, which relate to Romano-British 
remains.  
3.9.8 
A review of the National Heritage List for England confirmed there to be no 
designated heritage assets within the Power Generation Plant Site or within the 
Gas Connection or Electrical Connection. Tables 13.5 to 13.9 in the ES list the 
designated assets within the wider study area (5 km from the Project Site).  They 
include 12 Scheduled Monuments and 22 listed buildings, 5 Conservation Areas 
and 1 Registered Park and Garden.  
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
48 
 
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.9.9 
The extent of any previous disturbance to buried archaeological remains is an 
important factor in assessing the potential impact of the Project.  
3.9.10 Given that the Power Generation Plant Site is within formerly developed land 
(e.g. previously excavated Rookery clay pits) which are subject to ongoing 
construction works as part of the LLRS, it is likely that any archaeology would 
have already been removed. Therefore, the assessment has concluded that 
there will be no physical direct impacts on any heritage assets. The assessment 
has shown that no features or structures of archaeological interest have been 
recorded on the Bedfordshire HER within the area of the Power Generation 
Plant.   
3.9.11 The majority of the construction works will not be visible outside of Rookery 
South Pit and therefore will have no impacts on the setting of any heritage 
assets.   
3.9.12 The Access Road will have no potential impacts on designated heritage assets.  
3.9.13 The Gas and Electrical Connection are in previously undeveloped agricultural 
land, and therefore there remains the potential for impacts on as yet 
undiscovered 
buried 
archaeology. 
Although 
previous 
archaeological 
investigations in the vicinity of the Gas Connections did not reveal any 
significant archaeology, further assessment of this area will be undertaken prior 
to construction in order to fully characterise the extent of any archaeological 
deposits at the Project Site.  This will involve stripping off and recording any 
discovered archaeology prior to construction, thereby limiting any effects. This 
will also be undertaken along the route of the Electrical Connection, in the 
proximity of previously identified cropmarks and Roman remains.  
Operation  
3.9.14 During operation, the introduction of the stack associated with the Generating 
Equipment has the potential to have minor adverse effects on surrounding 
cultural heritage assets such as listed buildings. There is also the potential for 
intervisibility between the stack of the Generating Equipment, the SEC 
associated with the Electrical Connection and the AGI of the Gas Connection 
and up to five Scheduled Monuments. However, in all cases effects are 
anticipated to be no more than a slight adverse indirect effect on the setting of 
any of the assets, and for the majority of assets, there will be a neutral indirect 
effect.   
Cumulative Effects 
3.9.15 The Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13. However, most of the proposed developments are greater 
than 2 km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within 
which potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
49 
 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of 
archaeology and cultural heritage during construction, decommissioning or 
operation.  
3.9.16 The only projects listed in Paragraph 3.1.13 which are considered relevant to 
the cumulative effects assessment for the historic environment are the 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and 
the Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
3.9.17 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts on 
archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of this project. Should it go ahead 
it will have to consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative 
impacts will arise between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is 
needed in future in relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and 
the Project would be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the 
permission process for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities 
development. 
3.9.18 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no likely 
significant effects arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the project on archaeology and cultural heritage.  
3.9.19 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation, along with the embedded mitigation in the Covanta 
RRF Project, cumulative and combined operational impacts with Covanta are 
the same nature and magnitude as the Proposed Development on its own in 
respect of archaeology and cultural heritage. 
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.9.20 Based on the assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on 
archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project either cumulatively with other projects proposed 
in the vicinity or in isolation. Further work will be undertaken to confirm the 
potential effects of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection on buried 
archaeology prior to construction in the form of trial trenching and recording of 
any discovered archaeology.  
3.10 Socio-economics 
Introduction 
3.10.1 The Project has the potential to affect the socio-economic make-up of the 
surrounding area due to increased investment to the local economy and labour 
market distortions. It also has the potential to affect community infrastructure by 
placing pressure on facilities used by construction workers and their families. 
Additionally, the Project could have potential effects on the tourism economy 
should it cause potential tourist to be dissuaded from visiting the area. 
ES Non-Technical Summary

3.10.2 The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using standard 
indicators. This provides a baseline from which potential impacts and effects 
can be assessed: 
� 
Socio-economic/ labour market: research has been undertaken into the 
business and labour market structure of the local economy; 
� 
Tourism economy: the area’s visitor attraction has been profiled including: 
visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and value; and 
the local tourism economy; 
� 
Community Infrastructure: an audit of community infrastructure including 
GP facilities, education facilities, sport and recreation facilities, pharmacies 
and dentists has been prepared; and 
� 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other relevant policy 
has been reviewed to identify related economic, social and regeneration 
objectives which the Project may affect.  
3.10.3 The study areas are as follows:   
� 
The socio-economic assessment is based on drive time catchment areas 
from the Project. The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30 minute drive time, 
‘wider area’ within a 45 minute drive time, and ‘wider region’ within a 60 
minute drive time.    
� 
The tourism / recreation study area is based on a 10km radius from the 
Project Site. 
� 
The community infrastructure assessment is focussed on the area defined 
within an approximate 5 km radius from the Project Site.   
Baseline 
3.10.4 The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the Project is 
characterised by a pattern of population increase since 2001 which is expected 
to continue until 2035. The area has a declining work age population with more 
than one fifth of the population expected to be at retirement age by 2035. This 
is also coupled with high economic activity which is considerably higher than 
the UK average. Retail work is the main employment category in the local area, 
and is above the national average. 
3.10.5 Tourism volume and value in Central Bedfordshire recovered strongly during 
the period 2011 to 2013 but has decreased slightly between 2013 to 2015 and 
now accounts for approximately one third of Bedfordshire’s tourism economy.  
Previously Central Bedfordshire accounted for approximately a quarter of 
Bedfordshire’s tourism volume and value.  
3.10.6 An initial audit of community facilities shows there is sufficient capacity to 
accommodate additional demand from construction workers.

3.10.7 The community infrastructure audit has identified:  
� 
17 schools within approximately 5 km of the Project Site (capacity for 
1,027 pupils);  
� 
Six GP surgeries (all accepting new patients);  
� 
One hospital; 
� 
Five pharmacies; and 
� 
One library.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.10.8 The Project will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of the 
area through both employment creation and capital expenditure and worker 
spending in the local economy. It is anticipated that up to 122 construction 
workers would be required at the Project Site during peak periods at any one 
time. Project construction would support up to nine permanent full time 
equivalent construction jobs.  
3.10.9 These workers would not only benefit the economy directly, but would also have 
knock on effects on other businesses (e.g. slight positive impact to 
accommodation providers in providing accommodation for temporary workers). 
3.10.10 No likely significant effects are predicted on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of the Project from traffic and accessibility, noise, 
landscape and visual and air quality impacts, given that assessments in 
Chapters 12 and 6 respectively have concluded that there will be no likely 
significant effects arising from these areas.  
Operation 
3.10.11 During operation, there will be up to 5 members of staff at the Project Site. This 
is anticipated to bring minor beneficial effects to the area in the vicinity of the 
Project Site through the generation of jobs and investment of staff from e.g. 
spending their wages locally.  
3.10.12 No likely significant impacts are predicted on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of operation of the Project from visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts, given that assessments in Chapters 11, 7, 
12 and 6 respectively have concluded that there will be no likely significant 
effects arising from these areas on tourism or community assets.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.10.13 Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Paragraph 3.1.13.  
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
52 
 
3.10.14 A total of 6,734 temporary construction jobs would be required to build nearby 
projects, including the Covanta RRF Project.  The assessment shows that there 
is sufficient labour in a 60-minute drive time of the Project to build all of the 
cumulative projects The cumulative projects could therefore be built using 
labour from the Project labour market area without creating any minor labour 
market distortions.  The projects would therefore contribute to an overall slight 
benefit in terms of job creation.   
3.10.15 The air quality and traffic Chapters (6 and 12 respectively) conclude that there 
would be no significant adverse cumulative effects.  Therefore, it has been 
concluded that cumulative impacts on tourism and recreation receptors would 
also be not significant during the construction/decommissioning process, 
especially given that there are limited tourism and recreation receptors in close 
proximity to the Project Site.   
Conclusions / Residual Effects 
3.10.16 No likely significant effects are anticipated on socio-economics as a result of the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project in isolation or 
cumulatively with other projects in the vicinity. However, there are likely to be 
minor beneficial effects from investment and job creation at all stages of the 
Project.  
3.11 Other Issues Considered  
3.11.1 It is recognised that some of the statutory consultees have raised concerns that 
the Project may give rise to environmental impacts over and above those 
described in this ES NTS. Specifically, it has been requested that the Applicant 
assesses waste arising from the Project and Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) 
arising from operation of the Electrical Connection.  
Waste 
3.11.2 As part of the construction works, there is likely to be limited potential for the 
generation of waste given that the LLRS will ensure that a level platform is 
created in the base of the Rookery South Pit on which to site the Generating 
Equipment. There may be small amounts of waste spoil produced from 
excavations for foundations, for the Pipeline associated with the Gas 
Connection and for the trench associated with the Electrical Connection, 
although it is hoped that as much of this as possible can be re-used on site.  
3.11.3 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework Directive, 
the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (where 
relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the Project, will seek to apply the waste 
hierarchy as part of their waste prevention and management policy. 
3.11.4 The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
� 
Prevention; 
� 
Re-use; 
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
53 
 
� 
Recycling; 
� 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
� 
Disposal. 
3.11.5 A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of construction 
method statements for approval by the local authority prior to commencement 
of construction, secured by a requirement attached to the DCO.  
3.11.6 Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used 
on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from 
de-watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
3.11.7 In order to facilitate the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive 
during decommissioning, many of the structures and equipment for the 
proposed Project will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far as is 
practicable. For example, a large proportion of the buildings will be constructed 
of pre-fabricated steel and will therefore be of interest to scrap metal merchants. 
3.11.8 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the Project 
Site at any time, and any such substances will be held in secured containers to 
prevent contaminant migration. Closed storage facilities or suitable dampening 
techniques will be utilised within the Project where emissions of dust etc. from 
waste are possible. All mitigation measures will be in full accordance with 
industry good practices. 
3.11.9 The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a manner 
that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project Site) waste 
will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. Where 
hazardous waste is transported from the Project Site, it will be handled in 
accordance with relevant regulations, and, where necessary, be transported in 
sealed tankers. 
3.11.10 During operation a feature of the Gas Turbine Generator technology to be 
incorporated in the Project is that waste generated should be minimal and will 
be restricted to the following: 
� 
General office wastes; 
� 
Used air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
� 
Used ion exchange resins or used membranes (typically replaced every 5 
to 10 years); 
� 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
� 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers.

3.11.11 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that the Project will result in no 
likely significant effects with respect to waste.  
Human Health 
3.11.12 The potential for likely significant effects of the Project on human health relate 
primarily, to exposure to excessive levels of noise, pollutants released during 
construction or operation of the Project (to the air, water or land) as well as 
effects relating to EMFs.  
Air Quality 
3.11.13 It is considered unlikely that levels of atmospheric dust would be generated 
which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to local people in the vicinity 
of the Project Site (Chapter 6, section 6.7). The limited numbers of vehicle 
movements associated with the Project means that significant effects on human 
health from exhaust emissions are not anticipated. 
3.11.14 Air quality modelling has shown that the stack height selected for the Project of 
32.5 – 35 m will achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits 
and prevent any impacts to identified receptors. It is concluded, therefore, that 
there will not be any likely significant effects on human health as a result of NOx 
emissions during the operational phase of the Project.   
Noise and Vibration 
3.11.15 A numerical model has been created which assesses likely construction related 
noise in comparison to measured background levels of noise at the Project Site. 
Based on a conservative, realistic worst case assessment, where numerous 
large construction plant items are operating simultaneously, the likely 
significance of the overall effect of construction and decommissioning noise 
from the Power Generation Plant is predicted to be neutral at all receptor 
locations and therefore not significant following the implementation of 
embedded mitigation measures. 
3.11.16 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken at 
nearest noise sensitive receptors were modelled alongside noise levels 
predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the 
Project. 
3.11.17 The predicted noise levels are below the proposed significant observed adverse 
effect level (SOAEL). This is defined as the level at which significant health 
effects on receptors is likely to occur or when noise causes a material change 
in behaviour and/or attitude, e.g. having to keep windows closed most of the 
time; avoiding certain activities during periods of intrusion; potential for sleep 
disturbance resulting in difficulty in getting back to sleep; or quality of life 
diminished due to change in acoustic character of the area. There are therefore 
not predicted to be any likely significant effects on noise receptors.

Pollution and Contamination 
3.11.18 Mitigation measures such as working within and adhering to a detailed CEMP 
during construction will be employed to prevent any contamination or pollution 
incidents impacting on ground conditions. This will include having an 
appropriate spill response plan, correct re-fuelling of vehicles and plant on 
hardstanding and the correct storage of potentially hazardous substances in 
bunded storage tanks. These mitigation measures will ensure that there will be 
no likely significant effects from pollution and contamination on human health. 
3.11.19 During the operational phase, there is the potential for the contamination of 
surface water resulting from the flushing of silts and hydrocarbons from areas 
of hardstanding within the Project Site.  However, such impacts would be 
controlled by the embedded mitigation measures implicit within the Project, 
comprising industry standard/best practice and measures required to ensure 
legislative compliance, contained within an operational environmental 
management plan secured through the EP.  On this basis, the impact is 
considered to be negligible and is therefore not significant in terms of human 
health. 
Electromagnetic Fields 
3.11.20 The potential effects of electric and magnetic fields is a specialised area which 
relies upon extensive work of worldwide experts. UK Power developers (such 
as the Applicant) rely on national guidelines in accordance with Government 
advice to ensure that new installations consider health risks based on current 
knowledge. The UK’s Health Protection Agency provides independent 
recommendations to the Government based on reviews of international study 
results. 
3.11.21 In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to power-
frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) are 
adopted in the UK as recommended by the NRPB. 
3.11.22 The proposed substation would be surrounded by an earthed metal fence and 
consequently the electric field outside of this fence due to the substation 
equipment it encloses would comply with ICNIRP exposure guidelines for the 
public. 
3.11.23 There are no external electric fields associated with underground cables. 
Electric fields associated with underground cable are contained by the sheath 
of the cable itself. The public would thus not be exposed to electric fields from 
the proposed underground cables.  
3.11.24 Some equipment within the substation would produce magnetic fields, but these 
fields tend to diminish rapidly with increasing distance from the equipment. 
Magnetic fields outside the substation due to these items of equipment are 
inherently compliant with public exposure limits, as discussed above.  
ES Non-Technical Summary  
Millbrook Power Project

3.11.25 The prospective magnetic field strength due to the proposed underground 
cables is calculated to remain below the public exposure basic restriction levels. 
3.11.26 There will be a magnetic field due to the underground cable from the SECs 
beside the existing overhead line to the Substation. However, this will be a 
relatively short length of cable and given the conclusions above, there will be 
no impacts arising from this which could give rise to public health issues 
3.11.27 A full EMF report is included with the DCO Application (Appendix 15.1 of 
Document Reference 6.2). 
Cumulative Effects on Human Health  
3.11.28 The assessment described above has shown no likely significant effects are 
anticipated to arise from construction of the Project on human health.   
3.11.29 The DCO for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site included a health impact assessment (HIA). The HIA concluded that 
although there were potential impacts arising from construction and 
decommissioning of the project on human health from air quality, noise, socio-
economics, traffic and visual effects, the implementation of mitigation measures 
precluded any impacts from the construction of the Rookery RRF. 
3.11.30 The results of cumulative assessments during construction and operation in 
terms of air quality, noise and vibration, and pollution and contamination (ground 
conditions) are set out in sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.6 respectively.  
3.11.31 These assessments have concluded that there would be no likely significant 
cumulative effects on sensitive receptors, including human health.  
Residential Amenity 
3.11.32 The amenity of a property can be affected by various factors including local 
changes in views from the property, external noise and changes in local air 
quality. 
3.11.33 A consideration of these potential impacts on amenity at each property lying 
within 0.75 km of the Project was made from the nearest public vantage point. 
In the case of visual effects, this included a review of aerial photography to 
understand the orientation of windows and gardens towards the Project Site and 
the degree of screening from intervening vegetation that could be taken into 
account when assessing the magnitude and degree of visual effect. 
3.11.34 Although there is no published guidance that sets out the criteria for establishing 
whether or not the visual presence of a development impacts unacceptably on 
living conditions, the distance of 0.75 km for the consideration of potential 
effects has been examined at several public inquiries. 
3.11.35 The visual element of the assessment identified temporary significant visual 
impacts would occur during construction at six viewpoints. Of these, four 
viewpoints (VP5, VP6, VP7 and VP15) are considered representative of

residential receptors. However, only one of these were from properties within 
0.75 km of the Project Site (VP15 on a publicly accessible footpath near to South 
Pillinge Farm). No other residential receptors lie sufficiently close to the Project 
Site to experience potentially overbearing visual amenity impacts.  
3.11.36 In the longer term, visual effects would be mitigated by screen planting which 
would take approximately 15 years.  
3.11.37 For properties where a significant visual impact would be likely to occur (in EIA 
terms), it was concluded that the potential impact on living conditions from views 
would be acceptable without the benefits of mitigation planting, and would not 
be overbearing or oppressive. The conclusion was based on the intervening 
distance, the extent of screening from existing vegetation, and the orientation 
of views from the properties.  
3.11.38 Visual impacts would be further mitigated by the proposed screen planting 
which would have a noticeable affect approximately five years after planting and 
achieve its full effect after around fifteen years. 
3.11.39 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken at 
nearest noise sensitive receptors were modelled alongside noise levels 
predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the 
Project. 
3.11.40 This assessment has shown that South Pillinge Farm (the nearest residential 
receptor), the predicted noise levelis 38 dB.  
3.11.41 The predicted noise levels are therefore below the measured background levels 
(39dB) and below the proposed SOAEL.  
3.11.42 As such, predicted noise levels from the Project to external amenity areas of 
residential dwellings are considered unlikely to cause annoyance. 
3.11.43 Finally, in terms of Air Quality, the risk of a loss of amenity during construction 
at residential properties will be low due to on the embedded site mitigation 
measures inbuilt into the Project, and the distance from residential areas. In 
most cases, significant impacts are generally only seen within 20 m – 50 m of 
construction activities. 
3.11.44 During operation of the Project, the impacts of the emissions will be 
imperceptible. Gas combustion does not produce any odorous compounds or 
particulate matter that would be visible, and will thus have no impact on local 
amenity.

Overall Conclusions 
4.1.1 
This ES NTS provides a background and sets the context of the Project and 
summarises (in non-technical language) the assessment of environmental 
effects from the Project. 
4.1.2 
It has concluded that the use of OCGT is the most appropriate technology 
choice for the Generating Equipment and that the Project Site is appropriate to 
support a project of this nature. Key features of the Project site are the close 
proximity to existing gas and electrical connection infrastructure.   
4.1.3 
The assessment of environmental effects has shown that the Project can be 
responsibly delivered without causing significant harm to the environment. No 
likely significant effects are predicted on local air quality, noise, ecology, water 
quality, ground conditions, traffic and transport and historic environment during 
the construction, operation or decommissioning phases in isolation, or 
cumulatively with those developments listed in Paragraph 3.1.13. 
4.1.4 
Minor positive effects are likely to result on the socio-economics of the area 
surrounding the Project Site due to an increase in workforce during all phases 
of the Project.  
4.1.5 
Based on the assessment, most of the predicted significant landscape and 
visual effects will occur during the construction period and are therefore of a 
limited duration. Few significant effects persist into the operational period and 
some significant benefits are predicted with the maturing of new woodlands and 
hedgerows.
