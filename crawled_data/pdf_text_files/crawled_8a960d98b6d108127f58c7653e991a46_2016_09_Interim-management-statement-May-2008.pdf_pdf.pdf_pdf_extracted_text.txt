Interim Management Statement 
 
 
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 January 2008 to 
date. 
 
Trading conditions in the commodity markets in which we operate have improved in the year to 
date and we are pleased to report that our current expectations for the full year are now modestly 
higher than our expectations at the time of our preliminary results announcement on 4 March 2008.  
This is primarily a consequence of improvements in dark green spreads. Our expectations for the 
year are based on our current contracted position as well as prevailing conditions in the commodity 
markets.  
 
Other than the contract for construction of a biomass processing facility with Alstom Power Limited, 
which is the subject of a separate contemporaneous announcement, there have been no material 
events or transactions, nor any material change in the underlying financial position of the group 
during the period. 
 
Drax will issue a pre close statement on 30 June 2008 in which it will update the market on the 
contracted positions for 2008, 2009 and 2010.
