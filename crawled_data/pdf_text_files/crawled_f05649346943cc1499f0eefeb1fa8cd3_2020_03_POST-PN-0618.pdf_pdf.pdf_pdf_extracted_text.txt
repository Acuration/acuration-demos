Bioenergy with Carbon Capture & Storage 
 
 
According to global climate and economic 
models, removing greenhouse gases from the 
atmosphere will be necessary to limit global 
warming to 1.5˚C. Among Greenhouse Gas 
Removal (GGR) techniques, models assume 
that Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and 
Storage (BECCS) could play a prominent role. 
This POSTnote summarises why BECCS has 
been included in the models, outlines the 
challenges and trade-offs of deploying at scale, 
and considers policy options for supporting its 
development. 
 
Overview 
◼ Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage 
(BECCS) is a system of technologies. It 
combines biomass (plant matter or organic 
waste) for energy generation, with the 
capture and permanent storage of the 
resulting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. 
◼ BECCS is one of the ‘negative emissions’ 
technologies projected to play a major role 
in global climate mitigation. It will be 
needed if the Paris Agreement goals are to 
be met. 
◼ The scale of BECCS projected in some 
models has raised concerns around the 
sustainability of bioenergy and overall 
carbon footprint of BECCS required to 
deliver negative emissions. 
◼ Its development requires robust and 
transparent policy and sustainability 
frameworks; with environmental, economic 
and social dimensions; as well as Carbon 
Capture and Storage (CCS) infrastructures 
that do not yet exist. 
 
Background 
The Paris Agreement sets a global target to limit global 
warming to well below 2˚C above pre-industrial temperatures 
and pursue efforts to limit this rise to 1.5˚C (POSTnote 594). 
Doing so will require that ‘net’ human-caused CO2 emissions are 
reduced to zero around 2050 or soon after.1 Net emissions refer 
to total emissions minus Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) 
(sometimes known as Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR). There is 
a large body of evidence suggesting that some level of GGR is 
needed to achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement (POSTnote 
549). 
A BECCS process removes atmospheric CO2 (the GHG that 
contributes most to climate change) using a combination of 
technologies. Broadly, it uses plant growth to absorb CO2, 
generates energy from the biomass (such as through 
combustion) then stores the CO2 emitted so that it cannot 
contribute to climate change. Estimates of the mitigation 
potential of BECCS vary considerably. A 2019 Special Report by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
suggested it could remove 0.4 to 11.3 billion tonnes of CO2 
(GtCO2) per year by 2100, with the higher figure representing 
around a quarter of current global CO2 emissions.2 There are a 
number of potential challenges associated with the widespread 
use of BECCS, primarily around scale and land availability. In 
addition, there are risks relying on the technology when 
significant uncertainties exist around its cost and its potential to 
achieve negative emissions.3 
BECCS within integrated models 
‘Integrated assessment models’ (IAMs, Box 1) are used to 
support policy-makers by assessing how emissions may change 
in the future. The models describe the global economy, energy 
and land use systems to produce ‘pathways’ that illustrate how 
the Paris Agreement aims could be met.4 Most pathways that 
limit global warming to 1.5˚C rely on large-scale deployment of 
BECCS and afforestation (which enhances forest cover from 
planting trees).5,6 
Reducing emissions and using GGR 
Annual CO2 emissions must reach net zero to limit global 
warming. There is a trade-off between how quickly emissions

Box 1: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) 
IAMs are complex models developed by scientists to 
estimate the most cost-effective scenarios to meet global 
temperature targets.10 These models are based on various, 
but complementary, narratives and assumptions, with high 
degrees of uncertainty: 
◼ Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), a set of 
assumptions about future population and economic 
growth, education, urbanisation and technological 
developments. 
◼ Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), 
which describe different levels of future greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions and set mitigation targets for global 
warming.  
By combining these, researchers developed Illustrative Model 
Pathways to help policy makers shape their decisions about 
climate change mitigation policies.24 
 
are reduced and how much GGR will be needed to limit global 
warming to a given temperature.7 The faster emissions are 
reduced from now, the less GGR will be needed.8,9 The 
pathways suggest that GGR will still be required to meet the 
Paris Agreement goals.10 Rapid ambitious mitigation would 
reduce the need for GGR, without fully eliminating it, and allow 
GGR technologies to offset residual emissions.11,12 
Exceeding the 1.5˚C target 
Many pathways in which global warming is limited to 1.5˚C 
feature a situation where this target is initially exceeded, before 
GHG concentrations (and hence the global temperature) are 
brought back down by removing excess CO2 from the 
atmosphere with GGR.13 The extent and duration of such 
scenarios would depend on the rate of emissions reduction and 
deployment of GGR at scale.14 The implications of exceeding 
targets are unknown and have raised scientific and ethical 
concerns.15,16 Environmental responses to such a situation are 
uncertain, as it is not clear if impacts on environmental systems 
from going beyond certain temperatures can be easily 
reversed.17 This puts a burden on future generations to adjust 
to unknown consequences.18,19 
Limitations of models 
Integration of other GGR techniques 
IAMs only feature afforestation and reforestation alongside 
BECCS, rather than a wider portfolio of GGR technologies. This 
is partly because other GGR technologies are further from 
commercialisation than BECCS.9,20 These include ‘Direct Air 
Capture’, enhanced weathering, or restoration of habitats such 
as peatlands and wetlands (POSTnote 549). Multiple GGR 
technologies deployed at modest scale would carry less risk 
than a single technology deployed at much larger scale.21 
Underpinning assumptions 
Many models are optimised for the most cost-effective solutions 
and readiness of technologies. BECCS has the potential to 
generate energy carriers (such as electricity or fuels), making it 
more cost-effective within the models compared to other 
GGR.22,23 
Some of the assumptions in the IPCC pathways that affect 
large-scale deployment of BECCS are uncertain, including: 
◼ The amount of land freed by dietary changes and the use of 
marginal land (such as degraded agricultural land). 
◼ A large increase in biomass yields. 
◼ Any policy frameworks that will be ready to deploy BECCS at 
scale within the next few decades (see Governance).9,25–27 
Component parts of BECCS 
BECCS encompasses several technologies: 
◼ Growing and processing biomass, which absorbs atmospheric 
CO2 over its lifetime. 
◼ Transporting the biomass and converting the energy within it 
into a useable form. 
◼ Capturing the CO2 emissions from this conversion, then 
compressing, transporting and storing the CO2 somewhere so 
that it cannot contribute to climate change. This is known as 
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).  
If the amount of CO2 stored is greater than the CO2 emitted 
during the life cycle of these processes (as assessed with life 
cycle analysis), then CO2 has been removed from the 
atmosphere, resulting in net negative emissions.28–30  
Bioenergy as an energy source 
The uses of biomass for energy generation vary depending on 
the type of raw material and the conversion technology 
(POSTnote 410). The main materials used to produce bioenergy 
(feedstocks) are: 
◼ Energy crops. Edible crops (maize, corn) and dedicated 
herbaceous or woody crops (miscanthus, willow). 
◼ Forestry resources. Residues from the timber industry 
(forest bark, thinnings, branches, sawdust). 
◼ Waste. Agricultural residues (such as straw, rice husk, 
sugarcane bagasse), post-consumer waste wood, food 
waste, sewage sludge, manures.31–35 
These feedstocks can then be used for: 
◼ Power or heat generation by combusting the biomass in a 
power plant to supply the electricity system or using the 
heat, for example in a specific industrial plant. 
◼ Fuel and chemicals production. This includes bioethanol, 
biogas, biodiesel, jet-fuel and hydrogen. 
The amount of carbon stored by BECCS is dependent, not only 
upon the feedstock used to generate the initial bioenergy and 
its supply chain, but also the processes involved, the removal 
system, the purity of CO2 and its end use.36–38 Power generation 
stores more of the carbon fixed in the biomass than biofuels 
because the tailpipe CO2 emissions from vehicles are not 
captured.39,40 However, biofuels can displace emissions from 
fossil fuels, and may be necessary to help decarbonise some 
transport modes such as aviation (POSTnote 616).  
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) 
CCS involves capturing CO2 emissions, compressing the CO2 
then transporting and permanently storing it underground to 
prevent it from entering the atmosphere. Technologies for 
capturing CO2 from industrial processes are established and 
have been applied to coal, oil and natural gas combustion; and 
hydrogen and bioethanol production. Government-assisted 
projects in the USA, Norway, Canada and Australia have been 
successful and reduced the associated costs and risks.41,42 
POSTNOTE Number 618 March 2020 Bioenergy with Carbon Capture & Storage 
Page 3 
 
 
 
Storage sites are geological structures, such as depleted oil and 
gas fields, saline aquifers or un-mineable coal seams (POSTnote 
335). Deep saline formations have the largest global storage 
capacity, estimated to be between 1000 to 10,000 GtCO2.43 
There is some evidence that the CO2 storage capacity of 
depleted North Sea oil and gas fields is larger than any 
potential UK storage need.44–47 
There are some concerns that stored CO2 could leak back into 
the atmosphere over the lifetime of storage sites, raising 
questions around who would be liable for such leaks. However, 
there is evidence that leakage risk is very small and decreases 
over time if the sites are properly selected, characterised and 
managed.43 Many carbon capture projects currently use the CO2 
in economically productive processes such as in enhanced oil 
recovery, horticulture, and building material and synthetic fuel 
production (POSTbrief 30).48 
Combining bioenergy and CCS 
Five bioethanol manufacturing facilities around the world 
currently capture 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) per year.42 
This is less than 1% of the lower range of estimates of BECCS’ 
technical potential. The US Decatur biorefinery is the only large-
scale facility (it stores 1 MtCO2 per year). It has only 
demonstrated the feasibility of the combined technologies for 
bioethanol production using maize. Other potential applications 
for BECCS have yet to be demonstrated at such a scale, 
particularly when using feedstocks that are more complex and 
heterogeneous such as waste. BECCS could also be used in 
different industries and energy-intensive industrial processes 
(such as steel, cement or paper).49,50 
Challenges for developing BECCS 
There are several challenges to overcome if BECCS is to provide 
negative emissions at scale.  
Sustainability of bioenergy 
The implications of increased bioenergy use are the main 
source of uncertainty when modelling the mitigation potential of 
BECCS in IAMs. Estimates of bioenergy by 2050 vary from 100 
to 300 exajoules (EJ) per year (equivalent to 17 and 51% of 
the global primary energy supply in 2017, respectively).51,52 
However, high levels of bioenergy can have side effects with 
significant risks for: 
◼ Food security (growing biomass for bioenergy competes with 
agricultural crops for land), 
◼ Ecosystems and biodiversity (POSTnote 617), 
◼ Water and nutrient scarcity (intensive use of soils and 
fertilisers can lead to land degradation).2,53,54 
The most important factors affecting these risks are land 
availability and productivity.2 The IPCC analysis suggests that 
bioenergy production should be sustainable, without providing a 
clear definition of the term. The definition of sustainability is 
often contested (POSTnote 408), but it is considered to have 
environmental, economic and social dimensions.55 
In practice, the sustainability of bioenergy is often context-
specific, depending on its location, feedstock, production 
method and supply chain. In particular, land-use change 
emissions associated with the expansion of bioenergy 
production will determine whether climate change benefits are 
realised (Box 2). 
Estimates of additional land requirements for BECCS range from 
100 million to 400 million hectares.56 The biomass requirements 
for BECCS arising from most IAMs are much greater than the 
estimated amount of sustainable biomass that could be 
produced (around 100 EJ).57 These models focus upon cost 
optimisation and do not take into account sustainability 
constraints, leading to potential scenarios with unsustainable 
large-scale use of BECCS.58,59 
Sustainability Criteria for Bioenergy 
The Global Bioenergy Partnership, an intergovernmental 
initiative, defines 24 indicators for sustainable bioenergy around 
three dimensions (environmental, social and economic). These 
include life cycle GHG emissions, jobs in the energy sector, the 
price of a national food basket and infrastructures for bioenergy 
distribution.60 The International Organization for 
Standardization has developed bioenergy sustainability criteria 
(ISO 13065). These are used to compare bioenergy processes 
or products, but do not set any thresholds or limits.61  
The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires that large scale 
heat and power bioenergy systems deliver an 80% emissions 
reduction compared to existing fossil fuel systems by 2026. This 
is based on life cycle analysis, which includes direct and indirect 
land use change emissions.62 In the UK, the Renewable 
Obligation and Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation look at 
sustainability beyond carbon accounting.63–65 Similarly, in 
California, the Renewable Fuel and Low Carbon Fuel Standards 
were created to decarbonise road transportation fuels and 
include CCS aspects to incentivise negative emissions.70 
However, these policies provide a flat incentive for saving 
Box 2: Carbon cycle and payback time of bioenergy 
Biomass at maturity, on a given area of land, is known as a 
carbon stock. Plants still actively storing CO2 (including even 
mature forests) are referred to as carbon sinks.66,67 
CO2 emissions from burning biomass are counted as ‘zero’ in 
the energy sector to avoid double-counting, because carbon 
loss from harvesting plants is counted in the land sector. The 
carbon accounting in the two sectors are not linked and has 
led to the widespread perception that bioenergy is always 
‘carbon neutral’. In reality, net emissions from bioenergy can 
be substantial depending on their carbon cycle.68 Dedicated 
energy crops have short carbon cycles (<2 years) so the CO2 
emitted upon combustion can be re-sequestered by crop 
regrowth. For forests, however, regrowth is much slower. 
The time needed to offset the carbon emitted from 
bioenergy combustion depends on several factors:  
◼ The nature of the feedstock (and if it is regrown)  
◼ The carbon stock of the land before harvesting (initial 
carbon debt) 
◼ Indirect land use change emissions 
◼ Bioenergy supply chain emissions (such as 
transportation).69  
The point at which this carbon debt will be paid back is 
called the carbon payback period (or carbon break even 
time). This amount of time can vary from one or two years 
(marginal land, dedicated woody crops) to more than 
hundreds of years (wood from mature natural forests).

carbon relative to fossil fuels, and do not incentivise any further 
savings.71 Moreover, current sustainability schemes do not 
include emissions from the conversion of biomass itself to 
energy (Box 2).  
Trade-offs in biomass uses for BECCS 
There is debate about which biomass resources could be used 
for BECCS to deliver negative emissions.72–76 This is in part 
because of the carbon accounting frameworks as well as 
differences in payback time of different feedstocks (Box 2).77 
Forests provide services such as amenity values, biodiversity 
and soil stabilisation, as well as construction products and 
bioenergy.16,69 Residues from the timber, board or paper 
industries are used for bioenergy because they have short 
carbon payback periods.78 However, The European Academies’ 
Science Advisory Council (EASAC) advised that whole trees 
should only be used for materials and construction, as 
atmospheric levels of CO2 released from the combustion of 
stem wood can have negative impacts on the climate 
(increased GHG emissions) for decades to centuries.79,80 EASAC 
concluded in 2019 that relying on forest biomass for renewable 
energy increases the risks of exceeding the Paris targets.72,81,82 
The International Energy Agency stresses that current 
sustainability frameworks need to be reinforced to:  
◼ Fully integrate the carbon impact of supply chains, especially 
with forestry management schemes. The carbon removed 
using BECCS may be negated if emissions rise from long 
payback times (Box 2) and supply chain emissions.83 
◼ Understand the interconnections between bioenergy and 
food security. 
◼ Promote transparency in land use change and forestry 
resources management.31 
Technical and economic challenges  
Technological and economic challenges for BECCS include: 
◼ Engineering challenges from using biomass instead of fossil 
fuels in power and industrial plants (such as lower energy 
density, higher ash content, and the presence of corrosive 
elements and alkali deposits).84,85 
◼ The scale of capital and operational costs, as well as the 
energy penalty from CO2 capture.26,86 In some cases, CO2 
capture units can be retrofitted to existing power and 
industrial plants. However, some argue that new alternative 
low carbon facilities would have higher energy efficiency and 
capture more of the CO2.43 
◼ Vicinity to existing CCS clusters. In addition to a sustainable 
biomass supply chain, BECCS facilities would need access to 
CO2 transport and storage infrastructures, which are yet to 
be built.45 The UK Government has identified five potential 
CCS clusters across the UK. However, the longer it takes to 
implement CCS, the more likely it is that BECCS would be a 
dominant use around which facilities should be clustered.87,88 
Governance of BECCS 
The rate of deployment of BECCS will depend on both CCS and 
GGR future policy frameworks.89 There is currently no 
international policy mechanism in place to support the 
implementation of BECCS. This is particularly an issue when the 
supply chain is geographically dispersed or has yet to be put in 
place (with implications for biomass import, CCS infrastructure 
and offshore CO2 storage). 
Incorporating BECCS into carbon markets 
‘Carbon markets’ are mechanisms that put a price on CO2 
emissions to incentivise firms to install CO2 reduction measures, 
such as energy efficiency or CCS. Including BECCS within 
carbon markets, so that operators earn revenue for 
permanently storing CO2, is often considered to be an 
economically efficient way of supporting it.90,91 However, no 
existing carbon market currently includes negative emissions. 
The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the largest carbon 
market globally, does not currently differentiate between 
reducing industrial emissions and actively storing them.92 The 
‘45Q’ carbon tax credit in the US has supported CCS, but mainly 
for enhanced oil recovery projects. It has no mechanism to 
consider the negative emissions potential of projects.93 New 
policy measures to incentivise a positive impact on the climate 
through permanent CO2 removal would be needed for BECCS 
and other GGR. 
Public acceptability 
An assumption implicitly used in IAMs is that the social 
acceptability of GGR technologies will be a barrier to their 
development.94 There have been a number studies on the 
public acceptance of CCS alone, some of whose findings could 
be applicable to BECCS.95 Biomass for bioenergy on its own has 
a relatively high acceptability of 70% in the UK.96 However, 
some researchers argue a whole systems approach is needed to 
consider the bioenergy, CCS and negative emissions aspects at 
a social level, together with carbon accounting and 
technological considerations.97 This would involve engaging 
affected communities and other stakeholders.18,98 
UK approaches 
The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) suggested in 2019 
that GGR will be needed to achieve the statutory UK target of 
net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and that UK afforestation will 
provide only part of this. According to CCC modelling, the UK 
mitigation potential of BECCS ranges from 20 to 51 MtCO2 
(equivalent to 5-14% of UK CO2 emissions at 2018 levels).88,104 
A 2019 report on GGR, commissioned by BEIS, suggested that 
BECCS will be one of the largest GGR options in the UK.100 The 
UK Government will set out preferred options for CCS business 
models in early 2020 (GGR technologies will not be included).101 
A UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund of £32 million was created in 
2019 to demonstrate GGR technologies, including BECCS, and 
address their challenges.102 Achievement of negative emissions 
at scale remains uncertain and will require transparent and 
flexible policy mechanisms.103 The report suggested several 
policy pathways and short-term measures to develop a market 
for GGR before 2050. These include integrating BECCS in the 
EU ETS, supporting pilot and demonstration schemes, and 
investing in CCS infrastructures.100 
The Drax power plant in North Yorkshire is the first trial BECCS 
project in the UK. Two-thirds of its generators use wood pellets 
to produce power, and the site has a demonstrator carbon 
capture unit to capture around one tonne of CO2 per day. Drax 
plans to scale up this technology by 2027 and investigate CCS 
transport and storage in the North Sea.99
