Delivering dispatchable, 
renewable power 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022
(1) We calculate Adjusted financial performance 
measures, which are Drax specific and exclude 
income statement volatility from derivative 
financial instruments and the impact of 
exceptional items, to provide additional 
information about the Group’s performance. 
Adjusted financial performance measures are 
described more fully on page 179, with a 
reconciliation to their statutory equivalents in note 
2.7 to the Consolidated financial statements on 
page 205. Throughout this document we 
distinguish between Adjusted measures and Total 
measures, which are calculated in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
Delivering dispatchable, renewable power
An electricity generator produces Dispatchable Power when the power can be ramped up and down, 
or switched on or off, at short notice to provide a flexible response to changes in electricity demand. 
Biomass, pumped storage, coal, oil, and gas electricity generation can meet these criteria and hence can be 
Dispatchable Power sources. Nuclear can be dispatched against an agreed schedule but is not flexible. 
Wind and solar electricity cannot be scheduled and hence are not Dispatchable. An electricity system requires 
sufficient Dispatchable Power to operate and remain safe. Renewable power is derived from natural sources 
that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed.
References to financial performance measures 
throughout this Annual Report and Accounts refer 
to continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. 
Further details of discontinued financial 
performance is included in note 5.4 to the 
Consolidated financial statements on page 240.
(2) We define Net debt as borrowings, including the 
impact of hedging instruments, less cash and cash 
equivalents. Net debt is more fully described on 
page 180. A reconciliation of Net debt is provided 
on page 207. Borrowings is defined as per the 
Group’s Consolidated balance sheet on page 183 
and does not include lease liabilities, pension 
obligations or other financial liabilities.

If we are to avert a climate catastrophe, more urgent action must be 
taken to get to net zero. As an integral part of the energy sector, I believe 
Drax has a pivotal role to play in driving the transition to renewable 
electricity by enabling a more flexible energy system which can deliver 
secure, renewable power when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind 
doesn’t blow and, in 2022, Drax continued to play an important role 
in supporting the security of energy supply in the UK.
Carbon dioxide removal technology is widely regarded as being essential 
to global efforts to reach net zero. We have ambitions to lead the world 
with our bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology, 
which can generate secure, renewable electricity and permanently 
remove CO2 from the atmosphere. 
Sustainable biomass is recognised as having the potential to play an 
important role in tackling the climate crisis and displacing fossil fuels. 
As the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation, production, 
and supply business, Drax is committed to ensuring the biomass 
we use delivers positive outcomes for the forests we source from and 
the people living in and around them. 
I passionately believe that a thriving biomass industry, which sources 
the right biomass in a sustainable way, contributes to healthy forests: 
whether by providing an outlet for sawmill residuals or by using low 
quality wood that is unsuitable for use in a sawmill. We work closely 
with rural communities, providing and supporting jobs for people from 
different backgrounds in Canada and the southeast of the US.
Our commitment to sustainability sits at the heart of everything we do, 
helping to ensure we have a positive impact on the climate, nature, 
and people. In this report we’ll explain how we are delivering our purpose 
to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
Our strategic objectives are aligned 
to net zero targets:
To be a global leader in 
sustainable biomass pellets
To be a global leader 
in carbon removals
To be a UK leader in 
dispatchable, renewable 
generation

Strategic report
To address the climate crisis and limit global warming to 
1.5oC, we need more renewable energy, and more flexible 
energy systems to make the best use of wind and solar.
How Drax is enabling the transition to net zero:
How do we reduce carbon 
in a sustainable way?
By being a global leader in 
sustainable biomass pellets
Sustainably sourced biomass is a renewable, 
low carbon source of energy and a key 
element in the road to net zero. This is at the 
heart of our purpose. Sustainable biomass can 
play an important role in supporting forest 
health. Well-managed forests are effective at 
absorbing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) 
from the atmosphere. 
We are committed to sourcing sustainable 
biomass that achieves both decarbonisation 
and positive forest outcomes. Drax forms 
part of a wider forest industry where forest 
management and felling is used primarily 
for producing material for construction and 
manufacturing. The material we use to make 
pellets includes sawmill and forest residuals, 
and low-grade roundwood – material of a 
lower grade which is unsuitable for use in a 
sawmill. Using these materials can also help 
prevent the spread of fire, pests, and disease 
by reducing stand density to healthier levels 
and removing deadwood which can attract 
insects and pathogens.
By diligent sourcing of these materials to 
make pellets, our activity can help forest 
owners, and the larger forest industry, 
make the best use of forests, achieving both 
decarbonisation and positive forest outcomes.

However, wind and solar are 
intermittent and when the wind 
isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t 
shining, we need to look to other 
sources of power.
How can we permanently remove 
carbon from the atmosphere?
How do we keep the lights on 
during the transition to more 
intermittent renewable energy?
By being a UK leader in dispatchable, 
renewable power
Moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity 
system that is primarily based on renewables. Supporting 
wind and solar, by providing electricity at times of low 
sunlight or wind levels, will require flexible sources of 
generation, such as biomass. Our pumped storage and 
run-of-river hydro stations also help to reinforce the UK’s 
renewable energy mix.
The dispatchable generating assets at Drax remain critical 
to providing UK power system stability and security as the 
war in Ukraine continues to put global energy markets 
under considerable pressure. Over the 2022-23 winter, 
our assets generated renewable power when the country 
needed it most. This has helped the UK to provide energy 
to consumers and businesses while maintaining its target 
of net zero by 2050. 
Up to 9.5bn tonnes of carbon removals, 
via BECCS, could be required annually  
by 2050 to reach global net zero targets.
Ensuring the electricity system is reliable 
means intermittent renewables need  
to be complemented by technologies 
which can provide dispatchable power, 
such as bioenergy.

By being a global leader in carbon 
removals
Alongside carbon emission reductions, carbon removal 
technologies are needed to remove carbon from the 
atmosphere. With an effective carbon removals policy and 
the right investment framework from the UK Government, 
we could deploy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS) on two of our existing biomass generating units in 
the UK to remove 8Mt of CO2 each year by 2030. And we are 
targeting 12Mt of carbon removals globally by 2030.

Our ambition is to become 
carbon negative by 2030. This 
means that we will be removing 
more carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere than we produce 
throughout our direct business 
operations globally – creating a 
carbon negative company.

Market context
Our role in delivering a secure and renewable 
energy system, tackling climate change, sustaining 
healthy forests and habitats, and promoting 
socio‑economic growth
Bolstering energy security
In 2022, Drax generated 11% of the UK’s 
renewable electricity – more than any 
other generator. This electricity comes 
from Drax Power Station – fuelled by 
sustainable biomass – in North Yorkshire 
and our pumped storage and hydro sites 
in Scotland. 
We continue to play a critical role in 
ensuring the UK’s security of energy 
supply, whilst also supporting thousands 
of jobs across the UK, both directly and 
through our supply chain. Drax helps to 
keep the lights on when the wind doesn’t 
blow and the sun doesn’t shine. Unlike 
wind or solar, our sites provide secure, 
dispatchable, renewable power whatever 
the weather – supporting grid stability.
Now more than ever, the UK needs to 
invest in domestic security of supply while 
also decarbonising the grid and meeting 
2022 was a challenging year for the global 
community. The after-effects of Covid-19 
and the continuing effect of Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine combined to have an 
impact on the social, economic, and 
political fabric of most countries around 
the world. Developed economies 
experienced rising demand, high energy 
costs, and supply chain issues, driving 
inflation and resulting in a cost of living 
crisis for many people.
Rising global acceptance 
of BECCS
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) is the world’s leading 
authority on climate science. It states 
that carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
methods, including BECCS, are needed 
to mitigate residual emissions and keep 
the world on a pathway to limit warming 
to 1.5ºC. 
The illustrative mitigation pathways 
assessed in the IPCC’s latest report use 
significant volumes of CDRs, including 
BECCS, as a tool for mitigating climate 
change. IPCC modelling shows that 
between 0.5 and 9.5 billion tonnes of 
CDRs, via BECCS, could be required 
annually by 2050 to reach global net zero 
targets. The UN-backed Principles for 
Responsible Investment estimate that 
the CDR market could be worth over 
a trillion dollars by 2050.
In 2022, progress was made in global 
policies relating to carbon removal 
technologies. Despite the significant 
political uncertainty in the UK, 
the Government published several 
consultations and bills that demonstrated 
support for BECCS. These included 
publishing the Power BECCS Business 
Model Consultation, the GGR Business 
Model Consultation and the Energy Bill. 
Zero Carbon Humber, of which Drax 
is a member, supports the ambitions 
of the East Coast Cluster consortium 
which was chosen as a priority cluster. 
In addition, Drax awaits the outcome 
of its bid into the "Track 1" Power BECCS 
submission process and publication 
of the Government’s Biomass Strategy.
11%
In 2022 Drax generated 11%  
of the UK’s renewable electricity
In the UK, sterling’s weakness and 
12 months of unprecedented political and 
economic challenge compounded these 
issues. Despite this, governments in the 
UK, North America, mainland Europe and 
Asia continue to remain focused on 
delivering a decarbonisation agenda, 
both domestically and globally. Together, 
they aim to reduce the energy system’s 
reliance on fossil fuels and help tackle 
climate change. 
climate targets. There is only one 
technology that can generate reliable 
and renewable electricity while removing 
carbon dioxide from the earth’s 
atmosphere: bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS).
The project is well-developed, the 
technology is proven within the industry, 
and an investment decision could be taken 
in 2024, subject to the right investment 
framework, with a first BECCS unit 
operational in 2027 and a second in 2030. 
BECCS could remove millions of tonnes 
of carbon from the atmosphere and create 
local, national, and global opportunities.
Scaling up BECCS could help get the 
UK to net zero faster and kickstart 
a new green economy in the Humber, 
supporting thousands of jobs and creating 
opportunities across the North of England. 
And it could allow the UK to lead the world 
in carbon removals.

Strategic report
Delivering a future 
positive outcome
To tackle the climate crisis, the world 
needs secure, renewable energy – and 
to remove carbon from the atmosphere. 
The IPCC and a number of governments 
agree that CDR methods, including 
BECCS, are necessary elements in 
achieving this goal. Drax is the world’s 
leading sustainable biomass generation, 
production, and supply business, and is 
now developing options for BECCS in the 
UK and North America. Our Responsible 
Sourcing Policy is informed by science, 
and the biomass we use to generate 
electricity is assessed against sustainable 
forest management principles. 
The material we use to make pellets 
includes sawmill and forest residuals, 
and low-grade roundwood, material 
of a lower grade which is unsuitable for 
use in a sawmill. Strong markets for lower 
quality material can help support good 
forest management in the US and Canada, 
and we take our wood from responsibly 
managed working forests. As the demand 
for bioenergy and BECCS increases, we 
are exploring opportunities to generate 
bioenergy from other sustainable 
fibre sources.
Bioenergy and BECCS can remove carbon 
from the atmosphere while sustaining 
healthy forests and habitats. In turn, this 
can protect and create jobs – particularly 
in some of those communities most at risk 
of decline in the transition to net zero.
“Our commitment to 
sustainability sits at the 
heart of everything we 
do, helping to ensure 
we have a positive 
impact on the climate, 
nature, and people."
BECCS
Over a quarter of IPCC strategies  
mention BECCS as part of their plans  
to limit global temperatures.
The international environment for BECCS 
continued to develop favourably in 2022. 
A growing number of governments and 
key stakeholders around the world 
recognise that deploying BECCS at scale 
will be critical to delivering on climate 
targets. At COP27, the IPCC released 
a synthesis of long-term low emission 
development strategies of 53 countries. 
Over a quarter of these strategies mention 
BECCS as part of their plans to limit global 
temperatures. As a result, we have seen 
significant developments to support 
BECCS deployment. In the US, the 
landmark climate bill – known as the 
Inflation Reduction Act – includes an 
uplift in funding and tax credits for 
carbon removal technologies. 
The US Department of Energy included 
BECCS as an eligible technology in various 
funding schemes. Likewise, a National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory report 
states, by 2035, the US could need around 
100Mt of carbon removals from BECCS to 
offset remaining carbon emissions in the 
power sector. State-level developments 
also support the deployment of BECCS. 
California’s net zero strategy, for example, 
identifies carbon removal technologies 
as an important tool to deliver its 
climate targets. 
The California Air Resources Board 
(CARB), which is responsible for climate 
policy, has stated its intention to deploy 
75Mt of carbon removals, including 
BECCS, by 2045.
Canada launched an investment tax credit 
for carbon capture technologies to 
support carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
development. The country has set a target 
to capture 15Mt of carbon removals a year 
by 2030 and the government is working 
on a clean energy standard. This cites 
carbon capture and storage as being 
central to achieving net zero due to its 
potential to deliver carbon removals and 
to enable further reductions attributable 
to the electricity sector.
Meanwhile, the European Commission 
adopted a proposal for an EU-wide 
framework to reliably certify high-quality 
carbon removals. The proposal includes 
BECCS and classifies it as a permanent 
storage solution. The EU Energy 
Commissioner will also be working on 
a strategic vision for CCS in 2023, and 
EU Member States continue developing 
programmes to enable BECCS 
deployment. Several governments have 
announced research and development 
funding schemes and grants to support 
Front-End Engineering Design.
We expect the growing momentum for 
BECCS to continue in 2023. This is likely 
to include the development of detailed 
roadmaps to deliver net zero targets, 
and international negotiations on 
carbon markets will progress in the 
run up to COP28.

At a glance
Drax is the second largest producer of sustainable biomass 
globally, and the UK’s largest source of renewable power 
by output. We are progressing options for bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Pellet Production 
The material we use to make pellets includes 
sawmill and forest residuals, and low-grade 
roundwood, material of a lower grade which 
is unsuitable for use in a sawmill. They provide 
a sustainable, low carbon fuel source that can 
be safely and efficiently delivered through 
our global supply chain. 
The forests we source our biomass from 
are managed in accordance with standards 
designed to support the health and growth 
of these forests over the long term. Based in 
the US south and in Western Canada, we have 
18 operational and development sites with 
nameplate capacity of around 5Mt once 
expansions are complete. 
We have US$4.1 billion of long-term contracted 
sales to third parties across Asia and Europe. 
Our Generation business also uses pellets 
sourced from our Pellet Production sites 
to make flexible, renewable electricity 
for the UK.
Generation
Our portfolio of flexible, low-carbon and 
renewable UK power assets – biomass, 
hydro, and pumped storage generation – 
provides dispatchable, renewable power 
and system support services to the 
electricity grid. 
Our dispatchable power – which can be 
ramped up and down, or switched on or off, 
at short notice to provide a flexible 
response to changes in electricity demand 
– has a vital role to play in enabling the 
transition to more renewable energy and 
a more flexible energy system: generating 
renewable electricity when the sun doesn’t 
shine and the wind doesn’t blow.
We are the UK’s largest source of renewable 
power by output, and Drax Power Station is 
the UK’s largest single source of renewable 
electricity by output. Our portfolio provides 
long-term earnings stability and 
opportunities to optimise returns from the 
transition to a low-carbon economy.
We are developing options for BECCS at 
Drax Power Station in the UK and exploring 
options for global BECCS.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022
Business model
Our business model and 
strategy address key 
trends in global energy:
• The increasing demand for electricity 
and the need for renewable energy
• The need to decarbonise and the 
importance of carbon removals 
• The need for dispatchable generation 
to enable increased reliance on 
intermittent renewables
Our strategic pillars:
To be a global leader  
in sustainable biomass 
pellets
To be a global leader  
in carbon removals
To be a UK leader  
in dispatchable, 
renewable generation
Sustainable biomass pellets
Drax believes that the global market for 
sustainable biomass will grow significantly, 
creating opportunities for sales to third 
parties, BECCS, generation, and other 
long-term uses of biomass. Delivery of 
these opportunities will be supported 
by the expansion of the Group’s biomass 
pellet production capacity. 
The Group has 18 operational and 
development sites with nameplate 
capacity of around 4.8Mt p.a. which will 
increase once expansions are complete. 
Drax is targeting 8Mt p.a. of production 
capacity by 2030, which will require the 
addition of around 3Mt p.a. of new 
biomass pellet production capacity.
Underpinned by this expanded 
production capacity, Drax aims to double 
sales of biomass to third parties to 
4Mt p.a. by 2030, developing its market 
presence in Asia and Europe.

Carbon removals
Post-combustion removal of carbon 
from the atmosphere (such as BECCS) 
and afforestation (planting trees in 
new areas) are recognised as important 
sources of carbon removals – removing 
CO2 from the atmosphere(1). 
Building on its biomass expertise, 
Drax is developing options for BECCS.
Subject to the right regulatory 
environment, and support from the UK 
Government, Drax has plans to transform 
Drax Power Station into one of the 
world’s leading carbon capture projects 
using BECCS to permanently remove 
8Mt of CO2 emissions from the 
atmosphere each year by 2030. 
The project is well developed, and 
an investment decision could be taken 
by Drax in 2024, with the first BECCS 
unit operational in 2027 and a second 
in 2030, subject to the right 
investment framework. 
The Group is also developing options to 
complement this innovation with a target 
to deliver 4Mt of negative CO2 emissions 
p.a. from new-build BECCS outside of the 
UK by 2030.

(1) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change and the Coalition for Negative 
Emissions have both outlined a clear role for 
BECCS in delivering the carbon removals 
required to limit global warming to 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels and to achieve net zero by 
2050, identifying a requirement of between 
0.5 and 9.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide

Strategic report
Chair’s statement
An important  
role to play
Through 2022, Drax continued to make 
progress towards our purpose – to enable 
a zero carbon lower cost energy future – 
and our aim: to be a carbon negative 
company by 2030. At the same time, we 
have supported energy security in the UK.
The Group’s three strategic objectives – 
to be a global leader in sustainable biomass 
pellets; to be a global leader in carbon 
removals; and to be a UK leader in 
dispatchable, renewable power – are 
aligned with a number of global energy 
policies. Such policies increasingly 
recognise the important role that 
sustainable biomass and carbon removals 
can play in the fight against climate change.
Since 2012, we have reduced our 
generation Scope 1 and 2 carbon 
emissions by approximately 99%, 
principally reflecting our long-term 
investment in sustainable biomass. And we 
have continued to progress our ambition 
to become a carbon negative company by 
developing opportunities for bioenergy 
with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
in the UK and North America. 
While progressing our strategy, we also 
play an important role in supporting UK 
energy security. Using our biomass, 
pumped storage, and hydro assets, 
we generate large amounts of reliable, 
renewable electricity and provide 
important system support services to the 
UK power system. This reduces the UK’s 
reliance on expensive fossil fuels like gas 
and complements the greater use of 
intermittent renewables such as wind.
In the future, biomass could offer a route 
to carbon removal using BECCS. But, 
it must be the right biomass. The Group 
is committed to this principle, in order to 
deliver positive outcomes for the climate, 
nature, and people.
On a personal note, this will be my final 
year as Chair since I plan to step down 
by 31 December 2023. By then, I will 
have served as a director for nine years, 
having joined the Board in January 2015. 
In that time, I have seen the continued 
transition of Drax from coal to biomass 
generation, the growth of our Pellet 
Production business and supply chain, 
the development of opportunities for 
BECCS, and the growth of the Group 
internationally. These actions have all 
been undertaken alongside our continuing 
commitment to deliver our purpose 
and contribute to the fight against 
climate change.
Operations 
In North America, our Pellet Production 
business has continued to support efforts 
to optimise biomass power generation and 
safeguard security of supply in the UK. 
At the same time, the Pellet Production 
business has added over 500kt of extra 
production capacity.
In the UK, our generation portfolio has 
continued to support the UK power system 
and deliver high levels of flexible, 
dispatchable, renewable electricity. 
In 2022, the Group was once again the 
UK’s largest source of renewable electricity 
by output, providing 11% of the total from 
its biomass, pumped storage, and hydro 
generation assets. At the UK Government’s 
request, we agreed to make available our 
two coal-fired units for the winter of 
2022-2023, if required, as a response to 
the European energy crisis following 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Our Customers business, which supplies 
electricity to businesses and other 
organisations in the UK, has continued its 
recovery from the impact of Covid-19. 
Results and dividend 
Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 was £731 million. 
This was significantly higher than 2021 
(£398 million), reflecting a strong 
performance across the Group. 
Through 2022, Drax 
continued to make 
progress towards our 
purpose (to enable a zero 
carbon, lower cost energy 
future) and our aim (to be a 
carbon negative company 
by 2030). At the same 
time, we have supported 
energy security in the UK.
Philip Cox CBE, Chair
Our values:
We care about what matters
We’re a can-do kind of place
We see things differently
We listen carefully
We do what we say we’ll do
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022

Strategic report
The balance sheet also remains strong, 
with Net debt at £1,206 million significantly 
below our target ratio of 2.0 times Net 
debt to Adjusted EBITDA. 
At the 2022 Half Year Results, we confirmed 
an interim dividend of £34 million 
(8.4 pence per share). The Board proposes 
to pay a final dividend in respect of 2022 
of £50 million, equivalent to 12.6 pence 
per share. This will make the full year 2022 
dividend £84 million (21.0 pence per share) 
(2021: £75 million, 18.8 pence per share). 
This represents an 11.7% increase on 
2021. It is also consistent with our policy 
to pay a dividend that is sustainable and 
expected to rise as the strategy delivers 
stable earnings, and cash flows and 
opportunities for growth. 
The Group has a clear capital allocation 
policy. In determining the rate of growth 
in dividends from one year to the next, the 
Board will take account of cash flows from 
contracted income, the less predictable 
cash flows from the Group’s commodity-
linked revenue streams, and future 
investment opportunities. This includes new 
biomass pellet plants, the development of 
options for BECCS in the UK and North 
America, and the expansion of our pumped 
storage power station at Cruachan. If there 
is a build-up of capital, the Board will 
consider the most appropriate mechanism 
to return this to shareholders. 
Safety and sustainability 
The safety, health and wellbeing of our 
colleagues and contractors, together with 
our environmental impact, remain priorities 
for the Group and the Board. We believe 
that safe, compliant, and sustainable 
operations are integral to the delivery of our 
strategy and crucial for sustained long-
term performance. These fundamentally 
underpin the continued success of the 
Group. Safety and sustainability underpin 
our operational philosophy. We continue 
to work across the Group to identify, 
implement, and maintain high standards 
supported by a positive safety culture. 
Sustainability is at the heart of the Group, 
and we believe that achieving a positive 
economic, social, and environmental impact 
helps us create sustainable long-term value. 
Throughout 2022, we have continued our 
work as a Taskforce on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) supporter. 
For example, we have submitted science-
based targets and identified opportunities 
for further reductions of carbon emissions 
in our supply chain. 
Delivering positive outcomes for climate, 
nature, and people are at the core of the 
Group’s business model, and ensuring that 
Drax only uses biomass which is sourced 
sustainably in the generation of electricity 
is central to this ambition. 
Biomass, when sustainably sourced, 
supports good forestry, is a renewable 
source of energy, and we believe, 
is an important part of both UK and 
international renewable energy policies. 
The Group sources its biomass from 
well-established forestry markets, 
primarily in the US and Canada. 
We support responsible forestry practices 
by providing incremental, secondary 
revenues to forest landowners through 
the purchase of material which is not 
otherwise merchantable to a sawmill. 
These materials are principally sawdust 
and sawmill residues, bark, branches, 
low-grade roundwood, and woody 
material from forest management 
activities. In addition, the markets we 
source from are subject to national and 
regional regulation. We supplement this 
regulation through our own biomass 
Responsible Sourcing Policy and supply 
chain checks, with third-party verification 
under the Sustainable Biomass Program 
in respect of woody biomass used at 
Drax Power Station.
People and values 
The Board remains committed to building 
a supportive, diverse, and inclusive working 
environment where all colleagues feel they 
belong. We continue to engage with, and 
listen to, our colleagues. Will Gardiner, our 
CEO, and I met regularly with the chairs of 
our workforce engagement forums during 
2022, and we will continue to do so in 2023. 
These meetings provide valuable ongoing 
insights and feedback for the Board.
We monitor and challenge management 
on the steps being taken to address 
diversity, and the Board receives regular 
updates at Board meetings on the work 
being done. In recent years, we have made 
progress on diversity, particularly in senior 
roles. By the end of 2022, our female 
representation at Board level was 44% 
and 40% for the Executive Committee. 
Summary 
In 2022, we used our generation assets 
and our supply chain to provide large 
volume, reliable and flexible power; we 
enhanced security of supply in the UK; 
and we continued to deliver strong 
financial performance with a sustainable 
and growing dividend. 
At the same time, we have made good 
progress with our strategic objectives. 
Our biomass growth strategy is clear 
and underpins our plans for biomass sales, 
opportunities for BECCS, and renewable 
power generation. Through these 
complementary opportunities, we believe 
we can deliver sustainable long-term 
value to our stakeholders as we realise 
our purpose of enabling a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future and become 
a carbon negative company.

Our purpose and  
ambition drive our 
commitment to  
address climate  
change
2022 saw a significant increase in gas 
prices, leading to concerns about energy 
costs and security in the UK and beyond. 
At Drax we have continued to play our 
part. We are the UK’s largest source of 
renewable power by output, a leading 
source of reliable and flexible generation, 
and our ambition is to become a carbon 
negative company by 2030.
Our portfolio generated over 4% of the 
UK’s electricity between October 2021 
and October 2022 (the most recent period 
for which data is available). We also 
generated 11% of the UK’s renewable 
electricity over the same period, making 
Drax the largest renewable generator by 
output. In addition, our assets produced 
on average 19% of the UK’s renewables at 
times of peak demand across the year and 
up to 70% on certain days. This underlines 
the important role that Drax plays in 
security of supply in the UK.
At the same time, we remain focused 
on our purpose – to enable a zero  
carbon, lower cost energy future –  
and our ambition to become a carbon 
negative company by 2030. 
This purpose and ambition drive our 
commitment to address climate change. 
Since 2012, the Group’s actions have 
reduced our generation Scope 1 and 2 
carbon emissions by approximately 99%. 
The world must act now to address the 
climate crisis and limit global warming to 
1.5oC above pre-industrial levels. We need 
more renewable energy, more flexible 
energy systems to make the best use of 
intermittent wind and solar energy, and 
crucially, carbon removal technologies, 
like BECCS, to remove carbon from 
the atmosphere. 
We believe that Drax is a world leader 
in sustainable biomass and that BECCS 
can become a world leading, UK-led, 
exportable solution for large-scale carbon 
removals, subject to the right regulatory 
and investment framework. Reflecting this 
belief, we are continuing to develop an 
option for our UK BECCS project and 
opportunities to invest in BECCS in 
North America. We believe this could be 
the world’s leading market for these types 
of technologies.
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer

CEO Review
Strategic report
These benefits will only be possible 
with the right biomass – biomass that 
is sourced sustainably. At Drax we are 
committed to using the right biomass, 
that can deliver positive outcomes for the 
climate, nature, and people, and we have 
put in place policies, controls, and reviews 
to support this. 
Through our strategy we are creating 
exciting opportunities for growth 
aligned to global decarbonisation efforts. 
Our investments in these areas are 
underpinned by high quality earnings and 
cash flows, which continue to support 
our commitment to a sustainable and 
growing dividend. 
Summary of 2022 
Safety remains a primary focus and, 
in 2022, the Total Recordable Incident 
Rate was 0.44 (2021: 0.22). This is not 
where we want our safety performance 
to be. However, as reported at the half 
year, the increase is explained in part by 
two developments. Firstly, a widening of 
the scope to include contractor incidents. 
Secondly, improvements in the recording 
of incidents in our Pellet Production 
business, including the Pinnacle sites 
we acquired in 2021. 
Since the acquisition we have 
implemented a health, safety and 
environmental (HSE) improvement plan 
across our North American operations 
and invested in training, human resource, 
and capital projects to deliver improved 
performance. We are committed 
to a strong safety culture across the 
Group and remain focused on embedding 
these improvements to uplift 
performance accordingly. 
Adjusted EBITDA of £731 million 
represents an 84% increase compared to 
2021 (£398 million). This reflects increased 
pellet sales, a strong system support and 
renewable power generation performance 
across the portfolio, and improved 
profitability in our Customers business. 
Our balance sheet is strong, with total cash 
and committed facilities of £698 million 
and Net debt of £1,206 million. 
Operationally, the Group’s biomass, 
pumped storage, and hydro assets have 
continued to support UK security of 
supply, providing power system stability 
at a time of higher gas prices and volatility 
on the power system.
We have used our pellet production and 
international supply chain to reprofile 
biomass from the summer to winter, 
maximising generation when it is most 
needed, based on system need and 
sustainable biomass supply.
While supporting UK security of supply, 
we have also progressed our options 
for BECCS in the UK and continued 
developing new opportunities for the 
technology in North America. 
Drax is a signatory to the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC) and we are committed 
to promoting the UNGC principles 
concerning respect for human rights, 
labour rights, the environment, and 
anti-corruption. 
Electricity Generator Levy
In December 2022, the UK Government 
confirmed the details of a windfall 
tax – the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) 
– on renewable and low-carbon generators, 
due for implementation in 2023. The levy 
will apply to the three biomass units 
operating under the Renewables 
Obligation (RO) scheme and our run-of-
river hydro operations. However, it does 
not apply to the Contract for Difference 
(CfD) biomass unit, pumped storage hydro, 
or coal generation.
Through the second half of 2022, 
we engaged with the UK Government 
on the issue of windfall taxes, and their 
impact on the industry, to ensure a 
balanced approach. While we do not 
believe a levy on renewables is 
appropriate, we welcome clarity and 
the recognition that the cost base for 
biomass is different to intermittent 
renewables such as wind. This is an 
important distinction, as it means the 
EGL should not have an adverse impact 
on biomass generation.
Operational performance 
Pellet Production 
In North America, our Pellet Production 
business reported Adjusted EBITDA of 
£134 million, up 56% (2021: £86 million). 
This primarily reflects higher levels of 
production and sales, as well as revised 
transfer pricing in the second half of 2022.
Pellet production was 3.9 million tonnes 
(Mt), an increase of 27% (2021: 3.1Mt). 
This reflects a full 12 months’ worth of 
production from Pinnacle’s plants 
following the acquisition in April 2021. 
It also reflects increased capacity at 
Morehouse and LaSalle, both in Louisiana, 
following their expansion. 
In addition, we commissioned three new 
plants during 2022: Demopolis in Alabama, 
plus Leola and Russellville (both in 
Arkansas). In September 2022, 
we acquired a 90 kiloton (kt) pellet plant 
in Princeton (British Columbia) from 
Princeton Standard Pellet Corporation. 
These four plants combined will add over 
500kt of production when at full capacity.
In December 2022, the Group took a Final 
Investment Decision (FID) to develop two 
new pellet production projects. The first is 
a 450kt new-build pellet plant at Longview 
(Washington State) that includes the 
development of a new port facility at the 
location. The second is a 130kt expansion 
of our Aliceville site (Alabama). The 
combined investment in these projects 
is expected to be in the region of 
$300 million, inclusive of the effect 
of inflation on construction costs.
The development of the new plant at 
Longview will provide the Group with 
access to a new fibre basket and we 
will also develop port infrastructure at the 
Port of Longview, adding a fifth port to 
the Group’s North American supply chain, 
with the opportunity to consolidate 
additional capacity in the future. 
The US Pacific North-West will be the 
Group’s fourth major area of fibre supply 
alongside the US South; British Columbia; 
and Alberta. The new facility is expected 
to support further diversification of the 
Group’s fibre sourcing production and 
export capacity, supporting sales into 
Asian and European markets, as well 
as own-use.
Taken together, existing operations and 
developments will give Drax a network 
of 18 pellet plants, with access to five 
deep-water ports on the East Coast and 
West Coast of North America.
In addition to our own-use of biomass, 
the Group also has contracts to supply 
22Mt of biomass to Asian and European 
counterparties. These contracts extend 
into the 2030s, with total revenues of 
over $4.1 billion.
Inflationary pressures, primarily in 
transportation and utilities in North 
America during 2022, contributed to 
an increase in our pellet production costs. 
Together with costs incurred in providing 
supply-side flexibility, production costs 
for the Pellet Production business are 
expected to be higher in 2023. These 
increased costs have been considered 
in an adjusted transfer price implemented 
in the second half of 2022.
We remain focused on opportunities 
to reduce the cost of biomass but will 
balance this against the need to optimise 
our supply chain to deliver value for 
the Group.

Strategic report
Generation 
Adjusted EBITDA of £696 million from 
continuing operations was an increase 
of 87% on 2021 (£372 million, inclusive 
of £20 million from discontinued CCGT 
operations). This reflects a strong system 
support and renewable power generation 
performance across the portfolio, 
providing high levels of dispatchable 
renewable and low-carbon electricity 
and system support services, more than 
offsetting incrementally higher biomass 
costs and grid charges. In addition, there 
was no major planned outage undertaken 
in 2022, compared to one in 2021.
Against the backdrop of increasing 
concern around European energy security, 
we have optimised our biomass generation 
and logistics, buying back positions in 
the first half of the year and reprofiling 
to the second half. These actions provided 
additional security of supply to the UK 
at times of expected higher demand. 
The process of moving generation 
between lower and higher demand periods 
has resulted in an incremental increase 
in achieved power prices – although this 
has not been without cost. 
We have incurred direct logistics costs 
associated with changing our delivery 
programme and managed an increased 
number of rail delivery cancellations 
in the UK due to driver availability.
Over the past 12 months, the cost of 
biomass in the European spot market has 
increased significantly, making it more 
challenging to procure and generate 
additional power with a margin. As a result 
of higher biomass prices, this created 
opportunities for the sale of biomass 
in addition to generation. 
Most of the biomass we use is under 
long-term contracts. However, as we 
flagged during 2022, inflationary 
pressures in certain aspects of our supply 
chain have led to some cost increases 
and we expect this to continue in 2023.
Our pumped storage and hydro operations 
– Cruachan Pumped Storage Power 
Station and the Lanark and Galloway 
hydro assets – performed strongly helping 
to provide system stability. Together with 
the Daldowie energy from waste plant, 
Adjusted EBITDA was £171 million 
(2021: £68 million).
To move towards net zero, the UK 
needs to reduce its reliance on fossil 
fuel generation from unabated gas. 
It also needs to increase the amount 
of renewables, likely from intermittent 
wind and solar. In this context, the role 
of flexible, dispatchable renewables like 
biomass, pumped storage, and hydro has 
never been more important. They are 
dispatchable and dependent on neither 
the weather nor the price of gas. As such, 
we believe they represent a long-term part 
of the UK power mix.
This underpins our plans for a potential 
investment in the expansion of Cruachan 
Pumped Storage Power Station, and we 
continue to expect to take a FID in 2024. 
You can read more about this opportunity 
on page 32.
In July 2022, at the request of the 
UK Government, Drax entered into an 
agreement with National Grid, to provide 
a “winter contingency” service to support 
the UK power system via its legacy coal 
units. The units will not generate 
commercially for the duration of the 
agreement and will only operate if, and 
when, instructed to do so by National Grid.

Customers
Our Customers business has performed 
well in 2022 with Adjusted EBITDA 
of £26 million (2021: £6 million). The 
performance is an improvement on 2021, 
when Covid-19 had an impact – principally 
in the area of the business working 
with small or medium-sized enterprise 
(SME) customers. 
Over the past two years, we have 
restructured the Customers business. 
This has included streamlining operations, 
with the closure of offices in Oxford and 
Cardiff, and rebranding the Haven Power 
Industrial & Commercial (I&C) business 
to Drax Energy Solutions. These changes 
will support the development of our core 
I&C supply business, which has performed 
well with growth in the contracted sales 
position to high-quality customers. 
We see an important role in supporting 
the decarbonisation of I&C businesses 
through the supply of renewable energy, 
asset optimisation, electric vehicle 
services, and carbon offset certificates, 
which we believe could evolve in the 
future to the provision of carbon removals.
To date National Grid has not instructed 
the units to run, other than for testing. 
The contract, which covers the period 
October 2022 to March 2023, provides a 
fixed fee for the provision of the units with 
National Grid remunerating Drax for costs, 
including the coal and carbon associated 
with any generation.
The winter contingency service agreement 
is not expected to interfere with our plans 
for developing BECCS at Drax Power 
Station. Site preparation works for BECCS 
are ongoing and will continue following 
formal closure of the coal units at the end 
of March 2023 on conclusion of the 
contract with National Grid.
In March 2022, the Group signed a 
development agreement with Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction (EPC) 
contractor Mytilineos for the development 
of three 299MW Open Cycle Gas Turbines 
(OCGTs). Each plant is expected to require 
investment in the region of £100 million 
across the period 2022 to 2024. This 
investment is underpinned by a 15-year 
Capacity Market agreement for delivery 
between 2024 and 2039. We are 
continuing to evaluate options for these 
projects, including their potential sale.

Strategic report
Our Customers business has seen some 
increase in bad debt, reflecting the 
impacts of higher prices. We have robust 
processes in place to manage this.
Strategy
Our strategy is designed to realise our 
purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future and our ambition to be 
a carbon negative company by 2030. 
The strategy includes three complementary 
strategic pillars, closely aligned with global 
energy policies. These pillars are to be 
a global leader in sustainable biomass 
pellets; to be a global leader in carbon 
removals; and to be a UK leader 
in dispatchable, renewable power.
A global leader in sustainable 
biomass pellets
We believe the global market for 
sustainable biomass will grow significantly, 
creating international opportunities for 
sales to third-parties, BECCS, generation 
and other long-term uses of biomass. 
To support this expected growth in 
demand for biomass products, Drax 
is targeting 8Mt of pellet production 
capacity by 2030. This will require the 
development of over 3Mt of new biomass 
pellet production capacity to supplement 
existing capacity and developments. 
We are developing a pipeline of organic 
projects, principally focused on North 
America, which includes the recently 
announced Longview project. We will 
also look at other opportunities 
where appropriate.
Drax is differentiated as a major producer, 
supplier and user of biomass, active in all 
areas of the supply chain, with long-term 
relationships and 20 years of experience 
in biomass operations. The Group’s 
innovation in coal-to-biomass engineering, 
together with the development of 
a leading position in carbon removals, 
can be deployed alongside its large, 
reliable and sustainable supply chain 
to support customer decarbonisation 
journeys with long-term partnerships. 
We expect to sell all the biomass we 
produce at an appropriate market price 
(both for own use at Drax Power Station 
and to third-parties), typically under 
long-term contracts. 
A global leader in carbon removals
BECCS – UK
We continue to develop options for BECCS. 
We plan to transform Drax Power Station, 
through the addition of post combustion 
carbon capture to two of the existing 
biomass units, using sustainable biomass 
and technology from Drax’s technology 
partner, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). 
Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) will be 
transported and stored by the Group’s 
partners in the East Coast Cluster. By 2030 
the project aims to permanently remove 
8Mt of CO2 per annum. An investment 
decision could be taken in 2024, subject 
to the right investment framework. 
In addition, Drax awaits the outcome 
of its bid into the “Track 1” Power BECCS 
submission process and publication of the 
Government’s Biomass Strategy.
Alongside MHI’s technology, we are 
supporting other innovative options for 
carbon capture. For example, Drax is an 
equity shareholder in C-Capture Limited, 
which is developing a solvent technology 
that could be used for BECCS and other 
applications. We believe this could deliver 
significant long-term cost savings for 
future projects. 
BECCS – North America
We want to capitalise on our belief in the 
global need for BECCS and the technical 
expertise gained from our Drax Power 
Station project. Our ambition is to deliver 
4Mt of carbon removals each year from 
BECCS outside of the UK by 2030. 
Accordingly, we are developing models 
and locational preferences for global 
BECCS developments, with a primary 
focus on North America.
Opportunities under consideration include 
new-build BECCS power stations, as well 
as developing options for a pellet plant 
with carbon capture, and using BECCS 
as an exportable solution, for example 
in coal-to-biomass-to-BECCS on 
non-Drax assets. 
Key considerations for these opportunities 
include proximity to sustainable biomass 
fibre, carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
infrastructure, regulatory support, 
commercial potential, and technology.
We are currently evaluating a range 
of potential financial models for these 
projects. These could include long-term 
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), 
long-term Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) 
offtake agreements, and government 
investment frameworks. In September 
2022, we announced a Memorandum 
of Understanding (MoU) with Respira, 
which could see the largest volume of 
carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) traded 
so far globally. Under the MoU, Respira 
could purchase up to 2Mt of CDRs over 
a five-year period from our North 
American BECCS projects.
The regulatory environment for BECCS 
in the US continued to develop in 2022, 
with the inclusion of BECCS as an eligible 
technology under the Department of 
Energy climate goals funding scheme and 
the increase in 45Q support to $85 per 
tonne of CO2 captured, under the Inflation 
Reduction Act (2022). 
Furthermore, a recent National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory report highlights that, 
by 2035, the US could need around 100Mt 
of carbon removals from BECCS to offset 
remaining carbon emissions in the power 
sector. In addition, recent State level 
developments in Louisiana and California 
have both been supportive of the 
development of BECCS.
Research by the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s 
leading authority on climate science, 
is also supportive. The IPCC’s research 
states that CDR methods, including 
BECCS, are needed to mitigate residual 
emissions and keep the world on a 
pathway to limit warming to 1.5oC. 
The illustrative mitigation pathways 
assessed by the IPCC use significant 
volumes of CDRs, including BECCS, 
as a tool for mitigating climate change. 
IPCC modelling shows that between 
0.5 and 9.5 billion tonnes of CDRs, 
via BECCS, could be required annually 
by 2050 to reach global net zero. 
The UN-backed Principles for Responsible 
Investment estimate that the CDR market 
could be worth over a trillion dollars 
by 2050.
We believe there are significant growth 
opportunities linked to BECCS in North 
America. To progress these opportunities 
in 2023, the Group expects to invest 
in development expenditure in the region 
of £30 million with a view to advancing 
these opportunities to a FID. We expect 
to update on progress with these 
opportunities in 2023.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Drax supports these forest economies 
by providing incremental secondary 
revenues to forest landowners through 
the purchase of material which is not 
otherwise merchantable to a sawmill 
and has limited alternative uses. 
These materials include bark, branches, 
low-grade wood and woody matter from 
forest management activities (thinning), 
in addition to purchasing sawmill residues. 
This reduces the risk of wildfire and the 
spread of disease, and allows for 
replanting of the forest. Where there 
would otherwise be no demand for 
these materials, they are sometimes 
burned at the roadside, as happens 
in British Columbia. 
In the US South, the periodic thinning of 
a forest helps improve the size and quality 
of sawlogs when the trees reach maturity, 
the economic value of the timber 
produced and the carbon absorbed 
and stored, as well as forest health 
and biodiversity. 
If forests were not thinned, the revenue 
from sawlogs would be reduced and 
landowners may consider other uses 
for their land, such as agricultural crops 
and livestock farming. The management 
of forestland to produce sawlogs ensures 
forests are growing vigorously and 
absorbing carbon, which means forests 
remain a carbon sink.
Forests in the areas where Drax sources 
material are subject to national and 
regional regulation and typically supported 
by, and independently monitored for 
compliance by, forest certification 
schemes. These include the Forestry 
Stewardship Council (FSC® C119787), 
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), 
and the Programme for the Endorsement 
of Forest Certification (PEFC) 
(PEFC/16-37-1769).
We supplement this regulation through 
our own Responsible Sourcing Policy and 
supply chain checks, with third-party 
verification under the Sustainable Biomass 
Program (SBP), in respect of woody 
biomass used at Drax Power Station.
Outlook 
The Group is continuing to play an 
important role in supporting energy 
security of supply in the UK, using our 
supply chain and flexible, renewable 
generation portfolio to provide large 
volumes of reliable renewable power 
and system stability at a time of higher 
gas prices.
Our long-term focus remains on 
progressing our strategy and our ambition 
to become a carbon negative company 
by 2030, underpinned by the development 
of BECCS. The potential for the growth 
in carbon removals, and the opportunity 
this could afford BECCS in the UK and 
our plans for North America, is significant 
and we expect to make further progress 
on these options during 2023.
Through these strategic objectives, 
we expect to create opportunities 
for long-term international growth 
underpinned by strong cash generation 
and attractive returns for shareholders, 
and to deliver value for our other 
stakeholders. 
Will Gardiner,  
Chief Executive Officer
A UK leader in dispatchable, 
renewable generation 
The UK’s plans to achieve net zero 
by 2050 will require the electrification 
of sectors such as heating and transport 
systems, resulting in a significant increase 
in demand for electricity. We believe that 
intermittent renewable and inflexible 
low-carbon energy sources – wind, 
solar and nuclear – could help meet 
this demand. However, this will only be 
possible if the remaining power sources 
can provide the dispatchable power and 
non-generation system support services 
required to ensure security of supply and 
to limit the cost to the consumer. 
Long-term biomass generation and 
pumped storage hydro can provide these 
increasingly important services and we are 
developing an option for new pumped 
storage – the expansion of Cruachan 
Power Station – to provide an additional 
600MW of dispatchable long-duration 
storage to the power system. A planning 
application was submitted in May 2022, 
and any investment remains subject 
to the right investment infrastructure 
and support. 
The location, flexibility and range of 
services Cruachan can provide makes it 
strategically important to the UK power 
system. A final investment decision could 
be taken in 2024 and the development 
operational by 2030. Any investment 
decision will depend on the right 
regulatory framework. 
Biomass sustainability
Delivering positive outcomes for the 
climate, nature, and people are central 
to our plans. Ensuring that we only use 
biomass that is sourced sustainably is key 
to this ambition. You can read more about 
biomass sourcing in Sustainable 
Development on pages 36 to 74.
Biomass, when sustainably sourced, 
supports good forestry, is a renewable 
source of energy, and we believe 
represents an important part of both UK 
and international renewable energy policy.
Drax sources its biomass from well-
established forestry markets mainly in 
the US and Canada, as well as Europe. 
The main output from these markets 
is sawlogs, which are processed for use 
in construction and manufacturing. When 
used in this way, these materials represent 
a source of long-term carbon storage and, 
when the forest regenerates or 
is replanted, the growing trees absorb 
carbon from the atmosphere.

Financial Review
Introduction
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
of £731 million (2021: £398 million) 
reflects a strong contribution from all 
business units as we benefited from the 
integrated nature of our business model, 
against a backdrop of volatile 
macroeconomic conditions. Cash 
generated from operations of £320 million 
(2021: £354 million) is stated after 
cash collateral outflows of £407 million 
during the year, associated with forward 
sales of power (2021: inflows of 
£168 million). Excluding the impact 
of these cash collateral outflows, 
the underlying cash generated from 
operations grew significantly, reflecting 
the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.
Closing Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 
1.6 times (2021: 2.8 times) is significantly 
below the Group’s long-term target 
of 2.0 times and reduces to 1.3 times 
if collateral posted of £234 million 
is adjusted for (2021: 3.2 times, 
collateral held of £173 million). 
Total operating profit was £146 million 
(2021: £197 million). Total gross profit 
increased by £132 million to £1,023 million 
(2021: £891 million) but this was offset by 
increases in operating and administrative 
expenses, impairment losses on financial 
assets, increased depreciation charges, 
and impairment of non-current assets.
Capital expenditure of £255 million grew 
7% compared to £238 million in 2021, 
with £127 million spent on major strategic 
initiatives, including £90 million on the 
development of our OCGT projects. The 
proposed full year dividend of 21.0 pence 
per share reflects a 12% increase on the 
previous year (2021: 18.8 pence per share) 
as the Group continues to pay a sustainable 
and growing dividend in line with its 
long-standing capital allocation policy.
Financial performance
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA of £731 million is an 84% 
increase (2021: £398 million). All business 
units delivered an increase in Adjusted 
EBITDA compared to the previous year.
Our Pellet Production business generated 
Adjusted EBITDA of £134 million (2021: 
£86 million). This reflects increased 
production volumes attributable to 
commissioning new sites and a full year 
of ownership of Pinnacle, an uplift in the 
Group’s intercompany sales price between 
our Pellet Production and Generation 
businesses, and increased value achieved 
from sales of biomass in the spot market, 
partially offset by increased costs 
of production.
Our pellet business produced 
3.9Mt of pellets and shipped 4.7Mt 
(2021: 3.1Mt produced and 3.2Mt shipped). 
Of this volume 2.2Mt was sold to third 
parties (2021: 1.2Mt). Increased volume 
produced primarily reflects the full year 
impact of the acquired Pinnacle sites, 
which were added in April 2021 and 
additional volumes achieved from the 
commissioning of new sites. 
Against the background of volatile 
commodity prices, the Pellet Production 
business contributed significant value 
to the Group by providing flexibility 
in biomass supply to Drax Power Station. 
During 2022 we saw cost increases and 
inflationary pressures, particularly in 
relation to utilities and transportation, 
and incurred additional costs reprofiling 
biomass cargoes, both own use and 
third-party, to support the provision 
of flexible generation to the UK power 
system. The value achieved in the 
Generation business exceeded the 
extra costs incurred.

We calculate Adjusted financial performance measures, which exclude income statement volatility from derivative financial instruments and the impact of exceptional items. 
This allows management and stakeholders to better compare the performance of the Group between the current and previous year without the effects of this volatility and 
one off or non-operational items. Adjusted financial performance measures are described more fully on page 179, with a reconciliation to their statutory equivalents in note 
2.7 to the Consolidated financial statements on page 203. 
Throughout this document we distinguish between Adjusted measures and Total measures, which are calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). On 31 January 2021, the Group completed the sale of its portfolio of CCGT assets to VPI Generation Limited. Because of this transaction, the results of the 
CCGT portfolio for 2021 have been classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated financial statements. References to financial performance measures throughout 
this annual report refer to continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. Further details of discontinued financial performance is included in note 5.4 to the Consolidated 
financial statements. Tables in this financial review may not add down/across due to rounding. 
*In previous years Net debt was presented on a ‘before the impact of hedging’ basis. However, we consider including the impact of foreign currency hedges associated 
with borrowings to better reflect the economic reality of the Group’s indebtedness, i.e. to reflect the fixed GBP cash flows of foreign currency denominated debt. 
Thus, all references to ‘Net debt’ now refer to the position including the impact of hedging, unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation of and between these measures 
can be seen in note 2.7 to the Consolidated financial statements.

Strategic report
We also incurred commissioning costs 
at new sites as we continue to invest 
to expand capacity to support future 
growth opportunities in North America.
Despite these cost increases, we continue 
to see opportunities for cost reduction 
through additional production at existing 
plants, driving efficiencies in production 
and logistics, and implementing new 
technologies and innovation.
Our Generation business contributed 
£696 million of Adjusted EBITDA, all from 
continuing operations (2021: £372 million, 
inclusive of £20 million from discontinued 
CCGT operations). Reprofiling of 
generation during the year allowed Drax 
Power Station to support security of 
supply and maximise generation during 
the winter months, based on the needs 
of the UK power system. 
This optimisation was underpinned by 
strong operational performance, which 
effectively mitigated the increased risk of 
an unplanned outage during periods of 
high power prices. In line with our hedging 
policy, we managed this increased risk by 
retaining a proportion of generating 
capacity unhedged.
The Group’s hydro and pumped storage 
assets continued to supply renewable 
electricity and essential services to the 
UK power system and, inclusive of the 
results of the Daldowie energy from waste 
plant, contributed £171 million of Adjusted 
EBITDA in 2022 (2021: £68 million). 
This increase was achieved through higher 
hedged power prices, increased rainfall 
in 2022 against a particularly low year 
in 2021, and increased provision of critical 
services to the system operator in support 
of system stability. This result is net of 
a £6 million payment to the Voluntary 
Energy Redress Fund. 
The extension to the availability of the coal 
units at Drax Power Station at the request 
of the UK Government, as discussed in the 
CEO’s Review, delivered income during 
the final quarter of 2022.  
 
The Customers business contributed 
£26 million of Adjusted EBITDA during 
2022, a significant increase on the 
£6 million delivered in 2021. This reflects 
continued improvement from 2020, when 
the impact of Covid-19 resulted in a loss 
of £39 million. Volumes sold increased 
to 19.4TWh in 2022 (2021: 18.7TWh). 
Our policy is to fully hedge power 
purchases for the duration of a sales 
contract at the point that the contract is 
signed, based on the customer’s forecast 
consumption. During 2022, because of 
increased market prices and lower 
customer demand profiles, we benefited 
from the resale of forward hedged power 
back into the merchant market above the 
contracted rate. Most of this benefit arose 
in the first half of 2022. 
The total bad debt charge for 2022, net of 
credits, was £48 million (2021: £16 million), 
an increase of £32 million. This increase 
reflects the impact of higher commodity 
prices, which feeds through to increased 
revenues and gross profit but also to 
increased gross trade receivables. Before 
the application of credits, the bad debt 
charge represents 1.4% of total revenue 
for the Customers business (2021: 1.4%). 
The overall bad debt provision at 
31 December 2022 of £61 million 
(representing 18% of the Group’s gross 
trade receivables balance) compares 
to £47 million at 31 December 2021 (20% 
of the Group’s gross trade receivables 
balance). The net trade receivables balance 
relating to the Customers segment at 
31 December 2022 was £244 million 
(31 December 2021: £161 million). 
The bad debt provision reflects forward-
looking consideration of the potential 
impacts of UK Government support to 
customers and other macroeconomic 
conditions. The Energy Bill Relief Scheme, 
introduced by the UK Government, 
became effective from 1 October 2022. 
It provides financial support for non-
domestic UK energy customers by 
implementing a cap on their energy tariff. 
This scheme ends in March 2023 and will 
be replaced by the Energy Bill Discount 
Scheme, which will continue to provide 
support for businesses via a discount 
on their tariff, as opposed to a cap.
Subsequent to 31 December 2022, 
following a strategic review the Group 
decided to exit the market for supplying 
gas to SME business customers, leading 
to the end of all gas sales by the Group. 
Having already ceased acquiring new gas 
customers, no renewal contracts will be 
offered after May 2023. We anticipate the 
portfolio will reduce by over 50% by the 
end of 2023 and be almost entirely gone 
by the end of 2024. 
Innovation, capital projects, and other 
costs of £124 million (2021: £65 million) 
primarily reflects increased spending 
to support our growth ambitions and 
progress opportunities on major projects 
which have not reached the stage where 
costs can be capitalised (such as global 
BECCS). Innovation and capital projects 
accounts for £12 million of this increase. 
The main components of the £47 million 
increase in other costs were insurance 
costs (£8 million), elimination of intra-
group profits (£10 million) and additional 
variable pay charges (£7 million).
Total operating profit
Total operating profit from continuing 
operations decreased from £197 million 
in 2021 to £146 million in 2022. Within this 
is an increase in Total gross profit of 
£132 million to £1,023 million (2021: 
£891 million) and an increase in Total 
operating expenses of £73 million to 
£543 million (2021: £470 million) reflecting 
the factors discussed above in relation 
to Adjusted EBITDA. 
As shown in the table on page 21, 
the difference between Adjusted EBITDA 
and Total operating profit results from 
adjustments for a net loss on exceptional 
costs and certain remeasurements 
of £323 million (2021: a net gain of 
£26 million) and charges associated 
with fixed assets of £261 million 
(2021: £208 million). These factors are 
discussed further below.
The net loss from remeasurements on 
derivative contracts of £298 million 
(2021: a £48 million gain), reflects adverse 
movements in the valuation of gas and 
inflation contracts, offset by favourable 
movements in the valuation of our foreign 
exchange portfolio, as sterling weakened 
during 2022. For more detail on the nature 
and valuation of our portfolio of derivative 
contracts, please see note 7.1 to the 
Consolidated financial statements. 
The Group excludes these certain 
remeasurements from Adjusted results 
to present a clear and consistent review 
of trading performance, as described 
in the basis of preparation and note 2.7 
of the financial statements.
Exceptional costs for 2022 totalled 
£25 million (2021: £22 million). Of this 
charge, £19 million reflects the write 
down of previously capitalised costs 
in respect of a billing system where the 
Group has stopped development and 
where proceedings have been issued 
against the supplier to recover damages 
for misrepresentation and breach of 
contract. The Group no longer expects 
that any future economic benefit will be 
recovered as an ongoing intangible asset. 
In accordance with accounting standards, 
the previously capitalised balance has 
therefore been impaired. Following 
consideration with external professional 
advisers, the Group continues to believe 
this previously incurred expenditure will be 
recovered from the supplier, and there has 
been no change in this position during 
2022. Accordingly, an associated 
contingent asset has been disclosed, 
see note 7.6 to the Consolidated 
financial statements. 
The remaining £6 million of the 2022 
charge relates to previously capitalised 
Software as a Service costs, which

Financial Review continued
were written off following a change in 
accounting policy effective 1 January 
2022. For more information on this change 
in accounting policy see the basis of 
preparation of the Consolidated 
financial statements.
Depreciation and amortisation charges 
increased from £199 million in 2021 
to £239 million in 2022. Of this increase, 
£13 million is attributable to the inclusion 
of Pinnacle for a full year in 2022, and 
£7 million to depreciation on new sites. 
The remainder is attributable to 
accelerated depreciation of certain pellet 
plant equipment in line with planned 
capital upgrades.
Adjusted impairments of non-current 
assets was £17 million (2021: £nil). 
Of this total charge £9 million relates 
to the impairment of the Group’s fourth 
OCGT development opportunity, which 
is considered unlikely to be developed at 
the current time. The three projects that 
have already secured Capacity Market 
contracts remain in development, ready 
to meet their obligations when those 
contracts commence in 2024. The 
expected economic benefit to the Group 
continues to be attractive. A further 
£8 million relates to a partial impairment 
of the assets of the Daldowie energy from 
waste plant, due to a reduction in the 
forecast earnings over the remaining 
period of ownership to 2026, when the 
assets will be transferred back to Scottish 
Water after they triggered an option in the 
Private Finance Initiative agreement.
Profit after tax and earnings per share
Total net interest charges for 2022 of 
£68 million reduced in the year (2021: 
£75 million). The movement included a 
foreign exchange gain of £11 million (2021: 
£4 million loss) which resulted from the 
weakening of sterling during 2022, and the 
subsequent revaluation of intercompany 
loans denominated in foreign currencies 
(further details on this are included 
in note 2.5 to the Consolidated financial 
statements). This reduction has been 
offset by an increase in monetisation 
fees related to the facility available to 
accelerate cash flows associated with 
trade receivables in the Customers 
business, as that facility has increased 
in size from £200 million to £400 million 
during 2022, as discussed on page 228.
The Total tax credit of £4 million includes 
a charge of £67 million on Adjusted 
results offset by a credit of £72 million 
on exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements, the latter predominantly 
driven by the tax impact of the 
£302 million of certain remeasurements 
discussed on page 22.
The effective tax rate applicable to the 
Group’s Adjusted pre-tax profits of 17% 
(2021: 12%) is below the standard rate of 
corporation tax in the UK and includes the 
effect of tax rates in overseas jurisdictions. 
This rate is lower than the standard rate 
in the UK because of credits attributable 
to Patent Box and the super-deduction 
for qualifying plant and machinery, 
announced in March 2021 and running 
until March 2023. The increase in effective 
tax rate from 2021 has been driven 
by growth in UK-based profits, diluting 
the impact of the Patent Box and 
super-deduction credits.
The exceptional deferred tax credit 
of £10 million in 2022 (2021: £49 million 
charge) relates to the corporation tax 
rate changes announced by the UK 
Government in 2021, being a planned 
increase from 19% to 25% in April 2023. 
In November 2022 the UK Government 
announced the Electricity Generator Levy, 
as explained on page 13. The levy is not 
deductible for corporation tax purposes 
and therefore will result in an increase in 
the Group’s effective tax rate for 2023. 
Payment of the levy will be in line with the 
Group’s arrangements for corporation tax 
payments, once substantively enacted.
Adjusted and Total profit after tax 
attributable to the discontinued CCGT 
operations was £nil during 2022 (2021: 
£17 million and £24 million respectively). 
The above factors all contributed 
to Adjusted basic earnings per share 
of 85.1 pence (2021: 26.5 pence) and 
a Total basic earnings per share figure 
of 21.3 pence (2021: 20.0 pence).
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the year was 
£255 million (2021: £238 million). 
£127 million was on strategic initiatives, 
including £90 million in respect of 
development of our OCGT projects and 
£19 million on UK BECCS, £79 million 
on maintenance capital, £27 million on 
enhancing existing assets and £22 million 
on Health, safety, environment and IT.
The OCGT projects are progressing in line 
with the requirement to be operational at 
the beginning of their Capacity Market 
contracts in 2024. Delivery of our UK 
BECCS project is subject to a final 
investment decision, which is expected 
in 2024 and dependent on the right 
regulatory and investment framework. 
Commissioning of certain pellet assets in 
North America progressed more slowly 
than anticipated during 2022. Our capital 
projects and operations teams are focused 
on achieving full production capacity 
as soon as possible during 2023.
In September 2022 the Pellet Production 
business completed the acquisition of 
a 90kt pellet plant in Princeton, British 
Columbia, for consideration of 
C$11.5 million. The plant will contribute 
to the Group’s strategy to increase pellet 
production to 8Mt per year by 2030.
Cash and Net debt
Cash generated from operations
Operating cash flows before movements 
in working capital and defined benefit 
pension obligations for the period was 
£734 million (2021: £337 million), primarily 
reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.
Cash generated from operations in 2022, 
inclusive of movements in working capital, 
of £320 million compares to £354 million 
in 2021. The total outflow of £403 million 
on working capital includes an outflow 
during the year of £407 million relating 
to cash collateral. This has been driven 
by increased use of exchange traded 
contracts during the year, with increased 
commodity prices meaning that 
counterparty credit limits had to be 
managed carefully. Exchange traded 
contracts typically require an up-front 
margin payment and cash collateralisation 
of mark-to-market positions. Excluding 
the cash flows in relation to collateral 
during the year there was a small working 
capital inflow.
At 31 December 2022, the Group had 
posted £234 million of cash collateral 
(2021: held £173 million of cash collateral). 
When the associated trades mature in 
2023 and 2024 there will be a 
corresponding working capital inflow, 
however market movements and new 
trades will continue to determine overall 
cash collateral requirements in the future. 
Capital expenditure in 
the year was £255 million 
(2021: £238 million). 
£127 million was on 
strategic initiatives, 
including £90 million in 
respect of development 
of our OCGT projects and 
£19 million on UK BECCS
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022
23
 
Strategic report
There was a net outflow in relation to 
trade and other receivables during the 
year. Excluding movements in working 
capital facilities and cash collateral 
postings, trade receivables increased 
by £551 million. This was driven primarily 
by higher billing in the Customers business, 
reflecting increased commodity prices. 
The facility available to accelerate cash 
flows associated with trade receivables 
in the Customers business, on a non-
recourse basis, was extended during 2022 
from £200 million to £400 million. The 
extended facility was fully utilised during 
the year, resulting in a cash inflow 
of £200 million and a corresponding 
reduction in receivables. This reduction 
was offset by an outflow of £234 million 
on collateral posted, as described above, 
which is recorded within receivables. 
The overall working capital inflow 
of £317 million from payables in 2022 was 
predominantly driven by increases in the 
Customers business, reflecting higher 
commodity prices on power and gas 
purchases. This was partially offset by the 
change from holding net cash collateral of 
£173 million at the beginning of 2022 to 
having posted £234 million at the end of 
the year, with the gross movement on 
collateral at the beginning of 2022 
showing as a reduction in payables.
A £114 million inflow from renewable 
certificate assets was driven by the 
monetisation of ROCs using available 
facilities, partially offset by the increase 
in ROC assets attributable to generation 
in the year.
Cash outflows on inventories totalled 
£133 million during 2022, resulting in part 
from the reprofiling of generation from 
summer to winter, meaning more cash was 
held in inventory at 31 December 2022.
Net cash movements
Capital expenditure cash flows for 2022 
totalled £171 million (2021: £209 million). 
Cash flows associated with capital 
expenditure on the three OCGT projects 
are significantly lower than the accounting 
additions recorded because of the use of 
letters of credit to extend payment terms. 
The amount outstanding under these 
arrangements at 31 December 2022 was 
£65 million (31 December 2021: £nil). 
Corporation tax payments totalled 
£39 million in 2022 (2021: £12 million 
receipts), reflecting higher UK payments 
on account in respect of the increased 
profits chargeable to corporation tax.
Net debt and Net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA
The Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is 
significantly below our target of 2.0 times 
at 31 December 2022, and reduces to 
1.3 times when adjusted for cash 
collateral posted.
In previous years, Net debt was presented 
on the ‘before impact of hedging’ basis. 
However, we consider including the impact 
of foreign currency hedges associated with 
borrowings to better reflect the economic 
reality of the Group’s indebtedness 
position. Thus, all references to ‘Net debt’ 
now refer to the position including the 
impact of hedging, unless otherwise 
stated. The impact of this change on 
Net debt at 31 December 2022 is to 
increase it by £2 million.
Liquidity
Cash and committed facilities at 
31 December 2022 of £698 million 
(2021: £549 million) provide substantial 
headroom over our short-term liquidity 
requirements. In addition to cash-on-hand, 
the Group has access to a £300 million 
ESG Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) 
and a C$10 million RCF, to manage low 
points in the cash cycle. The £300 million 
ESG RCF expires in January 2025, with a 
one-year extension clause. No cash has 
been drawn under this RCF since its 
inception over three years ago, but 
£46 million was drawn for letters of credit 
at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 
£74 million drawn for letters of credit).
In December 2022 the Group agreed 
a new 12-month £200 million liquidity 
facility with its existing lending group. 
This facility provides an additional source 
of liquidity to the Group’s £300 million 
RCF. The new facility was temporarily 
drawn during December, to support 
optimisation of generation and associated 
cash collateral postings, but was undrawn 
at 31 December 2022. Separately, 
£44 million was drawn under an 
uncommitted facility during the second 
half of 2022 and remained outstanding 
at 31 December 2022 also to support 
optimisation of generation during winter 
(31 December 2021: £nil).
During the first half of 2022, the Group 
utilised existing cash reserves to repay its 
index-linked term loan facility, with a total 
cash outflow of £41 million. Our liquidity 
position remains robust, having put 
additional measures in place during the 
year in response to the volatility in 
commodity markets. All three of our 
ratings agencies evaluated our outlook 
as stable during the year.

Financial Review continued
Derivatives
We use derivatives to hedge commodity 
price and foreign exchange risk. In 2022 
there was significant volatility in these 
markets, leading to a net £302 million 
charge related to certain remeasurements, 
which we continue to adjust for when 
presenting Adjusted results. Increases 
in the value of foreign exchange related 
derivative contracts were more than 
offset by increases in liabilities in relation 
to gas and inflation trades.
The accounting for, and valuation of, these 
products is complex, and is identified in 
the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
of the Consolidated financial statements 
in the current year.
Rebasing is a process whereby the rates 
agreed in a contract are modified to 
current market rates. This leads to an 
initial cash inflow, as the mark-to-market 
on the contract is settled at the time of 
rebasing, with a subsequent outflow in 
future years, compared to if no action had 
been taken. The Group rebased contracts 
during the first half of 2020 to realise 
working capital benefits in light of the 
developing Covid-19 pandemic. At the end 
of 2022, outstanding cash received from 
rebased cross-currency swap trades was 
£43 million (2021: £48 million).
Distributions
In line with our long-standing capital 
allocation policy, the Group is committed to 
paying a growing and sustainable dividend. 
On 25 July 2022, the Board approved an 
interim dividend for the six months ended 
30 June 2022 of 8.4 pence per share. 
This was paid on 7 October 2022 with a 
record date of 26 August 2022.
At the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 
2023, the Board will recommend to 
shareholders a resolution to pay a final 
dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2022 of 12.6 pence per share. If approved, 
the final dividend will be paid on 19 May 
2023, with a record date of 21 April 2023.
Taken together with the interim dividend 
this would give a total dividend for 2022 
of 21.0 pence per share (2021: 18.8 pence 
per share), representing a 12% increase, 
in line with our policy of paying a 
sustainable and growing dividend. 
Our capital allocation policy is unchanged 
and incorporates maintaining our credit 
rating; investing in the core business; 
paying a sustainable and growing dividend 
and then returning surplus capital beyond 
investment requirements.
Going concern and viability
As described on page 20, the Group’s 
financial performance in 2022 was strong, 
delivering improved profitability and a 
decrease in the Net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA ratio. Our financing platform is 
stable, with most of our principal debt 
repayments due from 2025 onwards and 
significant liquidity headroom available 
from both committed and uncommitted 
facilities.
The Group refreshes its business plan and 
forecasts throughout the year, including 
scenario modelling designed to test the 
resilience of the Group’s financial position 
and performance to several possible 
downside scenarios. Based on its review 
of the latest forecast, the Board is satisfied 
that the Group has sufficient headroom 
in its cash and committed facilities, 
combined with available mitigating 
actions, to be able to meet its liabilities as 
they fall due across a range of scenarios.
The Directors therefore have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation over the five-year 
period of the viability assessment, 
as discussed further on page 75. 
Consequently, the Directors also have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue in existence for a period of 
at least 12 months from the date of the 
approval of the financial statements and 
have therefore adopted the going concern 
basis when preparing the Consolidated 
financial statements.
Other information
Non-Controlling Interest purchase
On 30 September 2022, the Group 
completed the acquisition of the remaining 
10% minority interest in Alabama Pellets 
LLC for cash consideration of $22 million. 
Alabama Pellets LLC contained the two 
pellet plants at Aliceville and Demopolis, 
prior to their reorganisation into separate 
entities. This acquisition provided the 
Group with economic rights over a further 
66 kt of biomass production capacity.
Pension plan merger
Historically, the Group has operated two 
defined benefit pension schemes, the Drax 
ESPS scheme and the Drax 2019 scheme, 
as described further in note 6.3 to the 
Consolidated financial statements. 
On 31 January 2023 these two schemes 
were merged. The impact of this will be 
to reduce levels of administrative 
expenses and time taken to manage the 
two schemes, as well as providing the 
ability to pool the assets of the schemes 
when making investment decisions. There 
will be no change to members’ benefits 
as a result of the merger.

Strategic report
Achieving our purpose – 
to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future – 
and supporting global efforts 
to reduce carbon emissions 
are long-term projects. 
Building sustainable 
relationships with a diverse 
range of interested parties 
is critical in helping us 
achieve them.
Many of our strategic and investment 
decisions have multi-year time horizons. 
We recognise that these decisions can 
have an impact far beyond our business 
and well into the future. This is why 
we seek to understand the needs and 
perspectives of our stakeholders; 
and we believe that considering these 
views improves the quality of our 
decision making. 
Section 172 Statement
Under Section 172(1) of the Companies 
Act, the Directors have a duty to 
promote the success of the Company, 
having regard to a range of matters and 
stakeholders. The Board is responsible 
for ensuring effective engagement with 
stakeholders: it recognises that decisions 
taken today will have an impact upon 
stakeholders, as well as shape the 
longer-term performance of the 
business. Appropriate consideration 
is important in enabling Drax to deliver 
positive outcomes for the climate, 
nature and people, and to deliver 
sustainable value creation. 
During 2022 the Board’s discussions 
and decision-making considered the 
matters contained within Section 172, 
and acted in good faith to promote the 
sustainable long-term success of the 
Company. The following pages explain 
how the Board considered those matters 
during 2022.

We maintain regular dialogue through several workforce engagement activities. These include 
MyVoice Forums (involving direct dialogue between colleague representatives, and the Chair of 
the Board and CEO), colleague briefings run by our executive and leaders, dialogue with unions, 
and our annual engagement and ‘pulse’ surveys. The CEO also emails a weekly update with 
a Q&A section responding to colleague questions. 
Our MyVoice Forums continue to be a key part of our listening strategy, providing us with a view 
of colleague sentiment and key topics of interest. We review the results of the MyVoice surveys 
with our Forums, inviting input on key topics such as recognition and reward, and diversity and 
inclusion. To learn more about the Forums, see page 69.
The Non-Executive Directors have recorded periodic video messages on a range of topics for 
distribution across the Group. During 2022, Erika Peterman, Non-Executive Director, spoke about 
diversity and inclusion; and Nicola Hodson, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, outlined the 
Committee’s role, and explained the annual bonus plan and scorecard measures. The MyVoice 
Forums provided feedback on these messages to the Chair and CEO.
In 2022, we also held a Group-wide discussion on biomass sustainability and posted the video 
recording of the event to our intranet. The discussion involved the Plant Director at Drax Power 
Station posing to the Group Director of Sustainability questions received from colleagues across 
the business.

programme of investor relations meetings with shareholders and prospective investors. In 2022, 
the CEO, CFO and Head of Investor Relations (IR) met shareholders and investors as part of full and 
half-year results roadshows. These events were a combination of in-person and virtual meetings.
The CEO, CFO and Head of IR also held meetings with investors in North America. In June 2022, 
the CFO and Head of IR participated in a US road show, meeting investors in New York, Chicago 
and Boston. The Head of IR also hosted a visit to the US Southeast to show investors and analysts 
our sustainable biomass sourcing and the associated supply chain. This included a field visit 
to working forests and meeting with commercial foresters with whom we partner.
The Head of IR and Group Director of Sustainability met with institutional investors and their 
governance teams to discuss key issues around biomass sustainability and carbon accounting. 
This was part of an ongoing series of engagements through the year. In November, the Chair met 
with some investor groups to discuss the Board’s approach to biomass sustainability.
At industry conferences, we hosted one-to-one and group investor meetings with the CEO, 
CFO and Chief Innovation Officer, who explained our ambitions for BECCS. Reflecting growing 
interest in the opportunity around our planned extension of pumped storage, we hosted two 
investor site visits to Cruachan Power Station, and an Edinburgh roadshow.

We engage with local communities in each of the territories in which the Group is active. In Canada, 
in June 2022 members of the Board were pleased to meet with representatives of First Nations 
who, as owners of parts of the forests in British Columbia from where we source some of our 
biomass, partner with us in the sourcing of some of our biomass. You can read more about this 
on page 33.
Quarterly town and parish council liaison meetings at Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire, allow 
communication with local communities. There are fixed agenda items where we provide updates 
on our operations, and the opportunity for local councillors to ask questions and raise any issues.
We believe it is important to undertake engagement with schools and pupils from a young age. 
We engage directly with schools and colleges to promote interest in science, technology, 
engineering, and maths (STEM) subjects, and the energy sector. We seek to inspire the next 
generation and help develop the workforce of the future. Our five-year partnership with 
Selby College in North Yorkshire aims to implement projects concerned with developing skills 
in young people that are relevant to modern engineering and green skills. This includes our 
first BECCS course.
We also work with the seven Selby Cluster Schools – ranging from primary to further education – 
local to Drax Power Station. We deliver curriculum support and develop hands-on activities such 
as electric car building, STEM events, careers fairs, and work experience. Our aim is to increase the 
number of employer interactions over every young pupil’s academic life, encouraging engagement 
throughout school and into early careers. 
In the US, we work with several local schools and colleges. These include the University 
of Louisiana at Monroe (working on a recycling programme) and Delta Community College 
(employee training). We are also funding classroom grants in Demopolis, Alabama, as well as 
in Monroe and West Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
In 2023, we plan to launch a new Drax Foundation, which will be an important way for Drax to give 
back to the communities in which we operate. You can read more about this initiative on page 32. 
We also believe our large-scale carbon removal and sustainable generation projects can create 
thousands of jobs, both directly in the supply chain and in the wider economy. These projects 
include BECCS at Drax Power Station and the expansion of Cruachan Power Station in Scotland.

While Drax makes no political donations, it is important that we engage with politicians and their 
parties, policymakers, and other stakeholders. 
In the UK, we engage with political stakeholders at party conferences and through All-Party 
Groups. We also engage proactively and reactively with political bodies, such as Parliamentary 
Select Committees, over issues including biomass acceptability. In addition, we engage with 
relevant Ministers and their teams ahead of significant political proceedings including fiscal events.
We also engage with policymakers around the world (including the EU, Canada and the US), 
to better understand their plans for tackling climate change, and how sustainable biomass and our 
plans for carbon removal can be an enabler to them in realising their own goals.
Developed in direct response to shareholder feedback, our political engagement policy is on our 
website: www.drax.com/about-us/drax-political-engagement-policy/. You can read more about this 
on page 160.
We engage with relevant teams at the UK regulator Ofgem, the Department for Business, Energy 
and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and National Grid. An example in 2022 was in considering making 
available our coal units to operate under a winter contingency (see page 107). We emphasise the 
growing need for stable markets and appropriate investment mechanisms to provide enough 
secure, flexible and dispatchable generation and system support services to the grid. We also 
engage with Energy UK and the Sustainable Biomass Programme to promote best practice and 
progressive reform in policy, licences, and standards.

The cost of energy was a critical issue for our customers in 2022 and we implemented the UK 
Government’s support package for businesses, the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS). We hosted a 
dedicated phone line for customers requiring additional support with arranging payments tailored 
to their needs. Where a Trustpilot review has a rating for us of two stars or lower, we assign one of 
our Energy Relationship Specialists who engage with the customer to identify the reasons behind 
the rating and try to rectify any issues. We also seek to ensure that such engagement involves the 
creation of enduring solutions that can improve the service experience overall. 
Our internal Operational Excellence team interacts directly with customers to gain feedback about 
certain processes, to seek to ensure our solutions meet customer needs. Our large Industrial and 
Commercial (I&C) customers, as well as the Third Party Intermediaries (TPIs) we work with 
as partners, have dedicated account managers and service delivery managers. 
Our relationships with suppliers are governed by contracts that include our minimum standards 
including compliance with relevant regulatory and legal requirements, anti-bribery and corruption, 
modern slavery and supplier code of conduct. These minimum standards are regularly reviewed by 
our Procurement, Legal, and Business Ethics functions. Drax has also signed up to the Prompt 
Payment Code, and monitors performance to both continue to improve payment performance 
and maintain positive supplier relationships. 
Engagement through our biomass supply chain is a key focus for the Group. We require our 
suppliers to know from where they source and aim to identify, exclude, or mitigate sustainability 
risks. Our annual satisfaction survey asks our biomass suppliers for their views on the sustainability 
and compliance system we require them to use. You can read more about our biomass sourcing 
in the Sustainable Development section on pages 36 to 74.

Engaging stakeholders 
in the development 
of BECCS
As a key part of our long-term strategy, 
we are developing options for BECCS. 
We believe BECCS could offer significant 
long-term value creation opportunities, 
in addition to being a key part of enabling 
not just Drax, but the UK and other 
countries, to reduce carbon emissions. 
In order for BECCS to progress, it is vital 
that there is the right regulatory and 
investment framework. Through 
consultation and engagement with 
stakeholders in 2022, our BECCS project 
at Drax Power Station has achieved 
several important milestones: the 
submission of our Development Consent 
Order (DCO) planning application; the 
submission of a project bid to the UK 
Government as part of the Carbon 
Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) 
Cluster Sequencing Process; and 
continued progress on front-end 
engineering design (FEED).
Ahead of submitting the DCO application, 
we engaged with statutory and non-
statutory consultees on the proposals 
for BECCS at Drax Power Station, such 
as local Parish councillors, local planning 
authorities, the Environment Agency and 
the Health and Safety Executive. We also 
agreed a plan for information-sharing and 
engagement with affected communities.
We continue to engage with the 
business community in the region 
through trade unions, local businesses, 
and business groups such as the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), 
the Chambers of Commerce, and Local 
Enterprise Partnerships. 
We also discussed policy development and 
industry views through trade and member 
associations such as the Carbon Capture 
and Storage Association and Coalition for 
Negative Emissions.
A key focus of BECCS engagement is the 
relationship between Drax and its partners 
in the East Coast Cluster. We met regularly 
to share progress updates. 
We also engaged with new and future 
partners and suppliers that can support 
the delivery of BECCS, for example:
• The National Farmers’ Union of England 
and Wales – to explore opportunities to 
scale up domestic perennial energy crop 
production as a potential new feedstock 
for BECCS
• British Steel – to identify opportunities 
to locally source steel for the BECCS 
project 
• The BECCS supply chain – using online 
webinars and in-person ‘meet the 
engineer’ events in the Humber and 
Teesside with our FEED partners, 
Worley (each in-person event attracted 
interest from around 300 businesses) 
The UK Government is a critical 
stakeholder for the BECCS project. 
Throughout 2022, we met with teams in 
BEIS, HM Treasury, the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and 
the Department for International Trade.
In 2023, we will continue building our 
community and supply chain partnerships. 
This will include engagement with 
policy-makers as they refine the power 
BECCS business model and market 
frameworks for carbon removals. 
We will also work with local and regional 
stakeholders on the planning and 
consenting aspects of the project.
Through consultation 
and engagement with 
stakeholders, our 
BECCS project at 
Drax Power Station 
achieved several 
critical milestones

Decision to extend coal 
operations at request 
of UK Government
In July 2022, Drax announced it had 
agreed to delay the planned closure of its 
two coal-fired units at the request of the 
UK Government – a significant matter that 
was considered at length by the Board of 
Directors. This helped to bolster the UK’s 
energy security by providing a “winter 
contingency” service (October 2022 – 
March 2023) to the UK power system. 
The Board recognised that the decision 
taken in 2019 to end coal generation 
was informed by the Group’s purpose of 
enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy 
future and the transition to a flexible, 
renewable generation model. However, 
in assessing the UK Government’s request, 
the Board gave due regard to the impact 
of any decision on a range of stakeholders 
including the UK Government, National 
Grid, shareholders, colleagues, 
UK consumers more widely, and the 
environment, at what was a challenging 
time as a result of significant uncertainty 
and volatility across global energy markets. 
  You can read more about the Board’s 
consideration of stakeholders in 
this decision within the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 107.
Supporting colleagues 
with the rising cost 
of living
For many of our colleagues, the rising 
cost of living is deeply worrying and 
we continue to work hard to offer support 
during this difficult time. Through 
feedback from our MyVoice Forums, 
colleague survey and the CEO’s weekly 
Q&A, colleagues raised concerns about 
their ability to pay their energy and food 
bills. The Board and Executive Committee 
monitored the situation in each of the 
countries where we operate and discussed 
what our approach might be to best 
support colleagues.
Following these deliberations, the 
Remuneration Committee and 
management decided to bring forward 
the 2023 pay review from 1 April 2023 
to 1 January 2023. The aim was to support 
colleagues by allowing them to benefit 
from changes to pay earlier in the year – 
specifically, during the winter period 
when energy bills are higher – and provide 
longer-term certainty. In addition, the 
2023 pay review budget was significantly 
higher than prior years, (with average 
pay rises of 8% in the UK, US and Canada 
and 3% in Japan, reflecting inflation 
in each country). 
With our external partners, we ran a 
series of Wellbeing Fairs at sites across our 
UK business, with the focus on mental, 
financial and physical wellbeing. We also 
offered virtual sessions with our new 
financial wellbeing partner, Nudge. 
These were available to all UK colleagues 
and included guidance on how to navigate 
the cost of living crisis. 
Drax helped to provide 
a “winter contingency” 
to bolster the UK’s 
energy security
Engaging with experts
A key part of our engagement, and 
governance around responsible sourcing 
of biomass, is the Independent Advisory 
Board (IAB). 
This is a body of scientists, academics 
and forestry experts who advise Drax 
on sustainable biomass and its role in the 
transition to more intermittent renewable 
energy and to net zero. 
The IAB provides independent scrutiny, 
challenge, and advice. It makes 
recommendations on how we can improve 
various initiatives within our sustainability 
strategy, including our responsible 
sourcing of sustainable biomass.

Engaging stakeholders 
in the expansion of 
Cruachan Power Station
During 2022, Drax engaged with the UK 
Government, the Scottish Government, 
environmental NGOs, and a range of other 
stakeholders. The aim has been to help 
unlock investment in new long-duration, 
large-scale electricity storage (LLES) 
projects such as the extension of 
Cruachan Power Station.
These interactions have led to several 
positive steps forward, including a grid 
connection agreement with National Grid 
from October 2030, and the submission 
of the project’s Section 36 application 
to gain development consent from the 
Scottish Government.
As part of the Section 36 process, Drax 
held several exhibitions about the project 
to engage with, inform and hear the views 
of the local community. These sessions 
resulted in potential opportunities with 
local businesses. One example is a quarry 
that was interested in using the excavated 
rock and spoil from the Cruachan 
extension in the construction of new roads 
and tracks for wind farms.
Following a Call for Evidence in which 
Drax participated, the UK Government 
committed to introduce a new financial 
stabilisation mechanism by 2024. This 
new policy framework will aim to de-risk 
investment in new-build LLES to meet the 
energy system’s needs while also providing 
value for money for consumers.
During 2023, Drax will continue to work 
with other LLES developers and operators 
to engage with BEIS as it undertakes 
detailed design work. This work will assess 
the benefits and interactions of a 
new framework within the wider 
energy system.
Drax Foundation
Drax is committed to being a global force 
for good. In 2022, the Board approved 
a proposal to set up a global corporate 
giving model to support this vision. 
In 2023, we aim to launch the Drax 
Foundation, which will manage and 
distribute a fund for community 
investment and giving across the Group’s 
core territories. Covering the UK, US and 
Canada, the Foundation will be under the 
governance of a new sub-committee 
of the Board. The Foundation will enable 
Drax to invest in larger-scale and longer-
term projects in each of our territories, 
and to provide financial support and 
sponsorship to local community projects 
and charities. The Foundation will provide 
a tangible link to the Group’s sustainability 
strategy. All projects will require 
an assessment to ensure they have the 
potential to deliver at least one of the 
following outcomes: 
• Climate positive: Contributing 
to tackling the climate crisis
• Nature positive: Contributing to creating 
and maintaining thriving, sustainable 
natural environments
• People positive: Helping those most 
at risk in the transition to net zero to 
find sustainable, meaningful work and 
to support education

economy, especially products like 
timber, pulp wood, and biomass. 
Their understanding of the best ways 
to support and protect the forests 
represents important learning for 
other users, including Drax.
“We’ve lived here for thousands 
of years, and First Nations have to be 
involved in forest management and 
decision-making. It has an impact 
on our communities, and we rely heavily 
on forest industries for employment 
and community wellness. We manage 
resources in ways that protect them 
and are meaningful to us culturally and 
spiritually. Supplying Drax with forest 
residues for biomass production is 
an important part of what we do.” 
Percy Guichon, Councillor, Tsˆideldel 
Tsˆideldel Biomass was formed in 2018 
to focus on biomass and hog fuel 
recovery from logging operations 
around Williams Lake. The company has 
two main clients: Drax for the biomass 
and Atlantic Power for the hog fuel. 
Tsˆideldel Biomass has recovered close 
to one million cubic metres of fibre 
to date from forests destroyed by 
pine beetle and fire.
Drax management has worked closely 
with Tsˆideldel Biomass to build the 
business-to-business relationship. 
In June 2022, our Board of Directors 
had the opportunity to tour the biomass 
operations in the field and to attend a 
reception afterwards. In October 2022, 
Drax Power Station hosted a visit 
by Tsˆideldel Biomass representatives.
We hope to continue building our 
relationships with First Nations and 
to learn from local communities. This is 
a vital part of enabling a lasting legacy 
of nature positive and climate positive 
ways of working.

I joined Drax seven years 
ago because I believe 
we can make a difference. 
Our purpose – to enable 
a zero carbon, lower cost 
energy future – has 
informed our achievements, 
sits at the heart of 
everything we do and 
underpins our commitment 
to sustainability. These are 
core values at Drax, and we 
will continue to implement 
them as we target our 
stated ambition to be carbon 
negative by 2030.
I have seen continued recognition and 
support from global leaders and policy-
makers of the role that Drax can play 
in helping to limit global warming to 1.5° 
Celsius (C). That is underpinned by our 
objective to be a global leader in carbon 
removals, using our bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS) technology 
to help permanently remove carbon 
dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. 
We continue to develop options for 
BECCS, which we believe could become 
a world leading, UK-led, exportable 
solution for large-scale carbon removals. 
The project is well developed, the 
technology is proven within the industry, 
and an investment decision could be taken 
in 2024, subject to the right investment 
framework, with a first BECCS unit 
operational in 2027 and a second in 2030.
Our ambitious plans are fundamentally 
shaped around the global sustainability 
agenda, whilst recognising our 
responsibilities to the local areas, 
communities, and stakeholders where 
we operate. Our sustainability framework: 
delivering positive outcomes for climate, 
nature and people reflects this and 
informs our decision-making across the 
business. This starts with ensuring that 
we use sustainable biomass that is 
underpinned by robust Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) standards.
The world must act now to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C. Bioenergy has a vital 
role to play not only in generating the 
energy which powers our homes, schools, 
and businesses, while also delivering 
secure, dispatchable and renewable 
power, but also is a key contributor 
to achieving our climate targets. 
In this section of the report, we explain 
how sustainability determines what 
we do at Drax, how it applies to our 
biomass sourcing and how we’re 
progressing towards our ambition 
of being carbon negative by 2030.
At Drax, we believe 
that achieving positive 
outcomes for climate, 
nature, and people 
is key to delivering our 
business strategy. We are 
committed to creating 
a business model where 
financial performance, 
value creation, and 
sustainability outcomes 
are aligned.

BECCS done well
In 2022, Drax commissioned an 
independent study by Forum for the 
Future to convene a panel of experts 
(the High Level Panel) to assess the 
conditions for implementing BECCS 
in a manner which will make a positive 
contribution to climate change. The High 
Level Panel and its chair, Jonathon Porritt, 
published a report outlining their 
30 conditions for BECCS done well. 
The report has been published and can be 
viewed on Forum for the Future’s website.
“With such high concentrations 
of greenhouse gases already in the 
atmosphere, the only sustainable way 
of avoiding a cataclysmic outcome for 
humankind will be to draw down billions of 
tonnes of CO2 back out of the atmosphere. 
Dealing with overshoot means Carbon 
Dioxide Removals – with billions of tonnes 
of removals and storage needed every 
year by 2050.” – The High Level Panel 
on BECCS done well, November 2022.
As a company with ambitions to be 
a global leader in carbon removal 
technology, we are excited about the 
possibilities for BECCS. But Drax is about 
more than power generation. Our business 
model includes opportunities for the 
forests and communities where 
we operate, and for the role they will play 
in addressing the climate crisis. Drax 
welcomes constructive input and 
challenge on BECCS, and we want 
to continue working with stakeholders 
to ensure it is done well. That means 
delivering it to high standards, using strict 
governance and forest monitoring to 
ensure positive outcomes.
“BECCS will need to play a significant role 
in the world of Negative Emissions 
Technologies if we are to remain under 
or close to that 1.5°C temperature increase 
threshold.” – The High Level Panel 
on BECCS done well, November 2022.
We have committed to formally respond 
to the recommendations in the study 
and we will work with our Independent 
Advisory Board (IAB) to implement the 
findings in our sourcing strategy.

Drax Sustainable 
Development Framework
By using sustainable biomass at its 
generation facility in Yorkshire, Drax 
continues to play a vital role in the UK’s 
energy transition. Since announcing 
our Sustainable Development Framework 
in December 2021, we have made good 
progress against our sustainability 
outcomes – Climate Positive, Nature 
Positive and People Positive. Our progress 
has been underpinned by Group-wide 
ESG systems which sets targets, 
captures the required data, monitors 
and reports on progress and supports 
transparent disclosure. 
Sustainability is integral to our purpose 
and success
Our purpose is to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future. We are 
committed to a sustainability strategy 
that identifies measurable and transparent 
objectives that have been developed by 
subject matter experts, scrutinised and 
adopted by our Board, and embedded 
within our wider business model. This 
means we adopt an integrated and 
sustainable business model which reflects 
the views and needs of stakeholders.
Sustainable Development highlights 
in 2022
• Continued embedding our Climate, 
Nature and People Positive strategy 
through our business 
• Created our new Carbon Reduction Task 
Force, designed to give oversight, track 
our progress, and bring together all our 
emissions reductions plans.
• Implemented our ESG dashboard – 
allowing visibility of ESG metrics 
through the business (see below)
• Since 2006, we have hired 
186 apprentices in total and have held 
a 91% retention rate of apprentices 
completing the programme 
(compared to a national average 
of 57.5% in 2020/2021).
Sustainability governance 
The Board approves the Group’s 
sustainability strategy which forms 
an integral part of Drax’s overall 
strategic imperatives, and which together 
enable the realisation of our purpose. 
The CEO has overall responsibility 
for the implementation of that strategy. 
He regularly reports to the Board on 
progress in the delivery of key initiatives 
which form part of the Group’s 
sustainability programme. The Group 
Director of Sustainability leads the 
implementation of the sustainability 
programme at Drax, reporting to the 
Group Director of Corporate Affairs, who 
is a member of the Executive Committee. 
In 2022, a key area of focus was on 
establishing the ESG dashboard which 
ensures clarity on critical objectives, 
tracks the delivery and enables 
appropriate challenge on actual 
performance of the sustainability 
programme against those objectives. 
We have also worked on setting up 
specific groups which will have a 
contribution to make on aspects of our 
sustainability agenda. For example, we set 
up a new Carbon Reduction Taskforce 
which commenced in late 2022. The 
intention over 2023 is to further formalise 
these groups by the creation of a new 
Sustainability Council, chaired by our 
Group Director of Sustainability, which 
will undertake the review and challenge 
on progress, issues and developments 
in advance of reporting to the Executive 
Committee and Board.
Sustainability priorities
We identify the sustainability priorities 
that are material to our business and 
important to our stakeholders, 
as summarised in the Sustainable 
Development Framework below. In 2022, 
we commissioned a third-party to review 
our sustainability priorities to build and 
refine them. This work will be carried out 
and completed in 2023.

Independent Advisory Board (IAB) 
The IAB was established in 2019. Their 
primary role is to provide independent 
challenge, insight and advice on key 
aspects of the development and 
implementation of our sustainability 
strategy; provide scrutiny of our impacts 
on nature and climate; review and assess 
our sustainability-linked policies; and make 
recommendations on how we can improve 
our practices. Comprising scientists, 
academics, and forestry experts, the IAB is 
chaired by Professor Sir John Beddington, 
former Chief Scientific Adviser to the 
UK Government. Lord John Krebs, 
former member of the Committee 
of Climate Change, is the Vice Chair. 
The IAB’s Terms of Reference and work 
programme were updated in 2022 
to reflect their explicit focus on science.
The IAB provides the Drax Sustainability 
team, Executive Committee and 
Board with:
• Feedback on our sustainability strategy 
of Climate, Nature and People Positive 
outcomes and biomass sustainability. 
For example, in 2022 the IAB fed back 
on the structure of our new scientific 
evidence tracker and best practices 
for inclusion of scientific literature;
• Advice on feedstock options, sourcing 
decisions, and forest science including 
forest carbon accounting;
• Advice on standards, verification, 
and post-harvest surveys, ensuring 
that the science behind these projects 
is robust;
• Scientific advice on the role of biomass 
in our climate change mitigation 
activities and in supporting the 
transition to a net zero energy system. 
During 2022, the IAB met five times and 
visited industrial and forestry sites in 
British Columbia, Canada, to learn more 
about Drax’s business in the province.
The recommendations from each meeting 
are followed up by the Group Director 
of Sustainability on an agreed timeline. 
The IAB Chair and Vice Chair meet the 
Drax Board, with the most recent meeting 
being in September 2022. A summary of 
the IAB’s activities and recommendations 
is published on the Drax website every 
six months. 
Highlight on:
IAB Chair, Sir John Beddington
“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
and the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) recognise 
that sustainably sourced biomass can play an important role 
in meeting climate change targets. I decided to chair the 
IAB because it’s vital that biomass is sourced sustainably 
and takes the latest scientific thinking into account.
As the science evolves, our recommendations will aim 
to ensure that the biomass used at Drax makes a positive 
contribution to our climate and the environment.
Although the majority of our advisory board meetings have 
occurred virtually, we intend to meet face to face more 
frequently in future. In particular, to visit the sourcing areas 
that Drax uses. I look forward to progressing our work 
programme with Drax and delving deeper into the 
company’s sustainability strategy.”

Sustainably sourced biomass 
underpins our purpose: to enable 
a zero carbon, lower cost 
energy future.
Drax has been working with biomass for 
over 20 years. We began co-firing biomass 
with coal in 2002 and completed our first 
full conversion of a coal unit to biomass 
in 2013.
As the world’s largest user of biomass for 
energy, our Responsible Sourcing Policy 
(Policy), published on the Drax website, 
sets out the criteria by which we acquire 
our biomass for use at Drax Power Station. 
For us, this is biomass that will deliver 
positive outcomes for climate, nature 
and people. A report “Forest Research – 
Carbon impacts of biomass consumed 
in the EU” (available on our website) 
by Forest Research – the UK’s principal 
organisation for forestry and tree-related 
science − identified sourcing practices that 
maximise the positive carbon contribution 
sustainable biomass can deliver. 
Our sourcing choices are led by these 
recommendations. The biomass used 
at Drax Power Station complies with the 
standards set out in law, regulations, and 
our contract with the UK Government. 
Biomass sourcing
We are required to demonstrate, 
and assure to a limited level ISAE3000 
standard, that the biomass we use at Drax 
Power Station is sourced against the UK’s 
sustainability standards. The evolution and 
implementation of our Policy is informed 
by science and sets principles which go 
beyond existing UK regulations. 
Our Policy, published in 2019, applies 
to the production of biomass by Drax 
managed facilities in the US South and 
biomass consumed at Drax Power Station, 
reflecting our business at the time. 
We recognise our duty to keep forests 
thriving, to respect the many benefits 
they bring as carbon sinks and areas 
of recreation, as well as their critical role 
in fostering biodiversity. We work with 
our suppliers to ensure the biomass 
we use contributes to the protection, 
and where possible, the enhancement 
of the natural environment.
Subsequent to our acquisition of the 
Pinnacle pellet business in 2021, we own 
and operate pellet production facilities in 
the US and Canada. We also have a pellet 
supply business where our customers 
operate under different sustainability 
standards to those for Drax Power Station. 
In the time since acquisition, we have 
challenged ourselves to implement 
our Policy across our global operations, 
reflecting the growth, development, 
and evolving ambition of our business. 
In 2022, as we have continued work to 
increase the sustainability standards of 
our new Canadian assets, the Group has:
• Supported the development of an 
Alberta Sustainable Biomass Program 
(SBP) regional risk assessment, through 
collaboration with the Wood Pellet 
Association of Canada. The regional 
risk assessment process evaluates risk 
against the SBP indicators which will 
help us achieve higher quantities of 
SBP-compliant fibre for our Alberta 
and British Columbia (BC) operations.
• Announced our intention to build a new 
pellet plant and port facility in Longview, 
Washington, in the Pacific Northwest 
region of the US. Our movement into 
this new fibre basket will lead to detailed 
SBP risk assessments of the fibre 
sourcing area. Through this work 
we are enabling a greater proportion 
of SBP-compliant material.
• Developed more sophisticated systems 
and analytics to understand the fibre 
we source, which is helping to generate 
higher amounts of SBP-compliant fibre. 
Over the last two decades, Drax has 
developed the critical knowledge 
and capabilities in renewable 
generation and the development 
of a resilient global supply chain 
for wood pellets of the right quality 
that meet strict sustainability 
standards. And now, in 2022, 99.8% 
of our generation was derived from 
biomass, hydro and pumped storage, 
the balance being derived from 
legacy coal generation in 
January 2022.
Sustainable biomass is renewable 
when biomass is sourced sustainably 
because of the closed carbon cycle 
which is shown in the diagram 
opposite. This section provides 
details on biomass sustainability.
The CO2 released from sustainable 
biomass operates within what 
is termed a biogenic carbon cycle. 
This is part of the continuous 
exchange of carbon between the 
land and the atmosphere. 
Conversely, fossil-derived carbon 
is a one-way emission and all 
burning of fossil fuels adds to the 
accumulation of greenhouse gases 
in the atmosphere.

“ Biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies in 
the wide array of applications in which it can be used as 
a substitute for fossil-fuel based products and activities, 
from power generation to hydrogen production and 
even new forms of plastics. Along with its ability to 
deliver negative emissions, this makes biomass one of 
our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions.”

From forest to furnace: the controls and checks 
from source to Drax Power Station
The UK Government outlines sustainability 
criteria for organisations to qualify as a 
generator of renewable energy. Biomass 
must comply with the Land Criteria (which 
for wood pellets, sets out a range of 
measures for sustainable forest 
management) and the Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Criteria. The GHG Criteria is a limit 
set out by the UK Government, which 
ensures that the totality of emissions 
involved in Drax’s biomass supply chain, 
represents significant GHG reductions 
compared to fossil fuels. The current GHG 
criteria for UK biomass is to ensure supply 
chain emissions do not exceed 
200kgCO2e/MWh electricity generated.
We must report monthly to the UK 
regulators, Low Carbon Contracts 
Company Limited (LCCC) and Ofgem on 
the amount of biomass used, the type of 
material used, where it came from and the 
GHG emissions from the supply chain. 
We must also confirm if the biomass 
complied with the Land Criteria. At the 
end of every compliance year, we must 
have an independent third-party 
assurance to assess the accuracy of the 
monthly reporting submitted through the 
year. This third-party assurance is against 
limited level ISAE3000 standards and is 
completed for the regulators of the UK 
subsidy schemes for biomass: Ofgem 
and LCCC. In 2022, a limited assurance 
covering the previous compliance period 
highlighted no material misstatements 
in our reporting.
For a company to demonstrate that it 
meets all the sustainability requirements 
of the Land Criteria, it can either use 
a voluntary scheme (like FSC®, PEFC or 
SBP – see box opposite for further details) 
or carry out its own checks and audits. 
Material delivered with a full FSC® or 
PEFC claim comes from forests assessed 
by an independent auditor, deemed to be 
responsibly managed, and compliant with 
UK sustainability requirements.
At Drax Power Station, to ensure we can 
identify and track material through our 
supply chain, we are certified against the 
FSC®, SBP and PEFC chain of custody 
requirements.
SBP-compliant material provides evidence 
that it came from a sustainable source. 
The SBP system accepts the assurance 
of responsible materials provided by FSC® 
or PEFC certification. Despite overlapping 
requirements, FSC® or PEFC certification 
does not cover all the criteria of SBP 
certification – and vice versa. 
At Drax Power Station, 97% of the woody 
biomass used in 2022 was SBP-compliant, 
which evidences compliance with the 
Land Criteria. The remaining 3% woody 
biomass and the non-woody biomass 
we use is assessed to be compliant with 
the UK Land Criteria through our own 
programme of checks and audits.
To qualify for SBP-compliant status, all the 
pellet mills we source from need to trace 
the material they purchase back to the 
point of harvest. Also, they must be able 
to test if the material meets sustainability 
requirements. This can be done through 
the provision of FSC® or PEFC 
certification on the material, or through 
an additional programme of checks and 
controls. Drax purchases sawmill residues 
(chips and sawdust) and low-grade 
material from managed forests. For 
sawmill residues, checks must be in place 
to ensure that the sawmill’s sourcing is 
in line with SBP requirements. All checks 
and controls are then assessed as part 
of the SBP audit at the pellet plant. 
The SBP standard stipulates for audits 
to be conducted on site. As a consequence 
of COVID-19 this stipulation was relaxed, 
as a result of which in the period of 
2021/2022 some audits were conducted 
remotely. The ability to conduct remote 
audits ceased with effect from 
31 December 2022. The auditors also 
select a sample of forest sites for audit, 
to ensure the controls are effective and 
processes are being followed. SBP audit 
reports are published annually on their 
website for all certified pellet plants. 
The contracts for material received at 
Drax Power Station require that all 
material must comply with Drax’s 
sustainability requirements. We maintain 
ongoing dialogue with all our biomass 
suppliers and operate a programme of 
supplier engagement to ensure 
compliance. 
We also commission additional research 
on the areas from which we source in 
order to further understand the impact 
in these locations. See more on page 45.

Active forest management: 
thinning
Thinning removes some trees from a 
forest stand to improve the health and 
vigour of those remaining. Thinning 
operations target small, malformed 
or diseased trees for removal, allowing 
larger healthier trees to reach maturity 
sooner. Thinning also reduces the risk 
of pest infestation and wildfire while 
speeding the development of a more 
mature forest with increased plant 
diversity in the understory (the layer 
of trees and shrubs between the forest 
floor and its canopy).
In the US South, the periodic thinning 
of a forest helps improve the size and 
quality of sawlogs when the trees 
reach maturity, the economic value of 
the timber produced and the carbon 
absorbed and stored, as well as forest 
health and biodiversity. In many cases, 
if forests were not thinned, the revenue 
from sawlogs would be reduced 
and landowners may consider other 
uses for their land, such as agricultural 
crops and livestock farming. The 
management of forestland to produce 
sawlogs ensures forests are growing 
vigorously, absorbing carbon, and 
forests remain a carbon sink.
Biomass production and trading
Following the acquisition of Pinnacle in 
April 2021, which expanded our US pellet 
operations and introduced new pellet 
production facilities in Canada, we 
acquired a trading portfolio with 
customers to whom we supply biomass. 
These customers operate under different 
sustainability requirements to the UK 
regulators and Drax Power Station.
In the last two years, we have worked 
to further enhance our understanding 
of sourcing biomass from British Columbia 
and Alberta. Recognising the significant 
differences to the commercially managed 
forests in the US, we have facilitated a visit 
to our Canadian operations by the IAB, 
which made a number of recommendations 
(these can be viewed on our website), 
including improving the availability of 
evidence around our impact on climate, 
nature and people, and developing 
region-specific requirements that 
complement our global principles. 
We remain committed to adapting and 
improving our sourcing practices in line 
with evolving science and our learnings 
from engagement with stakeholders.
As a minimum, we assess all fibre suppliers 
to our pellet mills under PEFC’s due 
diligence review process. This ensures 
that all fibre sources are claimed as PEFC 
controlled sources. All our pellet mills are 
subject to an annual SBP audit, which 
assesses their sourcing and management 
systems against the sustainability 
requirements of the SBP Standards. 
In 2022, 97% of the biomass received 
at Drax Power Station was certified as 
SBP-compliant, with the remaining 3% 
assessed to be compliant by our own 
controls and verification. Not all the wood 
pellets produced at Drax pellet mills in 
North America are entitled to carry an 
SBP-compliant claim, however all pellets 
comply with the requirements of the 
customer to whom they are sold. 
Thinning is the process of 
periodically removing smaller, 
unhealthy, or malformed trees to 
reduce the density of working forests.
Less competition for sunlight and 
nutrients means healthy trees 
grow bigger more quickly.
Younger trees in forests that have been 
thinned are larger than older trees 
in forests that haven’t.

Helping to ensure British 
Columbia’s forests offer 
a sustainable source of 
fibre takes collaboration 
and careful management 
As a business operating in the Canadian 
forest industry, predominantly in British 
Columbia (BC) and Alberta, we strive 
to work with local, provincial and national 
governments, communities, and First 
Nations. This will help to ensure the 
forests of BC and Alberta are sustainably 
managed, more resilient against the 
risks of pests and fire and preserved 
for future generations.
Canada’s forests are some of the most 
resilient and sustainably managed in the 
world. They are subject to environmental 
regulation, careful management and 
third-party certification. BC and Alberta 
have vast forest resources and these 
forests are highly regulated by the 
provincial government to meet a series 
of conservation, environmental, and 
social objectives. Forest policies in 
Canada centre on the concept of 
sustainable forest management with the 
underlying goal of achieving a balance 
between the demands on forests for 
products and benefits, and the 
maintenance of forest health and diversity. 
The governments in BC and Alberta set 
the harvesting rules and annual harvesting 
rates for these forests. 
Drax sources its biomass from well-
established forestry markets mainly 
in the US and Canada as well as Europe. 
The main output from these markets 
is sawlogs, which are processed for use 
in construction and manufacturing, such 
as house building. When used in this way, 
these materials represent a source 
of long-term carbon storage and when 
the forest regenerates or is replanted 
these growing trees absorb carbon 
from the atmosphere. 
In Canada, harvesting is carried out under 
regulated schemes often referred to as 
licences or tenures. Companies taking 
the higher value sawlogs are the principal 
industries for Canadian lumber 
and primarily hold harvesting rights. 
The remaining harvested material which 
is a by-product of the principal industries 
referred to above, and which previously 
had limited other markets, can be used 
to manufacture sustainably produced 
wood pellets. The licence or tenure holder 
manages the forest, ensuring that soil 
and water are protected, and harvested 
trees are replaced by ecologically 
appropriate seedlings. This work is done 
by forest professionals and is regulated 
by provincial regulations. 
The wood pellet industry also supports 
the timber industry by utilising the 
sawdust and shavings which are a 
by-product from sawmills (and which 
represents almost 80% of our total 
volume into Drax Canada pellet mills) 
and the residues in the forest, such 
as undergrowth, branches and logs that 
are too diseased, twisted, or otherwise 
unsuitable for timber production. 
Partnerships
Drax operates eight pellet mills across BC 
and two in neighbouring Alberta, which 
receive by-products from the lumber 
industry. We partner with companies that 
operate sawmills and have forest tenures 
that allow them to harvest certain forest 
areas. We obtain sawmill residues from 
these partners. The BC and Alberta 
governments identify the forest areas able 
to produce solid wood products, which 
lock in carbon for years. We work with a 
range of third-parties, including large 
commercial corporations and smaller 
community-based groups in protecting 
the land from which the wood and 
associated by-products are produced. 
Some of these partners include 
First Nations which have a deep 
association and understanding of the land 
and forests. For example, we work with 
Tsˆideldel Biomass around the Williams 
Lake area (you can read more about this 
on page 33) and in 2023, we will be looking 
to increase our partnerships with First 
Nations within our operating areas.
Protecting forests from pests and fire
In three seasons between 2017 
and 2020, BC saw catastrophic 
wildfires. Factors like climate change 
and storms are seen as contributing to 
the increased number of fires in the 
province. The intensity of the fires has 
been exacerbated by naturally 
generated debris left on forest floors, 
from relatively recent infestations from 
mountain pine beetles and other 
insects, or diseases affecting 
forest health. 
To protect the forests from fires, 
pests and diseases, it is important 
to open them up through managed 
removals that create more space and 
less dense stands of trees and natural 
debris. It is also crucial to reduce what 
is left lying on the forest floor after 
forestry operations. This helps to create 
an eco-system which encourages 
biodiversity and soil health, and which 
enables flourishing habitat for flora and 
fauna. These sustainable management 
practices support the resilience of the 
forest, and the biomass collected from 
such activities can be used by 
businesses such as Drax for its 
sustainable power generation.

Catchment Area Analysis
Drax commissions independent Catchment 
Area Analyses (CAAs) in the regions from 
which we source. They test the forest 
carbon impact of our biomass sourcing, and 
we are committed to continuously improve 
the methodology of these studies as the 
science develops. Our CAAs are published 
on our website, with details of the 
independent body completing the work, 
the methodology used and their findings. 
Completion of our CAAs is part of a rolling 
programme, and to date we have covered 
58% of our sourcing (based on 
consumption at Drax Power Station in 
2022). Through our rolling programme, we 
aim to complete the balance during 2023; 
activity which has been encouraged 
through both recommendations from the 
IAB and the Forum for the Future report, 
referenced on page 37.
As part of this work, we ask local experts to 
test if demand for wood pellets is causing 
the following issues, and to provide the 
evidence behind their conclusions:
• Deforestation and degradation
• Changes in forest management practice
• Unexpected/abnormal increase 
in wood prices
• Reduction in growing stock
• Reduction in sequestration rate of carbon
• Increase in harvesting levels above the 
sustainable yield capacity
All our CAA reports are published on our 
website where you can find full details. 
Where findings are inconclusive or 
indicate an impact, we investigate further.
For example, in Estonia, the researchers 
found a slight increase in wood prices and 
a slight increase in harvesting levels above 
the sustainable yield capacity. In 2017-
2018, prices of all roundwood assortments 
(sawlog, pulpwood, fuelwood) increased 
notably, especially for exported pulpwood, 
however fuelwood price increases were 
less dramatic, suggesting that the price 
increase was not linked to the introduction 
of the biomass industry. 
The data for Estonia showed that there 
were uncharacteristically low levels 
of harvesting between 2004 and 2011. 
The level of harvesting was then increased 
for the period 2011 to 2020. In 2018, 
harvesting was at the maximum 
sustainable level (the level which is set 
by the Estonian Government) due to 
increased sawmill capacity, high demand 
for pulpwood from Finland and Sweden, 
and improved demand for energy wood. 
The researchers described this as a 
temporary peak which had already slowed. 
We will continue to monitor trends in this 
area. SBP certification also provides helpful 
data on these trends, ensuring that our 
suppliers can demonstrate that feedstock 
harvesting does not exceed the long-term 
production capacity of the forest.

Clear-cutting
Clear-cutting is an important forest regeneration technique that supports 
sustainable forest management. It happens when most (or all) trees in an area are 
harvested simultaneously. It is a well-established forestry practice in many regions, 
including the UK, Europe and North America. Clear-cuts typically provide a range 
of forest products, with timber suitable for sawlogs used in the construction 
industries. Among this, there is usually some low-grade roundwood and forest 
residues suitable to make pellets. 
The practice of clear-cutting is informed by science-based principles. It can be 
used to mimic wildfire and other forest disturbance in a planned and controlled 
manner. Clear-cutting is helpful for tree species that require full sunlight to 
regenerate and grow; it helps prevent forest degradation through competition 
which results in the more vigorous and shade-tolerant trees dominating. 
Clear-cutting creates open conditions that allow understory plants to get 
more sunlight, paving the way for an increase in pollinators and stronger forest 
regrowth. Over time, clear-cut areas regrow by replanting or natural regeneration, 
taking their place in a landscape mosaic of multiple forest stands at different 
stages of development. This continues the natural forest cycle.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is biomass? 
A. Biomass is organic matter (typically 
agricultural by-products and residues, 
woody waste products, and crops 
and microbes).
2. How is burning wood sustainable?
A. Biomass comes from organic, living 
matter that is in a cycle of growth and 
renewal, absorbing CO2 from the 
atmosphere in the growth process. 
In the case of woody biomass, trees are 
replanted by the work of foresters and 
land managers who care for the land, 
to replace those which are removed 
within a regulated process that enables 
the forests to be sustained. When 
biomass is used to generate heat and/or 
electricity, CO2 is released – and when 
new trees are planted as part of 
sustainable forest management, 
the new-growth trees absorb CO2 
from the atmosphere.
3. What is a sustainably managed forest 
and how is it sustainable if you are 
chopping down trees?
A. Sustainable forest management is 
defined in a number of different ways. 
At Drax, we follow the definition laid out 
in the UK Renewables Obligation 2015, 
which covers requirements including 
maintaining biodiversity, maintaining the 
health and vitality of ecosystems and 
maintaining the productivity of the area. 
These requirements set the standard that 
forest health is maintained for the long 
term, and even though forests may be 
harvested, trees are replanted in the right 
way, maintaining the long-term carbon 
stock of the forest.
Forest owners get the best value from 
growing, harvesting and selling a range 
of products. The harvesting takes place for 
multiple purposes, and the sawlogs provide 
the bulk of the income for forest owners. 
To track how the forests are growing and 
what they are being used for, we commission 
Catchment Area Analyses on targeted areas 
from which we source (see page 45). This 
evidence demonstrates that we are adhering 
to our responsible sourcing policy for the 
woody biomass used at Drax Power Station, 
by not causing deforestation, forest decline 
or negative impacts on carbon. Information 
about the health of these forests is available 
on our website.
4. What is sustainable biomass?
A. For biomass to be sustainable, it must 
first be sourced from forests which comply 
with sustainable forest management 
standards. Sustainable biomass uses 
residues from the wider forest industry 
where forest management and felling is used 
primarily for producing timber used for 
construction and furniture manufacture. 
The material we use to make pellets takes 
the by-products which are created from 
these industries, including sawmill and forest 
residues, and low-grade roundwood, left over 
when timber is processed, and which has 
little other use or market value.
5. How can it be sustainable if you are 
shipping the biomass from across the world?
A. In order to source low quality woody 
material, which has limited other uses, 
we source from regions across the world that 
have large areas of forestry and active forest 
industries, leading to a higher availability 
of residue material – either sawmill residues 
(created as a by-product of sawmilling), or 
forest residues (low-grade material created 
as a by-product of harvesting or forest 
management operations). 
Highlight on: 
Bioenergy creates an opportunity
“If left to nature, much of British Columbia’s forests 
would experience frequent, low-grade fires to maintain 
the natural ecosystem. These natural “maintenance” 
fires are being suppressed, resulting in unnaturally dense 
forests, with high surface fuel loads – inviting this surge 
in catastrophic wildfires with significant emissions”
Source: ‘Adding value to waste’, The ForestLink (Note: Shauna Matkovich from 
The ForestLink sits on our IAB)
For biomass to be considered low carbon, 
we must ensure that we account for the 
emissions created through the full supply 
chain (from forest, through all modes 
of transport including shipping, 
to Drax Power Station). We conduct 
this calculation for all the biomass 
delivered to Drax Power Station and 
ensure that when the emissions are 
totalled (including that associated with 
all transit including shipping), they still 
constitute a significant saving compared 
to fossil fuels. This process is defined by, 
and required by, UK regulations. 
See more on this in our climate section, 
on page 48.
6. Does burning biomass produce more 
emissions than burning coal?
A. Combustion of biomass produces 
similar levels of CO2 to coal. However, 
unlike coal, sustainable biomass does 
not add additional CO2 to the atmosphere. 
When sourced sustainably, biomass is in 
a constant cycle of renewal and carbon 
absorption across a landscape, ensuring 
that at least as much carbon is removed 
from the atmosphere to the amount 
emitted at the stack. Conversely, burning 
coal releases carbon that has been locked 
up for millions of years, increasing the 
amount of new carbon accumulated 
in the atmosphere.

Global context
Introduction by Dr Alan Knight – 
Group Director of Sustainability
In October 2022, following a review 
of emissions reduction targets and 
progress to date, the UN warned there 
was no credible pathway to keep global 
temperature rise under 1.5°C. Society, 
governments, businesses and all of us 
must act now to address the climate crisis 
and limit global warming to this target: 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
Playing our part in mitigating climate 
change by staying below an increase 
of 1.5°C is at the heart of our business 
at Drax. We have transformed from 
being a company using coal to one 
predominantly using sustainable biomass 
and hydropower. We not only generate 
renewable energy, we also have ambitions 
to become carbon negative using BECCS. 
As the Group Director of Sustainability, 
I’m excited and proud of this ambition. 
Research by the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s 
leading authority on climate science, 
states that carbon dioxide removals (CDR) 
methods, including BECCS, are needed 
to mitigate residual emissions and keep 
the world on a pathway to limit warming 
to 1.5°C. 
The illustrative mitigation pathways 
assessed in the IPCC’s 2022 report use 
significant volumes of CDRs, including 
BECCS, as a key element for mitigating 
climate change. IPCC modelling shows 
that between 0.5 and 9.5 billion tonnes 
of CDRs, via BECCS, could be required 
annually by 2050 to reach global net zero 
targets. The UN-backed Principles for 
Responsible Investment estimate that 
the CDR market could be worth over 
a trillion dollars by 2050.

To make sure our activities continue in line 
with science, our decarbonisation strategy 
aligns with IPCC scenarios. These limit 
global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels, with low 
or no overshoot. They also consider 
the necessary role of bioenergy and 
BECCS in delivering credible 
decarbonisation pathways.

related work in our TCFD section, starting 
on page 52, including metrics and targets

Forest carbon
While biomass is zero rated under 
IPCC rules (see diagram on page 49 for 
an explanation), Drax has closely followed 
the science which underpins this position. 
We recognise that biomass is only low 
carbon (or better) if it meets certain 
sustainability criteria and we have 
developed our Responsible Sourcing 
Policy on this premise. We have followed 
the science of forest carbon for many 
years and reviewed multiple approaches of 
modelling forest carbon. We have also 
commissioned our own studies and 
assessed the potential for the use of 
remote sensing (using satellites to scan 
forest areas) to provide data on forest 
carbon. 
In 2022, we contributed to the 
development of the Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Protocol “Land Sector and 
Removals Guidance” led by the World 
Resources Institute (WRI). This included 
involvement in the discussions and the 
drafting work surrounding the CO2

At Drax, we have set an ambition to be 
carbon negative by 2030 by removing 
more carbon from the atmosphere than 
we produce (Scope 1 and 2), helping the 
UK achieve its net zero target. By then, 
BECCS at Drax could deliver up to 8Mt of 
CO2 removals a year. This would deliver 
over 15% of the carbon removals the UK 
requires to achieve net zero by 2050, 
according to figures provided by the CCC 
in their 2019 Net Zero Report.
We are also developing opportunities 
for global BECCS, principally in North 
America, where we are targeting 4 Mt of 
carbon removals by 2030. See more about 
our Global BECCS plans on page 12.
We aim to achieve our ambition of being 
carbon negative by 2030, by reducing our 
emissions as far as possible Group-wide, 
while using removals delivered through 
BECCS to neutralise our remaining 
emissions. In doing so, we will also support 
the UK Government and other businesses 
to achieve net zero carbon emissions. 
We are committed to the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) and have submitted 
our targets for validation. To align with 
our SBTi targets, Drax set a new baseline 
for our carbon emissions data, to ensure 
comparability to our 2020 base year. 
Since 2012, the Group’s actions 
have reduced our generation 
scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions 
by c.99%.
management removals criteria, and 
product storage accounting. We began 
piloting the guidance at the end of 2022, 
with a view to completing a full forest 
carbon inventory of our biomass once 
the final guidance is published in 2023. 
Being involved with the GHG Protocol’s 
project and piloting is key to our forest 
carbon work. We believe we should not 
only rely on biomass certification schemes 
and our own due diligence when sourcing 
biomass – we should also consider 
quantified impacts on forest carbon. 
We have also continued our investment in 
research addressing causality with a team 
of academic researchers in the US South. 
This research includes assessing what 
forest catchment areas may look like 
if we did not source from them, to better 
understand the impact that biomass 
sourcing can have. The research uses 
economic modelling to establish 
relationships between the biomass 
demand we create, and landowner 
responses to meet that demand, in the 
US South. We commit to continuing 
to stay close to the science and how it 
can inform best practice in safeguarding 
forests in this area.
Energy and carbon reduction 
initiatives
At Drax, we are continuously monitoring 
energy efficiency and saving measures 
to reduce our carbon footprint. One of the 
initiatives we started in 2022 was at our 
Cruachan Pumped Hydro station 
in Scotland. 
At Cruachan Power Station, Unit 3 is 
contracted to the National Grid ESO to 
provide system inertia (stability) services, 
such that it runs 24 hours a day, 
synchronised to the grid. In doing so, 
the unit enables more intermittent 
forms of zero carbon non-synchronous 
generation, such as wind, onto the 
electricity transmission system. To remain 
synchronised, the unit consumes around 
2MWh of power. It is currently contracted 
to provide this service until 2026. 
In 2022, an energy saving project was 
initiated to explore ways to reduce the 
power consumption in this operating 
mode. Studies are focused on the 
generator windage losses to reduce heat 
losses and therefore power consumption 
to cool the generator and stator. 
This project is due to present its findings 
in 2023 and any changes to reduce power 
consumption will be monitored 
during 2023.

Biomass carbon accounting:
Biomass emissions are counted in the Forestry and Other Land Use 
(AFOLU) category.
IPCC guidance calculates all biogenic carbon emissions and removals from 
changes in land-based carbon stocks (like crops, soil and forests) in this way. 
It helps to ensure that lands are managed sustainably to mitigate against climate 
change and meet Paris agreement goals.
Because biomass is accounted for in the land use sector, the IPCC rates 
CO2 emissions from biomass as zero in the energy sector.
CH4 ,N20 and other emissions from biomass are included in the energy sector.
Other examples of energy and carbon 
reduction initiatives we have kickstarted 
in 2022 include: 
• within our air conditioning units at 
Drax Power Station, we are using more 
environmentally friendly gas, allowing 
better efficiency
• upgrading to more energy efficient 
pumps for the Heating, Ventilation, and 
Air Conditioning at Drax Power Station 
• signing a Memorandum of 
Understanding with Japanese shipping 
company MOL Drybulk to reduce 
emissions associated with shipping 
biomass by deploying technologies such 
as wind assistance from sails on vessels.
In 2021, we completed the third in a 
series of three high-pressure turbine 
upgrades on biomass units 1-3 at 
Drax Power Station.
Biomass supply chain emissions
Biomass can only be considered a low 
carbon, renewable energy solution when 
certain evidence exists. The evidence 
must show that the savings of GHG 
emissions are delivered on a lifecycle basis, 
compared to alternatives such as fossil 
fuel generation. Therefore, we collect fuel 
and energy data for each step within the 
supply chain. This enables us to calculate 
lifecycle GHG emissions for our biomass 
and demonstrate compliance with 
regulatory requirements.
The UK Government has set a limit on 
biomass supply chain GHG emissions, 
which is currently 200 kgCO2e/MWh of 
electricity. Generators must meet this limit 
to be eligible for support under the 
Renewables Obligation and Contract for 
Difference schemes. In 2022, our average 
biomass supply chain GHG emissions 
amounted to 96 kgCO2e/MWh 
of electricity.
In 2020, we launched our Biomass Carbon 
Calculator, a GHG lifecycle emission tool 
designed to improve the accuracy and 
transparency of reporting emissions for 
wood pellet supply chains. It accounts 
for material sources of GHG emissions, 
including categories absent from other 
UK reporting tools. These categories 
include methane and nitrous oxide 
emissions arising from fuel combustion. 
The calculator has been externally verified 
against UK and EU regulations, and the 
calculator and the verification statement 
are available on our website, under 
Sustainability, Sustainable Bioenergy.
We are further investigating 
decarbonisation pathways for our biomass 
supply chains to ensure emissions are 
reduced at a rate consistent with limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels.

Environmental management
Approach and governance 
for environment 
Our Group-wide Environment Policy, 
which can be found on our website, 
outlines our ongoing commitment to 
manage, monitor and reduce the 
environmental impacts caused by our 
business through continual improvement 
of our operations. It also sets our 
commitments to minimising the adverse 
impacts of our operations on biodiversity. 
Each month, we report internally on 
environmental incidents and near misses, 
and the Board receives regular updates as 
part of the CEO report. We respond to, and 
track actions taken from, substantiated 
environmental complaints made in relation 
to our operations. We also investigate 
environmental incidents in relation to our 
operations (e.g., waste spillage or near-
miss contamination event) to establish 
root causes and learn the appropriate 
lessons, which we then share across 
the business.
Environmental Management Systems 
During 2022, the environmental 
management of our Generation assets 
was certified to ISO 14001:2015 and these 
assets continue to be subject to regular 
external verification. 
Environmental compliance 
Drax recognises the importance of 
establishing open and direct partnership 
with the local environment agencies in the 
areas in which we operate. We provide 
further information on environmental 
compliance matters below. 
• At Daldowie, we continue to identify 
and mitigate potential sources of odour. 
We have completed work to enclose the 
skips which store the waste product 
processed at site and signed a contract 
to construct a new 50-metre chimney 
stack (due for completion in 2023). We 
continue our dialogue with the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), 
keeping them informed about our 
actions. In 2022 no substantiated 
complaints about odour were received. 
• Air emissions tests conducted by Drax 
subsidiaries Morehouse BioEnergy LLC 
(MBE) and LaSalle BioEnergy LLC (LBE) 
in 2018 and 2019, respectively, 
demonstrated that volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) from certain 
sources at the facilities were higher 
than indicated by previous tests and 
exceeded the VOC emission limits in 
the applicable air permits. MBE and LBE 
reported the test results to the Louisiana 
Department for Environmental Quality 
(LDEQ). Both MBE and LBE introduced 
technology at the plants to improve 
emissions in accordance with schedules 
of compliance approved by LDEQ. 
In August 2020, the construction and 
start-up of a regenerative catalytic 
oxidizer (RCO) was completed at the 
MBE facility. In February 2021, the 
construction and start-up of an RCO 
was completed at the LBE facility. 
These air permit exceedances and other 
alleged violations were the subject 
of various enforcement actions brought 
by LDEQ against MBE and LBE. In 2022, 
MBE and LBE finalized settlement 
agreements with LDEQ relating to these 
air permit exceedances and other 
alleged violations, and each entity paid 
$1.6 million in settlement to LDEQ. 
There are no pending enforcement 
actions against MBE or LBE related 
to the past air permit exceedances. 
As stated, MBE and LBE have 
completed the installation of the new 
RCOs at each facility to reduce 
emissions and continue to monitor 
for any potential non-compliances.
During 2022, 
the environmental 
management of our 
Generation assets 
was certified to 
ISO 14001:2015

Emissions to air 
Drax Power Station is required to comply 
with UK laws and regulations which limit 
emissions to atmosphere. New standards 
came into effect in August 2021 under 
the Industrial Emissions Directive and 
Large Combustion Plant Best Available 
Techniques Reference Document (BREF) 
which sets limits for emissions. 2022 
was the first year of operation under 
the annual emission limits for biomass. 
Our operations in the US and Canada 
which manufacture biomass pellets are 
also subject to laws and regulations which 
limit emissions to atmosphere and set 
requirements on the level of self-
monitoring and reporting which is required 
to be undertaken.
Water use
The use of water is subject to strict 
criteria, compliance with written 
procedures and also UK, US and Canadian 
laws. That compliance is overseen 
internally by the HSE teams and externally 
by the local regulatory agencies.
Drax Power Station uses water for 
operational and cooling processes, the 
volumes of which are shown in the table 
above. A primary use for the water at 
Drax Power Station is when it is heated 
to produce steam at very high pressure 
which is used to power the turbines that 
generate the electricity. Of the water used 
a proportion is emitted as water vapour, 
through our cooling towers. The remainder 
is recycled and discharged under permit 
to the local river. In line with our permit 
requirements, procedures are in place 
to manage water system efficiency and 
usage – ensuring we meet all discharge 
consent limits. Compared to 2021, our 
total water abstracted for generation 
decreased from 64,140,878m3 
to 51,899,818m3 – once again, this 
was related to the operational position 
(i.e. MW produced) for 2022.
In 2022, we diverted 3,389,452,345 m3 
of water from river systems to run through 
our plants before being redirected back 
into the river for hydro generation at the 
Galloway and Lanark Hydro Scheme. 
At Cruachan Power Station (our pumped 
storage facility), we generate electricity 
by allowing water to fall from Cruachan 
dam down through four turbines which 
generate electricity at times of demand 
for power from business and consumers. 
The water flows through the turbines 
before being directed into Loch Awe. 
At times when demand from business and 
consumers falls, there is excess power on 
the grid. We use the excess power to 
pump water from Loch Awe into the upper 
reservoir at Cruachan dam. We closely 
monitor the arrangements for the cycling 
of this water and report to SEPA 
as required.

Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Introduction
Compliance Statement
Drax recognises the importance of climate 
considerations, and specifically the 
matters of physical and transition risks 
arising from climate change. To manage 
these risks, we are committed to taking 
affirmative actions to meeting the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rule 
9.8.6(8)). This will be our third year of 
providing dedicated disclosures against the 
TCFD framework. The financial year to 
31 December 2022 represents the first 
year in which Drax has been required to 
respond to the recent additional disclosure 
requirements under the TCFD Annex and 
Guidance, published in October 2021. The 
additional requirements provide for greater 
transparency and incorporate new areas 
for assessment which by their nature are 
complex. Drax has sought to integrate 
these new requirements into its business 
methods and reporting, whilst recognising 
that, given the complexity, in this first 
period of reporting we are, like many 
stakeholders, evolving our understanding 
of the best approaches, methodology and 
standards. Accordingly, whilst we consider 
the information provided to be responsive 
to the new requirements, we are of the 
view this will require further refinement 
and improvement. Therefore, we believe 
that full consistency with the TCFD 
requirements has been attained for nine 
out of the 11 recommendations in the 
reporting period. We consider the 
disclosures to be partially consistent with 
the recommendations for cross-industry 
metrics and targets (recommended 
disclosures “Metrics and targets a) and c)”). 
We believe our cross-industry metrics 
currently lack the level of specificity 
required to meet the threshold for full 
consistency. Over the coming year, 
we intend to evaluate appropriate targets 
and evolve our business methods, and 
our approach to metric reporting. This 
should enable us to increase the level of 
specificity we are able to provide on these 
disclosure requirements. Our objective is to 
confirm that the 2023 Annual Report and 
Accounts is consistent with the current 
TCFD recommendations.
Our Approach to Disclosure
At Drax, being at the forefront of 
combatting the physical and transition 
risks of climate change is consistent with 
our purpose and business model. Drax has 
therefore presented its approach towards 
disclosing the physical and transition risks 
of climate change and their potential 
impacts upon the business throughout 
this section, but additional relevant 
information can be found throughout 
the Annual Report and Accounts. 
An overview of our progress against 
the framework is disclosed by sections 
as categorised under the TCFD 
recommendations (Governance, 
Risk Management, Strategy, Metrics 
and Targets). The TCFD Summary

Governance 
Board and executive-level oversight of 
climate-related risks and opportunities 
The Drax Board has ultimate 
accountability for all climate change risks 
and opportunities. The Board meets 
regularly and is supported through the 
existing governance structure which 
manages climate change risk on a 
day-to-day basis. Please see the 
Corporate Governance report on page 94 
for greater detail. 
The Group has developed a Climate Policy, 
published on our website, that is annually 
reviewed and approved by our Executive 
Committee. The Policy outlines our 
approach to integrate the management 
of climate-related risks and opportunities 
into everyday decision-making and 
delivery of our business strategy. 
Responding to climate change is a 
core component of the Group’s purpose, 
and this is reflected in our governance. 
Climate Change is one of our Principal 
Risks, and so is subject to a six-monthly 
“deep dive” review by our 
Executive Committee.
In 2022, the CEO commissioned a new 
Group Carbon Reduction Task Force, 
which includes Senior Leaders from 
across the organisation that will track 
and report on current and future projects 
required to decarbonise our current and 
future value chain. In addition, the Board 
have allocated a significant weighting 
for decarbonisation targets to the 2023 
Group Scorecard, in order to align the 
objectives and incentives of the 
operational business areas with our 
decarbonisation targets.
The Board
• Reviewed the Climate Change Principal Risk 
• Agreed the Climate Positive strategy 
• Reviewed the Climate Policy 
• As part of the approval process for climate change opportunities, the Board reviewed proposals for 
investing in construction of additional pellet production capacity, including the carbon and environmental 
related design requirements
Audit Committee 
• The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing risk and risk management, which includes climate 
change risk. Climate risk disclosures are reviewed twice each year
Remuneration 
Committee 
• Reviewed and approved targets for developing ESG dashboards (as part of the 2022 scorecard), 
which includes climate metrics 
• Reviewed and approved the adoption of a KPI for the development of a blueprint for an ultra-low 
carbon pellet mill in the 2022 scorecard.
• Agreed an emissions reduction target for the 2023 scorecard
Executive Committee 
• Reviewed and contributed to progress in establishing ESG dashboards, including an assessment 
of the data capture, interpretation, and reporting
• Reviewed and agreed our approach on the shadow price of carbon 
• The CEO reviewed and signed off our annual submission of the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. 
• Performed a deep dive of the Climate Change Principal Risk and assessed the potential impacts 
on the Group’s business outcomes. 
Carbon Oversight 
Group (COG) 
• In early 2022, COG provided a forum for the review of climate-related risks. 
• COG comprised a group of experts in climate matters across the Group and people in roles with direct 
impact on our carbon performance. Both in the formal COG and outside of the group, these members 
help manage our day-to-day progress on climate related matters.
• COG members managed the Climate Change Principal Risk. 
Assigning senior management accountability for climate change risk
We have assigned key accountabilities 
on environment and climate change 
to ensure a clear understanding 
of ownership throughout the business 
and at the executive level. Accountability 
for the Group’s climate and broader 
sustainability positioning (including the 
Climate Change Principal Risk) is assigned 
to the Group Director of Corporate Affairs, 
as delegated by the Executive Committee. 
The Group Director of Sustainability 
reports directly to the Group Director 
of Corporate Affairs and monitors the 
day-to-day risk management of our 
climate change Principal Risk. 
These accountabilities include the 
implementation of:
• Identification, measurement, monitoring 
and reporting of the financial risks 
of climate change in line with TCFD 
recommendations
• Scenario analysis (for physical and 
transition risks) to determine long-term 
financial risks that could impact the 
balance sheet
• Disclosing the financial risks 
of climate change
• ESG reporting and performance 
(the Drax sustainability strategy 
and key performance metrics)
• A governance framework to ensure 
leaders and wider colleagues 
understand the climate-related risks 
and opportunities

Work with the Board and Executive Committee 
on the creation of a new Sustainability 
Council that will oversee climate-related risks 
and opportunities.
The Board and Executive Committee were 
consulted on several climate-related 
matters (details in the previous table).
At the end of 2022, we planned our 
new Sustainability Governance approach 
and identified roles and responsibilities 
for managing our Climate Change 
principal risk. 
In 2023 we will roll out our new 
Sustainability Governance 
approach.
Risk Management 
Our approach to Climate Risk 
The Group recognises climate change risks 
and the financial impacts as a Principal 
Risk, reflecting management’s assessment 
of the risk exposures for the Group across 
its operations based on an established 
approach to the identification, rating and 
mitigation, which is fully integrated into 
the Group’s Risk Management Policy. 
Our climate-related risks are prioritised 
based on our risk scoring matrix, which 
looks at likelihood and impact. Our 
assessment of impact considers a broad 
range of impacts, including financial, 
regulatory, environmental, reputational 
and strategy considerations – our 
sustainability priorities are embedded 
throughout that assessment. Our Principal 
Risk categories (including Climate Change) 
are described in full in the Principal Risk 
section on page 77.
At Drax, we identify, monitor and manage 
our climate-related risks through scenario 
analysis, climate vulnerability 
assessments, internal programmes for 
carbon reduction and striving towards our 
BECCS ambitions to be a leader in carbon 
removals. In addition to minimising our 
own emissions, climate-related 
considerations are embedded in our 
decision-making, and we use a set of 
financial criteria, including our internal 
carbon price, for investment decisions. 
We consider existing and emerging 
regulatory requirements related to climate 
change as well as other relevant factors. 
You can find more details on how we 
manage risk in our “group approach to risk 
management” on page 78.
Drax has identified climate risks in two 
main categories – physical and transition. 
Physical impacts of climate change include 
event-driven, acute impacts, such as 
flooding, and chronic impacts, such as 
sea-level and temperature rises. Transition 
impacts of climate change include policy, 
regulatory, technology, and market-related 
changes associated with the transition to 
a low carbon economy. Whilst the physical 
impact of climate change may pose 
challenges to our operations (which 
even where we seek to mitigate could 
still have material impact on our business), 
the transition impacts include several 
aspects which directly align with the 
Group’s strategy. 
Scenario Analysis 
To understand the physical and transition 
risks of climate change, their financial 
impacts and their ultimate materiality to 
the balance sheet and income statement, 
the Group works with third-parties to 
perform scenario analysis. Scenario 
analysis enables an organisation to assess 
climate-related risks and opportunities 
under a range of potential future states 
and pathways. Scenario analysis can be 
carried out qualitatively or quantitatively 
and provides a useful tool to:
• enable organisations to consider issues 
for which possible outcomes are highly 
uncertain, outcomes which will develop 
over the medium to longer-term, 
or potentially have significant 
disruptive effects
• provide structure to strategic future 
planning and broaden decision makers’ 
thinking to a range of possible scenarios
• help organisations to assess the 
potential business, strategic, and 
financial impacts from climate change 
and the management actions that may 
need to be considered in strategic and 
financial plans
• help organisations identify indicators 
to monitor the external environment

and financial plans and to compare risks 
and opportunities
The Group recognises that TCFD is a 
journey and as data improves, we commit 
to continue to build on our approach 
to understanding the impacts of climate 
change. In 2020, we completed a high-
level qualitative analysis considering the 
impact to our business under different 
physical and transition climate risk 
scenarios. In 2021, we worked with a third 
party to advance this work by considering 
both transition and physical risks under 
different climate scenarios, looking at 
impacts to 2030, aligning with Drax’s 
strategic planning. In 2022 Drax focused 
on understanding the physical risks 
of climate change that could impact 
our self-supply value chain operations 
in the US South, British Columbia and 
Alberta, for the 2030s and 2040s, 
expanding the time frame considered.
We have taken a risk-based approach 
to our analysis work, focusing on the most 
material areas first. Our 2022 work covered 
our own pellet production and supply, 
as this represents a significant element 
of our value chain and supply of biomass 
for Drax Power Station (DPS). Future work 
will have a broader focus, including 
impacts on forests, third-party supply 
of pellets and our hydropower assets.

Strategic report
The table below provides an overview of scenarios considered by Drax to understand the risks of climate change. 
Physical 
Risk 
• 2°C world – current level of physical impacts (approximated to RCP 2.6): Very ambitious and effective global 
action to mitigate climate change results in a scenario < 2°C warming by 2100. In this scenario, the physical 
impacts of climate change are limited by 2030, despite some impacts continuing to increase beyond this time 
due to the lag in climate systems and greenhouse gas emissions. Changes across the economy, society, and 
environment are limited in response to physical climate change.
• 4°C world – High level of physical impacts (approximated to RCP 8.5): Low ambition/effectiveness on global 
action to mitigate climate change results in > 4°C warming by 2100 (despite the high ambition set by the UK). 
The physical impacts of climate change are more pronounced by 2030 and continue to increase significantly 
beyond this time. Changes across the economy, society, and environment are more pronounced in response 
to physical climate change.
Transition 
Risk
• A 1.5°C world scenario: Rapid and comprehensive changes are made to progress decarbonisation goals, beyond 
the UK’s current net zero commitments and beyond current global pledges, to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100. 
Coordinated global action occurs, including changes to policy, regulation, technology, and markets to support 
decarbonisation and carbon removal by 2030.
• An ‘existing policies’ scenario: The existing policies set by the UK (which are not yet sufficient to achieve net zero 
by 2050), US, and Canada, and the current global pledges are maintained without further ambition and action 
to progress decarbonisation goals, resulting in potential warming above 3°C by 2100. Changes across the global 
economy and society are less rapid and less comprehensive by 2030. Policy is fragmented and ad-hoc across 
the UK, US, Canada, and globally. 
A summary of the 2022 physical risk supply chain assessment 
In 2022, we researched the physical 
climate risks on our supply chain. 
The focus was on the medium and 
long-term threats to our pelleting facilities, 
logistics operations and generation assets 
across the US, Canada and the UK. 
Short-term threats were not a focus 
for this study, as the Drax supply chain has 
some built-in resilience for the short term, 
and recent investments have enabled 
short-term risk to be managed to an 
acceptable level. This study therefore 
focused on potential future actions which 
will be required as the pace of change 
increases. This was a quantitative 
assessment, based on the modelled annual 
average expected disruption. The key risks 
for the 2040s were identified and are 
summarised in the table below:
Climate change risks in the 2040s
Risk category 
Low risk: <2,000 tonne-days
Medium risk: 2,000 – 10,000 tonne-days
High risk: >10,000 tonne-days
River flooding in the UK impacting train routes into Drax Power Station
High 
Coastal flood and potential for disruption at ports
High 
Hurricane or windstorms causing disruption at US ports
Medium 
Drought and low river levels causing disruption to waterway navigation
Medium
Heatwaves and wildfires causing disruption to transport routes
Medium
Having evaluated these risks, the analysis 
concluded that the Group has a resilient 
supply chain, with only minor disruption 
to supply expected during an average year 
due to climate related risks. The minor 
disruption would be equivalent to less than 
half a shipment to Drax Power Station per 
year from all the annual transatlantic ship 
loads we receive. This risk only rises 
slightly through to the 2040s, remaining 
below a single shipment disrupted per 
year on average. 
Drax has a resilient supply chain, 
a strategy of increasing our self-supply 
and our climate-related opportunities 
outweigh our risks. As our business 
strategy is built around our climate-related 
opportunities, this demonstrates that our 
strategy is resilient against climate-
related risks.
These risks have been incorporated into 
our Climate Change risk register, which 
is summarised below and in the Principal 
Risks section on page 77. In our 2021 
Annual Report and Accounts, we reported 
on the transition scenario analysis, which 
looked at two transition scenarios 
(Rapid transition ‘1.5-degree scenario’ 
and Slow transition ‘existing global 
policies’). We reported on the main 
impacts under both scenarios and our 
strategic response under both scenarios.
The Group’s business strategy is closely 
aligned to our strategic response to the 
main impacts highlighted under our 
transition risk scenario analysis, 
highlighting that our strategy is resilient 
against transition risks. We therefore 
focused in 2022 on our physical risks. 
In 2024, we hope to take a final investment 
decision on our opportunities for Cruachan 
expansion and BECCS, and further 
scenario analysis on transition risks are 
planned for 2024, as more information 
becomes clear.
To increase the understanding of the 
physical risks posed by climate change, 
the Group is considering: 
• Further risk assessment work across the 
Drax supply chain in North America to help 
inform decision-making on possible steps 
to mitigate supply chain risks 
• Exploring physical climate risks outside 
of our supply chain, looking at operations 
at DPS and at the individual pellet mills
• Further work on heatwave risk, as such 
events may have an impact on operations, 
including the generation of electricity 
at Drax Power Station, or disruption 
to supply chains

Development 
of BECCS 
at Drax 
Power 
Station
One of our strategic objectives is to be a global 
leader in carbon removals. At Drax Power Station, 
we are developing options to retrofit BECCS, and 
aiming for 8Mt p.a. of carbon removals by 2030. 
Achieving this could make Drax Power Station 
the world’s first carbon negative plant at scale 
and offers a model for further BECCS retrofit for 
adoption by other power generation plants.
LT
Yes
• At Drax Power Station, between 2018 and 2020, we completed two 
BECCS pilot projects. In 2021, we selected our technology partner, 
agreeing a long-term contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
Engineering for Drax to use its carbon capture technology
• We completed a pre-Front End Engineering Design (pre-FEED) study and 
commenced the planning application, including formal public consultation 
on the project. Also, in 2021, the East Coast Cluster was selected as 
a priority cluster for deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage 
infrastructure. As part of our capital investment programme on BECCS, 
in 2022 Drax selected Worley Europe Limited to begin the FEED work
• In 2022 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with British 
Steel, and submitted our Development Consent Order (DCO)
• We announced that we are aiming for 8Mt p.a. of carbon removals in the 
UK by 2030. And during 2022, we submitted our planning application 
for the UK Government consultation on greenhouse gas removals (GGR) 
business models. Subject to an effective carbon removals policy and 
regulatory framework from the UK Government, we are aiming for the 
deployment of BECCS on two of our biomass generating units by 2030
See more details on our ambition for two BECCS units at Drax Power 
Station on page 12

forests. We continue engaging with policymakers 
and are screening regions and locations for 
BECCS in North America.

• In September 2022, we announced an MoU with Respira, an impact-
driven carbon finance business, which could see the largest volume of 
carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) traded so far globally. Under the MoU, 
Respira could purchase up to 2Mt of CDRs over a five-year period from 
our North American BECCS projects. This would enable other 
corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own CO2 emissions 
reduction targets, by purchasing CDRs from Respira

The UK’s plans to achieve net zero by 2050 
will require further electrification for example 
of heating and transport systems, resulting in 
a significant increase in demand for electricity 
from businesses and consumers. 
However, meeting the full extent of expected 
demand will only be possible if additional power 
sources are developed which can provide the 
dispatchable power and system support services 
required to ensure security and stability of supply 
and to limit the cost to the consumer.

• Planning application was submitted in May 2022. The location, flexibility, 
and range of services it can provide makes Cruachan strategically 
important to the UK power system
• A final investment decision could be taken in 2024 and the development 
operational by 2030. Any investment decision will depend on the right 
regulatory framework
• Amount and extent of assets or business activities vulnerable to transition risks: Based on the residual risk after mitigations over 
a five-year time horizon, capitalised spend on UK BECCS is vulnerable to transition risks if the UK Government does not pursue 
BECCS as a route for carbon removals. As identified in the critical judgements, the total capitalised to date is £25 million. 
This is linked to the risk around regulatory frameworks identified in the table above. An investment decision could be taken 
by the Group in 2024, subject to the right investment framework, and spend will continue on this project in 2023. 
• Amount and extent of assets or business activities vulnerable to physical risks: Based on the residual risk after mitigations over 
a five-year time horizon, an interruption to biomass generation is considered to be the most likely way that physical risk could 
manifest. As identified in the table above, the impact of this could be greater than 20% of Adjusted EBITDA in a given year.
• Amount of capital expenditure, financing, or investment deployed toward climate-related risks and opportunities: The Group’s 
purpose – to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future – and our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030, 
inform our future capital expenditure and investment plans. We believe that our three strategic objectives are closely aligned 
with the goal of addressing climate change. As previously announced, we are developing plans to invest a significant amount 
in the coming years to progress these objectives, and expenditure is underway in planning and development of new technologies 
such as UK BECCS. £19 million of capital expenditure related to UK BECCS was recognised during 2022 with a total capitalised 
spend on the project to date of £25 million.

Strategy
Impact of climate-related risks and 
opportunities on our strategy
The identified climate-related risks and 
opportunities that could have a material 
financial impact on the business are set 
out on pages 56-57.
Our climate-related opportunities are 
intrinsically linked to our strategy of being 
1) a global leader in sustainable biomass 
pellets, 2) a global leader in carbon 
removals, and 3) a UK leader in 
dispatchable, renewable power. 
We continue to explore and develop 
the transition plan that will enable us 
to operate beyond the current subsidy 
regime for biomass generation past 2027. 
Subject to the right regulatory and 
investment framework, we aim to 
transform Drax Power Station into one 
of the world’s leading carbon capture 
projects. This involves using BECCS 
to permanently remove 8Mt p.a. of CO2 
emissions from the atmosphere each year 
by 2030. The project is well-developed, 
the technology proven within the 
industry, and an investment decision 
could be taken in 2024, with a first BECCS 
unit operational in 2027 and a second 
in 2030. Should BECCS not be achieved 
due to any of the risks identified in the 
Principal Risk and Uncertainties disclosure 
on pages 82-83, this would potentially 
limit our ability to achieve our net carbon 
negative targets. 
In 2022, we made significant progress to 
deliver our BECCS project. This included 
submitting our DCO, continuing with the 
FEED process, and signing a MoU with 
British Steel. It also included ongoing 
stakeholder engagement with the local 
community, local planning authorities, 
the Environment Agency and the Health 
and Safety Executive. The East Coast 
Cluster initiative was selected as one of 
the UK’s first carbon capture and storage 
clusters in the UK, see more on page 14. 
This is the first step towards ensuring 
the CO2 transportation and storage 
infrastructure which will be required to 
safely take and store the CO2 emissions 
captured by the BECCS project. 
We do not expect the six-month winter 
contingency for coal, which ends in March 
2023, to have an impact upon the timing 
of the project’s final investment decision 
or intended commissioning date. Site 
preparation works for BECCS are ongoing 
and will continue following formal closure 
of the coal units in March 2023. You can 
read more about our ambitions for BECCS 
in the CEO’s review on page 12. 
We also cover the climate-related risks on our strategy – see page 82 on Principal Risks and Uncertainties for a detailed breakdown. 
We consider climate change through our financial planning, please see note 3.8 to the financial statements.
Our Beyond Net Zero Plan and Progress
One of the pillars of our business strategy 
is to be a global leader in carbon removals. 
To demonstrate our commitment to that, 
in 2019 we set an ambition to be carbon 
negative by 2030. Our actions towards our 
strategy are summarised in the graphic 
page 59.
Progress: We have been on a journey 
removing fossil fuels from our generation 
portfolio. In 2012, we were a single site, 
burning 9.6 million tonnes of coal, 
producing emissions of 784t CO2 per 
GWh of electricity generated. In 2020 
we announced the planned closure of 
our commercial coal operations and in 
2021 we sold our CCGT assets. In 2022, 
we agreed to delay the planned closure 
of our two coal-fired units at the request 
of the UK Government to bolster the 
UK’s energy security by providing a 
winter contingency service (October 2022 
– March 2023) to the UK power system. 
Our coal units will close in March 2023 on 
conclusion of the contract with National 
Grid. We are currently developing three 
OCGT plants, to deliver on our capacity 
market contracts starting in 2024 and 
continue to evaluate these projects, 
including their potential sale.
In addition to removing fossil fuel 
generation, we have been identifying 
emissions reductions opportunities and 
efficiency projects. We remain committed 
to our BECCS ambitions, which we believe 
is fundamental to delivering the net zero 
ambitions of the UK, not just our own 
carbon removal ambitions.
Amount of capital expenditure, financing, 
or investment deployed toward climate-
related risks and opportunities: 
At 31 December 2022 the Group had 
capitalised £25 million relating to the 
UK BECCS development project, including 
£19 million in 2022. Please see more detail

Remuneration: 
Our Group Scorecard comprises key 
metrics by which the cash bonus awards 
for Executive Directors and all eligible 
colleagues are assessed. For 2023 the 
Scorecard includes a carbon reduction 
metric, linking performance-related 
remuneration to actions that support 
the delivery of our long-term ambition 
to be carbon negative by 2030. 
See targets section on page 62.
Internal carbon price: 
For Drax’s future investments to 
adequately consider their carbon impact, 
we have developed a shadow carbon 
price in 2022. Our internal carbon price 
has been benchmarked to the UK ETA, 
and will be subject to change over time, 
and across 2022 was within the range 
of £75-100/t. 
We intend that as part of the evaluation 
of strategic growth project decisions 
through 2023, our internal shadow carbon 
price will be considered and will be applied 
to emissions across all Scopes (1, 2 and 3) 
over the lifetime of the investments. 
The level of the price will be kept under 
review so that it calibrates to a sufficiently 
material level to influence decisions, 
driving forward our purpose.

Strategic report
Targets:
In response to our climate risks, our 
actions centre around our ambition to 
deliver negative emissions and the targets 
listed here are in response to our climate-
related risks and support our climate-
related opportunities. 
Our ambition is to become carbon 
negative by 2030. To achieve this, we 
have set the following targets which are 
going through the validation process with 
SBTi and are based on further reductions 
from a 2020 base year:
• 75% in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 
electricity generation by 2030 
• 42% in non-generation Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 2030 
• 42% in Scope 3 emissions by 2030
Interim targets towards our long-term 
ambition to be carbon negative by 
2030 that are in the Group Scorecard 
for 2023 are:
• Reduce the emissions footprint 
arising from our portfolio of hydro 
generation assets by 25%, by the 
end of 2023, versus our 2020 baseline 
emissions figure
• Beginning the process of exiting the 
sale of natural gas contracts to our 
retail customer base
• Installing electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure across the majority 
of our UK sites
Alongside the 2023 Group scorecard 
projects, we will utilise the new shadow 
carbon price to prioritise and seek funding 
for dedicated decarbonisation projects, 
currently at various stages of 
development, to target specific sources 
of emissions across our Group footprint. 
This will allow us to secure capital spending 
for projects which do not provide positive 
commercial returns when judged against 
traditional valuation measures.
Aligned with our climate-related 
opportunity to develop new sustainable 
biomass capacity and self supply, we have 
set a target to have 8Mt p.a. of production 
capacity by 2030. See Strategic Report, 
page 19.
We have not set targets on spend related 
to our BECCS ambitions, but we continue 
to progress our strategy and hope to take 
a final investment decision in 2024.

negative emissions ambitions in the CEO 
Review on page 12.

Sustainable Development continued  
Climate Positive
Global Context 
Introduction by Alicia Newton – 
Senior Scientific Officer
We have put an emphasis on working 
in ways that respect, protect and where 
possible add benefits to the natural 
environment, through partnerships and 
initiatives around regions in which we 
operate. This ranges from our power 
station in North Yorkshire and hydro sites 
in Scotland, to the forests from which 
we source in both the US and Canada.
In 2021, the World Economic Forum (WEF) 
Global Risk Report identified biodiversity 
loss, ecosystem collapse and human-
made environmental damage as top risks. 
The general expectation of business and 
society is shifting from solely minimising 
harm (or protecting natural environments) 
to actively restoring and creating an 
environment to allow nature wellbeing 
to improve. At Drax, we support this and 
will include it within our Nature Positive 
outcome as it progresses in 2023. 
We fully support Target 15 (part of the 
post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, 
ratified at COP15 in late 2022 which looks 
at the responsibilities of businesses and 
financial institutions) and are working 
towards it by developing processes to align 
with TNFD (see more on page 65 about 
our TNFD pilot).
In 2022, we began work on consolidating 
our Nature Positive approach across the 
business and its operations – e.g., by 
developing KPIs and metrics. I’m proud 
to say that we remain passionate about 
contributing to nature-positive globally 
while remaining committed to delivering 
Nature Positive outcomes for the business. 
In this report we will refer to both 
‘nature-positive’ (which refers to the global 
concept – see box) and ‘Nature Positive’ 
(which refers specifically to one of the 
Drax sustainability outcomes).
Approach and governance  
for Nature Positive 
We continue to shift our approach from 
a focus on ensuring we do not have a 
harmful nature impact to also include 
restorative nature actions. The ESG 
dashboard allows tracking of our nature-
related actions, and we are continuing 
this work in 2023 as we publish our 
Nature Policy. One of our aims for 2022 
was to begin to integrate existing 
workstreams into a Nature Positive 
framework and narrative. This piece 
of work will continue in 2023 as we work 
through the TNFD pilot.
In 2022, we began work on a separate 
Nature Policy, which will map onto our 
Group aims and extend our commitment 
from ‘no harm’ to actions which encourage 
the regeneration of nature. Our Nature 
Policy will set out what we aim to achieve 
as a business to support nature and 
biodiversity in the areas where we operate. 
Until implementing our new Nature Policy, 
we have our Group Environment Policy, 
which can be viewed on our website. 
This outlines our commitment to minimise 
adverse impacts of our operations 
on biodiversity, through the protection 
of fauna and flora. 
Nature initiatives
Below is a summary of some of our current 
efforts and initiatives that we hope to build 
on in 2023. 
US: 
• Collaboration with the Louisiana 
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries 
(LDWF) to improve forest conditions 
of hardwood plantations established 
under the Wetland Reserve Program 
(WRP) by providing a market for 
thinning material. 
• We support the Forest Stewards Guild’s 
(FSG) bottomland hardwoods initiative 
in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley. 
We have put an emphasis on working in ways that respect, 
protect and where possible add benefits to the natural 
environment.
 Nature Positive
What is nature-positive?
In a paper published in 2021, 
conservationist Harvey Locke, 
scientist Johan Rockström and the 
CEOs of 12 conservation and business 
organisations, argued for the adoption 
of a ‘Nature-Positive Global Goal 
for Nature’ corresponding to and 
supporting the net zero goal. The paper 
set out three gradual objectives 
for nature-positive: ‘Zero Net Loss 
of Nature from 2020, Net Positive 
by 2030, and Full Recovery by 2050’. 
Put simply: We need more nature 
by 2030 than we have today.
In 2022, we set the following 
commitment for Nature Positive:
By 2027 Drax will have 
implemented the systems 
and metrics across our 
operations and value 
chains to demonstrate 
a contribution to nature 
positive outcomes 
in those regions.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022

Strategic report
Work with the FSG includes participation 
in, and support of, learning exchanges 
and landowner workshops, plus funding 
for the development of individual 
management plans. We also share 
bottomland hardwood mitigation 
material with our suppliers (a project 
developed in cooperation with the FSG).
Canada:
• In British Columbia, we collaborate 
with various forest industry participants 
to advance environmental stewardship, 
including First Nations. Our purchase 
of low-grade wood and residues 
enhances the quality of forests by 
avoiding the burning of the material left 
on the forest floor, which often occurs. 
Removal of the residues also helps 
prevent and mitigate the impact of 
wildfires. 
Drax Power Station: 
• The nearby areas of Barlow Mound and 
Arthur’s Wood are monitored annually, 
through ecological surveys with 
independent reporting (such as 
of soil health). Barlow Mound and 
Arthur’s Wood are also managed 
for wildlife habitat conservation.
Cruachan Power Station:
• Since 2009, this plant has completed 
biodiversity surveys to monitor the 
species living in the surrounding 
habitats. This survey data has allowed 
the team to build a picture of the variety 
of mammals, birds and insects present 
in the area, including a significant 
number of protected status species. 
• We seek to partner with local 
organisations and land-owners such 
as to reforest pockets of land near the 
plant. This project further enhances the 
extent of natural forest within the area, 
complementing some of the protected 
‘Atlantic rainforest’ in Scotland, and 
providing habitat for many local native 
protected species. 
Galloway and Lanark Hydro 
Electric Schemes: 
• We started a project with partners 
to monitor Atlantic salmon smolts 
in the Polharrow Burn to increase 
understanding and identify if there 
are hotspots of fish mortality. 
• In 2022, the team started a new project 
(Dee Restoration) at Black Water, 
funding the improvement of instream 
and riparian habitats.
Contributing to nature-positive 
thinking
We are working with the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) to track nature-positive science 
and the international response to 
understand how we can learn from 
the latest developments and work towards 
a shared understanding of nature-positive 
with other stakeholders. 
Within WBCSD, we are active members 
of multiple working groups including 
the Forest Solutions Group and the Nature 
and Nature-based Solutions project. 
Through this engagement, we are helping 
with the development of nature-positive 
roadmaps for both the forest and energy 
sector. The ‘Forest Sector Nature-Positive 
Roadmap Phase I: A shared definition of 
nature-positive’, published in November 
2022, provides guidance and tools to 
support forest companies in implementing 
nature-positive strategies. 
WBCSD is a Science Based Targets 
Network (SBTN) corporate engagement 
programme member. In 2022, Drax was 
involved in the joint WBCSD and SBTN 
consultation workshops of the SBTN 
design phase, developing science-based 
targets for nature through methods, tools, 
and guidance. 
We are a founding supporter of 
the Get Nature Positive campaign.
Highlight on: 
Post-COP15: our thoughts on the World Biodiversity Summit
Business and finance representatives formed a large 
portion of the attendees at the COP15 summit in Montreal 
and were united in their recognition of the need to halt and 
reverse nature loss.
There was widespread support for adopting a target of ‘30 by 30’, meaning that 30% 
of land and marine areas are designated as protected by 2030. Business leaders also 
led the call for the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal agreement, particularly the 
specific targets around reforming environmentally harmful subsidies and the reporting 
of nature-related risk and opportunity in financial disclosures. Drax is excited to 
embrace and contribute to these targets in the coming years, and to continue to be 
part of the conversation around the Global Biodiversity Framework and the Global Goal 
for Nature. Drax attended COP15, supports these nature-oriented priorities and is 
reflecting them in our policy framework, in our actions and in our pledge of financial 
resources to realise the necessary change. We expect this to be an important area 
of focus in 2023.

The Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD)
Launched in June 2021, the TNFD is 
an international initiative to provide 
a framework on how organisations 
can address environmental risks and 
opportunities to channel capital into 
positive action. The framework builds 
on the existing Taskforce on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
At the time of writing, the TNFD 
is currently on its third beta iteration, 
with the final TNFD framework set 
for publication in September 2023. 
We are committed to the management 
and disclosure of our nature positive 
risks and opportunities. In 2022, 
we were selected alongside 22 other 
companies to pilot the TNFD 
framework with TNFD pilot partner 
WBCSD. Drax was chosen among 
others in the energy industry 
to represent the renewables and 
bioenergy sector. 
Since October 2022, we have 
participated in multiple workshops to 
contribute to the development of the 
TNFD framework, exploring priority 
focus areas for the energy sector 
through testing the guidance and 
knowledge sharing. Findings and 
feedback from the group will be fed 
back to TNFD in 2023.

Enabling our people to achieve our strategy 
is key to Drax achieving its ambitions.
People Positive strategy 
Our People Positive strategy encompasses 
all aspects of a colleague’s experience 
at Drax, including the systems we use, 
our policies, our values, and our culture. 
In 2022, we continued to review our 
People policies to assess whether they 
met the up-to-date needs of our business 
and colleagues. We introduced a new 
Bereavement policy which considers 
a range of bereavement experiences, 
including miscarriage.
Our Resourcing strategy underpins our 
plans for growth, reflecting work with 
the business to understand both current 
and future resourcing needs. This has 
included new advertising and engagement 
strategies to attract, retain and develop 
diverse talent pools that reflect the 
demographics of the areas in which we 
operate. It also includes our Strategic 
Workforce Plan, which focuses on future 
workforce planning, enabling us to grow 
our business internationally and adapt 
to business changes swiftly.
We continued to undertake reviews 
of our reward strategies in each market, 
with the intention that our people are 
incentivised, rewarded and recognised 
for their contribution. This helps us create 
a high performance, inclusive culture.
During 2022, we started work on our 
employee value proposition, which aims 
to reorientate and integrate the 
organisations culture and values and 
support our global growth strategy. 
This will create an environment where 
colleague wellbeing is prioritised. 
Introduction by Karen McKeever – 
Chief People Officer
Enabling our people to achieve their 
potential and feel they are enabled to do 
their best is critical to Drax achieving its 
ambitions. To be People Positive, we are 
looking after the people who work for 
and with us, as well as supporting the 
communities in which we operate. 
We do this by supporting the green skills 
agenda, developing a talent pipeline, 
and focusing on diversity and inclusion. 
Our ambition is to make Drax a great place 
for all colleagues to work, be themselves, 
and grow, while being a good and 
responsible neighbour. 
With the impact of Covid-19 still being felt, 
our people strategy aims to ensure that 
colleagues have the resilience to adapt 
and work effectively at a fast pace, whilst 
having the confidence in and awareness 
of the resources available to them to 
manage current and future uncertainties. 
An effective approach to helping our 
people also means that as an organisation 
we need to adapt. We are therefore 
evolving our ways of working to create 
an environment with the colleague 
experience at its heart. 
Our People Positive strategy objectives 
are to:
• Ensure the organisation has the 
diversity, skills and experience to deliver 
our business strategy
• Bring to life a culture that is 
representative of our strategic ambition 
• Ensure our people are working as 
effectively as possible, feel valued for 
the work they do and their contribution 
as a person to our workplace community

Safety, health and wellbeing 
Approach and governance for safety, 
health and wellbeing 
The safety, health and wellbeing of our 
employees and contractors is a primary 
focus for Drax. Our Group-wide Safety, 
Health and Wellbeing policy (available on 
our website) is supported by our 
OneSafeDrax vision that all colleagues 
have a role to play in safety for themselves 
and those they work alongside.
Local Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) performance is regularly reviewed by 
each management team, with Group HSE 
performance reviewed quarterly by the 
Group HSE committee. Findings from an 
assessment of captured data is reviewed 
by the Executive Committee and the CEO 
also reports on that analysis, progress 
made on initiatives and areas for further 
action to the Board at each meeting. 
Additionally, Drax Leadership Team 
sessions (held monthly) commence with a 
‘safety standout’ section where key safety 
messages are shared. 
During 2022, we completed the roll-out 
across all sites of a new HSE reporting 
platform. This single system allows more 
data analysis of incidents, corrective 
actions, hazard management, risk 
management and behavioural observations. 
We expect to see improved analysis in 2023 
as we develop dashboards to look at trends 
in reporting that help us understand areas 
for action and develop local objectives. 
An important part of the processes, 
systems and training which we adopt 
is a recognition of the importance of 
continued attentiveness, of learning 
about existing and emerging workplace 
hazards and risks and ensuring the 
appropriate tone and commitment from 
leaders and all colleagues in working 
safely. In this way safety is acknowledged 
to be a shared responsibility which is 
enabled by ongoing vigilance and striving 
to improve, recognising that as individuals 
and as a collective we can do better.
Additional people data can be found 
in our ESG Supplement, published on the 
Drax website.

Safety Management Systems 
We have safety management systems 
(SMS) in place to promote safe workplaces 
for our people. During 2022, we aligned all 
our Pellet Production sites to one HSE 
management system across the US and 
Canada. Our Customers and Corporate 
sites in the UK continue to implement 
a SMS, with a focus on promoting 
wellbeing and a continuous improvement 
in our health and safety culture.
Using a risk-based methodology designed 
to assess, improve, and demonstrate the 
adequacy of our HSE business processes, 
a third-party undertakes our HSE internal 
assessment. Each business receives a 
report for local management’s ownership 
of the improvement areas, and the overall 
assessment is reported to the quarterly 
Group HSE Committee and to the 
Audit Committee. In 2022, this happened 
in July and November respectively. The 
Group HSE Committee provides oversight 
on HSE related risks, and the Committee’s 
Terms of Reference were reviewed 
in June 2022.

• As reported in 2021, following 
notification of charges relating to a 
violation of occupational health and 
safety laws arising from an explosion 
at the Entwistle pellet plant in 
February 2019, Drax pleaded not guilty 
to all charges. In September 2022, all 
charges against Drax were dismissed. 
• We have received notification from the 
Health and Safety Executive in relation 
to non-compliance with the Pressure 
Systems Safety Regulations (2000) at 
Drax Power Station. Drax consider this 
to be an administrative breach and have 
challenged the notification, and we are 
awaiting a formal response from the 
Health and Safety Executive. 
Safety Performance 
Each business unit submits monthly 
reports on HSE performance, including 
our total recordable injury rate (TRIR). 
The Board receives an update at each 
meeting as part of the CEO report, which 
includes information on any incidents and 
trends. We have a process to investigate 
injury events, with particular focus on 
those with a potential to become more 
severe, to ensure we establish root causes 
and learn the lessons we need before 
sharing those findings and learnings 
across the organisation, where relevant. 
In 2022, our total TRIR was 0.44 per 
100,000 hours worked, against a target 
of 0.20 (2021: 0.22 per 100,000 hours 
worked, against a target of 0.20). 
This is not where we want our safety 
performance to be and remains a primary 
focus for us. However, it does reflect our 
improved visibility on incidents and 
reporting in the year as changes have 
been introduced across the Pellet 
Production teams that better capture 
incidents and provide tools for assessing 
and reporting on actions being taken. 
In September 2022, we conducted a 
‘safety standdown’. This was an 
opportunity for all our operations and 
support functions to engage in a 
conversation about safety, as an avenue 
for collating ideas on how we can improve 
our safety performance. The safety 
standdown was launched with a video 
from the CEO to all colleagues, 
emphasising the importance of safety. 
Our teams are now tracking their 
commitments to improving safety 
behaviours and specific actions. 
As we implement our HSE improvements, 
we are investing in maturing our safety 
culture. Through a training and mentoring 
programme, including hazard awareness 
and risk assessments, we expect to see 
reductions in TRIR during 2023. We plan 
to conduct relevant benchmarking in 2023 
on our injury rates, and TRIR will form part 
of the safety scorecard metric in the 
bonus calculation. 
Process safety 
Process safety is the application of 
engineering and management principles, 
guidelines, and tools to the identification, 
assessment, and control of the risks 
associated with the release of hazardous 
materials during the design, operation, 
and maintenance of our industrial 
processes. The goal of our process safety 
is to prevent or mitigate the consequences 
of accidental releases of hazardous 
materials, which can include chemical 
spills, explosions, and fires.
Our Group-wide Process Safety Policy 
focuses on how we identify and manage 
process risk to protect our people, assets, 
the environment, and the communities 
in which we operate. It reflects our 
commitment to reducing the potential for 
a major accident, through the application 
of improved plant and process controls, 
and the training and awareness of 
our people. 
During 2022, we embedded process 
safety across the Generation business 
and continued the journey of integration 
across our Pellet Production business. 
Our process safety principles are in line 
with industry good practice and focus 
on controls of plant, process and people. 
A new process safety dashboard was 
delivered in 2022, giving management 
and operations teams visibility of 
process safety compliance against targets. 
As part of continuous improvement, 
we will update and adapt this during 2023 
to reflect best practice. We aim to improve 
and consolidate our process safety 
measures by adopting a multifaceted 
approach to the scoring that highlights 
and prioritises improvement areas. 
Process safety performance is reported 
monthly to the Executive Committee. 
We expect that all process safety incidents 
with high potential are routinely 
investigated to establish root causes and 
enable corrective actions. The actions 
focus on preventing reoccurrence and 
we share the lessons learned across 
the Group.

Strategic report
With the support of an external specialist, 
we increased the number of colleagues 
in the UK trained as mental health 
first aiders, enabling appropriate 
representation for each UK business area. 
This has ensured these colleagues are 
able to provide support to the rest of the 
workforce. We have also continued our 
work to understand the appropriate 
offering for our North American colleagues. 
We are aiming to build on the energy and 
enthusiasm of our existing mental health 
first aiders to act as wellbeing advocates 
across our organisation, to support our 
wellbeing strategy.
Colleague representation 
and engagement
Engaging with our colleagues is a priority 
and starts with listening to, and better 
understanding, their views. Established 
in 2019, our My Voice Forums (MVFs) are 
a valuable way for the Board and senior 
management to undertake such 
engagement. The MVFs are made up 
of colleague members from each part of 
our business, to ensure representation 
for every function. A member of the 
Exectuive Committee and an HR 
representative support these forums and 
attend each meeting. The MVF chairs 
meet quarterly with the Chair of the Board 
of Directors and the CEO to discuss 
colleague sentiment and to provide 
feedback on key topics. You can read more 
about such Board-level engagement with 
the MVFs on page 109. 
We regularly survey our colleagues to 
understand levels of engagement and 
inclusion, which helps us understand 
progress or areas of challenge in making 
Drax an inclusive and positive place 
to work. Our inclusion index is also one 
of the key metrics on our Scorecard – 
see page 147 for more information. 
Based on the findings from our annual 
survey undertaken in October 2021, our 
engagement and inclusion scores have 
improved compared to 2021. The 2021 
engagement survey highlighted 
that leading change, our social and 
environmental commitment, and providing 
opportunities for careers and development 
are what matter most to our colleagues. 
In 2022, our survey results showed that 
good progress has been made on leading 
change on and careers and development. 
However, there is more work to do to help 
build colleague understanding around our 
social and environmental commitments. 
This will be addressed through our 
community strategy and our work to 
improve transparency and reporting on 
our biomass sourcing.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) 
We are committed to a supportive, diverse 
and inclusive working environment, where 
employees can be themselves. Genuine 
inclusion that is reflected in the attitudes 
of those people within the organisation to 
being open to accepting, respecting and 
collaborating with people whose ideas and 
backgrounds differ from their own, drives 
diversity, which drives innovation. As the 
Group grows and increases our global 
footprint, we draw on the culture and 
heritage of the communities and countries 
where we operate. This supports our 
business for future growth and delivers 
on our purpose: to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future.
For additional health and safety 
performance data, see our 
ESG data supplement 
 
Wellbeing
We have given increased attention 
and resources to colleague wellbeing 
and our strategy includes support through 
our benefits, employee assistance 
programmes, manager and leader 
education, and mental health first aiders. 
We have a wide-ranging communication 
programme to help raise awareness and 
educate colleagues about the support 
available to them, including our Living Well 
newsletter and on-site events. In the UK, 
we held wellbeing fairs for the first time 
in November, giving colleagues the 
opportunity to interact with benefit 
providers first-hand.
With many colleagues feeling the impact 
of the rising cost of living, we introduced 
a new financial wellbeing partner, nudge. 
As well as providing personalised online 
financial wellbeing hints and tips, nudge 
worked with us to provide seminars 
covering topics including how to navigate 
the cost of living crisis. In 2023, we will 
continue to work closely with this provider 
to offer ongoing support to colleagues. 
We know that wellbeing is closely 
interlinked with inclusion. To create an 
inclusive environment, our wellbeing and 
inclusion strategies are closely aligned. 
Both are delivered through colleague 
events (both in-person and online) and 
internal communications (such as 
newsletters) to encourage colleagues 
to take part in awareness sessions 
and discussions. 
Building psychological safety, where 
colleagues feel comfortable to talk about 
difficult topics, has also been a key priority 
during 2022. Through communications 
and events, we tackled sensitive subjects, 
including menopause, male mental health, 
and testicular and prostate cancer.

Community and charity
At Drax, we care about being a socially 
responsible business. By making a positive 
contribution to the communities in which 
we operate, and by supporting good 
causes, our intention is to play a part in 
helping to shape a better future for people 
living in areas which have a connection 
with one of our businesses.
As part of that work, we deliver charitable 
donations and employee volunteering 
initiatives. In 2022, Drax UK employees 
gave £14,422 and Drax UK gave £592,372 
in donations, including through employee 
match funding, payroll giving, our 
community fund, community partnerships 
and fundraising days. 
We offer employee volunteering days, 
providing one day of paid time per year 
to take part in volunteering activities. 
In 2022, 59 volunteering days were 
completed across Drax Group. Examples 
of employee volunteering included 
supporting primary schools, vaccine 
clinics, and refugee centres.
Drax and Selby College regularly 
host Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Maths (STEM) 
events to inspire young people to 
enter careers in STEM. In 2022, over 
170 Year 9 pupils from four different 
local schools took part in a range of 
fun and engaging STEM activities, 
introducing them to future skills, 
training, and employment 
opportunities. The event engaged 
analysts and engineers from Drax’s 
graduate and apprenticeship 
schemes to lead some of the 
sessions, as a way to inspire the next 
generation and show them the 
career opportunities available 
to them.
Our My Voice Survey gives an insight into 
DE&I at Drax, and our Inclusion Index in 
2022 was 80% – a 3% increase from 2021.
Our key activities in 2022 included 
the following:
• We focused on building an experienced 
DE&I team to drive our progress. 
The team undertook a review of our 
DE&I interventions globally and used 
this to enhance our DE&I strategy.
• We built the foundations for the launch 
of our four Colleague Resource Groups 
(CRGs) planned for 2023. Our CRGs will 
be a space for colleagues who are 
passionate about inclusion to support 
our inclusion goals, and for colleagues 
from marginalised communities to 
come together. 
• We continued to roll-out our Inclusive 
Management Programme for managers. 
The programme uses immersive learning 
to build manager capability around 
inclusion, from understanding bias 
to having challenging conversations. 
By the end of 2022, over 180 managers 
had attended the programme, which is 
being rolled out to North America in 
2023. Alongside this, we also launched 
our global ‘We Belong’ e-learning 
programme for all colleagues.
• In November 2022, we sponsored the 
POWERful Women Conference, focused 
on how the energy sector can build 
inclusive cultures and deliver on 
diversity goals. Twelve female 
colleagues from across Drax attended 
the conference and brought those 
learnings back to their own roles. 
Our partnership with POWERful 
Women has also seen us involved in 
their campaign to widen participation of 
women in the energy sector, and several 
colleagues from Drax will be featured 
in this campaign in early 2023. This is 
an important issue for Drax, and we 
support the aim to encourage more 
women to consider a career in energy.
• In 2022 we refreshed our self-
identification project ‘Count Me In’. 
The purpose of ‘Count Me In’ is to gain 
greater insight to the demographics of 
our colleagues, so we can make more 
informed and strategic decisions. By the 
end of 2022, 71% of our colleagues had 
completed the ‘Count Me In’ survey, 
and we will continue to take action 
to improve this.

Levelling up and social mobility
Drax is at the forefront of bringing 
opportunities and growth to Yorkshire and 
the Humber – helping to work to a goal 
of creating thousands of jobs. Our most 
recent report, ‘Capturing Carbon at Drax: 
Delivering jobs, clean growth and levelling 
up the Humber’, shows how the Humber 
region could be the cornerstone of a green 
economic recovery by creating and 
supporting thousands of jobs.
• We are partnering with Selby College 
to develop the UK’s first educational 
programme in carbon capture. 
• We are part of the Zero Carbon 
Skills Taskforce. 
• We are a signatory to the Social Mobility 
Pledge, committing to social mobility 
through outreach, access and 
recruitment.
Development and training 
We are committed to developing new 
talent, providing our colleagues with the 
skills and capabilities to support them in 
fulfilling their career aspirations. In 2022, 
we delivered 2,352 total colleague training 
hours, and 12,415 digital learning hours 
using a blended learning approach. 
We have a proud history of investing 
in new talent by providing internships, 
graduate programmes, work experience 
and apprenticeships – our longest-running 
apprenticeship schemes at Drax Power 
Station were established almost twenty 
years ago. Since 2006 we have hired 186 
apprentices in total and have held a 91% 
retention rate of apprentices completing 
the programme (compared to a national 
acerage of 57.5% in 2020/2021). Currently, 
in the UK we have 54 apprentices with 
another 63 colleagues working on 
apprenticeship qualifications in the 
business. We also have placements 
for interns and graduates. 
In 2022, we launched our Senior 
Leadership Development offering, 
with 88 Senior Leaders who participated 
in 2022. Our senior leaders continue 
to participate in our Inclusive Leadership 
Programme, which supports managers 
in helping to improve diversity outcomes, 
and the course received 91% satisfaction 
feedback. We plan to expand our Inclusive 
Leadership Development programme 
in 2023 with participation by colleagues

Being a good neighbour
Drax strives to be a good neighbour 
and is committed to playing a positive role 
in the communities in which it operates. 
Drax does this through a combination 
of community outreach initiatives 
and grant funding for local projects 
and programmes. 
In 2022, Drax Group donated £843,561 
to support 225 community initiatives (this 
includes the Drax UK figure of £592,372 
on the previous page). For example, in the 
US we donated $10,000 to environmental 
group Ouachita Green in Louisiana to 
support community improvement efforts 
in Ouachita Parish, close to our Monroe 
office. This donation supported projects 
such as planting oak trees to replace those 
damaged in storms. 
In the UK, Drax Power Station donated 
£15,125 to Selby High School as part of 
a five-year programme to supply laptops 
to each annual intake of Year 7 pupils from 
low-income families. The pupils are able 
to use the laptops throughout their time 
at the school, increasing their access to 
technology to support their learning. 
In Scotland, we have been supporting the 
Galloway Glens Landscape Partnership 
in and around the Water of Ken and River 
Dee. This project aims to connect people 
to their heritage and support modern, 
rural communities close to our Galloway 
Hydro Scheme to secure a prosperous 
future. For example, we conduct and 
participate in nature-related research trials 
and restoration projects, and support 
community events. 
We have included a community section 
within the newly developed ESG 
dashboard. It measures our engagement 
with the community and will be used to 
evaluate our progress. In 2023, we intend 
to launch the new Drax Foundation 
to invest in our communities through 
multi-year funding for non-profit 
organisations. These organisations 
will deliver improved access to STEM 
education, skills development for 
underserved communities, or benefit the 
natural environment. We expect to work 
collaboratively with representatives from 
our local communities to create Action 
and Engagement Plans, to ensure we are 
listening and responding to local needs. 
You can read more about the Foundation 
on page 32. 
comply with the Drax Group Supplier 
Code of Conduct (covering issues such as 
human rights, modern slavery, anti-bribery 
and corruption and financial crime) and 
our sustainability requirements. 
A breach of these obligations can, 
if not corrected in a satisfactory manner, 
lead to the termination or suspension 
of a relationship. 
We also commission independent risk 
reports to help us identify risks and 
establish mitigations that we can 
incorporate into our supply contracts. 
Beyond this, we are further developing 
our engagement with our pellet suppliers 
to Drax Power Station. These activities 
will include:
• Development of a supplier risk 
assessment
• Design and implementation of supplier 
scorecards
• Regular visits to each supplier’s 
operational sites, and catch-up 
video calls
• Hosting webinars, open days, site tours, 
training and networking events
• Active participation in industry 
conferences and events
Ethics and integrity 
At Drax, we are committed to conducting 
business ethically, with honesty and 
integrity, and in compliance with relevant 
laws and regulations. We do not tolerate 
any form of bribery, corruption, human 
rights abuse, or other unethical business 
conduct.
Governance of Ethics and 
Business Conduct
Everybody at Drax is personally 
responsible for ethical business conduct. 
Managers are responsible for 
demonstrating leadership on ethical 
matters and supporting their teams 
to apply our ethical principles.
Engagement with our suppliers
Our Buying teams and the Responsible 
Sourcing team manage our engagement 
with pellet suppliers to Drax Power 
Station. They work closely with the 
Industry Frameworks and Supply Chain 
Compliance and Business Ethics internal 
teams at Drax. 
The Responsible Sourcing team’s first 
line of engagement for biomass suppliers 
is through our Sustainability Data System. 
This questionnaire-based system assesses 
the risks associated with suppliers based 
on their answers. For most of our pellet 
suppliers at Drax Power Station, 
we also use Sustainable Biomass Program 
(SBP) certification (97% of volume in 2022 
was SBP-compliant). This helps ensure the 
biomass we receive at Drax Power Station 
meets our requirements. For non-SBP 
wood pellet suppliers to Drax, we appoint 
third-party auditors. All biomass contracts 
supplying to Drax Power Station must

team
Our Business Ethics team takes steps 
to understand our risk profile. The team 
also works on developing, deploying, 
and maintaining the associated policies, 
procedures, awareness raising 
communications and training materials. 
In addition, the team monitors and 
evaluates compliance and investigates 
potential breaches of policy. Our Internal 
Audit function provides assurance 
on the robustness of our programmes. 
Our Anti Bribery and Corruption 
programme was the most recent to be 
audited (in September 2022).
Business Ethics Documentation 
Framework
Our business ethics documentation 
framework consists of principles, policies, 
and guidance. 
Drax Code of Conduct
The principles are set out in our Drax Code 
of Conduct (Drax Code), which outlines 
our approach of ‘doing the right thing’, and 
identifies the behaviours expected from 
employees and contractors on a broad 
range of topics, such as ethical behaviour, 
health and safety, and whistleblowing. 
The importance of complying with policies 
and guidance is integral to the Drax Code, 
which includes a series of embedded 
training videos. The consequence of failing 
to comply with the Drax Code is clearly 
articulated in the Code itself.
Business Ethics policies and guidance
Our business ethics policies and guidance 
relate to:
• Anti-Bribery and Corruption
• Anti-fraud
• Corporate Criminal Offences 
(Anti-facilitation of Tax Evasion)
• Fair Competition
• Financial and Trade Sanctions
• Human Rights
• Privacy 
• Speak Up (Whistleblowing)
We reviewed each of these policies 
and the Drax Code in 2022.
A series of guides support the above 
policies. Some of these guides are 
subject-specific (for example, Fair 
Competition), others span multiple policies 
(for example, Ethical Due Diligence).
In 2022, the Drax Code, Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Policy, Privacy Policy 
(and training), and a guide summarising 
all Business Ethics policies were deployed 
as mandatory reading to colleagues in 
Canada. This formed part of wider 
integration activities into the Drax Group 
Policy Framework. Other Group colleagues 
received annual eLearning refreshers 
on the Drax Code and Privacy. Additional 
training to certain ‘at higher risk teams’ 
was also provided throughout the year 
on other Business Ethics related topics.
As a result of our expansion and opening 
an office in Japan, integration planning 
activities for Drax Asia also commenced 
in 2022, with an employee handbook 
to be developed in 2023.
Drax Supplier Code
Our Supplier Code sets out the 
commitments and standards we expect 
from our third parties, and any 
subcontractors they use, in relation to 
working for Drax. The Supplier Code, 
which was reviewed and updated in 2022, 
includes details of how any third party 
can ‘speak up’ about a concern over 
non-compliance with the Supplier Code. 
During 2022, we continued to roll out our 
Supplier Code to relevant third-party 
suppliers, incorporating it into the 
associated contracts by means of specific 
business ethics clauses (including a 
termination clause for serious breach).
We take a risk-based approach to ethical 
due diligence, with appropriate suppliers 
being subject to the relevant checks prior 
to on-boarding. Our due diligence system 
enables the continual monitoring 
(i.e., in relation to international sanctions, 
regulatory enforcement action and 
as relevant, negative media) of suppliers 
during contract lifecycle. When 
concerning alerts are raised, they are 
investigated and, where appropriate, 
escalated to the Ethics Business Conduct 
Committee (EBCC) for consideration.

Business Ethics programmes
Supply Chain Human Rights (SCHR)
Drax has been a signatory of the UN 
Global Compact (UNGC) for five years and 
has embedded the ten principles of the 
Compact through our policies, culture, and 
ways of working. We also participate in the 
UNGC’s Modern Slavery Working Group. 
We set out our human rights 
commitments in our Human Rights policy, 
the Drax Code, and our Supplier Code. 
Our Human Rights policy and codes are 
publicly available. 
We have a long established cross-
departmental SCHR Working Group, 
which reports quarterly to the EBCC. 
You can find more detail about the 
activities of the Working Group in our 
Modern Slavery Statements.
Anti-Bribery and corruption (ABC)
We have a zero-tolerance approach 
to bribery and corruption. Our ABC 
programme is based on ‘Adequate 
Procedures’ guidance published by the 
UK Ministry of Justice and the EBCC 
oversees it (along with all other business 
ethics programmes). In 2022, our ABC 
programme was subject to internal audit, 
with controls deemed to be appropriate 
and working effectively to manage risks. 
This aligned to the internal risk assessment 
that was conducted in 2022. In 2023, 
we will be focused on addressing the due 
diligence related recommendations 
from the audit.
Fair competition
We are committed to conducting our 
business in accordance with all applicable 
fair competition laws and have adopted 
a zero-tolerance approach to any anti-
competitive behaviour or activity. Our Fair 
Competition programme now covers UK 
competition law, US anti-trust law and 
Canadian laws, and includes mandatory 
e-learning for ‘at higher risk’ teams. During 
2022 we engaged lawyers to provide an 
external risk assessment of the 
programme which they deemed as 
satisfactory (‘green’ traffic light rating). 
Data privacy and security
The Data Protection team manages our 
Privacy programme. We take seriously the 
privacy and security of the personal data 
we control, working closely with our 
people, customers and third parties.
In 2022, the Data Protection team 
completed the annual review of policies 
and notices to confirm they remain in line 
with prevailing legal and regulatory 
requirements. The updates encompassed 
new jurisdictions where the group 
operates (i.e., Canada and Japan).
New system improvements were 
implemented to third-party onboarding 
for Data Protection and Information 
Security Due Diligence in the UK, 
with plans to roll out across other 
jurisdictions in 2023. These changes 
provide that contract assessments take 
place on the inclusion of the correct 
clauses supplied to the Procurement team. 
Other improvements include refresher 
training on data protection topics, 
improved working practices with the 
security function, and continued education 
within the Data Protection team.
Data Protection investigations into 
potential data breaches were investigated 
in a timely manner, with good support 
from operation teams. In some cases, 
timely resolution included sending a 
notification to relevant authorities 
if necessary (such as the Information 
Commissioners Office).
Individual rights requests from customers 
and employees were processed within 
required timescales, along with requests 
made by appropriate authorities 
(such as the Police).
Speak Up (whistleblowing)
We are committed to transparency, 
openness, and continuous improvement. 
We encourage those working for and 
on behalf of Drax, and our third parties, 
to raise genuine concerns (via our 
reporting channels) about practices that 
could breach laws, regulations, or our 
own ethical standards. 
Drax has a zero tolerance of retaliation or 
victimisation. We have processes in place 
to apply appropriate consequences should 
an individual retaliate against, or victimise, 
a reporter in any way. 
Of the reports raised (or carried over 
and closed out) in 2022 and considered 
by the Board, several related to safety 
standards and practices. Concerns were 
also raised about inclusivity and standards 
of behaviour. 
The Board sought action by management 
to address the matters raised, where 
substantiated, in addition to an 
assessment of the underlying causes. 
This involved Non-Executive Directors 
participating in additional discussions 
with management on potential initiatives 
and programmes.
Four matters raised in 2022 remain under 
investigation at the time of this report.
For more information, please see the 
Corporate Governance section 
on page 100.
Corporate Criminal Offences (CCO) 
(Anti-facilitation of Tax Evasion)
Our ethical due diligence and payment 
procedures have been set up to facilitate 
the conduct of business which is compliant 
with applicable tax laws. These procedures 
are subject to regular internal audit. 
In 2022, we aligned our documentation 
for Canadian colleagues. 
Financial and trade sanctions
Our ethical due diligence and contracting 
processes include the consideration 
of financial and trade sanctions risk. 
Risk-based monitoring of counterparties 
is also in place. An assessment of the 
Financial and Trade Sanctions policy 
programme in the second quarter of 2022 
found the controls to be appropriate and 
working effectively. 
There was heightened sanctions-related 
activity in 2022 due to the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine. The Financial and 
Trade Sanctions policy, coupled with the 
work of our Business Ethics and Legal 
teams, supported an effective response.

Viability statement
The assessment of viability was led 
by the CEO and CFO, in conjunction 
with management teams, and presented 
to the Board as part of the annual planning 
process. In reviewing this assessment, 
the Board considered the principal risks 
faced by the Group, financial forecasts 
and sensitivities, availability of funding 
and the strength of the Group’s control 
environment. Detail was also provided 
on longer-term risks.
Assessment period
The Board determined to conduct this 
assessment over a period of five years 
(2021: five years) considering:
• The Group’s Business Plan (the Plan) 
which is prepared annually, updated 
three times during the year and used 
for strategic decision-making, includes 
a range of financial forecasts and 
associated sensitivity analysis. 
This Plan covers a one-year period in 
detail, before extending into the medium 
term. Five years is considered to be 
an appropriate mid-point in this range, 
when considering length of forecast 
and expected accuracy over the 
forecast period and this time period 
receives specific focus from the Board.
• Within the forecast period, liquid 
commodity market curves and 
established contract positions are used. 
Liquid curves typically cover a one to 
two-year window and contracted fuel 
commitments with third parties extend 
out to five years. The Group’s foreign 
exchange exposure is actively hedged 
over a rolling five-year period. Selecting 
a five-year period balances short-term 
market liquidity whilst including 
medium-term contractual positions.
• The Group benefits from the stable and 
material earnings stream available from 
current subsidies until 31 March 2027. 
In the period beyond current subsidies 
the viability modelling assumes that Drax 
Power Station runs on a merchant basis. 
• A significant proportion of the Group’s 
debt facilities mature in this period, with 
91% maturing in the five-year window.
• There is limited certainty around the 
Group’s markets and regulatory regimes. 
However, the Board has assumed no 
material changes to the medium-term 
regulatory environment and associated 
support regimes beyond those already 
announced at the date of this report.
The business considers longer-term 
forecasts for other purposes, including 
value in use analyses and estimates of 
useful economic lives, in line with the 
requirements of accounting standards and 
as set out in note 2.4 to the Consolidated 
financial statements.
Review of principal risks 
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, set out in detail on pages 77 
to 91 have been considered over the 
viability assessment period. The risks 
were evaluated, where possible, to assess 
the potential impact of each on the 
viability of the Group, should that risk arise 
unmitigated. The impacts were included, 
where appropriate, as sensitivities to the 
Plan and considered by the Board as part 
of the approval process.
The Group has a proven record of rapidly 
adapting to changes in its environment 
and deploying innovative solutions 
to protect its financial performance. 
Previous adverse events have arisen 
and provided challenges which tested 
the ability of the Group to deliver on its 
targets but, on each occasion, it has been 
able to respond positively. 
Relevant principal risks
The principal risks with the potential to 
exert significant influence on viability are 
considered to be: trading and commodity, 
political and regulatory, biomass 
acceptability and plant operations 
A significant adverse change to the status 
of each risk has the potential to place 
material financial stress on the Group. 
As described on pages 77 to 91, some 
of these risks have increased during 2022, 
as market conditions and commodity 
prices have continued to be highly volatile.
A summary of the scenarios modelled 
can be seen below. In addition to modelling 
the impacts on a standalone basis, 
severe but plausible scenarios that 
included a combination of unforeseen 
plant outages, adverse movements 
in commodity prices and reductions 
in subsidy income were considered.
As part of its review of principal risks and 
uncertainties, the Group considered risks 
related to climate change. This review 
concluded that such matters remained 
low risk to the Group over the period that 
viability has been assessed. In particular, 
the work performed over climate related 
risks, as part of the TCFD process (see 
page 52), and in our impairment analysis, 
suggests that climate change does not 
currently present a significant threat to 
viability on a net basis, notwithstanding 
the changes noticed by the business in 
weather patterns, as noted in the review 
of principal risks on page 77. 
The most likely way in which climate 
change risks could manifest is through 
a failure in plant operations, either 
in the Pellet Production or Generation 
businesses. The impact of these scenarios 
is included in the analysis as noted in the 
table below and further information 
is contained within note 3.8 of the 
financial statements.
The outcomes of this analysis indicated 
that the Group would be able to withstand 
these scenarios without compromising 
upon its ability to meet liabilities as they 
fall due. This is further considered in the 
‘Review of financial forecasts’ 
section below.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Group over a period significantly longer than the 12 months 
required by the going concern provision.

Consideration of other risks
The remaining principal risks, including 
transitional impacts of climate change, 
were considered and were not deemed to 
present a significant threat to viability over 
the assessment period. The impact of 
increased expenditure or a loss of margin 
as a result of one of these risks (e.g. a 
cyber attack resulting in disruption to 
planned generation) can be inferred from 
the scenarios already modelled.
If the Group is not successful in achieving 
its strategic aims, then this could pose 
a threat in the longer-term. However, 
analysis of this risk suggests that this 
would materialise beyond the assessment 
period, and therefore consideration 
has been presented in the longer-term 
risks section below.
Longer-term risks
Considering a time horizon extending 
beyond the viability assessment period, 
the two principal risks which are believed 
to be most significant are climate change 
and strategy.
Climate change could have a physical 
impact via an increase in the frequency 
of extreme weather events, leading 
to sustained reduced profitability for the 
Group because of supply chain disruptions. 
In addition, as the speed of transition 
to lower-carbon/net-zero increases there 
is a risk that new policies and regulation 
impact the Group’s operations or plans. 
However, climate change also provides 
companies with an opportunity. For more 
information on climate-related risks and 
opportunities, please read the TCFD 
section on page 52.
Failure to deliver on our strategic 
objectives could also pose a threat 
to the Group over the longer term. 
The achievement of these objectives 
is forecast in the period beyond the 
assessment period. The models used to 
assess viability are based on the analysis 
required by IAS 36, and therefore exclude 
enhancement capital expenditure and 
the associated cash inflows. An example 
of such inflows and expenditure is for 
future BECCS projects. 
If returns achieved from strategic 
initiatives were significantly below 
forecasts then, given the level of capital 
expenditure required to complete the 
plans, this could present a risk to the 
Group. However, a detailed analysis of the 
returns achievable, including reasonably 
possible downside scenarios and potential 
impacts on viability, would be performed 
ahead of any final commitment by the 
Board to progress each initiative, in line 
with our long-standing disciplined 
approach to capital allocation.
Review of financial forecasts
The Plan considers the Group’s financial 
position, performance, cash flows, credit 
metrics and other key financial ratios and 
was most recently updated to reflect 
current market and external environment 
conditions in January 2023. It is built by 
business unit and includes growth 
assumptions appropriate to the markets 
each business serves. Climate change 
is also factored into these forecasts, as, 
for example, forecast future energy prices 
are based on decarbonisation targets 
committed to by the UK Government.
The Plan includes assumptions, the most 
material of which relate to commodity 
market prices and levels of subsidy 
support available through the generation 
of biomass-fuelled renewable power. 
It is underpinned by the earnings of the 
biomass generation units, albeit these 
reduce in the model at the end of current 
subsidies in early 2027. The impact of 
the Energy Generator Levy announced 
in November 2022 has been considered 
when preparing financial forecasts 
and sensitivities.
The Plan is subject to stress testing, 
which involves the construction of 
reasonably foreseeable scenarios, 
including those aligned to the principal 
risks (described above) which test the 
robustness of the Plan when key variables 
are flexed both individually and in unison. 
Where such a scenario suggests a risk to 
viability, the availability and quantum of 
mitigating actions is considered.
As part of stress-testing the Plan, 
a ‘severe but plausible’ scenario was 
constructed and assessed. Rather than 
a single event, the Board considers the 
most significant downside scenario that 
could reasonably arise in the assessment 
period to be an aggregation of incidents 
either in a short timeframe or repeatedly 
during the period. Further detail is 
contained within the ‘Relevant principal 
risks’ section above.
The severe but plausible case considered 
the impact on earnings, cash flow and net 
leverage resulting from incidents including 
unexpected generation (+10% increase 
in biomass forced outage rate) and pellet 
production outages, adverse movements 
in commodity prices and a loss of ROC 
income during the period. Whilst the 
outcomes from this scenario were 
significant, they indicated that the Group 
should continue to operate within the 
covenant restrictions of its financing 
arrangements and would have sufficient 
cash to meet its liabilities as they fall due. 
The final column of the scenarios table 
indicates the scale of the impacts.
Potential mitigating actions were also 
considered. Such mitigating actions 
included potentially reducing levels 
of capital expenditure and dividend 
payments if required. The impact would 
also be partially mitigated through the 
Group’s ability to trade effectively in 
volatile markets, use of existing committed 
facilities, the Group’s insurance 
arrangements and reductions in 
other expenditure. 
Availability of adequate funding
The Group’s current borrowings are set 
out in note 4.2 (page 224). The Board 
expects these facilities, along with cash 
flows generated, to provide adequate 
levels of funding to support the execution 
of the Group’s Plan.
Facilities totalling c. £1.2 billion, excluding 
RCFs, mature during the assessment 
period. The base viability assessment 
assumes that these are repaid as they 
fall due or prior to that, predicated on no 
strategic enhancement expenditure being 
included in the model, as discussed above. 
In the severe but plausible case the 
facilities are forecast to be extended based 
on expected rates achievable in the 
current environment. 
At 31 December 2022 the Group had 
total cash and committed facilities of 
£698 million, see note 2.7 on page 208. 
The Plan demonstrates that the Group 
expects to operate within its current 
committed facilities for the duration 
of the assessment period under a range 
of scenarios.
The Board is confident that the Group 
has access to a range of options to 
maintain a diverse and well-balanced 
capital structure.
Expectations
Based on its review, the Board is satisfied 
that viability would be preserved in a range 
of scenarios, with various mitigating 
actions available to manage the risk, 
should they be required.
Taking all of the above into account, 
the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the five-year period 
of their assessment.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The effective management 
of risk supports the delivery 
of our strategy 
Identifying, assessing, and managing risks 
across the Group is an integral part of 
enabling an informed assessment of the 
potential challenges in the delivery of 
our strategy. The Board is responsible 
for determining risk appetite and ensuring 
the effectiveness of risk management 
and internal controls across the Group. 
The Group has a comprehensive system 
of governance controls to identify and 
manage all key risks in accordance with 
policies and processes approved by 
the Board.
Risk appetite
The risk appetite is the level of risk that the 
Group is prepared to tolerate in seeking to 
realise its business objectives. The Board 
determines the risk appetite of the Group 
to ensure the potential impact of both 
current and emerging risks is considered 
and appropriately managed, to increase 
the likelihood that the Group’s business 
objectives can be achieved, whilst seeking 
to minimise the threat of adverse impact to 
the financial and operational performance 
and the prospects of the Group. 
Risk appetite therefore informs the 
expected behaviours from our Board, 
senior executives, colleagues, contractors, 
and partners. This helps in determining the 
investment likely to be required to support 
risk management activities and an 
appropriate risk-balanced approach to 
carrying out our plans. Risk appetite can 
vary depending on the nature of the risk, 
the expected impact of that risk, the 
extent to which the risk is foreseeable 
and the potential benefits to the Group 
and its stakeholders. 
Some parts of the Group’s operations 
reflect high inherent risk while also 
providing the opportunity for potential 
commercial gain. For example, trading 
in commodities, where the Group 
has developed a commercial strategy 
that is designed to manage the Group’s 
exposure to volatility in commodity prices 
whilst also reflecting the Group’s risk 
appetite in this area. We deploy forward 
hedging strategies which seek to 
manage the volatility of commodity prices 
to help limit the Group’s exposure to the 
uncertainty of future adverse swings 
in commodity prices, whilst also 
acknowledging that this same market 
volatility provides an opportunity for 
financial returns. This is an area of risk 
which experienced material change 
in 2022 and we explore the issues 
and challenges associated with this risk 
on page 87.
The risk management approach reduces, 
rather than eliminates, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and provides 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
For example, in recent years the business 
has become increasingly aware of changes 
in weather patterns which, alongside other 
climate-related risks, have become more 
impactful on our business. As a result, 
we continue to recognise a Climate 
Change Principal Risk. Through our 
analysis of the underlying climate risks, 
we seek to identify material challenges 
to the business which might arise and 
consider how we should respond to both 
physical and transitional climate risks. 
In so doing we seek to better understand 
the emerging and potential future threats 
against the resilience of our business 
and operations to reduce the adverse 
impact which might arise for our people, 
our assets, our ability to operate day to day 
and our financial performance. 
Risks are assessed on a gross basis, 
a net basis after mitigating controls have 
been considered, and a target risk level 
reflective of the Group’s risk appetite.

Risk management governance
The risk management governance 
structure includes the Executive 
Committee (from which owners are 
identified to be accountable for each 
Principal Risk) and the Group’s risk 
management committees who have 
responsibility for:
• Regularly assessing and understanding 
the risks that may impact our business 
to ensure any new, current or emerging 
risks are managed within the defined 
risk appetite and limits of the business.
• Reviewing changes in the internal 
business and external macro environment 
and responding appropriately.
• Driving completion of the actions 
required to improve the mitigation 
of risks and where possible reduce risk 
exposures to target levels.
• Driving an appropriate risk management 
culture that promotes and creates 
balanced risk-taking behaviour and 
clear accountability.
• Demonstrating robust governance 
of risk management by reviewing 
and challenging risk management 
across the Group.
In line with good governance, the risk 
management committees at the business 
unit and Group function level undertake 
regular reviews of operational and financial 
risks, receiving reports from subject matter 
specialists and risk owners reflecting 
their technical knowledge. The Executive 
Committee undertakes deep-dive reviews 
of all the Principal Risks through an annual 
cycle and receives reports from the risk 
management committees and Principal 
Risk owners. Under the guidance and 
challenge of the Audit Committee, 
management undertake a process that 
targets continuous improvement with 
regards to risk management including 
a quarterly update being provided at each 
Audit Committee meeting on proposed 
enhancements. During 2022, as part 
of their annual internal audit plan, 
KPMG completed a maturity assessment 
of the Group’s risk management 
framework as a result of which no 
high priority actions were identified.
Drax Group’s

Process
Identification 
Senior leadership and risk owners 
are collectively responsible for the 
identification of risks with the potential 
to threaten the achievement of 
strategic objectives.
Assessment
Senior leadership and risk owners 
assess likelihood and possible impact 
of risks occurring using the Group’s risk 
scoring methodology.
They also seek to ensure appropriate 
mitigating controls are in place to 
manage identified risks to an acceptable 
level aligned to risk appetite and 
target risk.
Governance
Risk management committees 
undertake regular risk reviews and 
receive reports from business units and 
risk owners reflecting their specialist 
areas and technical knowledge.
Monitoring and Reporting
The Executive Committee undertake 
deep-dive reviews of each Principal Risk 
on an annual cycle and receive reports 
from the risk management committees 
and Principal Risk owners.
The Audit Committee and the Board 
review the suitability and effectiveness 
of risk management processes and 
controls. They also review and challenge 
the proposed disclosures prepared 
by management on risks to consider 
whether they are fair, balanced and 
understandable, provide adequate links 
to the Group’s strategy (and the ability 
to realise objectives over the near and 
longer term) and reflect adequately 
wider macro and emerging threats.

Group approach to risk management
The Group has a Risk Management Policy, approved  
by the Board, which defines its approach to risk 
management. The key elements of the policy are  
detailed in the diagram below:

Principal risks and uncertainties  
continued
Emerging Risks
In addition to these reviews, risk owners, 
risk management committees, the 
Executive Committee, and the Board 
undertake holistic reviews to identify 
emerging risks and consider the 
appropriate response. This involves 
judgement and is undertaken through 
gathering the views of key internal 
stakeholders including the Executive 
Committee and Board members who 
bring to bear significant levels of technical 
knowledge, industry experience and 
economic awareness. Where appropriate, 
this may also involve the views of external 
experts or stakeholders. For example a 
review of the Group’s physical climate risks 
was undertaken by Atkins, a third party 
consultant, during the year.
As a result of this, a new emerging risk 
was identified – the significant levels 
of construction which will be required 
in future periods to deliver strategic 
objectives. In addition to ongoing capital 
expenditure on the OCGT projects, and 
investment in the expansion of existing 
and new North American pellet plants, 
the business is approaching a pivotal 
point in relation to options for BECCS 
development, and the risks relating to 
physical execution are becoming more 
important. Whilst work continues to 
ensure an economic business model can 
be established for UK BECCS, as outlined 
further on pages 16 and 82, initial 
preliminary works to enable the project 
at Drax Power Station are commencing. 
This exposes the Group to new risks 
associated with the execution of a 
significant programme of work, dependent 
on supply chains, availability of skills in the 
labour market, and the other operational 
and safety risks associated with large 
scale construction. As a result, the key 
controls in operation to mitigate these 
risks are undergoing review to ensure they 
are sufficient and effective. In conjunction 
with this, the level of assurance obtained 
over the design and operation of these 
controls is also being considered. As these 
projects progress through 2023, 2024 
and 2025, and final investment decisions 
are expected to be taken, the Board 
will consider whether this represents 
a new Principal Risk to the Group. 
Internal control
The Group has a well-defined system 
of internal control, supported by policies 
and procedures, documented levels 
of delegated authority which support 
decision-making, and accountability by 
management across the Group. These 
internal controls operate as important 
mitigations of the risks identified via the 
Group’s risk management processes. 
Therefore, the effective design and 
operation of these key internal controls 
is critical to the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic aims.
Management maintain an assurance map 
assessing the level of assurance obtained 
for each of the Group’s Principal Risks 
across the various lines of defence, 
as shown on page 77. This enables the 
Audit Committee to debate and challenge 
whether sufficient assurance is in place 
over the Group’s system of internal control. 
Where a risk is identified as having 
emerged or increased, the level of 
assurance obtained over the respective 
mitigating controls may need to be 
enhanced in response. For example, 
the identification of capital construction 
as an emerging risk has led to the inclusion 
of an internal audit addressing BECCS 
readiness in the 2023 internal audit plan.
The Audit Committee approves and 
implements a programme of internal 
audits covering various aspects of the 
Group’s activities. Refer to page 126 
for further information. This programme 
evolves, based on an assessment of the 
key risks of the Group.
The majority of internal audits are 
performed by KPMG, who provide a fully 
outsourced internal audit function to the 
Group, reporting to the Audit Committee. 
For specialist areas, an expert auditor 
is employed such as the use of DNV 
to undertake internal audits in respect 
of Health and Safety. The findings and 
recommendations from each internal 
audit are distributed to members of the 
Executive Committee and the Audit 
Committee as a whole. Each report 
includes management’s responses to 
the findings and recommendations, and 
details of the actions that management 
propose to take. At each monthly meeting, 
the Executive Committee considers the 
status in responding to and closing 
recommended actions.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives 
a quarterly update report on the status 
of the internal audit plan and any recent 
findings. Internal audits are augmented 
by additional internal control checks 
which are performed by operational 
management, and which are considered 
by senior management and the 
Audit Committee.
Where weaknesses are identified, these 
are investigated and the impact on the 
business is identified, with remediation 
actions established. This is also reported to 
the Audit Committee. None of the findings 
reported during 2022 were individually 
or collectively material to the financial 
performance, results, operations, 
or controls of the business.
Based on the assessments undertaken 
by each of the Executive Committee 
and the Audit Committee during 2022, 
and considered at the meeting of the 
Board held in finalising the Annual Report 
and Accounts in February 2023, the Board 
determined that it was not aware of 
any significant deficiency or material 
weakness in the system of internal control. 
For further information on the work of the 
Audit Committee see pages 116 to 126.
On behalf of the Board, the 
Audit Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of the system 
of risk management and internal 
control. The Committee takes 
a keen interest in understanding 
the evaluation of the Group’s 
Principal Risks, to ensure 
that internal controls remain 
appropriate and that the Group’s 
overall exposure to risk aligns 
with the Board’s risk appetite.

Overall risk assessment
The Group has identified nine Principal 
Risk categories which have the potential 
to have a material adverse impact on the 
operational or financial performance 
of the Group. These and other key risks 
are assessed within an established 
programme by which management, 
the Executive Committee and the Board 
consider how risk and the Group’s ability 
to respond should evolve.
The Board continued to perform a robust 
assessment of Principal and emerging 
risks. As part of its year end processes, 
the Board considered reports from 
management reviewing the Principal Risks 
and uncertainties, and how these had 
evolved during the second half of 2022. 
This review took account of the ongoing 
Russia-Ukraine conflict, the volatility 
in the energy market and the potential 
impact on future energy strategy. Thought 
was also given to the cost of living crisis 
and associated government responses 
such as the Energy Bill Relief Scheme 
and Electricity Generator Levy, as well as 
the agreement reached with National Grid 
to make our two coal-fired units at 
Drax Power Station available to operate 
as a winter contingency until the end 
of March 2023. All of these areas are 
discussed in further detail below.
The threat of cyber-attack is evolving, 
and managing this risk requires careful 
understanding and assessment of the 
threat. Geopolitical tensions have in the 
past been known to result in increased 
cyber related incidents, and the Russia-
Ukraine conflict is considered to have 
increased the Group’s risk exposure to 
attacks, state-sanctioned or otherwise, 
on our systems. Despite the significant 
work and investment undertaken to further 
enhance security over our systems, this 
heightened external risk environment 
poses an increased cyber risk which may 
result in operational and financial impacts 
and regulatory non-compliance.
Consistent with the view communicated 
in Drax’s 2022 Half Year Report, increased 
energy prices expose the business to 
a heightened financial cost should 
an unplanned outage occur on a plant, 
as the business would incur the cost 
of a significantly heightened market price 
to buy back the volumes contracted but 
undelivered. Whilst we do not believe the 
integrity of the Group’s plant and 
machinery, and therefore the likelihood 
of an outage, has increased, the financial 
impact of such an occurrence has 
increased and could have a material 
impact on the Group’s results.
The two material increases in risk noted 
above are discussed further below under 
‘Cyber-security’ and ‘Cost of living and 
energy market conditions’. Additionally, 
the Information systems and security and 
Trading and commodity risk disclosures 
on pages 91 and 87 respectively, provide 
detailed descriptions of the risk, impact 
and key mitigations associated with 
both threats.
Despite there being some further, 
less significant, increases in the Group’s 
other Principal Risks, as discussed further 
below, the Board is satisfied that the 
Group’s remaining Principal Risks are 
materially unchanged.
Russia-Ukraine conflict
Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 
February 2022, which not only created 
a humanitarian crisis but led to extensive 
economic impacts felt across the globe, 
leading to potential risks to the business 
summarised below:
Biomass pricing and availability
The conflict is testing global supply chains 
and reinforces the importance of resilience 
in the Group’s biomass sourcing processes. 
As the volume of Russian and Belarusian 
biomass purchased by the Group has 
historically been very low, this line of 
sourcing was ceased with no significant 
impact on the Group’s ability to achieve 
required future biomass volumes. 
However, a secondary impact on the 
Group’s indirect supply chains has been 
upward global biomass pricing pressures, 
as suppliers faced increased costs to 
procure fibre due to market shortages and 
inflationary pressures. The impacts of 
higher biomass prices are largely mitigated 
by our long-term hedging strategy which 
ensures a high proportion of the contracts 
in place have agreed pricing out to 2027. 
In addition to remaining vigilant to biomass 
pricing pressure, the ability of our suppliers 
to fulfil contracted volumes continues to 
be closely monitored to respond to market 
developments, including the impact 
of fibre market shortages resulting from 
the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
Cyber-security
The Board believes the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict has increased the Group’s risk 
exposure to attacks on our systems, 
and those of suppliers on whom the Group 
relies for integrity of service. This view 
is supported by our engagement with a 
range of third parties in addition to publicly 
available information. The Group’s Security 
and IT teams have conducted a thorough 
risk assessment of our externally facing 
infrastructure and have implemented 
a robust critical patch regime as a result 
of this heightened cyber-security threat. 
The Group also has regular updates with 
its regulators which allow it to assess and 
calibrate the level of security risk. Whilst 
the Group’s response to the heightened 
risk has been robust, it is acknowledged 
that cyber-attacks are continuously 
increasing in sophistication and 
complexity, requiring constant assessment 
and response to address any vulnerabilities 
on an ongoing basis. Therefore, whilst 
actions in respect of this increasing threat 
have been undertaken, we recognise the 
scale, pace and nature of exposure also 
continues to evolve and responding 
immediately with commensurate 
mitigations may not always be possible.
Market volatility
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has also 
contributed to widespread energy market 
volatility and concerns over the security 
of supply due to the restriction of Russian 
gas. The resulting commodity price 
increases and extension of the availability 
of the Group’s coal assets are discussed 
further on pages 81, 87 and 90.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Cost of living and energy 
market conditions
During the second half of the year, 
in common with other economies, 
the UK continued to experience increased 
pressure on the cost of living due to high 
inflation. It is expected that inflation 
will continue to outstrip the increase in 
average incomes over the coming months. 
Energy market pressures also continued 
into the second half of 2022, becoming 
a more sustained energy price increase. 
In response to this, in order to provide 
support to our colleagues through this 
challenging period, we accelerated the 
Group’s annual pay review process by 
three months to take effect in January 
2023. You can read more about this on 
page 130. These economic conditions, 
as well as the UK Government’s response 
to them, create the following risks 
to the business: 
Cash collection
We recognise that the inflationary 
pressures from rising commodity prices, 
including power, are providing challenges 
to consumers and in some cases causing 
hardship. In September 2022 the 
UK Government announced the Energy 
Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS) to support 
UK businesses and other non-domestic 
energy users by protecting them from 
increasing energy costs and providing 
them with certainty over winter energy 
costs. Price caps have been applied to 
UK customer bills from 1 October 2022 
and from 1 April 2023 the EBRS will be 
replaced by the Energy Bills Discount 
Scheme (EBDS), which has been 
confirmed to be in place until March 2024.
We continue to monitor how wholesale 
power price increases are feeding through 
to end consumers in our Customers 
business. By building on the actions taken 
during the Covid-19 pandemic, we aim 
to support our customers during this 
challenging time by working to provide 
payment plans where necessary. 
We remain alert to the possibility that this 
may have an impact on our customers’ 
ability to pay their bills, resulting in a 
potential financial impact of bad debt 
or delayed payments.
Market price volatility
What initially appeared to be temporary 
energy price volatility resulting from 
short-term pressures on supply at the start 
of 2022, became a more sustained energy 
price increase. As noted on page 87, 
energy price volatility exposes the Group 
to an increased financial cost should an 
unplanned outage at Drax Power Station 
occur. We believe that this risk is most 
appropriately managed through holding 
back a proportion of capacity as a 
mitigation. This would enable energy 
contracts to be fulfilled by an alternative 
unit should an unplanned outage occur. 
Price increases in the forward market can 
also present challenges in respect of 
liquidity and credit, requiring careful 
management of both ongoing exposures 
and collateral requirements.
Continued availability of coal-fired units 
until March 2023
In July 2022 the Group confirmed that, 
at the request of the UK Government, 
it had entered into an agreement with the 
National Grid to make our two coal-fired 
units at Drax Power Station available 
to operate as a winter contingency 
to the UK power system until the end 
of March 2023. The units will only operate 
if and when we are instructed to do so 
by the National Grid. Whilst this means 
prolonging the UK’s dependence on fossil 
fuels, which is not aligned with the Group’s 
strategy, we recognise that as part of the 
UK’s critical national infrastructure, we play 
a key role in providing security of energy 
supply and take this responsibility seriously. 
Some of the Group’s facilities and 
equipment relating to coal-fired generation 
are classed as ageing assets, given Drax 
Power Station was built approximately 
50 years ago. Continued operation of these 
assets therefore brings operational risks 
in maintaining the availability of assets to 
fulfil a request to operate. The Group is also 
cognisant that the extended use of the 
coal-fired units could increase the threat 
of disruption to the Group’s operations 
and supply chain from protester action. 
Before committing to extending the 
availability of the coal-fired units, a 
thorough assessment was undertaken 
to ensure these potential risks could be 
sufficiently managed to an acceptably 
low level. In assessing whether to make 
the units available, and after careful 
consideration, it was determined that a 
six-month extension was not expected to 
impact on the timing of a final investment 
decision or intended commissioning date 
for the UK BECCS project. Site preparation 
works for UK BECCS are ongoing and will 
accelerate following formal closure of the 
coal units in March 2023.
Energy market reform
Changes to government policy 
at a regional and national level in the 
countries in which we operate may 
increase the cost to operate our 
businesses. Global economic challenges 
and volatility in commodity markets have 
created the potential for an accelerated 
timeline of political and regulatory reform, 
as governments and regulatory bodies 
seek to ensure fiscal policy and regulation, 
including regulation surrounding biomass, 
remains fit for purpose.
The UK Government has opened a 
consultation on Review of Energy Market 
Reform (REMA), however it currently 
remains unclear the scale of the impact of 
any such reform. As part of their response 
to current heightened energy prices, the 
UK Government announced an Electricity 
Generators Levy, which will apply to the 
Group’s hydro run-of-river and biomass 
generating assets under the Renewable 
Obligation scheme from 1 January 2023 
to 31 March 2028. Refer to page 13 
for further information.
Credit availability and liquidity
We are exposed to spot and forward 
commodity prices. High volatility may 
impact Drax’s ability to access the market 
as it presents challenges in respect of 
liquidity and credit. This requires careful 
management of both ongoing exposures 
and potential collateral requirements 
under a range of scenarios. This could 
result in a reduction in Drax’s forecast 
hedge levels in future years, and less 
certainty over forecast earnings.
Set out below are the Group’s nine 
Principal Risks:
• Strategic
• Health, safety and environment
• Political and regulatory
• Biomass acceptability
• Trading and commodity
• People
• Climate change
• Plant operations
• Information systems and security

Strategic risk
The Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future, with an ambition to become a carbon negative company by 
2030. The Group has three strategic aims that underpin its purpose and ambition as detailed in the Group’s business model on page 8. 
Strategic risks are defined as those that could materially undermine any of the Group’s strategic aims, and thereby prevent the Group 
from delivering its stated outcomes and fulfilling its purpose. 
In 2022 the business established a strategy execution team that monitors the delivery of strategic initiatives and mitigates risks. 
A quarterly review is undertaken by the Executive Committee to gauge its confidence in delivery and determine the actions to be taken 
should course correction or additional risk mitigation be required.
Strategic pillar: To be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets 
 
Achieving a leading position requires delivering and growing our own production, at a sustainable economic cost whilst ensuring our 
sustainability requirements are met. 
The primary objectives are to increase biomass production capacity to 8Mt p.a. and to continually improve the biomass pellet supply chain 
to maintain pellet costs at a sustainable economic level.
Risk and impact 
• There is a risk to the availability of feasible expansion 
opportunities, the successful identification and delivery 
of initiatives to reduce the current cost of biomass, 
and the availability of sustainable biomass fibre. 
• There is the risk that biomass does not have stakeholder 
support in our target markets (for example, government, 
investors, economic and social) leading to a lower rate 
of adoption than our strategic plan assumes. 
Key mitigations
• Continued execution of the integrated plan to expand biomass 
production capacity and maintain the cost of sustainable biomass pellets 
at an economically sustainable level. 
• The adoption of the development and execution of a medium 
to long-term fibre strategy as a strategic initiative.
• The identification and management of biomass acceptability 
as a Principal Risk as detailed on page 86.
Strategic pillar: To be a global leader in carbon removals
 
As a key part of our long-term strategy, Drax is developing options for Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), as a form 
of carbon removal. We believe BECCS could offer significant long-term value creation opportunities, in addition to being a key part of 
enabling not just Drax but the UK and other countries to reduce carbon emissions. To be a leader in the emerging carbon removals market, 
Drax is working to deliver the BECCS project at Drax Power Station and also deliver BECCS globally. This requires the development 
of an economically attractive business model within its target jurisdictions.
Risk and impact 
• There is a risk that current or future governments do 
not provide the fiscal and legislative framework required 
to support the scale of the BECCS programme and 
Drax’s future investment decision. This could result in 
the potential impairment of £24.5m of capitalised UK 
BECCS development costs as detailed further under 
critical accounting judgements on page 178.
• There is a risk that an economic business model 
for BECCS cannot be established, including the risk 
that regulatory and voluntary frameworks do not 
develop in such a way as to enable Drax to fully 
participate in these markets. 
• There is a risk that Drax cannot build the right asset 
portfolio at sufficient scale to achieve a leading position.
Key mitigations
• Drax has established and is delivering against three strategic 
programmes:
 
– Development of options for its UK BECCS project at Drax Power 
Station, and engagement with UK Government and other stakeholders 
to secure the right commercial model to support it. Refer also 
to Political and Regulatory risk on page 85.
 
– Development of options for BECCS projects in other jurisdictions.
 
– The proactive development and sale of carbon removal products 
and standards.
• These programmes build on Drax’s competitive advantage, support the 
development of a scalable carbon removals business, and reduce the 
reliance on a single market and commercial model. Emerging risks 
associated with the development of these programmes include 
construction risks, referred to on page 79.

Strategic pillar: To be a UK leader in dispatchable, renewable power 
 
To maintain the position as the leading provider of UK dispatchable, renewable power requires the right portfolio of assets and associated 
business models. These must operate within a system that values the dispatchable characteristics of those assets at the right 
economic levels. 
Risk and impact 
• There is a risk that our asset portfolio is not 
appropriately valued by the market, is excluded from 
effective participation in power markets, or might be 
out-performed by a future technology.
• There is a risk that Drax Power Station does not receive 
the right economic support post 31 March 2027 
with respect to the dispatchable renewable power 
that it provides.
• There is a risk that unexpected changes to electricity 
supply and demand could reduce both demand and 
volatility, and therefore limit the market for dispatchable 
renewable assets. 
Key mitigations
• We maintain and invest in our market modelling capability and embed 
it into planning, option assessment and test and/or cross check against 
third-party scenarios. 
• We continue to actively engage with relevant UK Government 
departments and regulators in relation to a range of matters associated 
with power market design, and the role of dispatchable renewable 
generation. 
• We continually evaluate the current and projected performance of our 
own portfolio of assets, and the value gained from changing the 
composition of the asset portfolio in line with the Group’s view of the 
outlook for the market and emerging technologies. 
Strategic enabler: Capital
 
Delivering any one of the strategic aims requires the ability to access and effectively allocate the capital required, whilst maintaining 
a corporate credit rating in the BB range, to support power trading and B2B energy sales to Customers. 
Risk and impact
• There is a risk that the Group is unable to raise sufficient 
finance to fund the ongoing business or remain 
compliant with existing financing agreements due to 
poor performance, illiquid capital markets or poor credit 
rating leading to lack of investor appetite for the Group’s 
credit and/or equity.
Key mitigations
• The Group’s financial position including working capital and cash 
resources is strictly controlled.
• We continue to run a full investor relations programme, covering equity 
and debt markets. 
• The Group’s capital allocation process provides rigour and consistency 
in assessing the technical, financial, and strategic justification 
and performance of new projects across the Group, in particular 
for investments in new and emerging technologies.
• We have reviewed the impact of the Electricity Generator Levy on our 
capital strategy and have not identified a materially increased risk.

Health, safety and environment
 
Context
The health and safety of our employees and contractors, and effective management of our environmental impact remain priorities 
for the Group. Maintaining high operational and procedural safety standards is also an important contributor to the continued success 
of the business across all aspects of our activities. Safe, compliant, and sustainable operations are integral to the delivery of our strategy 
and crucial for sustained long-term performance. Safety and environmental management are foundational to our operational philosophy, 
and we continue to work across the Group to identify, implement and maintain high standards supported by a positive culture of safe 
working. We seek to respond proactively to emerging legislation and regulatory changes in both safety and environmental aspects. 
Risk and impact 
• Our operations involve a range of potential hazards 
which could affect colleagues, contractors, others 
attending our sites, and the wider environment, 
that arise from the materials and equipment we use and 
the processes we perform. This includes heavy plant 
and machinery across our sites in the US, Canada and 
the UK in the manufacture, storage and transportation 
of biomass pellets, and the generation of electricity 
from different sources, including biomass and hydro. 
Refer to page 90 for more information. 
• As we enhance and expand our safety reporting 
to include populations such as contractors, our TRIR 
has the potential to increase while appropriate 
mitigations are fully embedded with new workers 
on operational sites.
• The biomass we use to generate electricity, and the 
particulates that can occur if the biomass pellets 
degrade, are highly combustible. 
• In the generation of electricity, supplied to the National 
Grid at up to 400kV, we operate various plants at high 
temperatures and pressures, as well as managing 
significant volumes of water used by our nine hydro 
plants in Scotland (for example, 79.4 billion gallons 
at Cruachan). These are inherent attributes of our 
operations which contribute to Health, Safety and 
Environment (HSE) risk. 
Key mitigations
• Continued investment in safety equipment, environmental mitigation, 
and plant equipment and its regular maintenance. 
• Maintaining robust management systems which are subject to periodic 
review, and are refreshed as appropriate. 
• Careful management of the production, preparation, storage and 
transportation (whether within our sites, ports, or in transit 
between sites) to minimise the risk of fire or explosion.
• Integration of all assets into a new HSE system across all 
our pellet operations. 
• Effective governance framework including an executive-level Group 
HSE Committee, chaired by the CEO, to review and challenge 
the management of HSE across the Group. 
• Regular reporting to the Board on HSE matters as part of the CEO report. 
Outlining trends, incidents, and initiatives to enable the Board to 
understand culture, behaviours, and the status of key HSE matters. 
• Development of plans to align all business units on key focus areas 
to drive improvement in our HSE performance, whilst building upon 
the existing ‘One Safe Drax’ vision. 
• Implementation of a new Health, Safety, Environment and Quality (HSEQ) 
IT system for tracking and reporting events and near misses, prompt 
investigations, and timely implementation of corrective actions 
by directing attention and encouraging continuous improvement. 
• A programme of training, which aims to provide colleagues with 
an appropriate level of competence, enabling them to contribute 
to the effective management of HSE risks. 
• Raising awareness through shared experiences of events or near 
misses with colleagues across different sites.

Political and Regulatory
 
Context
During 2022, the focus of the UK Government turned to the situation in Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, and energy security. Generation 
from biomass has continued to play a crucial role in UK energy security, and the case for the future role of BECCS in supporting UK energy 
independence and its net zero ambitions has strengthened. However, the Group remains conscious of the ongoing discussion associated 
with biomass (refer to Biomass Acceptability Principal Risk on page 86) and the need for further commitment and financial support from 
the UK Government, and other critical partners, in order to deliver the decarbonisation of UK power generation and enable the Group 
to realise its negative emissions strategy. Global economic challenges and volatility in commodity markets have created the potential 
for an accelerated timeline for the UK Government’s continuing review and reform of the detailed legislation and regulation that 
underpins the electricity market. In 2022, this included launching REMA, announcing the Energy Prices Guarantee and the introduction 
of the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL). January 2023 also saw the launch of the UK Government’s Capacity Market consultation, seeking 
views on proposed reforms to strengthen the security of supply and provide greater clarity around the transition to net zero.
Internationally, the Group is entering new markets which increases its regulatory obligations and compliance challenges. This includes 
reviews of sustainability standards in the Group’s key markets including Canada and Japan; sales of pellets into Asian markets; and the 
opening of an office in Japan to support these activities. Furthermore, we remain alert to the changing geopolitical landscape which 
could continue to impact the global energy sector. 
Risk and impact 
• The invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces means the Group is no 
longer willing or allowed to access Russian and Belarusian biomass. 
Whilst the historically low volumes of Russian and Belarusian material 
purchased by the Group means this had no significant impact on the 
Group’s ability to source biomass, it has led to upward pricing 
pressures due to market shortages and associated inflationary 
pressures. The global biomass markets have been and are expected 
to remain volatile both in terms of pricing and availability. 
• At the request of the UK Government, the Group entered into an 
agreement with National Grid to make the two coal-fired units at Drax 
Power Station available to operate as a winter contingency until the 
end of March 2023, in response to concerns over security of supply. 
There is a risk that the UK Government asks the Group to extend the 
availability of its coal operations beyond this date, which, were it to be 
enforced, could materially and adversely impact the Group’s 
renewable energy reputation and also potentially delay the timetable 
for UK BECCS.
• The cost of living crisis, compounded by the effects of Covid-19, 
is having an impact on social and economic policy as well as UK 
Government funding. Whilst public and political pressure to respond 
to the threat of climate change remains strong, it has been impacted 
by a reassessment of investment priorities and resulting changes 
to UK Government fiscal policy. This has resulted in delays to the 
introduction of new legislation to deliver investment frameworks that 
support reducing carbon emissions. This could adversely impact the 
investment needed to support BECCS, which may result in material 
delays in the ability to realise Drax’s strategy around carbon removals. 
• Changes to government policy at a regional and national level in the 
countries in which we operate may increase the cost to operate our 
businesses, reduce operational efficiency, and affect our ability to 
realise our strategy. Examples include reform to the UK legal framework 
following Brexit; changes to electricity market structure and the launch 
of the REMA consultation; network access and electric charging 
arrangements; environmental regulation (refer to Biomass Acceptability 
risk on page 86); wholesale market arrangements including impacts on 
liquidity (refer to Trading and Commodity risk on page 87); consumer 
service and affordability requirements; and the EGL.
• The global regulatory environment is evolving, which may result in 
additional costs and complexity. Post-Brexit reviews of regulation are 
back on the agenda and could lead to a divergence between UK and 
EU regulation and reporting requirements, further increasing our cost 
to operate. Our involvement in new international supply chains and 
pellet markets in Asia introduces additional challenges in terms of 
compliance, regulatory change and misalignment of standards between 
markets. Such complexity could increase the risk of non-compliance, 
regulatory investigation and enforcement action against Drax, 
potentially resulting in penalties/sanctions that impact anticipated 
returns and/or the Group’s licence to operate. 
• Inflationary pressures from rising commodity prices, including power, 
are providing challenges to consumers and in some cases causing 
hardship which may lead to delayed payments or bad debt. 
We continue to monitor how wholesale power price volatility 
is feeding through to end consumers in our Customers business and 
aim to support our customers during this challenging time, for 
example by providing payment plans. There is also a risk of continuing 
energy supplier failures from these rising commodity prices, which 
results in greater cost mutualisation, whereby the cost of supply 
failure is spread across the remaining industry participants.
Key mitigations
• We believe the impacts of higher short-term biomass prices are 
mitigated by our biomass hedging strategy, which ensures a large 
proportion of the biomass contracts in place are long-term with 
agreed pricing and volumes. In addition to remaining vigilant 
to biomass pricing pressure, the ability of our suppliers to fulfil 
contracted volumes is also closely monitored, due to the impact of 
fibre market shortages associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
• Engaging with politicians and government officials, to listen to and 
inform understanding and perception of Drax’s business. This includes 
our commitments on sustainability and the creation of socio-
economic value (including jobs, training, and investment in 
communities), plus the critical role that Drax’s strategy will play 
in supporting the UK’s committed target to achieve net zero by 2050 
and ensuring security of supply. 
• Engaging with regulators and industry bodies to understand their 
priorities, influence the strategic direction, and undertake scenario 
planning in preparedness for ensuring compliance. Working with wider 
stakeholders and industry associations to maintain Drax as a thought-
leader on priority UK and global policy and regulatory issues.
• Exploring opportunities for the delivery of investment in BECCS 
globally, such as the US and the wider Asia-Pacific region. Working 
with leaders and key stakeholders in those regions, to identify areas 
of common purpose and share ideas for creating jobs, investment, 
and new growth opportunities. The Group’s International Affairs 
team continues to develop our stakeholder interaction and broaden 
engagement in regions where we source and supply biomass. 
• Confirming our compliance frameworks and internal guidance remain 
robust and continue to focus on best practice as regulation evolves 
and the business further expands its global operations.
• Investment in knowledge and experience through recruitment 
into the Group to best support our global operations.

Biomass acceptability
 
Context
Biomass is a significant element of Drax’s current business and is important in the delivery of longer-term strategic objectives, 
enabling the Group to meet its carbon removal target and the UK to realise its net zero target. During 2022, Drax sourced and shipped 
to the UK 2.5Mt of biomass for use in the operational activity of generating electricity at Drax Power Station. Furthermore, 
Drax enters into commercial contracts to supply biomass to third parties. The supply of 2.2Mt of biomass to third parties represented 
4.7% of revenue during 2022. 
High-profile campaigning by anti-biomass groups increased during 2022, with sentiment amongst stakeholders potentially being impacted. 
However, there continues to be clear and reiterated UK Government acceptance and recognition of biomass’ important role in enabling 
security of supply. This is also underpinned by independent research of the contribution to be made by sustainably sourced biomass. 2023 
is likely to be an important year in the development of biomass regulation and policy globally. Regulatory frameworks associated with the 
sourcing of biomass materials are also under development, including in some regions where we currently conduct business and others where 
we may seek to develop our business in the future. It is possible that future regulatory frameworks, may not align with our strategy and 
investment case. This could result in reduced support for certain types of biomass as a renewable energy source, increased costs of doing 
business, or the introduction of barriers to entry which may adversely impact our growth plans and financial returns versus expectations. 
The UK Government is due to develop its positioning and publish several relevant documents over the coming months which may impact 
the Group’s licence to operate. In Europe, the EU Commission (the primary decision-making body) will also publish an updated policy file 
as part of the “Fit455” package, including regulation on biomass in the Renewable Energy Directive III (REDIII). The RED file is widely 
considered to be market leading in terms of sustainability criteria for biomass, on which UK regulation is based. REDIII revisions may 
impact biomass policy decision making in the UK in the future, or in countries we supply, such as Japan, potentially restricting certain 
types of fibre for bioenergy. We continue to engage with UK and EU governments and other stakeholders to explain the benefits 
of responsibly sourced biomass and the positive impact this technology can have on the climate, nature and people.
Risk and impact 
• Some parties, including certain environmental non-governmental 
organisations (eNGOs) continue to argue against the use of biomass. 
These groups seek to influence and challenge policy and law-
makers, which may result in reduced political, business, public, and 
financial support for the benefits of biomass. 2022 saw high-profile 
and heightened campaigning by anti-biomass groups, including 
using the framework of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Companies to challenge certain statements made by Drax.
• Biomass remains immature as a commodity market. This includes 
some of the regions from which biomass is sourced, processed, 
and shipped. The Group currently has robust supply chains in 
place and in order for this to continue, we will require ready 
access to an increasingly diverse supply of biomass.
• Drax’s target is that all fibre currently used at Drax Power Station is 
Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) compliant. However, SBP 
standards are now under revision. There is a risk that the revised 
standards do not keep pace with stakeholder perceptions of 
biomass, the needs for the Group in supporting its strategy, 
including under BECCS, or become unworkable or overly restrictive.
• In the UK, policy decisions and publications relevant to biomass 
are expected in 2023. These include the Biomass Strategy which 
will set out the UK Government’s latest position on biomass and 
UK BECCS. Additionally, the UK Government is looking at policy 
decision making required closer to 2030, in particular how 
biomass sustainability can be assured when the CfD regime closes 
to biomass from 2027 onwards. The UK Government is also in the 
process of developing a UK Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, within 
which different technologies will be deemed as being a ‘green 
investment’ or not. If the current UK Government position 
supporting biomass as a renewable technology changes, this may 
negatively impact the Group’s operations and revenues in the UK. 
• In Europe, the Fit455 process continues with REDIII under revision 
which may adversely impact the Group’s growth plans. Being 
outside the EU reduces the UK’s influencing ability on EU biomass 
policy. The present draft of REDIII proposes unworkable 
restrictions on the use of “primary woody biomass” in Europe, 
which, if included in the final legislative text, would have negative 
impacts on the Group’s ability to supply Europe with its biomass 
needs, risking EU energy security and the delivery of long-term 
climate targets. 
• Reputation and market risks related to the transition to a  
low-carbon economy include increased activity by eNGOs, 
the potential for reduced investor and customer confidence, 
delays to our strategy (for example more stringent qualifying regimes 
or approval processes linked to developing existing or new facilities, or 
risk from legal challenge by eNGOs to our development or operational 
activities) and challenges with employee recruitment and retention. 
Refer to People risk on page 88.
Each of the above risks could have a material and adverse impact on the 
Group’s financial and business prospects, strategy and future results.
Key mitigations
• Engagement with stakeholders in all regions in which we operate, 
via a new global biomass campaign, to understand their requirements 
and expectations around sustainability as well as improving readiness 
to produce evidence of compliance. 
• Proactive education of stakeholders on the science of our 
sustainability practices.
• Increased resource within teams to develop and maintain strong 
relationships with policymakers in the UK, EU, North America 
and Asia via targeted engagement across institutions. 
• Targeted planning and engagement with the REDIII negotiation 
process and via Trade Associations suggesting alternative policy 
and regulatory solutions, to ensure workable outcomes.
• Where possible, seeking engagement with eNGOs to discuss issues 
of contention and potential areas of common ground, in support 
of more constructive engagement on delivering change that is 
responsible and sustainable. Equally, where we believe the views 
of eNGOs are inaccurate or misleading, providing robust challenge. 
• The Independent Advisory Board (IAB) of scientists and leaders in the 
field of sustainability provided impartial advice and guidance relating 
to the robustness of our work to deliver Nature Positive, Climate 
Positive and People Positive outcomes throughout 2022 which 
will continue in 2023. Refer to page 39 for further information.
• Closer relationships forged with suppliers through the supplier 
relationship programme to identify opportunities to enhance actions 
which support sustainable and responsible sourcing strategies and 
biodiversity, which is integral to our philosophy.
• Scenario and contingency planning and direct engagement with 
voluntary certification schemes, notably SBP, at Board and technical 
levels to ensure revised standards are fit for purpose and to identify 
alternative options where necessary. 
• Provided support to SBP to achieve RED II approval, affording 
divergent policies in UK and EU to be met through the same scheme.
• Continued assessment of new markets from which to source 
sustainable woody and alternative types of biomass.

Trading and commodity
Context
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in a range of different commodity prices, impacting both revenue and costs. Managing these exposures, 
the interactions between them, and the resulting balance of opportunity and risk, is critical to delivering value. Volatility within global 
commodity markets was significant during 2022, bringing with it heightened risk and a need to consider potential additional mitigations. 
Drax produces biomass and power with renewable certificates, and captures the market value of these commodities through both the 
wholesale markets and direct sales to end-users. The Group’s cost base is exposed to spot and forward commodity prices and foreign 
exchange rates, and the liquidity of these markets, particularly, the cost and availability of third-party biomass pellets and the fibre and 
logistics costs of our own Pellet Production business.
Managing the volatility and liquidity risks of these markets requires careful planning. Through our portfolio strategy, we optimise our 
assets to maximise value within the clearly defined parameters of our risk management framework, covering each individual commodity. 
We use forward hedging of varying lengths to manage the volatility of commodity prices and limit the impact of these on both revenue 
and costs, and we have multiple routes to market to manage liquidity constraints. 
Risk and impact 
• Power prices can be subject to significant volatility. Short-term elevated 
power prices in excess of hedged rates may result in losses should 
an unplanned outage occur on one or more of the Group’s generating 
units, as the Group could be required to buy back at spot (or the then 
prevailing market) rates which could be materially higher than the price 
which Drax had originally been paid for supplying that power. 
• Power prices remain highly volatile after reaching unprecedented 
levels during 2022, creating increased market uncertainty as well 
as constraints on supply. This uncertainty impacted market liquidity, 
which is expected to continue in the longer term. Such a continuation 
could make it harder to achieve target hedge levels for future periods, 
resulting in less certainty over forecast earnings and increased 
exposure to volatility. 
• High energy prices may cause some supply customers to change their 
forecast consumption. This presents challenges in managing the 
portfolio hedge position, and in a volatile market could result in 
additional costs if volume has to be bought or sold at adverse prices.
• Delivery of commercial value from the flexibility of our portfolio, 
and the optimisation of a complex supply chain against an uncertain 
running regime, requires effective execution of our trading strategy 
and opportunities to trade being available through sufficient liquidity. 
Volatility, as experienced in 2022, brings added complexity to the 
delivery of our strategy and increases the pressure on executing 
specific trades to take account of market conditions. Errors 
in execution, delays in carrying out planned trading or interruptions 
to our trading platform could all materially adversely affect the 
Group’s performance.
• Reduced liquidity in the forward market, along with price volatility, 
can lead to increased market exposures. These exposures potentially 
reduce the market’s appetite to trade further as this volatility in prices 
may lead to uncertainty on counterparty exposure across the market.
• Increased production costs in Drax’s supply chain may impact 
suppliers’ ability to deliver contracted biomass. This could result 
in additional third-party purchases in the spot market, at uncertain 
prices, or an interruption to forecast generation. Refer to Political 
and Regulatory risk on page 85. 
• Disruption to Drax’s biomass supply chain itself may also impact 
Drax’s ability to fulfil its sales contracts or deliver the forecast fuel 
requirements to the Generation business. During 2022, we 
experienced instances of suppliers warning of shortages and risk 
in their ability to meet their contracted obligations.
• The Generation business may fail to secure future system support 
services contracts or the value in providing those services may 
reduce due to increased competition. 
• Inability to fulfil pellet sales contracts may result in an exposure to the 
difference between the contracted and market price of the pellets. 
This could result in loss of margin and profits for the Group, 
particularly when wider supply of pellets is restricted.
• The fibre market is very dynamic and is impacted by both our suppliers 
and competitors. This makes it difficult to forecast the probability 
and impact of associated risks. The industries that use residuals 
(and other fibre classes) continue to develop. Whilst biofuel technology 
is still an early concept it is likely that this market will develop in the 
longer-term, further emphasising increasing demand for fibre.
• Across the international markets we trade in, we are exposed to 
foreign currency exchange risk, primarily in relation to the sterling 
cost of pellets to the Generation business, which is typically 
contracted in USD or EUR.
Key mitigations
• We continue to build on our high levels of forward power hedges 
(sales) for 2023 to 2025, and the CfD on one of our biomass 
generation units reduces our exposure to volatility. 
• Our UK portfolio of Industrial and Commercial electricity customers 
provides liquidity for forward power and renewable certificate sales 
through the Customers business. We maintain high hedge levels 
of customer sales through our power trading capability. 
• We are able to regularly reforecast our supply customers’ usage and 
realign our portfolio hedge to reflect changes in demand. A large 
proportion of our customers are on flexible contracts, where they 
absorb the cost or benefits of any reforecasts.
• Under our hedging strategy, our exposure to buying back power 
at higher prices in the short term is mitigated by holding back 
a percentage of generation. This provides insurance should there 
be an unplanned outage. 
• The flexibility and optimisation capabilities of the Group’s hydro 
assets allow the Group to manage its exposures more effectively 
and provide additional opportunities to create value. 
• Enhanced monitoring of the Group’s credit exposure, both cash and 
non-cash, and identification of a number of levers that could be utilised 
should the Group’s market exposure move outside of our defined levels.
• Increased self-supply of biomass allows the Group to better manage 
the supply chain to meet both forecast generation requirements at 
Drax Power Station and also third-party supply contracts and respond 
quickly to changes in these demand profiles.
• A consolidated Group-wide biomass position enables oversight of 
our complete portfolio, allowing better informed decisions about how 
pellet production operations are able to support our forecast sales/
generation requirements, noting the requirement to satisfy third-
party biomass supply obligations. 
• Operating three biomass units under a single ROC cap for Drax Power 
Station provides increased opportunities for flexibility of generation 
and can create additional value. 
• The Group has long-term fibre contracts to supply the Pellet 
Production business with biomass. We also actively engage with 
third-party pellet suppliers to ensure delivery schedules are met and 
any changes to agreed schedules are understood, to limit the impact 
on power generation. We continue to build fibre inventory and there 
is a dedicated team focused on managing this dynamic issue. 
The Biomass Strategy Team is focused on the 5 – 15 year fibre plan 
that underpins the pellet production business and BECCS strategy.
• Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by significant hedging of forecast 
exposures over a five-year horizon.

Context
During 2022, we, like many other organisations, faced tough challenges. As Covid-19 measures relaxed, the cost of living crisis began 
to take hold creating new pressures. Additionally, the labour market has been competitive with resources scarce and salaries increasing 
for in-demand skills. To fulfil our international growth plans we need to increase headcount significantly in markets with which we are 
less familiar. Plans to understand the long-term skills and capabilities required are underway, such as supporting work on new 
technologies like BECCS, alternative fuels, and the expansion of our biomass facilities in the US. Whilst addressing these market 
pressures and growth plans, keeping our colleagues safe is paramount in our planning and decision-making. 
It is imperative that our workforce has the skills required as the Group expands its presence. The UK political turmoil, and high-profile and 
heightened campaigning by anti-biomass groups during 2022 have the potential to impact our reputation, engagement with prospective 
candidates, and workforce attrition.
Risk and impact 
• In addition to ensuring we retain the core skills that will be 
required to run our business, the growth plans of the 
organisation will require new skills and capabilities. The Group 
is world leading in a number of the key aspects associated with 
the delivery of our strategy. As such, we require people with 
skills and capabilities which are adaptable to addressing new 
and emerging aspects of sustainable power generation and 
associated markets. Our performance and the delivery of our 
strategy is dependent upon having a robust talent pipeline at 
all levels of the organisation which importantly also reflects 
the diversity in the wider societies in which we operate. 
• Union organisation could lead to complex pay negotiations 
with an associated cost of establishing appropriate 
contingencies to mitigate against any threat of potential 
strike action. 
• Changing ways of working allows colleagues more choice 
about where and how they work. This means we have to be 
competitive on all fronts with our employee value proposition. 
The failure to adequately respond to changing colleague 
expectations could result in the loss of existing colleagues 
or not attracting new colleagues with the skills the Group 
needs for future growth. 
• The Group is undertaking significant change associated with 
implementing our strategy and improving operational 
effectiveness. Such change can have an impact on employee 
engagement, wellbeing, stress, and retention, with subsequent 
impacts on colleague turnover and productivity. 
• International growth brings with it increased complexity, 
which requires an understanding and appreciation of cultural, 
legal, and diversity matters in those territories.
• Reputation and market risks related to the transition to a 
low-carbon economy may result in challenges with employee 
recruitment and retention. Refer to Climate Change risk 
on page 89.
Key mitigations
• We are progressing our employee value proposition and strategic 
workforce planning approach to fulfil our growth plans. Current 
growth needs are being met by increasing the overall capacity 
of the resourcing team and outsourcing recruitment processes 
where required to manage the increased demand.
• Working with colleagues across all aspects of our business to 
understand and determine our skills and capability needs, for the 
near, medium and longer term. Supporting the more immediate 
needs through reskilling programmes whilst also looking at the 
medium/longer term through our early careers offering.
• Contingencies are in place to mitigate against the risk of outage 
caused by strike action.
• Enhancing our diversity and inclusion strategy to ensure it is 
responsive to stakeholder views, provides equality of opportunity 
and aligns to our organisational vision and goals. You can read 
more about our work in this area on pages 69 and 112. 
• Using automated advertising for our recruitment, supporting our 
levelling up and diversity agendas, and identifying talent from 
broader communities. 
• Introduction of an Inclusive Leadership Programme, and an 
Inclusive Management Programme, aligning to the business’ 
strategy to educate and inspire colleagues to make Drax a more 
inclusive place to work. 
• Continued investment in employees’ personal and career 
development to enhance business performance and provide 
the Group with a relevant pipeline of talent in critical roles.
• Regular reviews of our succession and key talent cover, 
mapped to our development programmes and talent offering.
• Evolving our engagement and listening strategies mapped 
to a colleague experience framework, including the introduction 
of Colleague Resource Groups.
• Onboarding a new occupational health provider and broadening 
our benefits and wellbeing offering to help colleagues take more 
preventative measures in areas, such as financial wellbeing. 
• Aligning our wellbeing and inclusion plans, recognising that 
colleagues will contribute their best when they feel 
psychologically safe and supported in being themselves at work. 
This includes additional education and support focused on 
financial wellbeing and addressing increased anxieties relating 
to the rising cost of living, encouraging healthy behaviours, 
and enabling colleagues to understand their own health. 
• Introducing a new Bereavement Policy which considers a range 
of bereavement experiences, including miscarriage.

Climate change
Context
The resilience of the Group’s strategy and operations to climate risks is important to the functioning and long-term value creation of 
the Group. We have identified climate risks in two main categories – physical and transitional. Physical impacts of climate change include 
event-driven, acute impacts, such as flooding, and chronic impacts, such as sea-level and temperature rises which may pose challenges 
to our operations. Transitional impacts of climate change include policy, regulatory, technology and market-related changes associated 
with the transition to a low-carbon economy that could affect the Group’s business model, but also serve as opportunities for growth. 
In the analysis of the risks we therefore assess differing factors: those where the Group needs to mitigate against adverse events which 
could impact our ability to conduct our business, and those where, through effective and constructive engagement with third parties, 
the Group will be able to deliver a combination of economic, financial, and sustainability benefits through its activities. We provide 
further detail on climate-related risks and opportunities in our TCFD disclosure on page 52. 
Risk and impact 
• Physical risks to our pellet production operations and 
supply chain in the US and Canada include increased 
frequency, variability, and severity of extreme weather 
events such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires 
with potential to cause damage to assets and impact 
on the supply of raw material and finished goods. 
• Physical risks to our Generation operations and supply 
chain include increased frequency and severity 
of extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, 
flooding and high winds, with potential to cause 
damage to assets and impact on transport 
infrastructure that could restrict or reduce access 
to sites. For example, during December 2022, 
Winter Storm Elliot halted production at several plants 
in Canada due to sub-zero temperatures and also 
prevented the transport of pellets as railway lines 
became inoperable. 
• Policy and regulatory risks related to the transition to 
a low-carbon economy include changes in government 
and cross-border climate or emissions policies that may 
negatively impact our Generation and Pellet Production 
businesses. Refer to Political and Regulatory and 
Biomass Acceptability risks on pages 85 and 86 
respectively.
• Technology risks related to the transition to 
a low-carbon economy include technology and 
innovation, such as BECCS, not developing as expected, 
impacting delivery of the Group’s carbon negative 
ambition and business strategy as well as faster than 
expected development of competing technologies, 
such as direct air capture. 
Key mitigations
• The Pellet Production business has developed stockpiles to alleviate 
incidences of extreme weather-related production interruption. 
• The increase of geographic diversity of pellet plant asset locations 
across the US and Canada. 
• Modelling of reservoir spillway capacities at Cruachan Dam, 
to understand capacity for extreme weather events. 
• A robust business strategy informed by net zero 2050 scenario. 
The Group’s three strategic objectives are aligned to global renewable 
energy and decarbonisation agendas. Refer to pages 2 and 3. 
• Carbon negative ambition and Climate Policy, underpinning a business 
strategy consistent with UK and international climate change policies. 
Discussions with governments and policy makers continue 
with increasing recognition of the role the Group’s strategy 
can contribute to in combatting the threats of climate change.
• Sourcing from a wide geographical range of third-party biomass 
suppliers; and continued evaluation of alternative fuels, using different 
feedstock types and considering wider sourcing geographies. 
• Robustly challenging the views of eNGOs where we believe those 
views are inaccurate or misleading. Equally, where possible, seeking 
engagement with eNGOs on carbon accounting and reporting, 
and liaising with the UK Government on future policies. 
• Innovation team track technology advances and progressing 
development of new technologies.

Plant Operations
 
Context 
The reliability and safe operation of our facilities is critical to our ability to create value for the Group as well as fulfill our contracted 
obligations in the generation of power for the UK power system. 
The Plant Operations risk profile is influenced by a number of key activities including the safe management of ageing assets, building 
inherent reliability and safety by design for new installations, management of change, and operating equipment within intended design 
limits and parameters. 
The Group’s facilities are highly complex and require careful management, identification, control, and mitigation of risk to operate safely 
throughout the full life-cycle (from design through to decommissioning). The operational risk profile is varied and continually changing 
due to the growth in the business, with the construction of new assets and decommissioning of older assets.
At the request of UK Government, the Group entered into an agreement with National Grid to make our two coal-fired units at Drax 
Power Station available to operate as a winter contingency until the end of March 2023 to support security of supply to the UK.
Risk and impacts
• Severe weather events (such as hurricanes, fires, and floods) 
across North America and in the UK could result in interruption 
to operations and hinder the supply of required materials to 
operate our assets. Refer to Climate Change risk on page 89.
• As plants age, the operational reliability and integrity is expected 
to reduce. For example, Drax Power Station located in 
Selby in Yorkshire was built approximately 50 years ago and 
some of our hydro assets, located in Scotland, nearly 100 years 
ago. Whilst the likelihood of an unplanned outage occurring 
remains unchanged from the evaluation in 2021, the impact 
of an unplanned outage at Drax Power Station has increased 
due to volatile energy prices. Refer to Trading and Commodity 
risk on page 87. 
• Failure to procure critical spares, goods, and services could 
result in additional production losses. The war in Ukraine has 
resulted in supply chain challenges such as longer lead times 
and significantly increased costs, exacerbated by global 
competition for raw and manufactured materials. 
• Loss of experience due to planned restructuring or leavers could 
lead to loss of knowledge and increasing reliance on processes 
and procedures to operate plant and maintain quality. 
In particular, the Pellet Production business saw a high 
colleague turnover in 2022. 
• An inherent risk of handling biomass is the potential for fire and 
explosion during its storage, production, transportation and its 
on-site delivery, which has the potential to cause significant 
disruption to operations. Refer also to Health, safety and 
environment risk on page 84.
• As a result of the extension to the availability of the coal units 
until March 2023, we believe the likelihood of protestor activity 
has increased. This could result in disruption to or prevention 
of biomass operations due to site damage, health and safety 
issues, or supply chain interruption leading to curtailment 
of delivery of goods and materials (including biomass) 
or otherwise to safely operate our generation assets, 
with significant financial impacts. 
• There are also threats across our supply chain due to the 
reliance on the complex co-ordination of transportation 
at various stages of the process. Therefore, Drax could 
be exposed to unplanned disruption. 
• Injuries and environmental issues could occur as a result 
of decommissioning, demolition, and restoration activities.
Key mitigations
• Business continuity plans are in place for all plants, ports and 
other logistics which cover weather impacts and other factors. 
This enables Drax to respond to normal and one-off 
weather events.
• A comprehensive plant investment and reliability programme has 
been implemented, that is risk-based and reflects the challenges 
of operating complex equipment and takes account of potential 
long lead times for spares, supported by an experienced 
engineering team. Increased controls such as advanced 
condition monitoring to alert any plant failures before they occur, 
where practicable, are being installed. 
• The potential cost of an outage is considered when determining 
the running regime of our generation plant. For example, when 
prices are higher, lower risk running options will be utilised 
whereas when prices are lower we may look to take the 
opportunity to perform short maintenance outages.
• Maintaining stringent safety procedures in place for sourcing, 
acceptance, and handling biomass, and the control of dust 
management from both a respiratory, health, and fire and 
explosion perspective are assessed for their compliance 
with our policies. 
• Maintaining plant standards and investment in plant to 
As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) standards, such as 
chemical suppression systems at Drax Power Station have been 
established. In areas of the plant where engineering controls 
cannot yet meet required standards, Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) is used to ensure individuals are not exposed 
to harmful levels of dust. 
• Increased physical security presence is in place. Security policies 
and procedures are in place for each site/region in addition 
to a plan of adherence. 
• Insurance is in place to cover potential losses from plant failure, 
where possible. 
• Maintaining robust management systems, designed to identify 
and mitigate risk and manage process safety across 
operating assets. 
• Providing the required training and development to equip our 
colleagues in conjunction with recruiting people with the right 
skills and experience.

Information systems and security 
Context
Our Information and operational technology systems and the integrity of the data we use, are essential to supporting the day-to-day 
business operations of the Group in addition to contributing to the delivery of our growth strategy.
As part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure, we are required to maintain availability of our systems and the capability to adapt and 
respond to evolving external threats. We have a clearly defined technology and security roadmap, continually improving and investing 
in technology which is capable of meeting current and projected future requirements and ensuring our financial, legal, regulatory 
and compliance obligations are met.
Managing these risks in an environment where threats and challenges are continually evolving requires careful understanding and 
assessment. We use internal and external expertise, including engagement with regulators, auditors, and industry groups, to continuously 
update our understanding of the IT and Security risk environment. We involve IT and Security in all projects to ensure systems networks 
and architecture are reviewed and threat levels are assessed and addressed. Nevertheless, despite the significant work and investment 
undertaken to further enhance security over our systems, this heightened external risk environment poses an increased cyber risk 
to our business continuity and supply chains.
Risk and impact 
• Geopolitical tensions have in the past been known to 
result in increased cyber-related threats. The ongoing 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased the 
Group’s risk exposure to attacks, state-sanctioned and 
otherwise, on our systems and those of suppliers 
on whom we rely for integrity of service.
• Successful cyber-attacks have the potential to 
compromise our systems, affecting the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of our data (including personal 
data). The threat is evolving, and the risk from this 
threat has increased as a result of the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict. Their current attack methodology seeks to 
deny access which may cause operational and financial 
impacts and regulatory non-compliance.
• Evolving regulatory requirements present ongoing 
challenges to the Group. Operators such as Drax are 
required to broaden the scope of systems that are 
deemed ‘at risk’ and focus is being placed on 
establishing adequate resilience, the capability 
to respond and recover quickly from disruptions, 
and ensuring the continuation of safe and secure 
operations. Not meeting such regulatory obligations 
could result in the Group facing enforcement notice and 
financial penalties. 
• We partner with third-parties to support our information 
and operational systems. If these businesses were 
themselves to suffer systems failure, cyber-attack, 
or financial difficulties, this could in turn impact our 
business, operations, and performance. 
• Legacy systems are more difficult to maintain and are 
more susceptible to cyber-attacks. Subsequent 
operational issues, such as reduced performance, may 
impact the availability of systems, data, and facilities, 
affecting our operations adversely.
• The availability of experienced IT and Security 
personnel in the labour market has tightened. This may 
result in not being able to retain and/or hire people with 
the necessary skills to manage these risks. See People 
risk on page 88.
Key mitigations
• Maintenance of effective and up-to-date cyber security measures, 
including a prevent, protect, detect, respond and recover strategy, 
which evolves to address known and emerging threats. 
• We are well-placed to respond to changing regulations and standards 
and we continue to develop technology, security controls, and resilience 
measures to maintain compliance. 
• Regular awareness campaigns and training events are undertaken aimed 
at improved cyber-security awareness.
• Maintenance of a robust supplier onboarding policy and associated 
processes, to ensure major service providers and vendors are 
appropriately risk-assessed and reviewed periodically. 
• Periodic internal and independent external assessment of the integrity, 
adequacy, and compliance status of our IT and cyber security controls. 
• Regular updates with regulators to allow the business to continually 
assess the level of security risk.
• Increased exercising and refreshing of business continuity, disaster 
recovery, and crisis management plans.
• Continual technical refresh programmes to address legacy 
infrastructure and systems, and adoption of secure-by-design principles 
and design patterns. 
• Refer to the People risk disclosure on page 88 for additional mitigations.
• All Information systems and security risks, and associated risk treatment 
plans, are reviewed regularly by the IT Board comprised of Executive 
Committee level members and senior management subject 
matter experts.

Women’s Network at Drax Power Station
The numbers of female colleagues 
at Drax Power Station has increased 
significantly over the years, both in 
operational and support roles, 
which is very positive. 
While this is great to see and shows real 
progress in our efforts to create a more 
diverse workplace, it’s also highlighted 
areas we need to improve to reflect this 
demographic, such as the need for 
improved, better fitting personal 
protective equipment and creating 
breastfeeding facilities.
We’re there to listen to colleagues’ 
concerns and ideas and make changes 
to support women at various stages 
in their lives, including the menopause.
We want future generations of women 
to know they can work in our industry, 
that there are equal opportunities to 
grow and develop within the business 
and that they can realise their potential.”

My training has given me the

to look out for and to step in. 
I also know where to signpost

Effective governance 
is fundamental to the way 
in which everyone on the 
Board and across every 
part of our business is 
expected to act. 
I am pleased to present our 
Corporate Governance Report.
Governance is integral to the success 
of our business and the realisation of our 
goals. It also informs our purpose and 
values. Effective governance is 
fundamental to the way in which everyone 
on the Board and across every part of our 
business is expected to act. In addition, 
it enables us to work in ways that help us 
realise our potential.
During 2022, the Board challenged 
management and contributed to the 
Group’s progress in delivering its strategy. 
This included the continued expansion of 
the supply of sustainably sourced pellets, 
both for the Group’s own use and third-
party contracts. Furthermore, the Board 
fully supported an accelerated 
development of options for BECCS in the 
UK and globally. We have also devoted time 
during meetings and in our Board visits to 
understanding performance in activities 
such as health, safety and sustainability. 
the supply continuity that would allow the 
Group to meet its generation commitments. 
Amidst energy market changes 
unprecedented in modern times, Drax 
received a UK Government request to be 
available to operate our coal units during 
winter 2022/23, if required. The Board 
carefully assessed this request. More 
details about the decision-making process, 
stakeholder considerations (including the 
need for customers to have energy 
security during winter) are on page 107. 
The effect of the cost-of-living crisis has 
had an impact upon many people, 
including our colleagues across the Group. 
The Board discussed these impacts and 
how to respond in the early autumn, and 
supported management in considering the 
amount and timing of the annual salary 
review. We also considered our colleagues’ 
wellbeing, including the development 
of a Bereavement Policy. There is more 
information about this on page 69.
You can find more information about the 
Board’s trip to Canada on page 95 and 
on sustainability from page 36. For more 
about safety and how we embed key 
actions into assessing management’s 
performance, please see page 156.
During 2022, Drax – in common with many 
other organisations and individuals – had 
to react to challenging macro-economic 
factors. These included the impact of the 
invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the 
resulting sanctions, high energy prices, 
and rising inflation. Colleagues have 
worked hard to understand these issues 
and develop appropriate actions, which 
the Board scrutinised and challenged 
before reaching what we believe are 
appropriate conclusions. One example was 
the formation of a working group to 
undertake a detailed review of the Group’s 
supply chain and supplier resilience after 
the introduction of sanctions. The Board 
received updates on operational issues 
and risks, and the steps taken to ensure

Governance
The integration of the Canadian business 
continued in 2022, with the Board 
reviewing ways to invest in and facilitate 
operations as part of transitioning into 
an enlarged group. Since the acquisition 
of Pinnacle in April 2021, colleagues 
in Canada have made a significant 
contribution to the business and our 
strategic progress is testament to 
everyone’s dedication. As part of 
integration, the Group continues to roll out 
training modules such as ethics, values 
and safety to colleagues. The 
management team has also overseen 
ongoing work to implement the Group’s 
sustainability principles across our 
Canadian sites.
In June 2022, the Board took part in a 
highly successful trip to pellet production 
sites in Canada. We attended a series of 
meetings with local management and 
subject matter experts, including health 
and safety, process safety and ESG. 
Directors were fortunate to attend a forest 
tour hosted by a First Nations group, 
where we discussed the vital forest 
management work taking place. We were 
also delighted to meet many Canadian 
colleagues in person and develop those 
important relationships. Non-Executive 
Director Kim Keating who was appointed 
to the Board in October 2021, lives and 
works in Canada and is passionate about 
outreach within local communities. During 
the visit, all of the Board members gained 
insights into the operational challenges 
of conducting business in Canada with 
extreme seasonal weather changes 
including periods of severe cold, snow and 
high winds. More discussion around this 
risk and the response of the business is 
on page 89.
Engaging with our stakeholders
The Board recognises the need to ensure 
effective engagement with stakeholders, 
both internally and externally. Regular 
updates form part of reports discussed at 
Board meetings, supported by discussions 
with management and advisers. Some 
Directors have also directly engaged 
with suppliers while visiting Canada, 
and with shareholders. These included 
meetings where variously our CEO, 
Will Gardiner, CFO, Andy Skelton, 
and I have participated. In addition, 
Will Gardiner has led our engagement 
with the UK Government. As our business 
continues to grow internationally, 
we appreciate the open discussions and 
enriched experiences that come from 
visiting and meeting stakeholders 
face to face. We feel it is vital to listen 
to stakeholders, take account of their 
perspectives, and respond to and act 
upon their feedback. This was clearly 
demonstrated during our considerations 
concerning the potential operation of 
the coal units, during winter 2022/23. 
There are details about the process 
included on page 107.
We believe the BECCS programme is 
fundamental to delivering the net zero 
ambitions of the UK, while also supporting 
the nation’s energy demands. During 
2022, we have worked with stakeholders 
such as BEIS, and DEFRA, regional 
partners including the Northern 
Endurance Partnership (NEP) as part of 
the East Coast Cluster, and commercial 
partners to develop our work on BECCS. 
This included holding two large events 
focused on suppliers. Last October, 
the Board held a two-day review of the 
Group’s strategy, including the potential 
scale of the BECCS opportunity. 
The review assessed key next steps for 
the programme in the UK, and considered 
the prospects for global BECCS, primarily 
in the US. To do so, we scrutinised the 
feedback from meetings with regulators, 
policy makers and potential partners in 
several US states. These options for 
broadening the adoption of BECCS, 
both at home and globally, are 
encouraging and we believe represent 
genuine prospects for accelerated growth.
With BECCS being just one aspect 
of our portfolio and engagement with 
stakeholders, the Board also received 
reports about wider stakeholder 
engagement. In July, we received 
a presentation from the External Affairs 
team and discussed, assessed and 
challenged the quality of the team’s 
engagement in satisfying Section 172 of 
the Companies Act. Naturally, this meant 
considering the issues pertinent to the 
Group, such as the expansion at Cruachan, 
plus UK and global BECCS. However, 
we also sought to gain a better 
understanding of what matters most to 
our stakeholders, and of how management 
seeks to address these issues. The Board 
fully understands the vital nature of this 
work and the next phase of BECCS 
delivery in 2023 relies upon stakeholder 
support and the necessary regulatory 
framework in supporting Drax’s 
investment decision (find more 
information on page 26).
In line with the Board’s expectations for a 
full and thorough stakeholder engagement 
process, the Cruachan expansion work 
during 2022 involved a broad consultation 
with all relevant stakeholders. Through 
2022 the Board received updates on 
progress and discussed the structure 
of engagement. The project remains 
in the preliminary stage of consultation 
and approval. The expansion represents 
a key part of enabling the supply of secure, 
renewable energy in Scotland and 
England. And it will become a focus 
for education and job creation in the 
local communities.
During the year, Will Gardiner and 
I continued to meet quarterly with 
the chairs of the MyVoice Forums, 
our workforce engagement initiative. 
These meetings allow us to hear directly 
from colleagues, via their representatives. 
It is a safe forum where everyone can 
speak openly, holding discussions on 
key issues that are important for our 
colleagues. Will and I then reported the 
feedback to the whole Board. This ensures 
all Directors gain an appreciation of 
employee interests and concerns while 
also providing an opportunity for Directors 
to offer informed guidance and reflections 
upon our possible responses. You can read 
more about this on page 26.
Recognising the value of increasing 
Director engagement with employees, 
Nicola Hodson recorded a video in June 
2022. In it, she explained the annual bonus 
plan, how we choose financial, strategic 
and ESG measures, and how they support 
our strategy. We shared the video with 
colleagues in July 2022 and, as the fourth 
most viewed internal video in 2022, 
it was very well-received. At the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2023, 
we will use online technology once more. 
This enables shareholders to attend 
remotely and in person, with the aim 
of optimising shareholder engagement 
and participation. However, the take 
up rate for remote attendance remains 
very low so we will continue to consider 
its effectiveness in enabling the Board 
to hear from shareholders.

Governance
Diversity and inclusion
In last year’s Annual Report, we outlined 
our progress regarding diversity and 
inclusion at Board level and throughout 
the Group. Even so, we recognise there is 
always more work to do. We welcome the 
expectation from the FCA for improved 
transparency, as announced in its April 
2022 Policy Statement on ‘Diversity 
and inclusion on company boards and 
executive management’. It includes 
recommendations that appear in our own 
Board Diversity Policy, which was 
reviewed and approved during 2022. 
While already meeting two of the FCA’s 
new targets, we are mindful of the 
expectations placed upon the Boards of 
listed companies to meet all the targets. 
Set out below is our current progress 
against the FCA targets, and we provide 
further diversity figures in the tables 
on page 106:
1.  At least 40% of the board are women. 
Met: 44.44% of the Board are women. 
In addition, 40% of the Executive 
Committee are women.
2.  At least one of the following senior 
board positions is staffed by a woman 
– Chair, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Senior Independent Director (SID) 
or Chief Financial Officer (CFO). 
Not yet met: This is something of which 
we are mindful, and it will be considered 
as a factor in any future recruitment 
processes. Both the Audit Committee 
and Remuneration Committee are 
chaired by women.
3.  At least one board member is from a 
minority ethnic background, defined 
by reference to the categories 
recommended by the Office for 
National Statistics, excluding those 
listed as coming from a White ethnic 
background. Met: The Board currently 
has one director from an ethnic 
minority background.
The Board and management continue 
to place particular emphasis on the safety 
and wellbeing of our people. However, 
as we emerged from the pandemic, 
the cost-of-living crisis started to take hold. 
Our response included careful 
consideration of the best financial support 
measures, bringing the annual pay rise 
forward by three months and giving 
colleagues a significant increase. 
We appointed a new financial wellbeing 
partner, called Nudge. Through a web 
application, Nudge offers colleagues 
personalised financial guidance that aims 
to help them navigate the current financial 
challenges, as well as plan for retirement 
and deal with other financial matters. 
During the year there were a number of 
Director visits to sites. For example, in 
November, John Baxter and Kim Keating 
travelled to Drax Power Station to meet 
management and colleagues. They 
discussed safety, how to improve the 
operational efficiency of assets, and 
planning for onsite development works. 
Kim also had a separate meeting with 
female employees who were part of a 
women’s networking initiative, and John 
met apprentices to discuss their experience 
of working at Drax. He also visited the 
Glasgow office in June, for an update 
on risk management (including safety 
and governance) and our Scottish assets, 
including the development at Cruachan.
Looking forward, pressures on the global 
economy and cost-of-living are likely 
to continue. Alongside these challenges, 
we will ensure that our strategy for 
biomass acceptability, carbon removal, 
and secure renewable power all develop 
too. Drax experienced many changes 
during 2022 and the Board recognises 
the significant work by all colleagues, 
in response to those challenges. We very 
much appreciate everyone’s positive 
contribution in delivering our day-to-day 
operations while progressing our strategy. 
It is only by working together, informed 
by our values and our continuing 
commitment to realising our ambitions 
responsibly, that we can deliver 
our purpose.
Philip Cox CBE 
Chair
In other sections of this Annual Report, 
we explain the additional measures we 
have taken in 2022 to support positive 
change for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
These include leadership development, 
more transparency in career progression, 
and awareness-raising through events. 
We have developed our Bereavement 
Policy, which considers a range of 
bereavement experiences, including 
miscarriage and are building Colleague 
Resource Groups (CRGs) to give under-
represented voices an opportunity 
to communicate in a safe place. 
We are also evolving our recruitment 
strategies to attract candidates from 
under-represented groups.
The Board considered and fully supported 
all these steps. For example, to celebrate 
Black History month in February 2022, 
Non-Executive Director Erika Peterman 
recorded a personal video message 
to colleagues (the fifth most-viewed 
internal video of 2022), and we held 
an internal live panel event to share 
colleagues’ experiences.
Culture and governance
As the Group focuses on its People 
Positive agenda, we continued during 
2022 to work on culture, values and our 
colleagues’ experience. The Board 
received regular updates on workforce 
engagement, including feedback on 
meetings between the Chair of the Board, 
the CEO and the chairs (chosen by 
colleagues) of the MyVoice Forums. 
The Board also reviewed and challenged 
management on the results of the 
workforce engagement survey and the 
corresponding action plans, such as 
workshops to support colleagues. Actions 
following the 2021 survey, and ahead of 
the 2022 edition, were taken with the aim 
to improve the lower response rates from 
our colleagues in Canada and the US. 
These included making additional PC 
workstations available to colleagues 
in operating facilities, and allowing 
employees to access the survey with 
their phones via a QR code. In addition, 
line managers had to both ensure 
colleagues could access emails and make 
the appropriate plans for colleagues to 
have enough time to complete the survey.

Scotland he brings important insights to 
Drax on the local environment and culture.

The Board has clearly articulated the Group’s 
purpose (to enable a zero carbon, lower cost 
energy future), ambition (to become carbon 
negative by 2030) and business model. 
The Board promotes a culture of openness 
and collaboration, setting a clear and positive 
tone to promote our values. 
This underpins the Group’s strategy: to be 
a global leader in both sustainable biomass 
pellets and in negative emissions, and to be 
a UK leader in dispatchable, renewable power. 
It also supports the UK’s ambition to achieve 
net zero by 2050. 
Items such as health, safety and wellbeing, 
ethics and employee engagement are 
standing agenda items at Executive 
Committee and Board meetings. This provides 
oversight and identifies areas for 
improvement and practices that enable 
positive engagement, underpinning the 
culture of respect. 
The workforce engagement forums meet 
quarterly. Key issues discussed in 2022 
included career development, inclusion, social 
and environmental responsibility, Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine, inflation, energy costs 
and the rising cost of living. Chair, Philip Cox, 
and CEO, Will Gardiner, meet quarterly 
with the chairs of the workforce forums, 
with support from Hillary Berger, who is 
Group General Counsel and an Executive 
Committee member. The subsequent CEO 
report to the Board includes information 
about these meetings. 
Typically, the Group undertakes employee 
engagement surveys annually. Action from 
the 2021 survey included the implementation 
of a career pathway pilot. This involved career 
video stories and leaders engaging with teams 
to discuss how they can improve on 
communicating and leading change. (You can 
read more about how the Board monitors and 
assesses culture on page 105).
The Board comprises the Chair of the Board, 
two Executive Directors and six independent 
Non-Executive Directors. All six were 
considered independent on appointment; 
one of them, David Nussbaum, acts as 
Senior Independent Director.
The Senior Independent Director, David 
Nussbaum, led the Non-Executive Directors 
in a review of the Chair’s performance and 
then provided feedback to the Chair.
Non-Executive Directors routinely scrutinise 
performance against business objectives 
(including financial, strategic and other 
measures captured in the Group Scorecard). 
They hold management to account while 
providing challenge and guidance in an open 
and constructive environment. Examples 
from 2022 include requests for deep dives 
into the top safety risks and the 
reintroduction of health and safety to the 
bonus scorecard. In addition, there were 
The Nomination Committee comprises 
the Chair of the Board (who also chairs 
the Committee) and six independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
All appointments to the Board are subject 
to a formal, rigorous and transparent process, 
and all new Directors undergo a thorough 
induction programme.
Each year the Nomination Committee reviews 
the Group’s succession plan, identifying 
colleagues who have the potential to progress 
to more senior roles in one to five years. 
Based on merit and objective criteria, 
the review focuses on various aspects such 
as technical skills, experience, behaviours, 
attitudes and diversity. This ensures the 
business has the right leaders in place 
to deliver our purpose and strategy. 
The Audit Committee comprises four 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee chair, Vanessa Simms, 
was considered independent on appointment 
in that role, and has recent and relevant 
financial experience.
The Audit Committee provides oversight and 
challenge of the Group’s financial statements 
to ensure they provide a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and performance. 
The Board has procedures in place to manage 
risk and oversee the internal control 
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
five independent Non-Executive Directors 
and the Chair. The Committee Chair, 
Nicola Hodson, was considered independent 
on appointment as Chair and has relevant 
committee experience.
Shareholders approved the current Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (Policy) at the 2020 AGM. 
During 2022, the Remuneration Committee 
– with support from Korn Ferry –reviewed the 
Policy and considered it to be broadly fit for 
purpose. The updated Policy will be presented 
to shareholders for approval at the 2023 
AGM. You can find out more about the 
proposed new policy in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 127 to 157.

Corporate Governance Report: Compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code)
At two meetings during 2022, the Board formally considered reports on how Drax, the Board and its Committees applied the Principles 
and complied with the Provisions of the Code. The meetings included discussions about the steps being taken and how they might 
evolve, as well as the effectiveness of stakeholder and colleague engagement. We also discussed how the Board assesses, monitors

Governance
In June 2022, the Board visited Drax sites in 
Canada. This gave Directors the opportunity 
to visit key projects, meet operational 
colleagues, and gain invaluable insight into 
the local culture of the business. The visit 
included learning about First Nations’ forest 
management, in addition to health and 
safety, process safety and ESG at the 
Canadian sites. Following the easing of 
Covid-19 restrictions, we are planning further 
visits to Drax site locations for 2023. 
The Board ensures that both it and the 
business actively engage with a wide range 
of stakeholders to encourage meaningful 
two-way participation. This also ensures the 
Group makes a positive contribution to wider 
society. Board papers submitted for material 
decisions, and the assessment undertaken 
at Board meetings, consider the impact 
on wider stakeholders, and the Board 
routinely receives updates on stakeholder 
engagement. You can read more about this 
on pages 26 to 33. The Chair, Senior 
Independent Director and Chairs of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees are all 
available for engagement with shareholders.
Diversity, equity and inclusion are important 
to the work of the Board, which is keen to set 
the right tone. The Board assesses actions 
being taken in the three core areas of 
the strategy: 
(1)  Data – understanding and tracking 
changes being made to the socio-
economic and cultural balance of 
colleagues working across the Group
(2)  Educate – positive steps to inform 
behaviours as part of driving change
(3)  Inspire and recruit – encourage people 
throughout the organisation to participate 
and recognise the importance of their 
involvement in realising shared objectives
The Diversity and Inclusion Steering 
Committee reviews progress in each pillar 
regularly with the CEO providing updates to 
the Board. You can read more about our work 
on diversity and inclusion on pages 69 to 70 
and 112 to 113
The Group’s confidential whistleblowing 
telephone hotline and web-portal enable 
colleagues and third parties to raise matters 
of concern. The Board oversees 
whistleblowing and receives regular updates; 
it also discusses findings from investigations 
and challenges management on initiatives 
associated with raising awareness and 
addressing learnings.
discussions about the cost tracking and 
status of projects.
Before regular Board meetings, the Chair 
and Non-Executive Directors meet without 
the Executive Directors being present, 
giving them the opportunity to consider 
and discuss matters. The Audit Committee, 
which the Board Chair, Philip Cox, attends 
by invitation, also provides routine agenda 
time to discuss matters in the absence 
of management. These agenda items 
typically include meetings with the external 
and internal auditors.
The Board approves additional appointments 
in advance, taking into account the additional 
demands on directors’ time. No Executive 
Director has a non-executive position 
in another listed company.
All Directors have full access to the services 
of the Group Company Secretary, who works 
closely with the Chair of the Board and Chairs 
of the Committees. This ensures the Board 
has the policies, processes, information, time 
and resources it needs to function effectively 
and efficiently. The whole Board approves 
the appointment or removal of the Group 
Company Secretary.
The most recent review, conducted 
in November 2022, also assessed the 
capabilities required to support progress 
in delivering the breadth of projects across 
key functions of the Group.
All Directors seek annual re-election 
(or election at their first AGM following 
appointment). 
Board Alchemy performed an externally 
facilitated evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees in 2022. You can read 
more about this on page 107 to 108 and

the Group is willing to take to achieve 
its long-term strategic objectives. Details 
of the approach to risk management, 
the process controls and principal risks, 
together with mitigation strategies, appear 
on pages 77 to 91. The Audit Committee 
supports this work as part of regular 
agenda items. 
In 2021, the Committee undertook a formal 
tender in preparation for the end of tenure 
of the present external auditor Deloitte LLP. 
This concluded with a recommendation 
to appoint PwC for the financial year 
commencing 1 January 2024.

Directors, ensuring alignment. In 2020, the 
Committee determined that from 1 January 
2023, the contribution rates paid in respect 
of pension benefits for existing Executive 
Directors would align with the wider 
workforce.
The Remuneration Committee scrutinises 
performance-related pay at the point of 
completing a measurement period. It has 
discretion to adjust remuneration outcomes 
where appropriate to ensure that reward 
outcomes align to Group performance.
No directors are involved in making decisions 
regarding their own remuneration.

Principles and Provisions of the Code throughout 2022.

Governance
Corporate Governance Report: Executive Committee
The Executive Committee considers business performance 
against the annual plan, and reviews progress in realising 
longer-term objectives. They receive reports on each of the 
business units, covering financial and non-financial metrics. 
The latter include matters affecting the safety and wellbeing 
of our workforce, which is the opening agenda item for each 
meeting. Ethics and values are also a standing agenda item. 
In 2022, the Executive Committee completed an in-depth review 
of all nine principal risks; each one is owned by a member 
of the Executive Committee. Following the acquisition of 
Pinnacle, the Pinnacle Risk Register was restructured to align 
with the Drax Principal Risk categories and risk scoring 
methodology (which was completed in 2021). The resulting 
document was then circulated to each Principal Risk owner 
for review and feedback, to help establish Group-level 
governance of Pinnacle-specific risks. You can read more about 
our Principal Risk processes on pages 77 to 91.
The Executive Committee meets informally most weeks 
throughout the course of the year, in addition to holding 7 
meetings at which more formal reports are considered on a range 
of business performance and planning measures. Where relevant 
to the matters under discussion, Committee members receive 
the relevant briefing papers ahead of these meetings. In addition, 
members receive presentations on various issues from senior 
managers within the business units. 
The Committee also meets with management teams each quarter 
for a deep dive into performance in delivering the Group’s 
strategic imperatives. In these sessions, the Committee reviews 
key programmes and progress against key milestones.
Biographies of the Executive Committee members are on the 
website: drax.com/about-us/corporate-governance/.
Role of the Executive Committee
The Executive Committee focuses on the delivery of the Group’s 
strategy, assessing the adequacy of the Group’s financial 
structure, operational and financial performance, innovation, 
organisational development, and change. This is enabled 
by engagement with the workforce in addition to external 
stakeholders, including the UK Government and NGOs. 
The Committee considers stakeholder engagement, including 
a focus on the political landscape that could impact the Group’s 
ability to execute its strategy. There are more details about such 
engagement by the Group on pages 26 to 33. During 2022, there 
were no changes to the membership of the Executive Committee. 
The Executive Committee develops and considers policies and 
procedures that provide an effective framework for operating 
in line with required standards, laws and regulations. These 
policies and procedures include our Code of Conduct, Group 
Health and Safety, Supplier Code of Conduct and Diversity 
and Inclusion Policy.
As detailed on page 107, the question of whether to operate 
the coal units during winter 2022-2023 represented a significant 
business decision for the Group and its stakeholders. 
The Executive Committee completed several reviews of the 
risks related to coal generation and reported these findings 
to the Board. 
Following the acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy, Inc in 
April 2021, the Committee has continued – throughout 2022 – 
to oversee its integration within Drax. We are also deepening our 
understanding of the opportunities related to global sustainable 
biomass generation.

Role of the Board
The Board determines the Group’s purpose, strategy and 
business model for long-term value creation, and its appetite for 
risk and risk management policies. The Board also determines the 
annual plan and budget, considering whether the Group has the 
necessary resources to deliver the strategy. In addition, the Board 
sets the key performance indicators to measure performance 
against strategic objectives (e.g. tracking cost reduction targets 
in the self-supply of pellets; see page 18). It also reviews and 
advises on stakeholder engagement, including with shareholders, 
the workforce, Government and NGOs. The Board considers 
management proposals for acquisitions, disposals, and other 
transactions outside ordinary delegated limits. Such transactions 
included the decision to make available the coal units at Drax 
Power Station, in the event called upon to provide power to the 
UK grid (see page 107). 
The Board also considers material changes to accounting policies 
or practices, and significant financial decisions. Such decisions 
include investment in large scale projects such as BECCS, capital 
structure and the dividend policy. For more information on these 
see the Financial Review which starts on page 20. The Board 
provides challenge to management on the Group’s priorities and 
initiatives related to sustainability and environmental practices. 
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s governance 
structure too, commenting on how it should be revised to reflect 
the evolution of the business. Reviews may cover: business 
conduct, ethics and whistleblowing; the prosecution, defence 
or settlement of material litigation; and Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy. They may also include the terms of reference of Board 
committees, and the Board structure, composition and 
succession planning. 
Terms of reference
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decisions, 
and formal terms of reference for its committees (which it 
reviews periodically). The terms of reference of the committees 
of the Board are available to view on the Group’s website at 
www.drax.com. 
Matters not specifically reserved to the Board and its committees 
under their terms of reference, or for shareholders in General 
Meeting, are delegated. Delegation is to the Executive 
Committee, or otherwise delegated in accordance with a 
schedule of delegated authorities that is approved by the Board. 
The most recent review of the Matters Reserved for the Board 
occurred in December 2020. This review informed a detailed 
assessment of the Group’s wider delegations of authority, 
which was completed in 2021.
How the Board functions
Routinely, before the formal meeting of the Board, the Chair 
and the Non-Executive Directors meet in private without 
management being present. This allows the Chair and Non-
Executive Directors to exchange views and share any concerns 
before the meeting starts. At each Board meeting, the CEO gives 
a report on key business, operational and safety matters and 
reports on the Group’s financial performance. The Board also 
receives regular reports on performance against the business 
plan, as well as operational and financial performance. In addition, 
it receives regular business reports from senior management 
across the Group, and updates on investor relations and wider 
stakeholder engagement. Adequate time is allocated to each 
agenda item, to support effective discussion and challenge 
by Directors.
During 2022, there was a focus on understanding the principal 
risks associated with the request received from the UK 
Government to be able to operate the coal units, if required, 
to assist with country’s energy security during winter 2022/23. 
You can read more about the Board’s decision process and 
stakeholder engagement on page 106-107 and in the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on page 77. 
Linked to energy security, the Board received regular updates 
during 2022 on the macro-economic factors influencing energy 
providers and supply chains. In February, the Board established 
a working group with delegated authority to complete a detailed 
review of the Group’s supply chain. This review encompassed 
the resilience of suppliers and analysis on third-party sourcing. 
During the year, the Board also discussed the increasing costs 
of pellet production and inflation-related costs. Board members 
reviewed ways the Group’s integrated supply chain is capable 
of creating additional value to mitigate macro-economic factors. 
You can read more about the Group’s approach to economic 
risks on pages 77 to 91. 
The Board receives regular industry, regulatory and topical 
updates from internal specialists as well as external experts and 
advisers. Examples included, half-yearly updates on security 
matters including cyber security, information security and the 
effectiveness of controls. 
The core activities of the Board and its Committees are planned 
on a forward agenda that the Chairs of each Committee consider 
and review at least annually. Through meeting minutes the 
Committee maintains a list of matters arising from each meeting 
and follow these up at subsequent meetings. The Group 
Company Secretary advises the Board on governance matters, 
ensuring good information flows within the Board, its 
committees, the Executive Committee and senior management. 
The Group Company Secretary also assesses compliance with 
the Listing, Prospectus, Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules, the Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act. 
An important part of this is effective collaboration with other 
parties across all Group functions. Good training, regular 
discussions on key issues, and support in evaluating the 
potential for change from those in areas of critical operational risk 
are also imperative.
All Board Committees are authorised to obtain legal or other 
professional advice as necessary to perform their duties. 
This includes securing the attendance of external advisers 
at meetings and seeking required information from any member 
of the Group’s workforce.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) give the 
Directors power to authorise conflicts of interest when presented 
with such matters for their review. The Articles were most 
recently reviewed by the Board in 2021 and updated with 
shareholder approval at the AGM held in 2021. The Board has 
an effective procedure to identify potential conflicts of interest, 
consider them for authorisation and record them. In 2022, 
no conflicts of interest were identified. The Articles also allow 
the Board to exercise voting rights in Group companies without 
restriction (for example, to appoint a director to a Group 
company). The Articles are available on the Group’s website at 
https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-

Governance
Culture
How does the Board monitor and assess culture?
The Executive 
Committee
• The subject of ethics and values is a standing agenda item for the Executive Committee. The Chair of the 
EBCC supports the CEO’s regular updates to the Board.
• The Executive Committee develops plans for Board consideration on matters such as responding 
to workforce engagement feedback, promoting diversity and inclusion, and dignity at work. 
• The CEO sends a weekly Group-wide “Ask Will” email with Q&A (allowing colleagues to ask/comment about 
what is on their mind).
The Group 
Ethics and 
Business 
Conduct 
Committee 
(EBCC)
• A sub-committee of the Executive Committee, the EBCC meets quarterly to monitor, support and challenge 
activities, assessing whether there has been proper regard for the Group’s policies as well as external laws, 
regulations and standards. It also considers initiatives to maintain, enhance and assess ethical behaviour 
and business conduct across Drax. 
• Members of the EBCC include the Group General Counsel (Chair), the Director of Corporate Affairs, the DBI 
Senior Vice President, the UK Portfolio Generation Director, the Managing Director of Drax Customers, 
the Group General Counsel and the Group Company Secretary.
• The EBCC supports the Group’s commitment to doing the right thing in its business practices. It achieves this 
by making sure there are appropriate communications to raise awareness and providing appropriate training 
that informs behaviours in accordance with our Code of Conduct. For more information, see page 72. 
• This sub-committee also assesses and challenges the annual review and risk assessment of compliance 
programmes. These cover anti-bribery and corruption (including conflicts of interest), corporate criminal 
offences (tax evasion), ethical due diligence, fair competition, privacy, sanctions, Speak Up (whistleblowing), 
and supply chain human rights.
The Business Ethics team is responsible for the operation of the 
Group’s Speak Up (whistleblowing) programme and reviews its 
annual risk assessment (most recently completed in early 2022). 
This includes the external, confidential (and anonymous, should 
reporters so wish) reporting service that’s available in multiple 
languages. In the 2022 MyVoice engagement survey, 86% 
of colleagues responded positively when asked whether they 
“feel comfortable to speak up or report any concerns”. 
For more information on Speak Up, see page 73. 
Our various Speak Up reporting channels are promoted to 
internal stakeholders across several platforms, and to third 
parties via our Supplier Code of Conduct. The Business Ethics 
team responds to any reports from within Drax, as well as those 
referred via the external service. The Group Company Secretary 
is the Whistleblowing Officer with oversight of all related 
investigations, which the Business Ethics team manages. Speak 
Up matters continue to be reported to the Board and EBCC at the 
respective meetings, with an annual report of EBCC activities 
(including Speak Up reports and investigations) provided to the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also receives a quarterly 
report on Speak Up. 
As stated in our 2021 Annual Report, our Speak Up programme 
received a positive internal audit in May 2021 (reported to the 
Audit Committee in July 2021). Most actions raised in the audit 
were completed within 2021, although one that the Audit 
Committee was tracking – related to creating an investigation 
procedure – was carried over into 2022. To close this action, 
the EBCC created and approved three principle-based guides 
in June 2022. 
The Speak Up (whistleblowing) policy was reviewed in early 2022, 
with no material changes required. Our two Speak Up guides 
(one for reporters and the other for managers) were also 
reviewed and updated then communicated to colleagues in 
2022. Both documents reflected our newly-created template 
for internal Speak Up reports. 
The Speak Up programme was rolled out to colleagues in Canada 
during 2021. In July 2022, there were further communications 
via the deployment of the Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy and 
a ‘Keeping Ethics in Mind’ guide that summarises Business Ethics 
policies. In September 2022, the full Code of Conduct 
(including Speak Up content) was issued to former Canadian 
salaried colleagues; whilst non-salaried colleagues received 
the ‘Code at a Glance’. Our new Princeton colleagues in Canada 
will be included in the programme from 2023.
We intend to deploy the Speak Up programme to our Drax Asia 
colleagues in 2023. In preparation, during the second half of 
2022, we progressed an external legal review of our Speak Up 
policy in relation to Japanese whistleblowing legislation. 
In addition, the Business Ethics team held two virtual awareness-
raising sessions in September 2022 for our MyVoice Forum 
members and Mental Health First Aiders. A Code of Conduct 
eLearning refresher (including Speak Up content) was deployed 
in November 2022 to all UK and US colleagues (although not 
to our colleagues in Canada).

Board leadership of stakeholder engagement
The Board is responsible for engagement with stakeholders. 
It ensures that appropriate time is given to discussing the views 
and feedback from stakeholders and assesses the sufficiency 
of resources available for the Group to effectively engage. 
The Corporate Affairs team maintains a detailed map of the 
Group’s key stakeholders, the concerns they have raised, and 
the date of each meeting with them. 
Members of executive management, including Executive 
Directors, provide regular updates to the Board on key 
stakeholder relations activity, current issues and the relevant 
feedback received from stakeholder interaction. These updates 
ensure the Board’s awareness and inform discussions, with 
members taking these opportunities to assess and challenge 
management’s approach relating to engagement. 
The methods of engagement vary according to the issue and 
stakeholder(s) concerned, and engagement takes place at 
many levels of the business. A judgement is made, case-by-case, 
on the need for engagement by the Board, Executive Committee 
or senior management, or at the operational level. Management 
also keeps under review the relevant stakeholders that may be 
affected by major decisions.
During 2022, the Board received reports on the engagement 
strategy from a range of stakeholders. The topics included 
BECCS and the potential expansion of the Cruachan pumped 
storage power station (see page 95). The Board also considered 
biomass acceptability and strategy, and the possible use of the 
coal units over winter 2022-2023 (see page 107). The CEO’s 
report to the Board regularly includes a section detailing activity 
around key stakeholder relations and the relevant feedback 
received from stakeholder interactions.

Governance
The Board has a duty to promote the success of the Company, 
as set out in Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. Supporting 
this, Board discussions – and papers – for material decisions 
consider the likely impact on stakeholders affected by the 
decisions. This helps to ensure that the interests of all relevant 
stakeholders are considered in decision-making. You can find 
our Section 172 Statement on page 26. 
For more detailed information on our stakeholders and how 
we engage with them, please refer to our Stakeholder 
Engagement section on pages 26 to 33.
Directors’ development and induction
The Board are supported in their development and knowledge 
through a combination of regular presentations from 
management, and informal meetings, that build an understanding 
of the business and sector, or in areas recognised as being 
technically complex. Such training is intended to support a 
deeper understanding and equip the Non-Executive Directors 
with insight into how the Drax approach compares with the 
practices of its peers. 
All new Directors receive a comprehensive and tailored induction 
programme. It includes meetings with key managers, 
international site visits, briefings on key operational matters and 
training with external and internal providers on Board procedures 
and governance matters. Following their appointment in October 
2021, Kim Keating and Erika Peterman completed their induction 
programme during the first half of 2022.
Throughout 2022, the Directors also had access to the advice 
and services of the Group Company Secretary. Directors may 
take independent advice at the Company’s expense, when they 
judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
No such independent advice was sought in 2022.
Board decision-making and stakeholder considerations 
– Extension of coal operations and energy security
In 2020, the Board announced that by 2021 Drax would cease 
the commercial operation of coal for the generation of power. 
This decision was, and remains, an integral part of the delivery 
of our carbon negative strategy. This is also underpinned by the 
further development of generation through the use of viable 
and sustainable alternative fuels. As a consequence of the energy 
crisis and the war in Ukraine, in spring 2022 the UK Government 
requested that Drax consider making available its two coal fired 
units for operation during winter 2022-2023 under a formal 
operational and commercial framework. 
With regular discussions on the matter, the Board diligently 
examined this request and established a sub-Committee 
consisting of the Chair, CEO and CFO. Additionally, a new 
management working group fed into the Executive Committee 
to consider the impact of extended coal operations. Early in the 
process, the Board took advice from key advisers including our 
brokers and our lawyers, Slaughter and May. The analysis 
included scenario-planning and reports on different stakeholders’ 
perspectives and their concerns.
It was emphasised that the aim of operating the coal units, 
if required, was not to generate significant value for the 
Company. Instead, the expectation was to enter into an 
agreement with National Grid ESO that would allow for extended 
coal operations in consideration for a reasonable fee, to ensure 
the Group’s costs were reimbursed, and to ensure additional risks 
which might arise were suitably indemnified. In seeking such a 
structure, management was cognisant of the views of external 
stakeholders, including shareholders. It also took account of the 
Group’s willingness to support the country, businesses, 
and communities in the security of energy supply at a time 
of potential need.
As the Government’s request represented a significant change 
from the Company’s stated strategy, the Board placed significant 
importance on stakeholder views. We gained updates on the 
views of energy customers, employees, NGOs, Ofgem and 
shareholders. We also considered concerns regarding the impact 
on the delivery of BECCS at Drax Power Station and the possible 
reputational impact. After thorough review, the Board concluded 
that it did not expect that a decision to make available the coal 
units over winter 2022-2023 would adversely affect the timing 
of realising BECCS. However, it was noted that the 2023 phase 
of the BECCS project continues to rely heavily on the UK 
Government’s financial model that supports BECCS.
Operationally, the Board considered site and logistics security to 
enable the units to achieve a state of readiness. This included the 
recruitment of experienced contractors and provision of training, 
and the identification of supply chain partners. It was also 
recognised that the amount of coal generation was not 
significant when compared to energy generation from 
sustainable and renewable biomass. Furthermore, and crucially, 
the request related to a short-term challenge to address a 
security of supply issue for the UK’s energy needs.
Throughout its consideration, the Board was cognisant of its 
stated strategy; the Directors remain committed to the cessation 
of the coal operation and to becoming carbon negative by 2030. 
The Board was also respectful of the views of stakeholders both 
within the Company and those outside who were averse to 
enabling the coal assets to be operated. The decision to agree 
to operate the coal units during winter 2022-2023, if required, 
resulted from several factors, including the highly unusual 
circumstances arising from the war in Ukraine. Other factors 
included high levels of energy uncertainty, energy market 
volatility, and the fact that Drax forms a key part of the UK’s 
critical energy infrastructure.
2022 External evaluation of the Board
The Board conducts formal performance evaluations annually. 
These reflect on the continuing effectiveness of its activities and 
the quality of its decisions, and consider the contributions made 
by each Board member. In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code requirements, every third year the Board engages an 
external facilitator to support the review. Board Alchemy 
supported the review in 2019 and Committee performance 
evaluation in 2020. Board Alchemy has no other connection 
with the Group or individual Directors. 
Selection of the provider
In preparing for the 2022 review, the Board agreed that Board 
Alchemy should be re-appointed. In so doing the Board 
recognised that there had been significant changes since the 
previous external review,. These included the appointment 
of two new Non-Executive Directors as well as a transformational 
acquisition and significant change in the activities of the Group 
combined with progression in strategy. Board Alchemy brought 
knowledge of the business and its objectives, and an 
understanding of how the Board had been performing (and its 
goals from three years ago). These insights were considered 
valuable in supporting the present review and allowing a degree 
of continuity that considered how the Board had evolved and 
responded to the changes experienced. Following consideration 
of the style of assessment, reflection and challenge, provided by 
Hanif Barma of Board Alchemy, the Board concluded that he 
was the most appropriate choice of reviewer.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 107
 
Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
The process
Hanif commenced the review by consulting public information 
on the Group. Subsequent conversations with the Goup Company 
Secretary added additional context to the written materials 
and allowed for an assessment of progress since the last external 
review. The Directors completed questionnaires and took part 
in interviews to support discussions on key topics and gain 
feedback. Hanif also met selected members of the Executive 
Committee and observed the September meetings of the Board 
and Remuneration Committee, and the November 2022 meeting 
of the Audit Committee. After collating all feedback, a report was 
presented to the Board at the December 2022 meeting. 
Outcomes
In November 2022, David Nussbaum, Senior Independent 
Director, received feedback from Hanif regarding the Chair’s 
performance; the Chair was not present for this discussion. 
Later in November, David provided feedback to the Chair based 
on the conversation with Hanif. The conclusions of the feedback 
were that the Chair continued to perform well and was an 
effective enabler to the Directors, promoting open dialogue and 
Board roles
The key responsibilities of members of the Board are as follows:
Position
Role
Chair
Responsible for leading and managing the Board, its effectiveness, and governance. Makes sure Board 
members are aware of, and understand, the views and objectives of major shareholders and other 
key stakeholders. Helps to set the tone from the top in terms of the purpose, goal, vision and values for the 
whole organisation.
CEO
Responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, developing the Group’s strategic direction 
for consideration and approval by the Board and implementing the agreed strategy.
CFO
Supports the CEO in developing and implementing strategy, in relation to the financial and operational 
performance of the Group.
Senior Independent 
Non-Executive 
Director
Acts as a sounding board for the Chair and a trusted intermediary for other Directors. Available to discuss any 
concerns with shareholders that cannot be resolved through the normal channels of communication with the 
Chair or the Executive Directors.
Independent 
Non-Executive 
Directors
Responsible for bringing sound judgement and objectivity to the Board’s deliberations and decision-making 
process. Constructively challenge and support the Executive Directors. Monitor the delivery of the strategy 
within the risk and control framework set by the Board.
good engagement amongst Board members. The Directors had 
noted progress in relation to feedback provided the previous year. 
Apart from the topics arising from the separate, overall board 
performance evaluation, the Directors did not identify further 
areas that merited the Chair’s attention. Hanif also met the Chair 
to discuss the performance of individual Directors and the 
comments were fed back to the relevant Directors.
Although there were no high priority actions for the Board, some 
recommendations and suggestions were provided and are set out 
on page 114, alongside the outcomes and actions to be taken 
over the coming year. 
Number of meetings held
The Board and its Committees have regular scheduled meetings 
and hold additional meetings as required to deal with matters as 
they arise. The Board has seven scheduled meetings each year, 
with the Board meeting at least annually to specifically consider 
strategy. Directors are expected, where possible, to attend all 
Board meetings, relevant Committee meetings, the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) and any other General Meetings.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022

Governance
Time commitment
Directors’ commitments outside of Drax are kept under review 
to make sure they have sufficient time to dedicate to the business 
and effectively perform their role. Under the terms of the Chair’s 
letter of appointment, the Chair is expected to commit between 
50 and 70 full days a year to this role. Under the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment, each is expected to commit 
12 to 15 full days a year. That includes attendance at Board 
meetings, the AGM, one annual Board strategy off-site event, 
and at least one site visit each year.
In addition, Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote 
appropriate preparation time ahead of each meeting. The time 
commitment expected in respect of their membership of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees is an additional 
three to four full days a year in each case. However, in practice, 
considerably more time is devoted, particularly by the Chairs 
of the Committees.
Executive Directors may, with the prior approval of the Chair, 
take on one additional role in an external listed company. 
Neither of the Executive Directors have taken on such a role. 
Non-Executive Directors may, with prior approval from the Board, 
take on additional roles provided the individual can continue 
to devote sufficient time to meet the expectations of their role. 
No requests for new external roles have been received from 
the Non-Executive Directors during the year.
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to undertake visits 
to Drax operations and spend time with management and 
the workforce. This is designed to build and then maintain 
their knowledge of the developing business, and to understand 
the operational challenges. Visits undertaken in 2022 enabled 
the Board to assess the effectiveness of actions being taken 
and to scrutinise both the financial and non-financial impacts 
of the pandemic. More information on these visits can be found 
on pages 95 and 96 of the report.
Board composition and independence
The Board has reviewed the independence of each Non-
Executive Director. None of the Non-Executive Directors 
who served during 2022 had any material business or other 
relationship with the Group. In addition, there were no other 
matters likely to affect their independence of character 
and judgement. The Board recognises that, in view of the 
characteristics of independence set out in the Code, length 
of service is an important factor when considering the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors. It also recognises 
that Directors who have served more than nine years may not 
be considered independent. The Board considers all the 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent.
In 2019, the Board selected the MyVoice Forums (MVFs) 
as the most appropriate means to facilitate workforce 
engagement. This decision was informed by the workforce 
forums already existing in parts of the business. These had 
demonstrated a sound basis on which to build a Group-wide 
framework of effective and direct engagement between the 
Board and the workforce. 
Each business unit has a MVF, comprising approximately 
10 colleague representatives. Across the Group, we have 
approximately 50 representatives, drawn from across career 
levels and jobs roles, and representing a range of diversity and 
experience. Collectively, the MVFs form a structured network 
of members across the Group, to ensure all colleagues’ voices 
and views are heard.
The MVF chairs meet quarterly with the Chair and CEO to 
discuss colleague sentiment and to provide feedback on key 
topics. Each of these meetings features a discussion about the 
feedback on topics previously agreed to be important to the 
Board and workforce. Following each meeting, the Chair and 
CEO provide updates to the Board, to make sure all Directors 
understand the views of colleagues and feedback received. 
Engagement with the MVF chairs has been valuable in helping 
the Board gain ongoing feedback as the Group continues 
to evolve.
Topics discussed in 2022 included our return to offices 
following the Covid-19 pandemic and the move towards hybrid 
working. The Chair and CEO also gained feedback on internal 
events which had taken place and which were designed to 
raise awareness and encourage discussion about inclusion 
(Black History Month and Neurodiversity). Other topics 
included Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on energy 
prices; the rising cost-of-living; Drax Power Station running 
coal; and biomass sustainability. The forums offer a safe space 
in which to address direct questions raised by the MVF chairs, 
and to discuss important issues. 
The MVFs continue to be a key part of our listening strategy 
and work in tandem with the MyVoice engagement survey. 
The forums provide valuable, deeper insight to the survey 
themes and deliver further input to the resulting action plans. 
Following the 2021 engagement survey, our MVFs provided 
valuable insight concerning career and growth opportunities. 
The engagement and feedback from the forums helped to 
shape and drive our plans, which has resulted in a 4% rise in 
favourable responses in the 2022 MyVoice survey compared 
to 2021. 
Each week, the CEO sends an email to the entire workforce 
with an update on what he and the business have been doing, 
and with answers to colleague questions. During 2022, 
the CEO received over 1,900 questions on topics including the 
rising cost-of-living, and the impact on electricity generators 
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, wider political changes 
and UK windfall taxes.

In addition to the topics discussed earlier in the 
Corporate Governance Report, the Board considered 
the following key items in 2022.
Board strategy event
• Over a two-day period in October 2022, the Board 
conducted its annual deep dive into strategy. The two days 
included presentations from management and discussions 
with various internal stakeholders from across the 
organisation. The sessions provided insight into market 
context, opportunities for the growth of the Group, 
including the deployment of BECCS internationally and 
explanation of key stakeholders involved in supporting the 
Group’s plans. Discussions were also held on sustainability 
and the capabilities to enable the realisation of the Group’s 
plans for growth using sustainable biomass. 
Health, safety and wellbeing
• In April 2022, following a visit by several Directors to a 
selection of the North American sites, the Board discussed 
working practices and agreed that efforts to harmonise 
health and safety standards across all the Group’s 
operations should be ongoing. In November 2022, 
the Remuneration Committee agreed that a safety KPI 
be reintroduced to the 2023 bonus scorecard. You can read 
more about this in the Remuneration Committee Report 
on page 156.
Operations
• Considered and approved the development of, and 
investment in, BECCS.
• Considered and approved the planning process to develop 
an additional underground pumped hydro storage power 
station at Cruachan – with the potential for more than 
doubling the electricity generating capacity at that site.
• Considered the risks related to the Government’s request 
to operate the coal units if called upon, over winter 
2022/23. See page 107 for more information.

Introduction
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2022.
The Nomination Committee has overall responsibility for people 
matters, with a particular focus on Board level and senior 
management. To support the long-term success of the Company, 
the Committee also assesses the adequacy of internal processes. 
These processes concern reviewing and evolving the balance of 
skills, experience and diversity required which increasingly takes 
account of the Group’s extended global footprint. The work 
includes challenging executive management on whether the 
capabilities within the organisation are sufficient, and the steps 
being taken to ensure appropriate assessment and forward 
planning takes place to support the delivery of the Group’s 
strategy. The work also covers succession, through the 
development of existing talent and identification of alternative 
talent sources that might be outside the Group. Board members 
and senior management must be able to deliver the Group’s 
purpose, and in conjunction with supporting and enabling that 
realisation consistent with our values, and to do so with due 
regard for the requirements of Drax’s stakeholders.

Governance
Nominations Committee Report continued
Given the growing international presence and complexity of Drax, 
the Committee recognises the importance of having effective 
measures in place, embedded within the regular considerations 
and actions of the business that ensure management properly 
understand the requirements of our business. Drax requires people 
with new skill sets and experience in activities which the Group 
may not previously have undertaken. For example, delivering 
options for BECCS in North America continues to progress and, 
in 2023, we will be growing our teams in North America (including 
into new states in the US). In September 2022, we welcomed 
new colleagues at Drax Princeton (Princeton Standard Pellet 
Corporation), a site that will assist in our efforts to reach 8Mt p.a. 
of sustainable biomass pellets by 2030. During 2022, we also 
opened a sales office in Japan; the first time the Group has had a 
presence in Asia. This is an exciting step towards our strategy to 
increase biomass sales in the Asian markets. These developments 
demonstrate the significance of building strength amongst 
our colleagues, including senior management.
A priority for the Board and Nomination Committee is assessing 
how these developments in the business align with the Group’s 
imperative of broadening diversity in the enlarged Group. We are 
also conscious of taking into account the local communities 
in which we operate, trends across wider society, and the ability 
of the Group – and its people – to adapt. We recognise that such 
work has its challenges, and the Board is committed to playing 
a role in shaping that activity. It is also dedicated to ensuring 
diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to the 
recruitment, retention, career progression and personal 
development activities across the business. We recognise 
that such activity is central to enabling the right culture and 
values of the Group, and to long-term success. 
Succession planning and diversity
I was appointed to the Company as a Non-Executive Director in 
January 2015 and appointed to the position of Chair in April 2015. 
Since my appointment to the Board in January 2015 I have seen 
Drax change and grow, establishing itself as a business that is not 
only a key part of the UK’s national infrastructure, but also leading 
new ways of supporting businesses and communities using 
innovative, reliable and sustainable sources of power generation. 
My third and final three-year term is due to expire in December 
2023. As part of the 2020 review into my re-appointment for that 
final term, the Committee proposed the search for a successor 
should start early enough to allow for a thorough recruitment 
process. This is intended to facilitate an overlap period when 
the Chair-designate could join the Board with sufficient time 
to complete a meaningful onboarding process. 
A robust process is in place to support the structured succession 
and to ensure objectivity. Our Senior Independent Director leads 
this and I will continue to provide input, as requested. Additional 
time and focus has been given by Nomination Committee members 
to discuss these matters, forming part of Board meetings and 
informally outside of meetings. Firstly, following a rigorous review 
of an initial six advisers by a subset of the Nomination Committee, 
four firms were invited to present. Following those presentations 
to the subset of the Committee, Heidrick and Struggles were 
appointed in October 2022. A key advantage of this firm has 
been its ability to conduct an international search, reflecting the 
structure of our growing Group across the US, Canada, Asia and 
Europe. Our structure also brings a level of complexity, so the 
search will include candidates with experience in large multi-
national groups. It should be noted that Heidrick and Struggles 
is signed up to The Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms, which ensures it factors diversity considerations 
into its recruitment advice and has no other engagement with 
the Group or conflict which would impact their role.
During 2022, the Committee also reviewed and updated the 
Board Diversity Policy (the ‘Policy’), with due regard for the 
FCA Policy Statement on diversity and inclusion on Boards and 
in executive management. The Policy states the Company’s 
support for the recommendations from the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review and the Parker Review. It also confirms our objective 
to maintain at least 40% female director representation and 
to have at least one director from an ethnic minority. As shown 
on page 106, these targets are currently fulfilled. The Policy also 
highlights that the Board believes a commitment to diversity 
and inclusion is fundamental to achieving our strategic goals 
and delivering a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. 
While recognising the steps already taken on diversity, the Board 
and Nomination Committee are conscious this remains an 
important element of ensuring the appropriate balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience. Members of the Board also continue to 
be strong advocates for enabling positive and constructive change 
in the wider workforce, which recognises the value from diversity. 
Each year, the Committee reviews the Group’s measures to enable 
succession planning and assesses alignment with the Group’s 
strategy and the realisation of its objectives. This relates to the 
skills, capabilities and experience needed to deliver our strategy. 
The review includes identifying colleagues with the potential 
to progress into more senior roles, across a timeframe of one to 
five years. It also incorporates factors such as technical skills, 
experience, behaviours and attitudes. The most recent meeting 
considering these matters in depth was held in November 2022. 
The Board is of the view that high performing companies are 
enabled by greater diversity and has challenged management 
on the need for effective recruitment, onboarding and career 
development programmes that ensure diversity is proactively 
included. We remain of the view more needs to be done 
in these areas.
The review also included an assessment of the time required 
for identified candidates to be ready to assume more senior roles. 
During the discussions, the Committee offered views on the 
importance of providing each of the candidates with appropriate 
training. Management outlined the training implemented during 
2022, how its evolution would encompass a wider cross-section 
of employees, and how targeted training supports them in their 
personal development. The Committee asked to be kept updated 
in 2023 to understand the progress being made. In addition, the 
Committee endorsed the need for ensuring there was a suitable 
level of understanding about the technical requirements of roles 
identified. Importantly this should take account of emerging 
technologies, as well as capabilities in new types of markets – 
for example markets for Carbon Offsets, in which the Group 
will need to participate and how such areas might inform 
recruitment processes.
As part of the succession review, the Committee discussed 
the Group’s progress on gender diversity. This included work 
to identify talent earlier in career paths, for example by focusing 
on diversity data when hiring new employees and converting 
diverse job applicants into new hires. In 2022, the Company 
also set up partnerships to help attract diverse candidates. 
We adopted female-biased language when advertising for 
Apprentice Engineers, which resulted in an increase to the 
number of female applicants and subsequent engineer hires. 
The proportion of female apprentices increased, from 14% at 
the end of 2021 to 21% at the end of 2022. A ratio of one female 
to every four male apprentices is progress but we believe more 
needs to be done. During 2022, we also launched our Senior 
Leadership Development offering to support the growth of 
our senior leaders. This involves having a consultation with 
our internal leadership development experts to co-create 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022

bespoke development journeys. Options available to employees 
include a diagnosis of development needs through psychometrics 
and 360-degree feedback and sourcing an executive coach 
or mentor. Options also include support in sourcing formal 
qualifications within a newly-created programme, which 
would be subject to evaluation and feedback. A total of 84 senior 
leaders took advantage of this offering in 2022, and we hope 
the number will continue to grow throughout 2023.
Currently, out of a total of ten Executive Committee members 
at 31 December 2022, four (40%) are female. No changes to the 
members of the Executive Committee were made during 2022. 
You can see more details about our Executive Committee 
members here: www.drax. com/about-us/corporate-governance/
board-and-committees/.
The Board and senior management continue to recognise that 
Drax needs to do more, at all levels of the business, to support 
people from diverse backgrounds. The 2023 plan goes beyond 
gender, with a clear commitment to a supportive, diverse and 
inclusive working environment where you can be yourself and 
your contribution matters. We continue to invest additional 
resources into this important area with the recruitment and 
onboarding of a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) team. 
To engage colleagues more broadly with DE&I, and encourage 
consideration of the issues while taking positive steps to influence 
culture and behaviours, a series of key events took place. This 
included the Group marking Black History month in February 
2022. At the start of the month, Non-Executive Director Erika 
Peterman recorded a personal video message for colleagues, 
and there was a live panel event where colleagues shared their 
experiences. Work was also undertaken to align the wellbeing 
strategy with inclusion, recognising the intrinsic link between 
an individual’s sense of wellbeing and belonging. The organisation 
has also recognised the National Day for Truth & Reconciliation in 
Canada and held neurodiversity awareness events. The Colleague 
Resource Groups (CRGs) that represent gender, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, and neurodiversity were launched in August 2022 and 
began recruiting for Chairs, sponsors and regional representatives. 
The goal is to further drive employee engagement, safety and 
wellbeing, and the work will continue into 2023. The groups aim to 
attract colleagues from across all our regions, to increase visibility, 
engagement and understanding about a range of topics.
The Nomination Committee and Board receives updates on 
management programmes to encourage a diverse workforce to 
pursue careers and qualifications that fit with the opportunities 
that Drax offers. These include apprenticeship schemes, training 
programmes, and experience days where young people can learn 
more about what we do and the roles available. The activities are 
an important part of our role in the industry, and they allow for 
two-way engagement. Our five-year programme with Selby 
College, which we started in 2020, continues and we have regular 
partnership meetings where we discuss opportunities for both 
parties to work together. The college has also delivered a course on 
BECCS and rolled it out to colleagues within the business; further 
cohorts are planned for 2023. In addition, the college continues 
to deliver our upskilling Engineering Manufacturing Technician 
Apprenticeship and we currently have 17 students on the course. 
The college also provides other engineering-related training.
Non-Executive Directors: terms of appointment
Under the Board’s policy, Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for an initial term of three years, which can be renewed by mutual 
agreement. For this to happen, the Board must be satisfied with 
the director’s performance and commitment, and a resolution 
to re-elect at the appropriate AGM be successful. The Board 
will not normally extend the aggregate period of service of any 
independent Non-Executive Director beyond nine years. 
What’s more, the Board will rigorously review any proposal to 
extend a Non-Executive Director’s aggregate period of office 
beyond six years.
In 2022, the Board considered the re-appointment of John 
Baxter, for a second term of three years. The Board considered 
John’s skills and contribution, together with the feedback 
from the externally-supported evaluations of the Board and 
our Committees. Following this, and on recommendation from 
the Non-Executive Directors, the Board approved the extension 
of his appointment for a further three years, taking effect 
from 16 April 2022.
Board and Committee evaluation
The Board conducts an annual performance evaluation, 
ensures there are ongoing Board development activities, and 
provides a comprehensive induction for new Board members. 
In 2022, an externally-facilitated evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees was conducted by Board Alchemy. There is 
a detailed update on the Board evaluation process on page 107 
and 108. 
The external performance evaluator – Hanif Barma at Board 
Alchemy – commented in his report on the Board’s progress 
regarding director diversity, since his last performance review 
in 2019. Pleasingly, feedback included in Hanif’s 2022 review 
as provided by the Directors, is that both our Non-Executive 
Directors who were appointed in 2021 – Kim Keating and 
Erika Peterman – have made valuable contributions to the 
quality of Board discussions.
The evaluation also determined that the Board and Committees 
were led well by effective, inclusive chairs. It was also concluded 
that the Board and Committee members had the requisite skills 
and experience to provide valuable contributions and effective 
challenge. Hanif also highlighted the progress made regarding 
Director diversity. At its meeting in December, the Board assessed 
the performance evaluation report and progress in responding to 
the open recommendations from previous evaluations. The table 
on page 114 summarises progress from the most recent 
evaluations and how we responded to them in 2022. 
The Nomination Committee is aware of the importance of ensuring 
existing Board members continue to develop their understanding 
as the Group evolves. This is highlighted in a recommendation 
from the independent performance review reported to the Board 
in December. One area identified was to consider ‘refresher’ 
training sessions on hedging strategy, trading and energy 
commodity markets.
Recommendations from previously-raised Board and Committee 
evaluations have been addressed, with certain items involving 
continued work and focus. 
Previously-identified needs included making the best use of the 
Board’s time to enable Directors to make the fullest contribution, 
and the processes around induction and obtaining external 
viewpoints. Improvements in the quality of papers submitted to, 
and presentations delivered by management at Board meetings 
were highlighted as potential remedies; efforts to refine and 
develop Board packs continue. During the October 2022 Board 
strategy meetings, the Board were complimentary on the 
progress the business had made in developing meeting materials 
and enabling informative discussions that resulted from them. 
As the business evolves and grows, the focus will be on the Board 
papers and what new and additional information is required 
to ensure ongoing rigour.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 113
 
Governance
A summary of the key recommendations from the Board and Committee evaluations, and proposed actions, is provided below: 
Recommendation
Comments
1.
Provide ‘refresher’ development to Board non-executives 
in areas relating to hedging strategy plus trading and 
commodity markets. Adopt a structured approach 
to determining training needs for Board members.
During 2023 a number of training sessions will take place and 
Directors will be consulted on any individual training needs.
2.
Enable Board members to visit Drax assets more regularly, 
particularly since this has been difficult in recent years. 
Members should use visits as an opportunity to engage 
with staff.
The Board agrees that Non-Executive Directors would benefit 
from visiting at least one asset per year, outside of the usual 
schedule Board trips. 
3.
Consider using the Chair succession exercise to meet new 
requirement for a woman to hold one of the four senior 
roles on the Board.
Diversity is actively being considered as part of the recruitment 
process. Heidrick and Struggles are also signed up to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.
4.
Obtain specific feedback from Board members about how 
to further improve papers submitted to the Board.
Directors will be consulted about meeting materials.
5.
Ensure less-experienced members of the management 
team who present papers to the Board are consistently 
well-briefed and adequately prepared.
This action is part of an ongoing initiative to provide the 
opportunity for the Board to meet with a wider cross section 
of employees as part of routine business. From 2023 additional 
support will be provided to new presenters.
6.
Establish formal terms of reference for the Independent 
Advisory Board (IAB) to Drax, then regularly review and 
update them.
Terms of reference are in place and were last reviewed by the 
IAB in September 2022. They will be considered by the Board 
in 2023.
7.
The Board should discuss the merits of establishing a 
Sustainability Committee and, if the decision is to proceed, 
consider the timing of its launch and its remit.
The Board have asked the CEO to evaluate the potential 
contribution of a separate sustainability committee, including 
its objectives, constituent members and the degree of 
oversight provided by the Board to its conduct of business. 
This will be considered further by the Board in 2023.
8.
Give attention to the development of a digital strategy to 
support the broader business strategy and purpose of Drax.
A digital strategy will be developed and presented to the Board 
in 2023.
9.
At Board level, undertake a ‘lessons learned’ review of the 
Pinnacle acquisition and establish the practice of 
conducting similar reviews on a regular basis.
An initial paper on lessons learned should be presented to the 
Executive Committee, following which a Board discussion will 
be held in 2023.
10.
Consider resuming the practice of holding occasional Board 
meetings away from the London head office.
The Board agree that at least one Board meeting each year 
should be held at a different site. In addition, a Board visit to 
Cruachan Power Station is planned for June 2023.
11.
The Board should seek management views about how the 
Non-Executive Directors might better support the 
Executive in stakeholder management.
In 2022 the Board discussed how Non-Executive Directors 
could participate in stakeholder engagement beyond the 
regular work of the Chair. A Board paper detailing peer 
methods of engagement will be considered in 2023.
12.
The Board should discuss how to evolve support for local 
communities, particularly through the creation of 
employment opportunities for minority groups.
A paper detailing support opportunities will be presented to 
the Executive Committee, following which a Board discussion 
will be held in 2023.
13.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference should 
include a responsibility to annually review the performance 
of the remuneration consultants.
The terms of reference were updated and approved at the 
the February 2023 Remuneration Committee.

Renewal and re-election
Any newly appointed Director may hold office until the first AGM 
following their appointment. At that meeting, they must submit 
themselves for election by shareholders. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
and in line with the recommendations of the Code, each of the 
Directors will retire annually and offer themselves for re-election 
by shareholders at the AGM. The evaluation and review of the 
Board and its Committees, described above, concluded that each 
Director continues to demonstrate commitment, management 
and business expertise in their particular role. They continue 
to perform effectively. Accordingly, John Baxter, Philip Cox, 
Will Gardiner, Nicola Hodson, Kim Keating, David Nussbaum, 
Erika Peterman, Andy Skelton and Vanessa Simms will all retire 
at the forthcoming AGM. Being eligible, they will offer themselves 
for re-election. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
(by prior arrangement) during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office. They will also be available for 
inspection at the venue of the AGM, before that meeting takes 
place. Details are contained in the Notice of Meeting.
During the year, I met regularly with the Non-Executive Directors 
in the absence of the Executive Directors. Separately, the Senior 
Independent Director held a meeting with the Non-Executive 
Directors without me being present, as required by Provision 12 
of the Code.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Nomination 
Committee.
Philip Cox CBE 
Chair of the Nomination Committee 
22 February 2023
Embedding the Company’s values and culture within the wider 
workforce is an area of continued focus. The Board’s imperative 
of ensuring culture, values and behaviours is appreciated, and 
evidenced in many legacy operations, needs to continue to be 
embedded in the American and Canadian assets. As the business 
grows, it will also be important to understand and embrace the 
breadth of diversity in the communities where we operate, 
ensuring that people from diverse backgrounds feel supported 
and we learn from colleagues inside and stakeholders outside 
about how we as a Group can grow. There is more information 
about our work with local communities on pages 28 to 33.
Skills and knowledge of the Board
A key responsibility of the Committee is ensuring the Board 
maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
appropriate to the long-term operation of the business and 
strategy delivery. The Nomination Committee has reviewed the 
Board’s composition, considering whether it has:
• The right mix of skills, experience and diversity
• An appropriate balance of Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors
• Non-Executive Directors who can commit sufficient time to 
the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively
Following the review, the Committee was satisfied that the Board 
continued to have an appropriate mix of skills and experience to 
operate effectively, now and for the future. All the Directors have 
many years of experience, gained from a broad variety of 
businesses. Collectively they bring a range of expertise and 
sector knowledge to Board deliberations, which encourages 
constructive, challenging and insightful discussions.
The Board at Drax does many things well but most striking 
for me was the Board’s mindset. It thinks broadly and deeply 
about how it does things, and is willing to challenge itself about 
the way it works. It is proactive but, as circumstances change, 
this mindset means it also reacts and responds with positive 
engagement from board members; the Board looks at things 
from different perspectives and reflects on feedback that 
it receives. Embracing diversity and inclusion has been an 
important enabler of this outcome, and this operates at two 
levels. Boardroom diversity is a key strength and, for example, 
the Board has responded to Drax’s shift from UK to global 
business by internationalising the Board. The Board also actively 
promotes organisational diversity, understanding that this will 
underpin the business’s long-term success. It engages actively 
with staff through the MyVoice Forum and asset visits, seeking 
to understand staff viewpoints. It is now striving for greater 
participation of local and indigenous communities in Drax’s 
workforce.” Hanif Barma, Board Alchemy

Audit Committee report
Introduction
The role of the Audit Committee is to provide oversight of the 
financial reporting process, the internal and external audit 
process, the Group’s system of risk management and internal 
control, and compliance with laws and regulations. This is to 
ensure transparent and accurate reporting that covers financial 
and operational performance and future prospects, and robust 
wider business controls required for the day-to-day conduct of all 
aspects of its business. Through this activity the Committee also 
assesses whether stakeholders are able to gain a fair and 
balanced understanding of how the Group is performing, its 
underlying resilience, and the effectiveness of the governance 
applied in the conduct of its business. 
Such work is particularly important in times of volatility and 
uncertainty. 2022 saw continued macro-economic and geo-
political challenges that have affected many aspects of society. 
This has included the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the global 
energy crisis and inflationary pressures; each of which have 
impacted businesses and consumers. In such times, management 
have a responsibility to link the sound business practices 
mentioned above with proactively understanding and responding 
to the immediate challenges affecting our stakeholders and wider 
society. In turn, the Audit Committee considers the robustness of 
the process in making those decisions, challenges management 
on the tracking and assessment of emerging risks and evaluates 
the appropriateness of controls, including potential required 
changes required to those controls.
As described by Will Gardiner in his CEO report, on page 12, 
2022 saw Drax continue to invest in delivering on its strategy 
and purpose. Progress made included, developing options for 
BECCS; commissioning of additional operational capacity of pellet 
production in North America; and delivering growth across our 
commercial operations. In so doing our employees worked 
exceptionally hard, responding to challenges such as securing 
the required volume of biomass to meet the demand of our plant 
in the UK and to fulfil third party supply contracts; working with 
customers facing uncertainty in meeting their energy bills; and 
developing the commercial frameworks that could support our

BECCS programme. In addition, colleagues responded to the 
impact on the UK of the energy crisis, in particular helping 
to bolster the country’s energy security by providing a 
“winter contingency” service, making available for operation 
the coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to support 
the UK power system for the winter of 2022-2023 should they 
be called upon to operate.
Considering how to respond to the UK Government’s request for 
a winter contingency, requiring Drax to provide the operational 
readiness of the Group’s coal-fired generation units, was a key 
activity in 2022. We speak more about this process in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 102. The evaluation 
involved consideration of multiple issues, which included the 
risks of ensuring the assets would be capable of operating if 
called upon by National Grid. The Audit Committee supported 
the Board in considering these issues. At our meeting held in July, 
management were asked to report back to the Board in the 
autumn on actual steps taken to ensure operational readiness 
and the mitigation of identified risks, on which they reported in 
November 2022. This allowed us to further assess the adequacy 
of steps taken and follow through on actions implemented which 
sought to mitigate identified features.
2022 began against a backdrop of increasing tensions in Ukraine, 
and the subsequent invasion by Russia in February 2022. 
With the introduction of sanctions regimes, Drax acted quickly 
to secure alternative sources of biomass to replace those of 
Russian and Belarusian origin. During the year, the Committee 
was appraised of the work being undertaken to transition 
to alternate sources, including the steps being taken by 
management to be assured of sustainable sourcing. This included 
reviewing the biomass acceptability principal risk, and the level 
of independent assurance obtained. More information on our 
sustainable sourcing practices can be found on page 40, 
and more information on our biomass acceptability risks 
can be found on page 86.
Geo-political tensions have further increased the threat of 
disruption to businesses and organisations from cyber-attacks. 
Our response to cyber threats is an important part of assessing 
the effectiveness of our internal controls. We explain in more 
detail our evaluation and response to cyber risks on pages 80 
and 91. During 2022 the Committee received reports on cyber 
security and cyber risk management. This included both the 
threat assessment and the actions being taken, including the 
levels of future investment required in people, processes and 
systems. We also received information on the level of 
sophistication of threat activists. For example, the Committee 
considered the breadth of different attack strategies and the 
data captured on the form of such attacks.
The Group’s generation assets form part of the UK’s critical 
national infrastructure, and Drax is designated as an Operator 
of Essential Services. As such, Drax is required to maintain 
a defined level of resilience to defend against potential cyber-
attacks. The Committee considered a report in April 2022 
on how management is meeting its regulatory obligations and 
comparing the internal status to updated benchmark guidance 
from the UK Government. In November 2022 the Committee 
also considered a detailed report from the cyber security function 
on our independently assessed current state of preparedness, 
and recommendations on how to continue to enhance our 
capabilities, reflecting the evolving requirements of regulators 
in addition to management’s own understanding of the emerging 
risks. The Committee will monitor actions resulting from these 
reviews at future meetings. 
The Committee discussed the strength of the team, their 
experience and operational capabilities to evaluate the evolving 
threats and to implement the required resilience, in addition to the 
training and awareness promoted across the wider organisation 
to cyber-attacks. The Committee will continue to assess whether 
the capabilities of the team are at the appropriate level to maintain 
the required level of resilience. The Committee and Board have 
been supportive of enhancements including additional investment 
and recruitment as part of responding to the emerging threats.
Another consequence of the conflict in Ukraine has been 
to significantly increase volatility in global commodity markets. 
As discussed on page 80 this volatility increases certain risks 
to the Group, including those associated with an unplanned 
outage on our generating assets. The Committee was updated 
at each of their meetings during 2022 on how these increased 
risks are being managed, and the additional mitigations 
introduced by management to assess whether balanced 
and proportionate actions were being taken. 
The Committee receives periodic reports on the work to assess 
compliance with material regulations or policy pertaining to the 
Group’s activities. During 2022, this covered areas including cyber 
security, safety, and sustainability supported by reports from 
management and, where appropriate, subject matter experts.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its 
oversight responsibilities. This includes undertaking the following:
• Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and other 
information provided to shareholders
• Reviewing significant financial reporting issues and

The Committee allows time at each meeting to speak in the 
absence of management or advisers. In addition, the Committee 
meets both the external auditor and the internal auditor without 
management present. Where required, this allows the Committee 
members to discuss areas for attention and identify potential 
areas of challenge. The Committee’s understanding with both 
the external and internal auditor is that, if they should at any time 
become aware of any matter giving them material concern, 
they should promptly draw it to the Committee’s attention via 
the Chair of the Committee. No such issues were raised in 2022. 
The feedback from the recent Board and Committee evaluation is 
that such discussions support transparency and positive discussion.
Review of Committee effectiveness
In line with the FRC’s Guidance on Committees, the effectiveness 
of the Audit Committee is periodically considered. During the 
autumn of 2022, an external review was undertaken of the Board 
and its Committees, including the Audit Committee (see page 107 
for further details). The review concluded that the Audit 
Committee continued to work well. Meetings are chaired well; 
the Committee Chair is inclusive and encourages contributions 
from Committee members, who contribute freely, provide good 
challenge and ask pertinent questions. There is good engagement 
and positive relationships with both the external auditor and 
the internal auditor. High quality papers are produced to support 
the meetings and Committee members have fed back positively 
on the information they receive. The respective Committee 
Chairs work together well and coordinate when necessary 
(one such example being on target setting and assessment 
of reward outcomes for performance related incentives) to avoid 
a siloed approach to the work of the Committees. An internal 
review will be conducted in 2023.
Committee activities in 2022
The Committee follows a programme of work designed to 
ensure that sound risk management processes, a robust system 
of internal control and fair and balanced external reporting are 
in place. The Committee undertakes its duties reflecting an 
annual work plan, which is agreed at the final meeting each year 
for the following calendar year. In addition, where appropriate 
to activities in the Group or to reflect changes in applicable 
regulations or external conditions, agenda items are incorporated 
to ensure members of the Committee have the opportunity to 
consider and contribute to an analysis of material issues. The 
main areas of work undertaken by the Committee during 2022 
at its routinely scheduled meetings are set out in the table below.
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of risk management and internal controls
The Committee received updates on the Group’s risk 
management and internal control environment and reviewed 
internal audit reports at each of the four meetings held during 
2022. It gave particular focus to the emerging risks arising from 
the conflict in Ukraine and ongoing volatility within commodity 
markets, and how management were responding.
At its meeting in April, the Committee considered in detail how 
management had responded to the emerging risks from the 
conflict in Ukraine, including the formation of a working group, 
detailed tracking of risks, and the escalation of key items to 
the Executive Committee and Board as appropriate. In addition, 
a deep-dive was performed into the impact of the conflict 
on cyber security risks, incorporating information provided 
by external parties, and considering the actions both already 
taken and planned in response.
Audit Committee Report continued

Governance
The Committee took part in several other deep-dive risk and 
internal control reviews during the year including wider cyber 
security risks, ethics and business conduct, health and safety, 
and climate change and sustainability. As part of the latter review, 
the Committee challenged management on the level of external 
assurance and verification of the data and statements included 
in the Group’s external reporting. Following this, and a review 
of management’s risk assessment, the Committee were satisfied 
with the level of assurance being provided.
Where the Committee feels it is of value, external parties are 
engaged to support with subject matter deep-dive reviews and 
those parties may be asked to attend Committee meetings to 
provide additional expertise and insight. For example, DNV 
Limited attended the meeting of the Committee in November 
2022 to provide an update on their internal audit work around 
health, safety and environment, and their key findings. 
Alongside the expert support provided by these external parties, 
management also co-ordinates an ongoing self-assessment and 
review of risk management and internal control activities 
covering the Group’s principal risks. Control owners are required 
to provide a quarterly assessment on the operation of key 
controls, and to detail any potential gaps or control failures 
identified. These responses are then reviewed by a separate 
internal team, and the assessments of control operation and 
effectiveness are periodically verified. 
This assessment is performed against the broader context of 
changes in both the underlying risks and also the environment in 
which the Group is operating, and considers whether prevailing 
controls remain appropriate. To support this, the Committee 
regularly reviews a detailed Assurance Map for the Group, 
covering each of the Principal Risks. This documents the different 
levels of assurance that are in place, and how they are structured. 
It also provides management’s assessment of whether the overall 
level of assurance is appropriate, or has areas that require 
addressing. The Committee challenges management on this 
assessment and identifies any areas that they feel require further 
assurance, giving guidance or instruction on how that should be 
provided, where necessary. 
Having reviewed the latest Assurance Map at their meeting in 
November 2022, the Committee was satisfied that there were no 
significant gaps in the levels of assurance maintained by Group. 
The Committee recognised the need for continued focus on the 
assurance around biomass acceptability, climate change and 
political and regulatory principal risks, as these areas are rapidly 
changing and can have a significant impact on the Group. Several 
actions were agreed at the meeting, to be implemented in 2023, 
including the further development of second-line assurance in 
these areas. Additional detail on the Group’s Principal Risks and 
key mitigations can be found on page 78.
As noted above, conditions in energy markets remained volatile 
during 2022, and what initially appeared to be short-term 
pressure on prices at the start of 2022 became more prolonged. 
This has exposed the Group to the risk of an increased financial 
cost from an unplanned outage were such an event to occur, 
and can also present challenges in respect of liquidity and credit, 
requiring careful management. 
The Committee received updates on the impact of these changes 
during the year, and the mitigating actions being taken by 
management to manage these evolving risks. This included the 
outputs from scenario and liquidity planning and stress testing 
to consider whether established trading, risk management, and 
plant operational policies remained appropriate in light of market 
conditions. The oversight and management of these risks falls 
under the remit of the Financial Risk Management Committee, 
(as detailed on page 103). The Committee was satisfied with 
the mitigating controls implemented to manage the underlying 
risks, and that potential future scenarios were being 
appropriately considered.
The Committee also works with the internal auditor, KPMG, 
to assess the broader system of risk management and internal 
control. The annual internal audit plan is designed with input 
from the Committee and wider management, and focuses on 
key areas of risk for the Group. This provides the Committee 
with an additional independent perspective on whether the key 
controls mitigating these risks remain appropriate and effective. 
Where appropriate, the internal auditor will provide detailed 
recommendations to improve the systems of risk management 
and internal control. Further detail on the role of internal audit 
is provided on page 125.
Updates provided to the Committee by management on risk 
management and internal controls during 2022 included financial 
reporting, and the continued development of the Group’s 
financial control framework. This framework takes a risk-based 
approach to defining required levels of internal financial control, 
focused on mitigating the risk of material misstatement arising in 
the financial statements, due to either error or fraud. During 2022 
the focus of this work was on continuing to drive consistency 
and best practice across the Group, and in particular aligning 
the approach across the Pinnacle operations, acquired in 2021. 
Significant work was also undertaken around the financial 
systems roadmap for the Group and on developing plans 
to harmonise and streamline approaches, with a focus on 
automation of controls where possible. 
The continued enhancement of the financial control framework 
forms part of the Group’s overall response to the corporate 
governance reforms proposed by BEIS (“Restoring trust in audit 
and corporate governance”). At meetings during 2022, the 
Committee received updates from the internal auditor on the 
latest developments in this area and discussed the planned 
approach in responding to potential future changes. This was 
supported by a deep-dive review at the meeting held in 
November 2022, which included an update on management’s 
plans and the progress against these, as well as an assessment 
of the areas likely to require most focus in 2023. The Committee 
was satisfied with the progress being made in this area, and that 
the proposals published by BEIS are being appropriately 
considered and addressed by management.
As part of its routine business, the Committee review and discuss 
findings and action points arising from the internal and external 
reviews that are performed, to assess whether improvement 
plans are suitably robust and have appropriate delivery targets. 
None of the findings discussed during 2022 were considered 
individually or collectively material to the financial performance, 
results, operations, or controls of the business, but the 
assessments did identify opportunities for future improvements. 
Areas highlighted include how learnings from past health and 
safety events can be more rapidly incorporated into future 
working practices, and how access to automated systems 
must continue to evolve, including multifactor authentication.
The Committee considered information arising from internal 
whistleblowing reports. It discussed with management the scope 
of any investigation and challenged on the appropriateness of 
the steps being taken in response. The Board was also updated 
on these reviews separately. The Committee seeks to understand 
how matters identified in incidents inform training for colleagues 
and how actions by management can improve culture within our 
operations. An explanation of the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy 
can be found on page 105.

Reviewing key judgements and financial 
reporting matters
Explanations of all the Group’s material accounting policies, 
critical accounting judgements, areas of significant estimation 
uncertainty and other material financial reporting matters are 
set out in the notes to the financial statements. The Committee 
reviewed these aspects of the financial statements, with 
a particular focus on the areas it deemed the most complex 
or subjective, as highlighted in the table below. In addition, 
the Committee considered how these matters are disclosed 
within the Annual Report and Accounts, to ensure that 
appropriate context and explanations are provided.
At each of its meetings the Committee receives a Financial 
Reporting and Accounting update from management, covering 
any key changes in the period, as well as emerging issues. These 
updates also incorporate any updated guidance or clarifications 
issued by bodies such as the FRC or FCA and management’s 
assessment of the impact on the Group and the timing of any 
planned response. These papers are discussed with the external 
auditor in advance of the Committee meetings, ensuring that they 
have the opportunity to consider and provide their own views 
on the matters raised. This includes highlighting alternative 
approaches or accounting treatments to the Committee, to assist 
their consideration of management’s conclusions and proposals.
Description
Audit Committee review and conclusion
Accounting for derivative financial instruments
As described more fully on page 252, the Group makes use 
of derivative financial instruments to manage key financial risks 
facing the Group.
The Group’s balance sheet includes significant assets and liabilities 
arising from these contractual arrangements that are measured at 
fair value by virtue of being within the scope of IFRS 9. Judgement 
is required around which contracts meet specific criteria and which 
do not (and therefore remain outside the scope of IFRS 9) and may 
also be required in the valuation methodology applied, where 
different approaches or sources of input information may be adopted. 
A judgement is made that biomass contracts continue to fall outside 
the scope of IFRS 9, primarily due to the illiquid nature of the market 
and the contractual terms in place between counterparties. 
The market remains immature and there is not a readily accessible 
source of supply and demand at present.
Where a fair value calculation is required, this typically involves 
a mark-to-market calculation, comparing the contractual price to 
prevailing market rates. As described on page 87, during 2022 there 
has been significant volatility in several of the markets most relevant 
to the Group, including power and foreign currency.
The result of this volatility is that the valuation of these contracts 
has been subject to significant fluctuations during the year. The size 
and scope of the Group’s derivative portfolio means that small errors 
in the valuation or disclosure process could have a material impact 
on the amounts included in the financial statements.
In addition, whilst the inputs to these calculations are largely taken 
from observable market prices or data points, in certain cases more 
than one potential source of information is available. Whilst 
differences in these forward-looking assumptions are typically 
relatively small, the impact can become material when applied to a 
large portfolio of contracts. In addition, the volatility during 2022 
resulted in the differences in source data increasing at certain points, 
as observable market prices can take time to fully incorporate rapid 
changes in the macro environment.
The accounting and disclosure requirements in this area are 
inherently complex. As a result, the accounting, controls, 
and disclosures in relation to derivative financial instruments 
all remain key areas of focus for the Committee.
At each meeting, the Committee receives an update on any new 
classes of derivative financial instrument that the Group has 
entered into and the proposed accounting treatment. During 2022, 
there were no new classes of instrument that required review. 
Ahead of each reporting date, the Committee reviewed 
management’s assessment that biomass contracts continue 
to fall outside the scope of IFRS 9. This involved comparing the 
requirements of the financial standard with the current situation 
in terms of observable practice and market conditions, and 
developments during the period. 
Having completed this review, the Committee was satisfied 
with management’s assessment. However, it was noted that this 
is a critical judgement given the potential impact on the financial 
statements should biomass contracts be deemed to be within the 
scope of IFRS 9. 
At each of its meetings, the Committee was also updated on the 
overall valuation of the Group’s derivative portfolio, and the 
movements in the period. The Committee considered the operation 
of the financial control framework around the valuation process, 
and the output from a rolling self-certification process.
During 2022 the Committee gave particular focus to reviewing 
the improvements made to the valuation process, in light of the 
significant volatility in market prices and the corresponding 
fluctuations in valuations. These improvements include 
enhancements to the way in which credit risk adjustments are 
calculated and applied, increasing the granularity within the 
underlying valuation models, and more frequent detailed reviews 
of the most complex derivative valuations, including reconciliation 
to external valuations. 
The Committee also considered the impact of volatility during 2022 
on the source data used in the valuation process. As a result, 
it was concluded that this should be disclosed in the Annual Report 
and Accounts as a key source of estimation uncertainty, as detailed 
opposite. Consideration was also given to the wider disclosures 
made around financial instruments, and the Committee were 
satisfied that these were appropriate and accurately described 
the closing position and potential impacts from future 
price movements.
Based on these reviews, the Committee was satisfied that the 
controls in place around derivative financial instruments were 
robust, and that the enhancements to the control framework and 
valuation methodologies made during 2022 were appropriate. 
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee considered the opinion 
and recommendations of the external auditor, and the independent 
analysis performed by their specialist teams.

Description
Audit Committee review and conclusion
Impairment of goodwill and fixed assets
The Group reviews its goodwill and fixed assets (or, where 
appropriate, groups of assets in cash-generating units (CGUs)) 
for potential impairment. Impairment reviews are triggered by either 
the existence of potential indicators of impairment at a given point 
in time or, in the case of goodwill and other intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives, are conducted at least annually.
As part of this review the Group reviews its classification of CGUs. 
As described on page 194, there have been no changes to this 
classification during 2022. 
When an impairment review is deemed to be required, 
the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU is assessed. 
This assessment is made with reference to the present value 
of the future cash flows expected to be derived from its value in use, 
or its expected fair value on sale.
Assumptions that underpin the assessment of value in use for 
each CGU are based on the most recent Board-approved forecasts. 
The forecasts include all the necessary costs expected to be incurred 
to generate the cash inflows from the relevant assets in their 
current state and condition.
Given volatility within commodity markets during 2022, certain 
assumptions can vary significantly from one period to the next. 
The reviews performed therefore also include sensitivity and 
scenario analysis to help the Board understand how changes 
in key assumptions impact the assessment. These include 
considering the prices of key commodities such as power and gas, 
as well as the potential impact of unplanned outages at different 
plants. Where these reviews suggest a potential risk of impairment, 
further detailed work is undertaken. 
The discount rates applied to the underlying forecasts 
(to take account of future risk and the time value of money) also 
represent an important assumption. These rates are reviewed 
annually with input from external experts. Market volatility, 
interest rates and inflation rates all impact the underlying calculation 
of these discount rates, and as such this area has required additional 
focus during 2022.
Impairment arises where management determines, and the 
Audit Committee concludes, that the carrying amount of an asset 
(or group of assets) exceeds its recoverable amount. Further detail 
on this process and the assumptions made is provided in note 2.4 
to the Consolidated financial statements.
At its meeting in November 2022, the Committee reviewed 
management’s process and initial conclusions in respect 
of impairment for the 2022 financial year.
Having considered and challenged management’s reports, process 
and key assumptions, the Committee concluded that the overall 
approach to impairment reviews was appropriate, and was satisfied 
that the only potential impairments necessary during the year were 
in relation to the Abergelli OCGT project and the Daldowie energy 
from waste site, as described in more detail on page 195. 
The Committee also considered the accounting impact of the winter 
contingency service agreed on the coal units, and in particular 
whether any reversal of prior impairment charges was required. 
Having reviewed management’s assessment, the Committee was 
satisfied that no such reversals were required, and that the assets 
in question would already have been fully depreciated. 
At its meeting in February 2023, the Committee reviewed a 
roll-forward of the analysis from November 2022 and considered 
any significant internal or external changes since that detailed 
analysis had been performed. This incorporated further analysis 
of the expected impact of the Electricity Generator Levy announced 
by the UK Government in November 2022. 
This review did not indicate any material changes in the conclusions, 
and the Committee was satisfied with management’s assessment 
and the impairment charges proposed. Further scenarios and analysis 
were also considered to support the review of going concern and 
viability conducted by the Committee, discussed in more detail below. 
This analysis did not suggest any further indicators of impairment, 
and supported the conclusions reached. 
The Committee reviewed the impairment disclosures in the Annual 
Report and Accounts and concluded that the key assumptions and 
sensitivities had been appropriately disclosed, and that all statements 
made were supportable.

Description
Audit Committee review and conclusion
Calculation and presentation of alternative 
performance measures
As described on page 179, the Group presents Adjusted results 
excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements. Adjusted results are consistent with the way 
Executive management and the Board review and assess the 
performance of the Group. The effects of exceptional items and 
certain remeasurements are presented separately in a column 
on the face of the Group’s Consolidated income statement.
The Group has a clear policy that sets out the transactions 
considered as exceptional for the purpose of this presentation, 
and the determination of certain remeasurements. However, 
the classification of transactions as exceptional and the separate 
presentation of certain remeasurements requires judgement.
A full glossary of alternative performance measures referenced 
throughout the Annual Report and Accounts, including the closest 
equivalent IFRS measure and an explanation of why the measure 
is considered important, is provided on page 287. Further supporting 
reconciliations of certain alternative performance measures 
from relevant IFRS measures are provided in note 2.7 to the 
Consolidated financial statements. 
The Committee plays an important governance role in the 
classification and presentation of items as exceptional in the 
financial statements. At each Committee meeting, management 
presents a paper that sets out the transactions proposed to be 
classified as exceptional in the period. The Committee reviews 
this paper, and challenges each of the individual items. Formal 
approval of the classification is provided at reporting dates.
In 2022, the Committee challenged management around the 
write-off of historically capitalised SaaS costs, recorded as an 
exceptional item in the year. This was to ensure that the treatment 
was consistent with the agreed policy and was not business-as-usual 
expenditure. As a result of this review the Committee was satisfied 
that recording the historic write-off as exceptional was appropriate, 
whilst current period and future costs would be reflected 
in underlying results, as described on page 177.
In addition, the Committee reviewed the definition of alternative 
performance measures in the year to ensure that they remained 
appropriate. As a result of this review it was determined that the 
primary Net debt metric reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 
should be updated to incorporate the impact of derivative financial 
instruments specifically used to hedge the impact of fluctuations 
in foreign currency denominated debt.
At its meeting in February 2023, the Committee reviewed 
the final classification of transactions as exceptional or certain 
remeasurements in the 2022 financial statements. It also 
considered the calculation and presentation of alternative 
performance measures in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Having considered analysis from management, and the opinion 
of the external auditor, the Committee was satisfied that 
the approach taken is appropriate. It was also satisfied that 
the Annual Report and Accounts for 2022 are fair, balanced 
and understandable.

Audit Committee review and conclusion
Review of other significant judgements and estimates
The other areas of significant judgement and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in the financial statements are set out 
on page 178. Management regularly reviews these other areas 
to ensure they are kept up to date, and also considers whether 
other items should be included. 
As part of the preparation for the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, 
management considered the level of provision required for expected 
credit losses in the Customers business. This took account of market 
conditions, current UK Government support schemes and any 
observed changes in customer payment habits. Management also 
considered whether the provision represents a key source of 
estimation uncertainty under IAS 1.
As noted in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts, during 2021 
it was deemed appropriate to commence capitalisation of certain 
costs associated with the BECCS project at Drax Power Station, 
based on an increasing level of confidence in the development 
of the project in the future. As total capitalised costs on this project 
are now material to the financial statements, this is deemed 
to represent a significant judgement under IAS 1. 
In November 2022, the Committee reviewed and discussed a paper 
from management outlining how the potential future impacts of 
climate change had been considered in preparation of the financial 
statements, covering areas such as impairment reviews and the 
useful economic lives of the Group’s fixed assets.
At each of its meetings, the Committee reviews a paper prepared 
by management that summarises key financial reporting updates 
for the period. This paper includes a summary of significant 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
and an update on any changes in the period. In particular, 
any material emerging issues are discussed in detail.
During 2022, the Committee reviewed the approach taken 
to calculate expected credit loss provisions in the Customers business. 
It noted the impact of the Government’s Energy Bill Relief Scheme, 
which came into effect in October 2022, and the performance 
of cash collection against billing seen during the year as a whole. 
Having completed this review, the Committee was satisfied that 
the approach adopted in the calculation was appropriate. 
The Committee also concluded that the risk of a material change 
in the estimated carrying value of related assets within the next 
financial year was unlikely, and that therefore this does not represent 
a key source of estimation uncertainty under IAS 1. 
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment that 
capitalisation of certain costs associated with the UK BECCS project 
remained appropriate. As part of this, the Committee noted that 
the total amount capitalised under this project was now material, 
and so this item warranted inclusion as a significant judgement 
in the financial statements. The Committee also noted that 
judgements were being made to not yet capitalise costs associated 
with other potentially significant future projects, such as 
the expansion of the Cruachan pumped storage power station 
and BECCS projects in the US. The Committee was satisfied 
that the proposed disclosure incorporated sufficient detail 
to cover these areas. 
Having considered the other matters raised in management’s 
papers, the Committee was satisfied that the items disclosed 
as critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty on page 178 are appropriate and complete. In addition, 
the Committee was satisfied that the descriptions clearly and 
accurately reflect the matters disclosed and the positions taken.

Reviewing the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts
At its meeting in November 2022, the Committee received 
reports from management on its planning for the various 
elements of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. This included 
a timetable for preparing drafts and for the contributions, 
including peer review and commentary, being made by members 
of the wider management and Executive teams. The Committee 
also discussed how such review would support the task of 
ensuring the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was 
fair, balanced and understandable. 
Between the year-end date and the date of the approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, the Committee Chair was updated 
on progress with the year-end audit process and key financial 
reporting matters. Updates were also provided by the external 
auditor and the internal auditor. At its meeting in February 2023, 
the Committee reviewed both the external auditor’s findings and 
the draft 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Committee also reviewed and approved the verification 
process undertaken by management around key information 
included in the Annual Report and Accounts. This included 
reviewing the results of internal and external assurance received 
around specific disclosures and sections of the report, and 
considering the overall level of review and assurance. Having 
completed this review, the Committee was satisfied that the 
verification process was robust and that key information and 
statements included within the Annual Report and Accounts 
were supportable.
As part of this review, the Committee considered the internal 
controls, forecasts and relevant assumptions underpinning the 
Viability Statement and the ongoing adoption of the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. This included 
assessing a scenario analysis prepared by management, reviewed 
by the external auditor, which considered the potential future 
impact of the Group’s principal risks on its financial projections. 
Particular focus was given to the scenarios relating to plant 
operations and commodity price risks, given current market 
conditions, and the medium to long-term impacts they could 
have. This is discussed in further detail on page 75.
The Committee challenged the assumptions made around 
availability of finance and covenant compliance, and considered 
the appropriateness of the period of assessment for viability. 
Whilst management and the Board consider longer-term 
forecasts for other purposes, including strategic planning and 
capital allocation, the Committee concluded that it was 
appropriate for the assessment period to remain at five years. 
The Committee was satisfied that the proposed viability 
statement was robust, fair and balanced, including consideration 
of the disclosure around longer-term term risks extending beyond 
the viability assessment period. In addition, the Committee was 
satisfied that the level of assurance, challenge and verification 
was appropriate, whilst taking into account the work undertaken 
by the external auditor. Consequently, it was also concluded that 
the ongoing use of the going concern basis of preparation for the 
financial statements was appropriate. 
As noted above, the Committee considered and reviewed 
management’s disclosure on certain remeasurements and 
exceptional items (see page 178) and the presentation of these 
items in the Consolidated income statement. This included a 
review of the calculation and presentation of alternative 
performance measures. The Committee was satisfied that the use 
of alternative performance measures and the way in which they 
are presented remains appropriate, and that they provide helpful 
information to the users of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
As a result of the Committee’s review, it advised the Board of 
its conclusion that the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as whole, were fair, balanced and understandable. This view is 
underpinned by the Committee’s discussions with operating and 
finance management regarding the Strategic Report, and with 
the finance team regarding the financial statements. In addition, 
the Committee believes that the Annual Report and Accounts 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s and the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy, and that statements made are supported 
by appropriate verification and assurance, including those made 
around the systems of risk management and internal control.
External audit 
Effectiveness of external audit
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor during the year and does so annually. Deloitte LLP 
(Deloitte), who have performed the role of external auditor 
continuously since 2005, were reappointed at the AGM in 
April 2022. Makhan Chahal became lead Audit Partner in 2021 
and has significant listed company and sector-specific 
auditing experience.
The Committee’s review primarily considered the independence 
and objectivity of Deloitte, its professional competence and past 
performance. The Committee also considered the robustness of 
the audit process including, in particular, the level of challenge 
given to critical management judgements and the professional 
scepticism being applied. This took account of the Committee’s 
discussions with the external auditor around areas of higher 
audit risk and the basis for the auditor’s conclusions on those 
areas. During 2022 this included a particular focus on the annual 
impairment review process and the valuation of derivative 
financial instruments. The Committee was satisfied with the 
level of ongoing challenge applied by the external auditor.
The annual review of effectiveness also incorporated feedback 
from members of the finance and wider management teams. 
The Committee sought their views on matters including the 
quality of audit work and engagement whilst planning and 
executing the audit, both at a Group and business unit level. 
In addition to completing an annual review, the Committee 
considers the effectiveness of the external auditor throughout 
the year and discusses this point at each meeting. This ongoing 
review incorporated any relevant external information, such as 
the FRC’s annual Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision 
Report, which was published in July 2022 and included 
an assessment of Deloitte and other large audit firms.
As reported in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts, during 
2021 Deloitte’s audit of the Group’s 2020 financial statements 
was selected for review by the FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) 
team. The Committee considered in detail the findings from 
the final report from the AQR, together with Deloitte’s responses 
in each area and their proposed future actions. In addition, the 
Chair and Audit Partner discussed the final report, and the 
Chair met with the FRC directly to understand their key findings 
and recommendations.
The Committee noted two key areas recommended for 
improvement in relation to the work performed, around expected 
credit loss provisions within the Opus Energy business, and the 
assessment of discount rates used by management in performing 
impairment reviews of non-current assets. The Committee 
considered Deloitte’s proposed actions in these areas as part 
of the presentation of their 2022 audit plan at both the July 2022 
and November 2022 meetings, and also considered the 
Audit Committee Report continued

improvements that had already been incorporated into its audit 
of the Group’s 2021 financial statements. The Committee 
reviewed the conclusions from Deloitte’s revised approach 
at their February 2023 meeting, and the additional work that 
had been performed. Improvements made to the audit approach 
included further utilisation of specialist teams within Deloitte 
(covering both credit provisions and data analytics) and additional 
corroboration of management assumptions against independent 
external data sources.
Having considered the actions taken and improvements made 
by Deloitte to address the areas identified in the AQR team report, 
the Committee concluded that there were no matters which cast 
significant doubt on the fundamental quality of the audit process. 
It was also noted that no adjustments to the financial statements 
were required as a result of this review.
Based on its overall review, and satisfactory consideration and 
response to the AQR team report, the Committee is satisfied that 
the external auditor and its audit has continued to be effective. 
The Committee agreed that the external auditor’s work 
demonstrated an ongoing commitment to audit quality, that the 
audit process was robust, and that Deloitte had shown strong 
levels of technical knowledge and appropriate professional 
scepticism in its work.
As reported in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts, a tender 
process for the Group’s external audit was conducted during 
2021, in accordance with the UK Statutory Auditors and Third 
Country Auditors Regulations 2016 (SATCAR), which require all 
Public Interest Entities to rotate their external auditor at least 
every 20 years. As a result of the process, in January 2022 the 
Board agreed to appoint PwC as the Group’s auditor for the 
financial year ending 31 December 2024, subject to shareholder 
approval. Deloitte will continue in its role as external auditor 
for the financial year ending 31 December 2023, also subject 
to shareholder approval, and PwC will shadow Deloitte in respect 
of this audit as part of an orderly transition.
Independence of external audit
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy (AIP) that defines 
procedures and guidance under which the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditor is governed. The AIP also facilitates the 
Committee being able to satisfy itself that there are no factors 
that may, or may be seen to, impinge upon the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the external audit process. The 
Committee reviews the AIP annually and last did so in July 2022. 
As part of this annual review, the Committee considers areas 
of development in best practice and guidance. The main features 
of the current AIP (which is available at www.drax.com) are:
• A requirement to review the quality, cost effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor
• A requirement to rotate the lead Audit Partner every five years, 
and processes governing the employment of former external 
auditor employees
• A policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit activities, which is expected to occur in very limited 
circumstances and is kept under review at each meeting 
of the Committee
The external auditor also reports to the Committee on its own 
processes and procedures to ensure independence, objectivity 
and compliance with the relevant standards.
The amounts paid to the external auditor during each of the 
financial years ended 31 December 2021 and 2022 for audit 
and non-audit services are set out below and in note 2.3 to the 
Consolidated financial statements (page 193).

As noted opposite, the external auditor should not provide 
non-audit services where it might impair its independence 
or objectivity. Therefore, any engagement for the provision 
of non-audit services requires prior approval from the Committee 
or Committee Chair. Agreement to allow the external audit firm 
to perform additional non-audit services is taken only after 
considering two key factors. Namely, that the non-audit services 
policy has been fully applied and that any engagements are in the 
best interests of the Group and its key stakeholders.
During 2022 there was a decrease in the level of non-audit 
services provided by Deloitte, with the most significant item 
being the Group’s interim review. In 2021, Deloitte provided 
support in a limited reporting accountant role in respect of the 
shareholder circular for the acquisition of Pinnacle, with fees 
totalling £469,000. 
In all cases the Committee was satisfied that the work was best 
handled by the external auditor because of its knowledge of the 
Group, and that the services provided did not give rise to threats 
to independence. The Committee was also satisfied that the 
overall levels of audit and non-audit fees were not of a material 
level relative to the income of Deloitte as a whole, and that the 
level of non-audit fees was below the 70% cap, based on the 
average audit fee for the preceding three years.
Auditor reappointment
The Group has fully complied with the provisions of The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014. The Committee discussed the 
appointment of an external auditor at its meeting on 20 February 
2023 and recommended to the Board that a resolution to 
re-appoint Deloitte as the Group’s external auditor should be put 
to shareholders at the AGM in April 2023.
Internal audit
The Group has adopted a fully outsourced model for internal audit 
since 2020. KPMG has acted as the Group’s main internal auditor 
since this model was implemented, supported by an internal team 
which acts as an interface with the business. The internal auditor 
presents an annual plan to the Committee for approval at its final 
meeting of the preceding year. This proposed programme of work 
is based on the assessment of the internal auditor, taking into 
account input from interviews with key internal stakeholders 
from finance, risk and wider management. 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 125
 
Governance
The Committee reviews this plan to ensure that priority is given 
to the areas of highest risk for the Group, while maintaining 
appropriate coverage of all other key risks. Fees are agreed on 
an audit-by-audit basis depending on the scope and requirement 
for specialist input, whilst being managed within an overall annual 
budget. Having reviewed the plan for 2022 in detail, the 
Committee subsequently approved it. 
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding the 
reviews completed since its last meeting, and progress against 
the overall annual plan. The Committee reviews the findings 
and agrees the recommended actions and delivery dates for 
improvements, taking into consideration supporting analysis 
from management on the root causes of any weaknesses. 
Key topics reviewed by the internal auditor during 2022 included 
Accounts Payable, Risk Management, and Regulation and 
Compliance. These reviews each provided recommendations to 
the Committee and management on how to further improve the 
system of internal controls, including suggested enhancements 
around segregation of duties when placing orders with suppliers, 
and the oversight of trading activities by the internal Compliance 
team. The recommendations, and suggested timelines, were 
agreed between management and the internal auditor before 
being presented to Committee. Aside from a small number of 
cases where the Committee asked for activities to be accelerated, 
all actions and target dates were approved. 
In addition, the internal auditor provided information to the 
Committee at each meeting around the ongoing progress 
of the BEIS consultation “Restoring trust in audit and corporate 
governance”. This included a deep-dive at the Committee 
meeting in November 2022, following the publication of the 
results of the consultation in May 2022, at which management’s 
action plans and progress in relation to each of the key areas 
of the consultation were considered.
In conjunction with reports from the internal auditor on reviews 
completed during the period, the Committee also receives reports 
from management detailing progress on implementing 
recommendations from previous reviews, tracking this against 
the originally agreed implementation dates as described above. 
This allows the Committee to effectively monitor management’s 
response. Having reviewed these reports, and received assurance 
from the internal auditor around the effectiveness of the overall 
tracking process, the Committee was satisfied that actions were 
being implemented on a timely basis. 
The Chair of the Committee, independent of management, 
maintains direct contact with the internal auditor, allowing open 
dialogue and feedback.
Health, safety and environment
Where relevant, and agreed between the Committee and the 
main internal auditor, additional external parties may be engaged 
to support with independent internal audit reviews. This is 
typically in highly specialised areas, to increase the overall level 
of assurance gained from the programme of internal audit work.
As reported in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts, during 
2021 the Committee reviewed and supported the appointment 
of a new external consultant DNV Limited (DNV) to provide 
an assessment of the Group’s health, safety and environment 
practices. The Committee received an update from management 
on progress against previously agreed actions at its meeting 
in July 2022, and a deeper dive update from DNV at its meeting 
in November 2022. 
Changes implemented during 2022 included improvements 
around contractor management, as well as the roll-out of a new 
Group-wide IT system to capture and report on incidents, 
allowing increased transparency and accountability for site 
performance.
During 2022 DNV’s programme of work has continued to focus 
on the three dimensions of Human, Organisational and Technical 
processes across the Group, and has also expanded to cover 
additional areas including safety culture within Pellet Production 
and a HSE governance review in relation to the BECCS project 
at Drax Power Station. Opportunities for improvement 
identified during 2022 include a continued focus on learning 
from past events and further development of emergency 
response identification. 
Effectiveness of internal audit
The Committee reviewed the overall effectiveness of the 
approach to internal audit, and in particular the effectiveness 
of KPMG, at its meeting in November 2022. This review included 
the Committee’s own views, and also incorporated feedback from 
members of the wider management team, covering areas such 
as scoping of reviews, level of subject matter knowledge and 
reporting of findings. KPMG also provided their feedback 
on interactions and engagement with management, and updated 
the Committee on this at each meeting during the year.
Based on its review, the Committee is satisfied that the approach 
to internal audit remains effective and that KPMG, as the Group’s 
main internal auditor, continue to provide the requisite quality, 
experience, and expertise in both its work and reporting 
to the Committee. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.

Annual Statement to Shareholders
Dear shareholders,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 2022 
financial year. The Group delivered impressive financial 
performance in 2022 and made significant progress on the 
Group’s key strategic objectives. It is noted that the strong 
performance was not without its challenges for the business 
and for our colleagues. The rising cost of living has had 
a significant impact on our colleagues across the Group. 
Their response in contributing to the delivery of the Group’s 
plans is recognised and appreciated. 
Management and the Board believe the financial stability and 
wellbeing of our colleagues is of paramount importance and 
therefore we took decisions in the year to support our colleagues 
through these difficult times. The Committee firmly believes that 
remuneration outcomes must be fair, appropriate in the context 
of business performance, and consistent across the wider 
workforce. The remuneration outcomes for 2022 have been 
assessed in line with these principles.
Review of decisions made during 2022
Annual assessment of performance
The Committee determines the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee against the 
objectives and priorities of the Group. For 2022 we achieved this 
through considering performance against a combination of strategic 
and financial metrics. The 2022 Group Scorecard (Scorecard) 
included metrics reflecting key objectives for all business areas, 
including Generation, Pellet Production and Commercial. It also 
included metrics reflecting progress on strategic objectives, 
people, sustainability and environmental practices. 
The Generation and Commercial businesses performed very 
strongly in 2022. The performance of Pellet Production was 
slightly behind budget but it still delivered robust performance, 
particularly in the context of external factors such as the impact 
of adverse weather during 2022. A detailed review of the 
achievement against the performance metrics in the Scorecard 
can be found on page 147.
The Committee determined that the overall performance 
outcome of the Scorecard represents a fair reflection 
of the business performance during 2022. The level of payout 
is commensurate with the experience of both shareholders and 
colleagues over this period. The Committee did however accept 
Will Gardiner’s recommendation to reduce the formulaic outturn 
of the bonus to reflect safety performance in 2022. Whilst there 
were no serious safety incidents in 2022, the number of injuries 
recorded was higher than the standards we set. The Scorecard 
specifically has a safety moderator provision to allow for such 
eventualities. The final outturn of the annual bonus plan was 
1.75 and this score results in 87.5% of the maximum annual bonus 
being paid to the Executive Directors. In accordance with our 
Policy, 40% of the overall bonus award will be deferred into 
shares and 60% will be paid in cash in the March 2023 payroll.
Long-term assessment of performance
Awards granted in 2020 under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) were subject to performance criteria stated in the Policy 
approved by shareholders in 2020. Vesting of these awards 
was determined based on performance against two measures 
over the three-year period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 
2022. The measures were Total Shareholder Return (TSR), 
relative to the FTSE 350, and Cumulative Adjusted Earnings 
Per Share (EPS), each accounted for 50% of the award. 
TSR over the three-year period was above the upper quartile 
(a rank of 5 out of the FTSE 350). The EPS outcome was 144.7p, 
Key Remuneration Committee activities in 2022
The key matters considered, and decisions reached, by the Committee in 2022 are shown in the table below:
Our workforce
Executives and senior management
Committee governance
• Considered the remuneration 
of the wider workforce in the 
context of cost of living pressures. 
Also received updates on broader

Governance
which was 23% ahead of the maximum target of 117.5p. 
The TSR and EPS performance resulted in full vesting 
for both performance measures.
The full performance vesting of the 2020 LTIP is reflective 
of the exceptional shareholder returns. The data in the chart 
at the bottom of the page shows how the value of £100 invested 
in both Drax and other leading Energy companies on 1 January 
2020 has changed in the period to 31 December 2022.
The vesting of the 2020 LTIP is also relative to Drax’s performance 
over the period. This included the impact of the pandemic 
(which includes the impact on earnings for 2020 and 2021: 
a reduction in EBITDA of £75 million), inflationary pressures and 
higher commodity prices. Over this same period, there has been 
considerable progress made on Drax’s strategy and purpose. 
This included the divestment of the combined cycle gas 
generation turbine assets (CCGT); the acquisition of Pinnacle 
and significant progress in the development of plans for BECCS. 
This progress and prospects for long-term growth have remained 
underpinned by good operational and financial performance, 
with strong cash generation and dividend growth. 
In addition to looking at Drax’s performance in the round, 
the Committee also recognised other factors. Specifically, over 
the period since the grant of the 2020 award, Drax’s share price 
has increased from 200p to an average share price over the last 
quarter of 2022 of 579p. Whilst being cognisant of the guidance 
from the Investment Association on potential windfall gains 
from 2020 awards granted during the first pandemic lockdown, 
we are not scaling back the award on vesting because:
• The 2020 award was not granted at a Covid ‘low point’. 
The share price was as low as 134p in 2020 and was at 
250-350p for most of the preceding year. The 2020 award 
was granted from a share price of 200p.
• With a rank of 5 out of the FTSE 350 constituents, Drax’s 
TSR performance has been exceptional over the performance 
period (measured from the start of 2020, when the share price 
was higher than the grant price). This shows that the share 
price is not simply reflective of a general market bounce-back. 
The chart shows Drax’s performance was well into the top 
quartile and that Drax has the highest TSR in the sector. Drax’s 
closing share price on 31 December 2022 was 703p, 124% 
higher than the 314p share price at the beginning of the 
three-year period that pre-dated the pandemic impact.
• The three-year EPS target was established prior to the date 
of grant for the performance period 1 January 2020 
Drax’s TSR over the 2020 LTIP performance period versus other energy companies
to 31 December 2022, considering both internal forecasts and 
market expectations at that time. Whilst power prices started 
to increase during 2021, the Group’s hedging policy meant the 
impact on the results was limited to the unhedged element 
of 2022, the final year of the performance period. Much of the 
value delivered across the performance period was achieved as 
the Group successfully optimised and leveraged its integrated 
supply chain to provide security of supply during several 
challenging years for the UK energy system, whilst delivering 
significant additional value. The pandemic materially negatively 
impacted the 2020 and 2021 financial year EPS performance. 
While there was a modest benefit from the UK Government’s 
request to provide winter contingency through coal for part of 
the 2022 financial year, this was more than offset by the net 
earnings lost during the period from the combined effect of the 
sale of CCGT and acquisition of Pinnacle.
• Drax has an important role in the security of supply. Despite 
significant operational challenges, we maintained the supply of 
power during the pandemic which required robust supply chains 
for the supply of sustainable biomass as well as the operational 
demands at Drax Power Station. More recently following the 
request from UK Government, we made the coal units available 
when called upon for operation.
• Subsequent LTIP awards have been granted at higher share 
prices (429p in 2021 and 701p in 2022) and the 2019 and 2018 
awards were granted at share prices of 380p and 255p.
• Vested awards for Executive Directors remain subject to a 
holding period. With the two-year holding period that applies, 
the share price could be lower by the time shares are released.
The Committee determined that the vesting outcome was 
appropriate in the context of performance over the three-year 
performance period. The Committee also believed the outcome 
was appropriate in the context of the response by management 
to the impacts of the pandemic on operational continuity and 
looking after colleagues. On this basis, the Committee decided 
not to exercise any discretion to reduce the overall vesting 
outcome.
All-employee remuneration
In September 2022, Drax completed the acquisition of Princeton 
Standard Pellet Corporation and thereby welcomed more 
colleagues in Canada (following the acquisition of Pinnacle 
in 2021). Careful consideration was given at that time to ensure 
that Princeton’s colleagues smoothly transitioned to the Group’s 
remuneration and broader HR policies.

Governance
Remuneration Committee report continued
In addition, Drax expanded operations into Japan in 2022, 
with the intention of further advancing biomass sales to support 
energy security and decarbonisation in Asia. 
At this stage our footprint in Japan is modest but our presence 
there, including the number of colleagues we have, is likely 
to expand as that business grows. Management is currently 
considering remuneration and broader HR arrangements which 
are appropriate and competitive in the local market in Japan. 
Inflation increased significantly in 2022 in all countries where 
Drax operates, leading to a significant cost of living impact on all 
colleagues. The Committee spent time considering how best to 
offer support. We took the decision to bring forward the effective 
date of the 2023 pay review to 1 January (from 1 April) for all 
colleagues not under collective bargaining (colleagues under 
collective bargaining already had 1 January as an effective pay 
review date). We felt that bringing forward the pay review was 
the most meaningful way to support colleagues during these 
difficult times. A budget of 8%, which is higher than recent years, 
was set. This was consistent with inflation rates in the US and 
Canada at the time the budget was set. This was also broadly 
in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI) in the UK when adjusting 
for the direct impact of energy prices. 
For the two Executive Directors, the Committee decided on a 4% 
base pay increase, effective 1 January 2023. The Committee took 
this decision as they were mindful of the knock-on impact on the 
relativity of Executive Directors’ total pay to the total pay of the 
wider workforce in awarding the Executive Directors base pay 
increases that were directly aligned with the average increase 
of the wider workforce (which is our standard approach). 
The median base pay increase for members of the Executive 
Committee was also 4%. 
To further support colleagues with the rising cost of living, 
Drax implemented Nudge globally. This provided all colleagues 
with access to financial education, such as advice on day-to-day 
budgeting and how to help money go further. We will continue 
to monitor the cost of living situation throughout 2023 and 
consider whether there is anything further we can appropriately 
do to support our colleagues.
New remuneration policy
Context
The Committee undertook a full review of the current Policy in 
2022. This took into account the evolution of the Drax strategy 
since the last Policy review in 2019, plus evolving market practice 
and feedback from our shareholders. Consensus from the 
feedback we received was our current Policy is working 
effectively and it remains aligned with our strategy.
Proposed changes
The key Policy changes which will be proposed for shareholder 
consideration at the AGM to be held in April 2023 are:
• Annual bonus deferral and holding periods – we are not 
proposing a change to the quantum of the bonus opportunities 
for the Executive Directors. While retaining the Scorecard 
methodology, there will be more flexibility in the choice of 
performance metrics. We will achieve this by removing the 
specification that 60% of metrics must be financial, albeit on 
the proviso that the majority of metrics will be financial (and 
the Committee note that 60% of the metrics in the 2023 
Scorecard are financial). The current approach to deferral of 
the bonus for Executive Directors will be simplified. A flat 40% 
of any bonus earned is to be paid in shares and deferred for 
three years. This is to simplify the current arrangement 
whereby the deferral operates differently for bonus earned 
for financial and non-financial targets. In addition, to align with 
market practice, the holding period on deferred bonus shares is 
to be removed. The deferred bonus shares will continue to have 
a three-year vesting period and, on vesting, these shares will 
still need to be held (as a minimum, on a net of tax basis) until 
Drax share ownership guidelines have been met. 
• Non-Executive Directors – consistent with wider market 
practice in FTSE 350 companies with an international footprint, 
there will be an introduction of flexibility to provide a limited 
range of benefits and travel allowances to Non-Executive 
Directors. These changes are being made in recognition of the 
additional time and expenses incurred by Non-Executive 
Directors based overseas in providing their services to a UK 
based listed company (e.g. the changes will enable the 
additional time which the Non-Executive Directors concerned 
commit in travelling to and from UK Board meetings to be 
reflected in the total fees provided). The Policy will also specify 
that our default approach is to increase their fees each year at 
a rate that is up to the rate applied to the wider workforce. This 
will bring the Drax Policy into line with market practice. With 
respect to 2023, the Chair received a 4% increase and Non-
Executive Directors received an increase of 4.1%, which was 
less than the average increase of the wider workforce although 
in line with the annual base pay increases of the two Executive 
Directors and median base pay increase of the broader 
Executive Committee members. 
BECCS
As explained in other sections of this Annual Report, Drax 
continues to make good progress with its business transformation 
strategy. This we believe can be achieved through delivering both 
UK BECCS and global BECCS, with options including the delivery 
of 4Mt of negative CO2 emissions each year from new-build 
BECCS outside of the UK by 2030, with a primary focus on North 
America. This includes the development of options for a pellet 
plant with BECCS, coal-to-biomass-to-BECCS and industrial 
models for BECCS as a service. 
In respect of BECCS in the UK, our stated ambition is to develop 
8Mt of BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030. Management are 
progressing with the planning phases and during 2023, site 
preparation works will be undertaken, supporting the target of a 
final investment decision in 2024. The development of the BECCS 
opportunity in the UK will require the right investment framework 
from the UK Government.
Internationally, as outlined in our Trading Update in December 
2022, management made progress on the objective to deliver 
4Mt of negative CO2 emissions annually from 2030. Opportunities 
under consideration include two new-build 300MW BECCS 
power units, each capable of producing 2TWh of renewable 
electricity from sustainable biomass and each capturing over 
2Mt of CO2 annually. Drax is also developing options for a pellet 
plant with BECCS, and the addition of BECCS to existing 
generation assets, including coal-to-biomass-to-BECCS.
The US was a key focus during 2022. The regulatory environment 
there continued to gain momentum, with the inclusion of BECCS 
as an eligible technology under the Department of Energy climate 
goals funding scheme. At state level, progress has been made 
through enabling legislation in Louisiana and Texas, with the 
Louisiana legislature approving a bill that classifies biomass 
as carbon neutral and BECCS as carbon negative. In addition, 
California’s net zero strategy identifies carbon removal 
technologies as important to deliver the state’s climate targets.

Governance
We are evaluating a range of potential financial models for these 
projects, which could include long-term power purchase 
agreements (PPAs), long-term CDR sales and government 
investment frameworks.
In 2022 the Committee gave much consideration to an 
appropriate mechanism by which management should be 
remunerated for the delivery of the high impact and high value 
opportunity of BECCS. The Committee’s view is that the long term 
incentive plan provides a more appropriate mechanism for 
assessing and rewarding the delivery of BECCS over the medium 
to long term than the annual bonus plan. Having considered this in 
the context of the current Policy, the Committee has, after careful 
reflection, and after taking into account shareholder feedback, 
concluded that the timing of implementing such a change is more 
appropriate for 2024. This will allow time for necessary clarity on 
the outcome of engagement with the UK Government in relation 
to UK BECCS and further evolution of Drax’s global BECCS policy. 
The Committee expects to be in a position to engage shareholders 
on this potential change later this year.
Shareholder Engagement
In developing the proposed Policy, we considered comments 
provided by shareholders on our current Policy and we engaged 
with our largest shareholders to explain our proposed revisions. 
In December we wrote to our leading shareholders (which 
accounted for circa 40% of our shareholder register at that time) 
to share the proposed revisions and our thinking behind them. In 
January and February 2023 we had conversations with some of 
these shareholders to discuss their feedback. We really appreciate 
the time taken by our shareholders and we found their input both 
helpful and constructive. The Committee took this feedback into 
consideration and it helped to inform our proposals, for example 
the decision to delay reviewing the mechanism through which 
management are remunerated for the delivery of BECCS. 
Application of Remuneration Policy in 2023
Base pay review
The Committee reviewed the base pay of both Executive 
Directors for 2023 and determined that a below workforce 
increase of 4% would apply from 1 January 2023. From that date, 
the base pay of Will Gardiner increased to £663,000 and the base 
pay of Andy Skelton increased to £421,750. As noted previously, 
the Committee took this decision while mindful of the knock-on 
impact on the relativity of Executive Directors’ base pay to the 
base pay of the wider workforce in awarding the Executive 
Directors base pay increases that were directly aligned with the 
average increase for the wider workforce (which was 8%). 
Pension
As reported in 2019, effective 1 January 2023, the pension 
contribution rates of the Executive Directors reduced to 10% of 
base pay (from 20% for Will Gardiner and 16% for Andy Skelton). 
Annual bonus
Feedback provided as part of the Policy review indicated that the 
construct of the current annual bonus plan is working effectively. 
Bonus awards for 2023 will continue to be based on a Scorecard 
methodology. The maximum bonus opportunities of the 
Executive Directors remain unchanged at 175% and 150% of 
base pay for the CEO and CFO respectively. The majority of the 
bonus remains subject to challenging financial targets with 40% 
based on Group Adjusted EBITDA and 20% on Leverage. The 
remaining 40% will be earned against a range of strategic, safety 
and ESG targets. The 2023 Scorecard will determine the bonus 
awards for all colleagues across the Group who participate in the 
bonus plan for 2023, including the Executive Directors. More 
information on the targets is on page 156. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
As detailed above, no changes are proposed to the existing LTIP 
structure. For the TSR element, performance will continue to be 
assessed against the constituents of the FTSE 350 with threshold 
vesting (25% of maximum) for performance in line with the 
median and maximum vesting for performance in line with the 
upper quartile. The targets for the EPS element are provided on 
page 157. 
Workforce engagement
We believe engagement with our colleagues is extremely important 
in informing decisions of the Committee and in communicating 
how the Committee reaches decisions. There are several ways 
we engage with our colleagues on remuneration matters. 
One of the key vehicles is the MyVoice Forums. In 2022 there 
were four meetings with the respective Forum Chairs, Will Gardiner 
and Philip Cox. At these meetings, a variety of matters were 
discussed and this feedback has informed HR decisions. 
For example, we received feedback that we need to improve 
on recognising the contribution of colleagues beyond our reward 
programmes. The Chairs are supporting HR to develop options. 
We are increasingly making use of this workforce engagement 
platform to seek views on remuneration and to help shape 
initiatives. For example, the participation of our UK Sharesave 
scheme is very high with over 50% of UK colleagues participating 
in at least one scheme. We have partnered with Wealth at Work to 
deliver a financial education programme in Q1 2023 and engaged 
our MyVoice Forum Chairs for feedback on how we communicate 
to ensure the content lands appropriately. This support will enable 
colleagues to understand their options with respect to the 
Sharesave contract that matures in June 2023. Each business 
area also had their own Forum meetings in 2022.
In 2022, I also recorded a video explaining the construct of the 
2022 Scorecard and the rationale for each metric. The purpose 
was to improve the level of understanding of how the Scorecard 
works, to reinforce the importance of each metric to our strategic 
aims, and to explain how colleagues can directly influence them. 
The video was published on the intranet and made available 
to all colleagues. Feedback from colleagues suggests this 
was a valuable exercise. 
During 2022, colleagues continued to have the opportunity to put 
questions to Will Gardiner on any topic, with his responses made 
available to all colleagues. Colleagues could also share their views 
with management through the all-employee annual engagement 
survey. Although the engagement score is no longer a metric 
in the annual bonus plan, we are still committed to assessing 
the findings and addressing them through targeted actions.
Summary
The Committee recognises the excellent performance of the 
Group in 2022. We believe the 2022 remuneration outcomes 
for the Executive Directors and senior management fairly 
reflect performance, provide a fair and consistent approach 
to remuneration across the Group, and is appropriate to the 
shareholder experience. We are confident that the proposed 
Policy underpins our purpose and the delivery of our strategy, 
and rewards long-term sustainable performance and value 
creation for shareholders. We hope that having read this report 
you will vote in support of the resolutions for the Annual Report 
on Remuneration and the separate proposed Remuneration 
Policy at the AGM being held on 26 April 2023.

Governance
Remuneration Committee report continued
Corporate Governance Code
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been subject to a full review by the Committee which was undertaken in 2022. Proposed 
changes will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM being held on 26 April 2023. 
When reviewing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee considered a number of factors, including but not limited to, Drax’s 
ambitious growth strategy, shareholder feedback on the current policy, the UK Corporate Governance Code (see below) and wider 
best practice. This has culminated in the formulation of a revised remuneration policy (the Policy) which will apply for three years 
from the date of the 2023 AGM, subject to shareholder approval.
The table below sets out how the Policy specifically addresses the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Our remuneration policy is aligned with the provisions of the 2018 Corporate Governance Code
Clarity
• Alignment between the delivery 
of strategic goals and remuneration 
outcomes.
• Remuneration which rewards growth 
in shareholder value over the medium 
to longer-term.
• Performance related elements, relevant 
for the Group as a whole, creating 
alignment across the wider workforce 
in delivering financial, operational and 
strategic imperatives.
Simplicity
• Annual bonus: a simple Scorecard 
structure focusing on a small number 
of financial, strategic and ESG metrics, 
which provides clarity, focus and ease 
of understanding.
• The vesting of the long-term incentive 
plan (LTIP) is conditional in part on 
cumulative adjusted EPS, which 
reflects the capability to deliver stable 
earnings, and TSR, which ensures 
strong alignment with the shareholder 
experience.
Risk
• A significant proportion of remuneration 
is linked to the longer-term performance 
of the Group.
• A significant shareholding requirement 
for Executive Directors during and 
post-employment.
• Malus and clawback provisions mitigate 
behavioural risks by enabling payments 
to be reduced or reclaimed in specific 
circumstances.
Predictability 
• Transparent performance measures 
and targets make clear the possible 
range of remuneration outcomes and 
these potential outcomes are illustrated 
in the Policy.
Proportionality
• Performance measures are linked to 
Drax’s strategy and aligned with 
long-term creation of value for 
shareholders.
• Stretching targets ensure that 
payments are only made for strong 
corporate performance.
• The Committee has discretion to 
override formulaic outcomes to ensure 
that remuneration appropriately 
reflects overall performance, the 
interests of stakeholders and 
shareholder experience. 
 Alignment to culture
• Annual bonus metrics for all employees, 
including Executive Directors, are the 
same so that all participating colleagues 
are focused collectively on, and 
rewarded for, the delivery of financial 
and strategic goals and Drax’s purpose.
• The annual bonus for 2023 (and in 
previous years) contains metrics related 
to the environment, sustainability and 
people which underpin Drax’s values 
and business strategy.

Summary of changes to the Policy
The table provide provides an overview of the proposed changes to the Policy and the associated rationale for these changes.
Element
Proposed Change
Rationale
Salary
• Adopt consistent wording for the ability to move base 
salaries to the market rate where Executive Directors 
are either (i) an external appointment made on a below 
market base salary; or (ii) an internal promotion on 
a below market base salary.
• The change aligns Drax with standard FTSE 350 market 
practice. The default base salary increase for Executive 
Directors remains an increase up to the rate typically 
applied to the workforce. Where the quantum increase 
exceeds the norm, an explanation will be provided 
by the Committee. 
Annual bonus
• The following changes are proposed:
1. Simplifying the wording on the choice of performance 
metrics. The majority of the annual bonus must still be 
earned based on performance against financial targets 
as opposed to the current approach that defined a set 
percentage of the bonus (60%) as being subject to 
financial targets. 
2. Simplification of current approach to that part of 
annual bonus which is deferred in shares. The change 
will specify that 40% of any annual bonus earned 
is deferred into Drax’s shares. This approach replaces 
the prevailing more complex approach whereby 100% 
of any bonus earned against strategic targets takes 
place subject to 40% of the total bonus outcome 
being deferred.
3. Removal of the two-year holding period on deferred 
bonus shares so that any deferred shares that vest will 
be released at the end of the three-year vesting period. 
These shares will need to continue to be held (as a 
minimum on a net of tax basis) until Drax’s share 
ownership guidelines have been met. 
• The changes to the operation of the annual bonus plan 
align Drax with standard FTSE 350 market practice. 
• Requiring at least half the bonus to be subject to financial 
targets provides greater flexibility for the Remuneration 
Committee in operating the annual bonus plan and 
mirrors standard market practice.
• The current approach to bonus deferral was overly 
complex with differing proportions of the parts of the 
bonus subject to financial and strategic targets taking 
place dependent upon the level of bonus earned against 
each measure. This was administratively complex with 
the change simplifying the deferral process. 
• Deferring a proportion of any bonus into shares which 
vest at a future date is standard practice. Holding periods 
are not typically applied to deferred share bonus awards 
at the point of release. To note, the holding period will 
continue to apply to shares vesting under the long-term 
incentive plan. The change brings Drax into line with 
standard FTSE 350 market practice. 
Pension
• The policy is being updated to reference that Executive 
Director pensions are now aligned with the rate typically 
provided to the UK wider workforce for new joiners at 
10% of base salary.
• The change conforms the policy with institutional 
investors best practice expectations with Executive 
Director pensions being reduced to the rate typically 
provided to the UK wider workforce of 10% from their 
prior rates of 20% (CEO) and 16% (CFO) of base salary.
LTIP
• The overall LTIP structure remains the same.
• N/A
Non-Executive 
Directors
• The changes to the current Policy provide flexibility 
for Drax to provide a limited range of benefits and 
travel allowances. 
• The Policy will also specify that the default is to increase 
Non-Executive Director base fees at a rate that is up to 
the rate typically applied to the UK wider workforce. 
• The changes to the Non-Executive Directors’ Policy 
mirror standard practice for FTSE 350 companies 
with an international footprint.
• The ability to provide a limited range of benefits 
and allowances will ensure that Drax has the flexibility 
to appoint international Non-Executive Directors of an 
appropriate calibre to support Drax through the next 
phase of its development. The change will enable Drax 
to provide support to Non-Executive Directors 
(specifically from outside the UK) in relation to initial set 
up and ongoing support with filing tax returns such that 
this is cost neutral to the individual. 
• Introducing the ability to increase Non-Executive 
Director fees up to the rate of increase awarded to the 
wider workforce bring the Company Policy into line 
with standard market practice.

Base salary
Base salary helps to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of Executive Director to deliver the leadership and management 
needed to execute the Group’s strategy and business plan.
Proposed Change (for adoption in 2023)
Adopt consistent wording for the ability to move base salaries to the market rate where Executive Directors are either 
(i) an external appointment made on a below market base salary; or (ii) an internal promotion on a below market base salary.
Practical operation
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and 
experience, and market level. To determine the market level, 
the Committee reviews remuneration data on executive 
positions at companies which the Committee considers to be 
appropriate comparators. The comparator companies are 
selected, with advice from the Committee’s remuneration 
advisers, taking into account factors such as, but not limited 
to, sector, size, and international presence.
Where base salary on appointment is below market level 
to reflect experience, it will be increased over time to align 
with the market level, subject to performance.
Base salaries of all Executive Directors are generally 
reviewed once each year, with increases applying from 
January. Reviews cover individual performance, experience, 
development in the role, market comparisons and pay 
reviews for the wider workforce.
Maximum potential value
The base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the start 
of the policy period, and who remain in the same role 
throughout the policy period, are eligible for increases during 
the policy period but will not usually be increased by a higher 
percentage than the average annual percentage increase 
in salaries of all other employees in the Group at the time 
of increase.
Exceptions to this, subject to performance and development, 
are where:
(i)  An Executive Director has been appointed at below 
market level to reflect experience.
(ii)  An Executive Director has been promoted internally 
(or the scope or nature of their role has changed) 
and their salary is below market level. 
Pension
Pension provision is one of the components to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of executive, to ensure delivery 
of the leadership and management needed to execute the Group’s purpose and strategy.
Proposed Change (for adoption in 2023)
The policy is updated to reference that Executive Director pensions are now aligned with the rate typically provided to the UK 
wider workforce for new joiners of up to 10% of base salary.
Practical operation
Executive Directors are entitled to a contribution to the 
Group’s defined contribution pension plan, a cash payment 
in lieu of pension (subject to normal statutory deductions), 
or a combination of pension contributions and cash 
in lieu of pension.
Maximum potential value
The contribution rates for existing Executive Directors are 
limited to the rate for new joiners to the UK wider workforce, 
which is currently 10% of base salary. This is also the most 
common pension contribution rate for UK-based employees.
The pension contribution rate for any new Executive Director 
will also be limited to the rate for new joiners to the 
wider workforce.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy for approval at the 2023 AGM
Below is the proposed Policy which, if approved by shareholders, will be effective immediately after the AGM on 26 April 2023 
and will be binding until the close of the 2026 AGM.

Benefits
Benefits are provided to be market competitive as an integral part of Executive Directors’ total remuneration.
Practical operation
Executive Directors receive a car benefit, life assurance, 
income protection, the opportunity to participate in all-
employee share plans on the same basis as other employees, 
annual private health assessment and annual private medical 
cover. Additional benefits may be provided if the Committee 
considers them appropriate (including tax equalisation 
expenses and benefits or allowances which are customarily 
provided in the country where an Executive Director resides).
Relocation expenses are paid, where appropriate, 
in individual cases. Executive Directors’ relocation expenses 
are determined on a case-by-case basis. The Policy is 
designed to assist the Executive Director to relocate 
to a home of similar standing.
Maximum potential value
Benefits are set at a level appropriate to the individual’s role 
and circumstances.
The maximum opportunity will depend on the type of benefit 
and cost of its provision, which will vary according to the 
market and individual circumstances.
Annual bonus
The award of annual bonus will be based on annual performance against financial and operational metrics linked to the business 
plan. The aim of the deferred portion of the annual bonus is to further align Executive Directors to shareholders’ interests, by 
linking share-based reward to long-term sustainable performance.
Proposed Change (for adoption in 2023)
(i)  Simplification of the wording on the choice of performance metrics. The majority of the annual bonus must still be earned 
based on performance against financial targets.
(ii)  Simplification of current approach to that part of annual bonus which is deferred in shares. The change will specify that 
40% of any annual bonus earned is deferred into Drax’s shares. This approach replaces the prevailing more complex 
approach whereby 100% of any bonus earned against strategic targets takes place subject to 40% of the total bonus 
outcome being deferred.
(ii)  Removal of the two-year holding period on deferred bonus shares so that any deferred shares awarded vest after three years. 
These shares will need to continue to be held (as a minimum on a net of tax basis) until Drax’s share ownership guidelines 
are met. 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 137
 
Governance
Remuneration Committee report continued
Practical operation
The Committee will determine the annual bonus payable 
after the year-end, based on performance against targets. 
40% of the total bonus outcome will be deferred into shares 
in the form of nil cost options or conditional awards under 
a Deferred Share Plan (DSP). The period over which shares 
are deferred is normally three years. Vesting is subject to 
continued service or “good leaver” termination provisions. 
Deferred shares vest based on continued employment and 
lapse other than in defined good leaver circumstances.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume 
notional reinvestment) are paid on DSP awards.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus 
and clawback to bonus awards.

Performance measures
The majority of the annual bonus will be based on financial 
metrics. The Remuneration Committee reviews and 
determines the metrics, weightings and calibration of targets 
annually taking into account business objectives and the 
strategic priorities of the business. 
The performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus 
awards are split between financial and strategic metrics.
• Financial – performance measures based on annual financial 
and operational targets, which will be linked directly to the 
performance of the Group and determined by the Board. 
• Strategic – performance measures based on non-financial 
and strategic targets, which will be determined annually by 
the Board and will be aligned with the business strategy.
There is no payment for below threshold performance. 
The outcome for threshold performance is 0% of maximum. 
The outcome for target performance is 50% of maximum.
Targets, outcomes and resulting payouts are published in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee will review the formulaic outcome of the 
bonus award and has the discretion to amend the final 
outcome to make sure that bonus payments reflect overall 
performance. The use of such discretion will be explained fully 
in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
In exceptional circumstances such that the Committee 
believes the original measures and/or targets are no longer 
appropriate, the Committee has discretion to amend 
performance measures and targets during the year.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Group’s LTIP provides long-term alignment with shareholders based on the outcome of performance against the conditions 
set for each award (which for awards granted in 2023 will be Relative Total Shareholder Return and Cumulative Adjusted 
Earnings Per Share).
Practical operation
Under the LTIP, Executive Directors may at the discretion 
of the Committee receive an annual grant of shares subject 
to performance conditions.
Shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject 
to continued service or in exceptional circumstances earlier 
subject to specified “good leaver” termination provisions, 
and the achievement of performance conditions over 
a three-year period determined by the Committee. 
Vested awards are then subject to a further holding period 
of two years for Executive Directors.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume 
notional reinvestment) may be paid on LTIP awards.
There is no payment for below threshold performance.
The outcome for threshold performance is 25% of maximum.
The Committee will include an override provision in each 
grant under the LTIP. This will give the Committee discretion 
to determine that no vesting shall occur, or that vesting shall 
be reduced, if there are circumstances (relating to the 
Group’s overall performance or otherwise) which make 
vesting when calculated by reference to the performance 
conditions alone inappropriate.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus or 
clawback to unvested/vested awards.
The Committee reserves discretion to:
(i)  amend the performance conditions/targets attached to 
outstanding awards granted under this Policy, in the event 
of a major corporate event or significant change in 
economic circumstances, or a change in accounting 
standards having a material impact on outcomes; and
(ii)  adjust the vesting of LTIP awards and/or the number 
of shares underlying unvested LTIP awards, on the 
occurrence of a corporate event or other reorganisation. 
In the event of a change of control, the treatment of 
long-term incentives will be determined in accordance 
with the plan rules.

Shareholding requirement
The shareholding requirement aligns the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders.
Practical operation
The shareholding requirement for the CEO is 250% of salary 
and for the other Executive Directors is 200% of salary. 
This is to be achieved within a period five years after the date 
of the 2020 AGM (or after the date of appointment for new 
Executive Directors if this is later) from vested shares derived 
from awards under the Company’s share plans.
Until this level is reached, Executive Directors who receive 
shares by virtue of any share plan award or who receive 
DSP awards are expected to retain 50% of the shares 
received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance 
contributions). Shares which have not vested and are subject 
to performance conditions will not count towards the 
requirement. Unvested awards subject to service only 
(e.g. DSP awards) will count towards the guideline on 
a net of tax basis.

Post cessation shareholding requirement
The Group’s post-cessation shareholding requirement aligns the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders 
over the longer term beyond their departure from the Group.
Practical operation
A post-cessation shareholding requirement, equal to the 
employment shareholding requirement (or the shareholding 
on departure if lower) applies for a two year period after 
cessation of employment. For clarity, the post cessation 
shareholding requirement is 250% of salary for the CEO 
and for the other Executive Directors is 200% of salary. 
In addition, shares vesting during this period will remain 
subject to the two-year post-vesting holding period, which 
may therefore extend beyond the two year period for which 
the post-cessation shareholding requirement applies.
Shares purchased by the Executive Director (including those 
from all employee share plans), will not be included.
Shares counting towards this requirement will not be 
released from the Employee Benefit Trust during the period 
in which the post-cessation shareholding requirement 
applies, to support enforceability. Acceptance of the 
post-cessation shareholding requirement will be a condition 
of participation in all share awards granted, and will be 
included in the grant documentation for awards.
Both Will Gardiner and Andy Skelton have entered into such 
an agreement.

Performance measures and approach to setting targets
The measures for elements of variable pay will be:
• In respect of the annual bonus plan, financial, strategic and operational measures consisting of targets set by the Committee 
each year in conjunction with the Board. The targets are aligned with key business goals determined at the start of each year
• In respect of shares awards granted under the LTIP, targets typically relate to a combination of:
 
– Relative TSR, which aligns Executive Director remuneration with creation of long-term shareholder value;
 
– Cumulative Adjusted EPS, which aligns Executive Director remuneration with the realisation of our earnings growth plans, 
which is a major determinant of shareholder value.
• The Committee sets targets for the performance measures each year, taking into account market conditions, the business 
plan and other circumstances as appropriate. A summary of the measures that apply for the following year are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
• The Committee retains flexibility during the Policy period to change the weighting and choice of performance metrics 
to better align with strategy as it evolves. 
Circumstances in which malus or clawback may apply
The Committee may, at any time within two years of the LTIP and DSP vesting or annual bonus payment, determine that malus 
and/or clawback provisions should be applied, in circumstances of:
• material financial misstatement;
• fraud or misconduct;
• material failure of risk management and corporate failure;
• if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information; and,
• in other circumstances that the Committee considers justifying the operation of the clawback provision.
Committee’s judgement and discretion
In addition to assessing and making judgements on the meeting of performance targets and the appropriate incentives payable, 
the Committee has certain operational discretions it can exercise in relation to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These include, 
but are not limited to the following and in all cases any use of discretion will align with the discretions afforded to the Committee 
in the relevant plan rules:
• reviewing the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus, DSP and LTIP awards and applying discretion to amend the final 
outcomes, to ensure that the outcomes reflect overall performance or an individual executive’s performance;
• deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award; 
• determining whether a leaver is a “good leaver”; and
• determining the treatment of awards in the event of a change of control.
Where such discretion is exercised, it will be explained in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will apply the components of this Policy to determine the remuneration of newly appointed Executive Directors. 
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Executive Director being appointed. Where this 
is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the market level, subject to good performance. 
A new Executive Director would be eligible to receive an annual bonus of up to 150% of salary, or 175% for a new CEO, in each 
case with financial and strategic elements as set out in the Policy table above. In addition, a new Executive Director would 
be eligible to receive an LTIP award of up to 175% of salary, or 200% in the case of a new CEO, (in exceptional circumstances the 
Committee may on recruitment grant a percentage of salary in excess of these amounts but in such circumstances it would 
be capped at 300% of salary).
The Committee may also determine it appropriate to honour prevailing contract commitments for an individual in the event 
they are promoted to an Executive Director position.
In relation to Executive Directors appointed from outside the Group, where the Committee considers it to be necessary to secure 
the appointment of the Executive Director, the Committee may:
• pay compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer, or grant ‘buyout awards’ to replace awards or 
amounts forfeited by a previous employer (subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement 
to mitigate loss and the Group’s right to clawback any amount which is subsequently paid to the Executive Director by the 
former employer, and to claw back an appropriate proportion of the payment if the Executive Director leaves soon after 
appointment). Any compensation or buyout award made will not exceed the value of the benefits, awards or amounts lost 
as determined by the Committee acting fairly and reasonably. Any buyout award would have equivalent terms (including 
vesting dates, performance conditions and malus/clawback provisions) to the original award it replaces. Where possible, 
the Committee will use existing share-based plans to grant such awards. However, in the event that these are not appropriate, 
the Committee retains the discretion to use the exception in Listing Rule 9.4.2 for the purpose of making an award 
to compensate the individual for amounts forfeited upon leaving a previous employer;
• agree a rate for employer pensions contributions, or salary supplements in lieu of pension contribution, which reflects 
the contribution rate for the wider workforce at the date of appointment;
• make appropriate payments in circumstances where an Executive Director is relocated from outside the UK; and,
• approve the inclusion in the Executive Director’s service contract of any terms required by mandatory law in the 
jurisdiction where the Executive Director is resident.

Service agreements and termination
Executive Directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
notice. They are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office.
Element
Details
Notice periods
Executive Directors may be required to work during the notice period or may be provided with pay in lieu of notice 
if not required to work the full notice period.
Under each of the Executive Directors’ service agreements, the Group has the right to make a payment in lieu of 
notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the 
Executive Director during the contractual notice period. For the avoidance of any doubt this excludes any 
performance bonus (or cash equivalent) for the relevant period of unworked notice.
Compensation 
for loss of office
If an Executive Director’s employment is brought to an end by either party, and if the Committee considers that 
it is necessary to pay the Executive Director a termination payment, the Committee’s policy, in the absence of a 
breach of the service agreement by the Executive Director, is to determine an Executive Director’s termination 
payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The termination payment will be calculated based on the 
value of base salary and contractual benefits that would have accrued to the Executive Director during the 
contractual notice period. The Committee will seek mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment 
to a leaving Executive Director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the circumstances and the law 
governing the agreement. It may, for example, be appropriate to consider mitigation if the Executive Director 
has secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would not apply retrospectively to a contractual payment 
in lieu of notice.
In addition, the Executive Director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights (including, 
where necessary to comply with the mandatory laws of the jurisdiction in which the Executive Director is resident, 
a remuneration payment or payment for loss of office in excess of the Executive Director’s pre-established 
contractual terms). The Group may pay reasonable fees for a departing Executive Director to obtain independent 
legal advice in relation to their termination arrangements and appropriate consideration for agreement to any 
contractual terms protecting the Group’s rights following termination. Moreover, reasonable fees in respect 
of outplacement support, insurance for a period following termination of office and repatriation assistance, 
which may include relocation back and tax advisory support. No service agreement includes any provision 
for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances would 
need to be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
Element
Details
Treatment of 
annual bonus  
on termination
All bonus payments are discretionary. The Committee will consider whether a departing Executive Director should 
receive a cash bonus and deferred share award in respect of the financial year in which, and/or immediately 
preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated to reflect the period of the performance year completed to the 
date on which the Executive Director ceases active service. The Committee will take into account performance; 
the reason for termination; cooperation with succession; any breach of goodwill; adherence to contractual 
obligations/restrictions; and any other factors which they believe should be taken into account. The service 
contract for Will Gardiner as CEO, does not entitle him to any payment of bonus on termination of employment.
If the employment ends in any of the following circumstances, the Executive Director will be treated as a 
“good leaver” and the Executive Director will be eligible for an annual bonus:
• redundancy;
• retirement;
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Group; and,
• death.
If the termination is for any other reason, an award will be at the Committee’s discretion and it is the Committee’s 
policy to ensure that any such award properly reflects the departing Executive Director’s performance and 
behaviour towards the Group. Therefore the amount of any such award will be determined, taking into account 
(i) the Executive Director’s personal performance and behaviour towards the Group and (ii) the Group’s performance.
If an award is made, it will normally be paid/granted as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Group 
performance element has been determined for the relevant period. Any bonus award will be paid in such 
proportions of cash and shares, and subject to such deferral arrangements as the Committee may determine. 
There may be circumstances in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the award to be made earlier, 
for example, on termination due to ill-health, in which case, on-target performance shall be assumed.

Treatment of 
unvested long-
term incentive and 
deferred share 
awards on 
termination
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the Executive 
Director under the DSP and LTIP should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee will be in accordance 
with the rules of the relevant plan.
In summary, the rules of the LTIP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date of employment termination) 
if employment ends for any of the following reasons (“long-term good leaver reasons”):
• redundancy;
• retirement;
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Company;
• death; and,
• change of control.
If employment ends for any other reason, the participant may be deemed a “good leaver” at the Committee’s 
discretion. In doing so, it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, the Group’s performance; 
the Executive Director’s performance and behaviour towards the Group during the performance cycle of the 
relevant awards; and other relevant factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
Awards which vest subject to satisfaction of performance conditions, will be time pro-rated, and will ordinarily vest 
on the normal vesting date subject to the post-vesting shareholding period.
The rules of the DSP provide that deferred bonus awards will vest (in full) if employment ends for any of the good 
leaver reasons detailed above. If employment ends for any other reason, the participant may be deemed a “good 
leaver” at the Committee’s discretion. In doing so it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, 
the Group’s performance; the Executive Director’s performance and behaviour towards the Group during the 
performance cycle of the relevant awards, and a range of other relevant factors, including the proximity of the 
award to its maturity date.
The rules of the DSP and LTIP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, they do so at the normal 
vesting date, unless the Committee exercises discretion to vest awards earlier. Vested LTIP awards will remain 
subject to any post-vesting holding period unless the Committee exercises its discretion to allow for earlier release.
Outside 
appointments
Executive Directors may accept external Board appointments, subject to the Chair’s approval. Normally only one 
appointment to a listed company would be approved. Fees may be retained by the Executive Director.
Consideration of circumstances for leavers
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving Executive Director is fair and 
appropriate, taking account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may be minded 
to award a cash bonus, DSP award and/or permit the vesting of LTIP and/or DSP awards include:
• the Executive Director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice; and,
• the Executive Director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements.
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is (for example) 
due to poor performance or if the Executive Director does not continue to perform appropriately following notice.

Travel allowance
To recognise the additional 
time commitment 
associated with travel 
on Company business.
Set by reference to anticipated travel times and allowances provided 
by FTSE 350 companies in similar circumstances. 
A travel allowance may be structured as appropriate from time

Non-Executive Director and travel commitments, including but not 
limited to an annual allowance, an allowance per meeting and 
different allowances payable for Non-Executive Directors based in 
different countries or continents.
Where travel allowances are paid, these will be disclosed.

information on the service agreements of the Non-Executive Directors can be found on page 152 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the Group 
Wider employee population
In determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within 
the Group. Employees are not directly consulted on the Policy, but there are a number of existing channels designed to capture 
the views of the workforce on remuneration, including the MyVoice forums.
The Committee’s policy is that annual salary increases for Executive Directors should not exceed the average annual salary 
increase for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the 
nature or scope of responsibilities or if an Executive Director has been appointed at a salary below market level reflecting 
experience in the role.
The Committee also considers external market benchmarking to inform executive remuneration decisions. External market 
benchmarking is also considered in relation to remuneration decisions of the wider workforce.
Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting 
the remuneration of Executive Directors. Specific measures can be included in the strategic element of the annual bonus. 
The Committee is also able to consider these issues in determining whether to exercise its discretion to adjust formulaic 
outcomes of the annual bonus and LTIP.

Notes:
(1) Benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance and permanent health insurance.
(2)  Bonus is the value of the award from the 2021 and 2022 annual bonus plans. It includes the value of bonus deferred and paid in shares after three years subject only 
to continuous service. For 2021, 40% of the overall bonus was deferred and for 2022, 40% of the overall bonus will be deferred too. 
(3) The 2022 numbers represent the value of the 2020 LTIP award which should vest in May 2023, together with the dividend equivalent shares in relation to those vested 
shares. The value of the award is calculated based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2022, which was £5.798. The value of the award attributable 
to share price appreciation for Will Gardiner is £2.38m and for Andy Skelton is £1.36m. This is based on the growth in the value of the shares due to vest (including 
dividend equivalent shares) from the grant share price to the average share price over the last quarter of 2022 (£5.798). The 2021 number (for the 2019 PSP award) 
are restated to reflect the actual share price on vesting of £7.706 on 28 March 2022.
(4) Other includes the value of Sharesave awards granted. Note no Sharesave awards were made in 2021 or 2022 as both Will Gardiner and Andy Skelton had maximum 
contributions under contract.

Governance
Remuneration Committee report continued
The targets were aligned with the Group strategy and 2022 Business Plan and reviewed regularly by the Board as part of their ongoing 
scrutiny of business and executive performance. No adjustment to the performance targets was made. Outlined below is a brief 
synopsis of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used and their strategic rationale.
• Group Adjusted EBITDA – was our principal financial metric, combining the underlying performance of each business to give a Group 
outcome. Group Adjusted EBITDA for 2022 was £731 million relative to a stretch target of £627 million (score of 2.00). The outturn 
of this metric was part of the Group’s independent financial audit.
• Leverage (Average Net Debt) – a progressive and sustainable structural reduction in debt is a key objective for the Group 
with progress assessed against weighted average net debt targets measured within the financial year. Average net debt 
was (£968) million which fell between the budget target and stretch target (score of 1.69). The outturn was adjusted for collateral 
payments made to counterparties to ensure consistency with the target.
• Progress on Strategic Projects – progress on key projects is of critical importance for Drax in progressing the Group’s strategy. 
There were three projects which were included in this metric. The first project was progress on advancing options for our UK BECCS 
strategy. Significant progress was made in 2022 against the objectives set, across all critical path activities of our UK BECCS 
strategy (score of 1.54). The second project was on progress of advancing our options for BECCS in North America. As noted 
throughout this Annual Report, our ambitions for the deployment of new build BECCS across sites in North America are now 
a key part of Drax’s long-term strategic aims (score of 2.00). Further information on the progress of our aims for UK BECCS 
and BECCS in North America is detailed on page 16. The third project was on progress on advancing the expansion of the Cruachan 
pumped storage power station. Significant progress was made on this project as well in 2022, as evidenced by the submission 
of the S36 application to the Scottish Government and subsequent signing of a Grid Connection offer with National Grid ESO. 
In addition, significant progress was made across other critical path activities (score of 1.66). The choice of projects, and assessment 
of performance of them in 2022 was subject to the Committee’s scrutiny and approval.
• People, carbon reduction, and sustainability practices are a critical part of our values, vision and how Drax will create long-term 
sustainable returns for shareholders. In 2022 the assessment of our carbon reduction aims was focused on the development 
of a blueprint for an ultra-low carbon and particulate emissions pellet mill by the end of the year with learnings from this ready 
to deploy for future projects (score of 2.00). This was combined with an independent rating of how included our colleagues feel 
across the Group, which directly links bonus outcomes to positive cultural change and influencing behaviours which can benefit our 
people and engender better organisational attitudes and initiates. The rating is derived through an all-employee survey administered 
by a leading and globally recognised management consultancy. Drax’s score for 2022 was 2% above the energy and utilities sector 
norm score (score of 1.50). In 2022 the assessment of our sustainable business practice was focused on the development of 
and implementation of ESG dashboards across the Group. The intention of these dashboards was to provide visibility of data 
on key metrics to the management teams at site and pellet mill level. These dashboards have now been implemented and insights 
from them have already started to influence important decision making (score of 1.75). 
The Committee completed an in-depth review of the score for each of the performance measures, to ensure that the result was 
appropriate individually and in aggregate. The Committee believes that the outcome reflected the strong financial and strategic 
performance of the Group, as well as wider employee and shareholder experiences. Discretion was exercised by the Committee 
to reduce the formulaic outturn of the bonus to reflect safety performance in 2022 as described on page 128. The Committee 
approved the Group Scorecard result for 2022 at a meeting held on 21 February 2023, subject to the final approval of the financial 
results and Annual Report and Accounts by the Directors on 22 February 2023.

cash in March 2023. The deferral element will in ordinary circumstances vest in March 2026, subject to the Executive Director being 
employed by Drax at that time. If the Executive Director leaves, other than as a “good leaver”, the deferral element will be forfeited.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited information)
The shareholding guidelines under the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy require Executive Directors who receive shares 
by virtue of share plan awards, or who receive deferred bonus share awards under the DSP, to retain 50% of the shares received net 
(i.e. after income tax and national insurance contributions) until the value held is equal to at least 250% of salary for the CEO and 200% 
of salary for other Executive Directors. Only shares that are not subject to performance conditions count towards the shareholding 
requirement (shares owned by the Director and unvested awards subject to service only – DSP awards – on a net of tax basis).
As at 31 December 2022, the shareholding guidelines were met as detailed in the table below.

Notes:
(1) The vesting date shown reflects the three-year anniversary, but the Committee reserves the right to change the vesting date by a period not exceeding 30 days.
(2) Based on the mid-market quotation on 31 December 2022 of £7.030. For Sharesave options, this is the intrinsic value, e.g. based on the excess value at 31 December 
2022 over and above the exercise price.
There was one movement in share interests between 31 December 2022 and the last practicable date for recording changes prior to 
the date of publication. On 23 February 2023 Andy Skelton, CFO, purchased 13,246 shares, and Andy’s Person Closely Associated, 
Nichola Skelton, purchased 6,244 shares, taking Andy’s total interest in shares to 297,157.

Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below illustrates the relative importance of spend on pay compared to distributions to shareholders. At the AGM on the 
26 April 2023 the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for 
the year ended 31 December 2022. The cost with respect to dividends for 2022 in the table below relates to the interim dividend, 
which was paid in October 2022, and the final dividend to be paid in May 2023, subject to approval at the AGM.

Percentage change in Directors’ remuneration compared with the wider employee population
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Directors’ salary/fees, benefits and bonus (where applicable) between 
2020 and 2022 compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for a group of employees. 
There are several employer entities but no employees who are specifically employed by Drax Group plc. As a result, the Committee 
has selected all Group employees below Executive Director level based in the UK, as the majority of employees are based in the UK 
and this provides the most appropriate comparison.

Notes:
(1) With respect to taxable benefits, there has been no material change to Drax’s existing benefits policies over the three reporting years.
(2) The maximum bonus opportunity for Will Gardiner and Andy Skelton increased for 2021 to 175% and 150% respectively, which explains the percentage difference 
compared to UK colleagues. The bonus scorecard outcome for 2019 and 2020 was the same and this is reflected in the 0% change for the average UK employee.
(3) The percentage change for 2022 shows an increase from 2021. This is because the bonus scorecard outcome for 2022 (1.75) is higher than it was for 2021 (1.61). 
Both Will Gardiner and Andy Skelton received higher base pay increases in 2022 than the average UK employee reflective of the changes to the business and therefore 
their bonus change for 2022 is larger when compared to the average UK employee.
(4) Kim Keating and Erika Peterman joined the Board on 21 October 2021 and therefore the percentage change in their fees has not been provided for 2020 and 2021.

CEO pay ratio
The table below sets out the CEO pay ratio for 2022, along with the comparative ratios since 2019. The pay ratios have been 
calculated using actual earnings for the CEO and UK employees. The CEO total single figure remuneration is given on page 147 
of this report.

The methodology used for calculating the 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 pay ratios was the same. For 2022, the total remuneration of all 
UK employees of the Group on 31 December 2022 has been calculated on a full-time (and full-year) equivalent basis using the single 
figure methodology and reflects their actual earnings for 2022. The only exception is for employees with Defined Benefit (DB) 
pensions, where the employer contribution to the respective schemes has been used in the calculation (rather than the single figure 
methodology) to reduce the administrative complexity. This is likely to undervalue the DB pension value. No adjustments, other than 
to achieve full-time and full-year equivalent rates, were made and no components of remuneration have been omitted. Of the three 
options permitted to calculate the percentiles, the Committee has chosen option A (the calculation of the total pay and benefits 
for 2022 for all UK employees on an FTE basis), as we believe it is the most robust and most statistically accurate method of the 
options permitted.
Set out in the table below is the base salary and the total pay and benefits for each of the identified employees in respect of 2022.

Total Pay and Benefits
£47,370

£94,770
Base salaries of all employees, including Executive Directors, are set with reference to a range of factors including market practice, 
experience and performance in role. The CEO has a larger portion of his pay based on performance of the business than the individuals 
at P25, P50 and P75. The Committee believe that our senior executives should have a significant portion of their pay directly linked 
to the performance of the business but recognise that this does mean the pay ratios will fluctuate each year depending on business 
performance and associated outcomes of incentive plans.
The 2022 pay ratios report a wider gap between actual earnings of the CEO and UK employees (than compared to the 2019, 2020 
and 2021 CEO pay ratios). This is ultimately due to the higher vesting of the 2020 LTIP versus the vesting of the 2019, 2018 and 2017 
PSP awards (100% versus 77.28%, 57.2% and 18.0% respectively). To a lesser extent, this is also driven by the higher Scorecard 
outcome for 2022 than in the previous years in the sample (1.75 versus, 1.61, 0.90 and 0.90).
The Group is comprised of different business units and teams with different levels of pay, including call centre staff, support staff 
and engineers. The Committee reviews information about employee pay, reward and progression policies of the Group and (given the 
relative differences in responsibilities of the roles, the pay relativities between grades within the organisation, and the positioning 
of pay versus the wider market) is comfortable that the median pay ratio is consistent with these policies.

Single total figure of remuneration – Non-Executive Directors (audited information)
The fees for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors were reviewed at the start of 2022 and were subsequently increased by 4.5% with 
effect from 1 January 2022. This was aligned with the average increase for the wider workforce in 2022. For completeness, the table 
below sets out the single figure of remuneration and breakdown for each Non-Executive Director for 2022 together with comparative

Statement of Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2023
This section sets out the proposed implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration policy in 2023. No deviations from the procedure 
for the implementation of the policy are proposed.
Base Salary
Below are the base salaries of the Executive Directors which took effect from 1 January 2023. There are no further planned increases 
for 2023. The base salary increase in January 2023 was 4.0% and this was made as part of the annual pay review process. 
This increase was less than the average increase for the wider workforce. A more thorough explanation on the pay increase is given 
on page 130 which also outlines the decision to bring forward the effective date of the 2023 pay review from 1 April to 1 January.

Benefits and pension
There are no changes intended to the benefits provided to the Executive Directors. The pension contribution rate for Will Gardiner 
reduced from 20% to 10% and for Andy Skelton reduced from 16% to 10%, effective 1 January 2023. The purpose of this change 
was to align their pension contribution rate with the applicable rate for new joiners to the UK wider workforce.
Annual bonus
The Group Scorecard metrics for 2023 are shown below. The performance targets for the scorecard are commercially sensitive 
therefore protective disclosure would not be in the best interest to stakeholders. The outcome of the 2023 scorecard will be disclosed 
in the 2023 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Target
Reason for use
Financial metrics (overall weighting of 60% in the Scorecard)
Group adjusted EBITDA 
(40% weighting)
Adjusted EBITDA is our principal financial metric, combining the underlying performance of each 
business to give a Group outcome.
Leverage  
(20% weighting)
A progressive and structural reduction in debt is a key objective for the Group with progress 
assessed against weighted average net debt targets measured within the financial year.
Strategic metrics (overall 40% weighting in the Scorecard)
Progress on strategic projects  
(20% weighting)
This element of the Scorecard will be assessed on progress against three key strategic imperatives. 
The first is a KPI based on progress made on BECCS, both in respect to advancing our roadmap for 
the implementation of BECCS at Drax Power Station and the deployment of new build BECCS in 
the US. The second KPI focuses on the expansion of the Cruachan pumped storage power station. 
Performance will be assessed against a range of technical and commercial milestones. The third 
KPI focuses on the delivery of the stretching budget volume growth in 2023 of our pellet 
production.
Safety and ESG  
(20% weighting)
Safety and ESG are a critical part of our values and how Drax will create long-term sustainable 
returns for shareholders. This element of the Scorecard will be assessed against three facets. 
The first is a KPI focused on improving inclusion across Drax, assessed based on an independent 
rating. This KPI was included in the prior year Scorecard. The second KPI is focused on reducing 
Drax’s carbon emissions across the Group and at a site level. Finally, a safety KPI is re-introduced 
to the Scorecard providing a holistic view of the Group’s safety performance. 
LTIP
The Committee intends to grant LTIP awards to Executive Directors of 200% of salary for the CEO and 175% of salary for the CFO. 
For the TSR element, performance will be assessed versus the constituents of the FTSE 350 with threshold vesting (25% of maximum) 
for performance in line with the median and maximum vesting for performance in line with upper quartile. TSR performance will be 
measured over the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025. 
For the EPS element, targets for the 2023 grant have been agreed by the Committee at the meeting in February. The EPS target was set 
after considering the company’s internal forecasts, market expectations and sector peers. The EPS target is ‘Adjusted EPS’, derived from 
Adjusted Results as reported in the Company’s audited financial statements. Instances where such adjustments might apply include 
acquisition and restructuring costs, asset obsolescence charges and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. EPS performance 
will be measured over the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025 and vesting will be in accordance with the following schedule. 
Note, vesting between the threshold and maximum will be on a straight-line basis. The Committee will undertake a final review of the 
proposed grants for the 2023 financial year, including the performance targets, immediately prior to making the grant in order, where 
necessary, to reflect changes to market conditions. This recognises current market volatility.

With regards to targets set in 2023 for each of the performance related incentives, the Committee retains discretion to restate or 
make adjustment to those targets in appropriate circumstances (such as material acquisitions, divestments, changes in capital 
structure or capital returns to shareholders). This would take account of the importance of such performance targets fulfilling their 
original intent and that they are not more or less challenging than intended when set and of relevant events in the performance period. 
Any amendments would be disclosed in the Remuneration Report at the relevant time.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The annual fee structure for the Non-Executive Directors for 2023 is shown in the table below. The fee structure for 2022 is also 
provided for reference. The increase in base fee for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors is consistent with the increase that the 
Executive Directors received as part of the 2023 annual pay review process (which was less than the average increase of the wider 
workforce of 8%). Following an exercise with the Committee’s independent adviser, it was identified that the additional fees were 
significantly below market rate given the current and expected future time commitment of the roles. The proposed increase to the 
additional fees is to bring them in line with the median of constituents of the FTSE 250 of a similar size to Drax. As outlined in the 
Policy, subject to shareholder approval, flexibility will be introduced to provide a travel allowance to recognise the additional time 
and expenses incurred by non-executives based overseas in providing services to a UK based listed company.

Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s Ordinary Shares are set out in the Articles, available on the Company’s website at  
www.drax.com/about-us/corporate-governance/compliance-and-policies/. The Articles may only be changed by shareholders  
by special resolution. 
Attention should be given to the following sections within the Articles, covering the rights and obligations attaching to shares:
• Variation of rights – which covers the rights attached to any class of shares that may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the relevant class (excluding any shares of that class 
held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders  
of shares of the class duly convened and held in accordance with the Companies Act.
• Transfer of shares – provides detail of how transfers of shares may be undertaken. It also sets out the Directors’ rights of refusal 
to effect a transfer and the action that Directors must take following such refusal. It should be noted that a shareholder does not 
need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other holders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares to take place.
• Voting, deadlines and proxies – these sections of the Articles deal with voting on a show of hands and on a poll. They also cover the 
appointment of a proxy or corporate representative. In respect of appointment of a proxy or corporate representative, the Articles 
provide for the submission of proxy forms not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Board may determine) before the time 
appointed for the holding of the meeting. It has been the Company’s practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution 
at Annual General Meetings and General Meetings. 
Disabled employees
The Company gives full consideration to applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with  
the Group continues, and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should, so far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.

Political donations
Drax is a politically neutral organisation and, as further explained below, did not make any political donations or incur any political 
expenditure (within the ordinary meaning of those words) in 2022. The Company regularly engages with regulators and policymakers 
(including those associated with political parties and governments) to listen and contribute to discussions on a wide range of matters. 
Such engagement is an important part of our strategy and contributing to initiatives enabling the UK in its goal of reaching net zero by 
2050. Further information on how we engage with stakeholders can be found on pages 26 to 33, and our Political Engagement Policy 
can be found on the Company’s website at: www.drax.com/about-us/corporate-governance/compliance-and-policies/drax-political-
engagement-policy/. Due to the broad definition of political donations under the Companies Act 2006 (the Act),and as a matter of good 
governance and transparency, we have provided information on areas of expenditure incurred as a result of this engagement which 
may be regarded as falling within the scope of the Act. During the year ended 31 December 2022, Drax exhibited at, sponsored, and 
held events at, conferences organised by political parties, spending a total of £94,572 (2021: £75,925). This included sponsorship of 
events at the Labour Party business conference (£12,000) and the Yorkshire and the Humber Labour Party annual conference 
(£12,000), and hiring exhibition stands at the Conservative Party annual conference (£45,377) and Scottish National Party annual 
conference (£10,495). These events allow Drax to present its views on a non-partisan basis to politicians from across the political 
spectrum and non-political stakeholders such as NGOs and other listed and non-listed companies. These payments do not indicate 
support for any political party. Overall, the recipients were the Conservative Party (£57,977), the Labour Party (£26,100) and the 
Scottish National Party (£10,495).
At the 2023 AGM, Drax will be seeking renewal from shareholders of the existing authority approved at the 2022 AGM. More details 
are contained in the Notice of Meeting.

if any lender requires, it may by giving notice to the relevant Group entity within 30 days of receiving notice from such Group entity 
that a change of control has occurred, cancel its commitments and require the repayment of its share of any outstanding amounts 
within three business days of such cancellation notice being given.

Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements
Other than a service contract between the Executive Directors and a Group company, no Director had a material interest at any time 
during the year in any significant contract with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings. There are no agreements between 
the Group and its Directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment because of a takeover bid. The Company has 
appropriate indemnity insurance cover in place in respect of legal action against Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Strategic report
The Strategic report on pages 1 to 91 contains disclosures in relation to workforce engagement, stakeholder engagement,  
diversity, Greenhouse Gas emissions, streamlined energy and carbon reporting requirements (SECR), future development  
and research activities.
Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditor
So far as each person serving as a Director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, 
being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors, each Director has taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to ascertain any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This information is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.
During 2021 the Audit Committee conducted an audit tender process for the external auditor. The result of this tender process was 
the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the new external auditor, to take effect from, and including, the financial 
year ending 31 December 2024. The appointment will be recommended to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2024. Deloitte LLP 
continued in its role as external auditor to Drax for the financial year ending 31 December 2022 and, subject to shareholder approval 
at the 2023 AGM, Deloitte LLP will continue in its role as external auditor to Drax for the financial year ending 31 December 2023. 
Resolutions will be proposed at the AGM for (i) the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group; and (ii) authorising 
the Directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration. The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, the auditor’s 
effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Further details 
on the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 116 to 126.

Governance
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standards and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law), set out in FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole;
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

We want to be carbon

Deploying BECCS at scale

It’ll bring about a 
significant change for 
Drax. Not only will we 
continue to be the 
backbone of the UK’s

Report on the audit of the financial statements
1. Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting 
standards;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
• the consolidated cash flow statement;
• the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies on pages 176 to 180; 
• the notes in Section 2.1 to 8.3 related to the consolidated financial statements; and
• the notes in Section 1 to 9 related to the parent company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law, 
United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit 
services provided to the group for the year are disclosed in Section 2.3 of the notes to the financial statements. We confirm that 
we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
3. Summary of our audit approach
Key audit 
matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
• Valuation of commodity, inflation and foreign exchange contracts
• Estimation of Customers accrued income
• Estimation of expected credit loss provision in Opus Energy Limited (Opus Energy)
Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:
!  Newly identified
 Increased level of risk
 Similar level of risk
 Decreased level of risk
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £15m, representing approximately 2% of current 
year’s Adjusted EBITDA1. 
Scoping
As further explained in Section 7.1, we performed full scope audit on eight significant components, and audit of 
specified account balances on a non- significant component. These components represent the group’s principal 
business units and account for substantially all the group’s net assets, revenue, and profit before tax.
Significant 
changes in our 
approach
Changes in key audit matters
Estimation of expected credit loss provisions in Opus Energy has been identified as a key audit matter in the current 
year due to the increase in risk of customer default associated with the current macro-economic conditions and 
uncertainties. 
1 Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional 
items and certain remeasurements

4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting included:
• evaluating the availability of adequate funding, repayment terms and covenants;
• assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management and key assumptions underpinning the forecasts; 
• checking the mathematical accuracy of the model used to prepare the forecasts; 
• challenging the assumptions used in the forecasts, including performing sensitivity analyses in relation to assumptions for future 
commodity prices; 
• checking the amount of headroom in the forecasts;
• assessing whether the directors have considered and reflected the impact of climate risks and opportunities in the group’s going 
concern assessment; and
• evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures in the financial statements.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
In relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections 
of this report.
5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
5.1. Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  
 
Key audit 
matter 
description
As at 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of the group’s goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 
£424.2m (2021: £416.3m) and £142.3m (2021: £188.6m). 
The group’s impairment assessment of the carrying value of each cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated, 
is performed in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The recoverable amount of the group’s goodwill was 
assessed by reference to value in use calculations which require estimates, including significant assumptions regarding 
future cash flows and discount rates. The cash flow forecasts are derived from the group’s business plan, which 
considers variables such as margins, supply volumes and inflation. The forecasts also reflect relevant impact of climate 
risks such as future commodity prices on cash flows.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are disclosed in Section 5.2 of the notes to the financial statements. Climate and 
biomass acceptability risks are disclosed in the principal risk section of the strategic report.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We obtained an understanding of relevant controls related to the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
We checked the mathematical accuracy of the impairment models and the methodology applied for consistency with 
the requirements of IAS 36. We evaluated the key assumptions including margins, future commodity prices and 
inflation rates, and assessed retrospectively whether prior year assumptions were appropriate.
With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s discount rates. 
We benchmarked the discount rate to comparable companies and considered the underlying assumptions based on our 
knowledge of the group and its industry
We assessed the accuracy of management’s cash flow forecasts by comparing historical forecasts with actual cash 
flows, external industry benchmarks and the impact of any climate change risks. We checked whether projected cash 
flows were consistent with Board approved forecasts. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses, including the 
impact of physical and transition climate change risks, as part of our overall evaluation of the forecasts
In respect of climate-related risks, we assessed whether key assumptions, such as future commodity prices, relating 
to the group’s principal climate change risks have been incorporated into the group’s forecasts. We further considered 
whether the forecasts and related cash flow sensitivities are consistent with the scenarios applied in the group’s 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
We also assessed the completeness and accuracy of the financial statements’ disclosures in relation to the impairment 
assessments performed.
Key 
observations
We conclude that the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as the relevant disclosures are 
appropriate based on the results of our work.

variety of derivative contracts, including commodity contracts and cross currency swaps to mitigate its exposures to 
financial risks such as foreign exchange risk and commodity risk.
The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement such as in the selection of appropriate 
valuation methodologies and relevant assumptions, including future market prices, credit risk factors, time value of 
money and spread adjustments. Due to these complexities and the large volume of data used in the valuation, we have 
identified the risk of error and risk of fraud in this regard.
Specifically, this risk has been pinpointed to the valuation of inflation swaps and the application of credit risk data 
calculations as part of deriving overall fair value estimates for derivative contracts. 
Furthermore, the group enters into contracts to buy and sell biomass. As disclosed in the critical accounting 
judgements, these contracts are currently considered to be outside the scope of IFRS 9 on the basis that they are not 
settleable on net basis. An error in this judgement could lead to excluding material amounts from the consolidated 
balance sheet. Accordingly, we identified a risk of error in relation to the judgement reached on the accounting for 
these biomass contracts.
Further detail of the key judgements is disclosed in the Audit Committee report section on page 123 and Section 1 
on page 183 of the notes to the financial statements. Financial risk management disclosures are set out in Section 7.1 
of the notes to the financial statements.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We obtained an understanding of and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls related to the valuation 
of commodity, inflation and foreign exchange contracts. 
With the involvement of our financial instrument specialists, we tested management’s key judgements and calculations. 
This included testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets and checking key contractual terms such as 
volumes and contracted prices.
We assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the fair value 
of the derivative instruments, and performed independent valuations on a sample of commodity, inflation and foreign 
exchange contracts.
We checked the appropriateness of management’s assumptions by benchmarking these to third party sources. We also 
evaluated the consistency of these assumptions against other relevant areas of the financial statements such as asset 
impairment.
We challenged management’s approach and assumptions for assessing fair value adjustments such as credit risk, 
time value of money and spread adjustments through consideration of third-party data.
We challenged the group’s assessment and judgement on whether biomass contracts are “net settleable” against the 
requirement of IFRS 9 and relevant accounting standards and by considering contradictory sources of evidence.
Key 
observations
The valuation of commodity, inflation and foreign exchange contracts, and the judgement reached on the net 
settlement of biomass contracts are reasonable, based on the results of our audit.
We consider the valuation methodologies used by management to be appropriate and the valuations are within 
acceptable ranges for all instruments.

5.3. Estimation of Customers accrued income  
Key audit 
matter 
description
The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last billing and year 
end, which is known as accrued income. Across the Customers division, accrued income at year-end amounted to 
£342.6m (2021: £153.1m). 
The method of estimating accrued income is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the volumes 
of energy consumed by customers and the related value attributed to those volumes in the range of tariffs. Therefore, 
we identified the risk of error and the risk of fraud on the estimation of accrued income.
Accrued income is disclosed in Section 3.5 of the notes to the financial statements.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We obtained an understanding of relevant controls over the estimation of accrued income, including the reconciliation 
of meter readings provided by the energy markets and used by management to estimate the power supplied; and the 
controls over the price per unit applied in the valuation of certain aspects of accrued income.
We agreed the volume data for customer usage of energy in the year used in the calculation to external settlement 
systems and agreed the volume data in relation to customer billings for the year to internal billing systems to assess for 
consistency and assess any residual estimation risk. When external market information was not available at the balance 
sheet date, our data analytics specialists assisted us in testing the group’s reconciliation of the volume of power 
purchased and their calculation of revenue supplied to assess whether accrued income as at 2022 year end was 
subsequently billed.
We compared the unbilled unit pricing by agreeing historical pricing to sample bills, sensitising the pricing to understand 
the impact of different pricing assumptions.
We evaluated the historical accuracy of management’s forecasting of accrued income by comparing estimates to final 
billed and settlement amounts.
Key 
observations
We consider the estimated accrued income to be appropriate.
5.4. Estimation of expected credit loss provision in Opus Energy  !
Key audit 
matter 
description
The current macro-economic conditions including rising energy bills, increases in the cost of living and rising inflation 
has increased the rate of credit defaults across several industries. The group is therefore required to make judgements 
and estimates on expected credit loss provision for trade receivables. Opus Energy is an entity within the Customers’ 
segment whose customers are Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) – including retail, entertainment, and hospitality 
businesses – where the range of judgement that could apply is far broader relative to the other group entities. We 
therefore identified a risk of error and a risk of fraud on the estimation of expected credit loss provisions in Opus Energy. 
The group uses a machine learning algorithm to calculate expected credit losses for its SME customer base. The 
algorithm predicts the future performance of debt on an individual account basis using a broad range of indicators and 
that are specific to the customer. Further detail on the estimation of expected credit loss model is provided in note 3.5 
of the financial statements.
A credit loss provision of £60.9m (2021: £46.6m) has been recorded at year end. Total Trade receivables were £337.5m 
(2021: £234.1m) against which a total provision associated with Opus Energy at the balance sheet date amounted to 
£54.9m (2021: £44.4m). 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the estimation of expected credit losses in line 
with the requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the expected credit loss model. With the involvement 
of our expected credit loss specialists and data analytics specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the model 
parameters and output of the expected credit loss model including its mathematical accuracy. Further we challenged 
the group’s assumptions, including forward-looking assumptions regarding ongoing macro-economic conditions and 
whether they reflect the lifetime expected credit outcomes for the amount receivable at year end.
We challenged the overall reasonableness of the provisions recognised at year end by assessing trends in cash 
payments, cancellation of direct debits and benchmarking the recorded provision against alternative valuation models, 
cash collection rates and external valuations.
We tested the historical accuracy of management’s estimation of expected credit loss provision by comparing 
estimates to actual write offs.
Key 
observations
Based on the work performed we concluded that the expected credit loss provision has been appropriately stated.

6. Our application of materiality
6.1. Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements
Materiality
£15.0m (2021: £11.4m)
£4.2m (2021: £4.0m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
Approximately 2% of current year’s Adjusted EBITDA 
(2021: 3% of Adjusted EBITDA) and corresponds to 3% 
of last three year’s average Adjusted EBITDA.
In determining our materiality for the current year, we 
have applied a lower factor of 2% (2021: 3%) to the 
Adjusted EBITDA to reflect the impact of volatility in 
current macro-economic conditions on current year’s 
results.
0.5% of net assets (2021: 0.5%) capped at 28% (2021: 35%) 
of the materiality identified for the group.
Rationale for 
the benchmark 
applied
Adjusted EBITDA was applied as it is considered to be of 
particular relevance to users of the financial statements as 
a key profit-based measure of performance used by the 
group. This measure allows the underlying profitability of 
the group’s core business activities to be assessed year on 
year. It excludes fluctuations caused in particular by the 
remeasurements of derivative contracts and exceptional 
items, defined as those transactions that, by their nature, 
do not reflect the trading performance of the group in the 
period. 
Net asset is considered the relevant benchmark for 
materiality determination due to the principal activity 
of the parent company as an investment holding entity 
for the group.

6.2. Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements
Performance 
materiality
70% (2021: 70%) of group materiality
70% (2021: 70%) of parent company materiality
Basis and 
rationale for 
determining 
performance 
materiality
In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: 
a)  our risk assessment, including our assessment of the overall control environment and that we consider it 
appropriate to rely on controls over a number of business processes; 
b)  no significant changes in the nature of the entity’s business during the year which would impact on our ability to 
identify potential misstatements; and
c)  history of low level of misstatements identified in the previous audits and managements willingness to correct 
those adjustments. 
6.3. Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.8m (2021: £0.6m), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1. Identification and scoping of components
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group- wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. We performed full scope audit work at eight components: Drax Power 
Limited, Drax Pumped Storage Limited, Drax Smart Generation Holdco Limited, Drax Energy Solutions Limited, Drax Corporate 
Limited, Drax Group Holdings Limited, Drax Biomass Inc and Opus Energy Limited. Audit of specified account balances was performed 
at Northern Pellet Operations. These components represent the group’s principal business units and account for substantially all of the 
group’s net assets, revenue, and profit before tax.
The group audit was performed by the group audit team in the UK and a component Deloitte team in Canada under the supervision of 
the Senior Statutory Auditor. The full scope entities are all based in the United Kingdom and audited by the group audit team. Our audit 
work at all significant component locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower 
than group materiality and ranged from £4.2m to £9.5m (2021: £4.0m to £6.0m). Component materiality levels were set based on the 
size and nature of each component on a range of applicable metrics.
At the group level, we also tested the consolidation process and performed analytical reviews to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to 
audit or audit of specified account balances.
7.2. Our consideration of the control environment 
Our audit approach was to place reliance on management’s relevant controls over revenue and financial instruments business cycles. 
As part of our controls testing, we obtained an understanding of and tested controls through a combination of inquiry, observation, 
inspection, and re-performance.
We also involved our IT specialists in assessing relevant controls over the group’s IT systems. Working with IT specialists we obtained 
an understanding of the IT environment to assess the relevant risks of material misstatement arising from each relevant IT system and 
the supporting infrastructure technologies based on the role of each application in the group’s flow of transactions. For the assessed 
risks on key IT systems, we obtained an understanding of and tested relevant automated and general IT controls.
7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks 
The group has considered climate change risk and biomass acceptability risk as part of their risk assessment process when considering 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group. This is set out in the strategic report on pages 87 to 90, and Section 3.8 of the 
notes to the financial statements on page 227. The areas of the financial statements that are notably impacted by climate-related 
considerations are associated with future forecasts in the medium to long term. These include the valuation of property, plant and 
equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets. Our response is highlighted in section. 5.1 above. In addition, we have
• assessed and challenged the key financial statement line items and estimates which are more likely to be materially impacted by climate 
change risks given the more notable impacts of climate change on the business are expected to arise in the medium to long term. 
• challenged how the directors considered climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability based on our 
understanding of the business environment and by benchmarking relevant assumptions with market data.
• involved our Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) specialist in in challenging the group’s climate and biomass acceptability 
principal risk assessments. The ESG specialists were also involved in reviewing the Sustainable Development section of the annual 
report and assessing TCFD on pages 38 – 43 against the recommendations of the TCFD framework.
• assessed whether climate risk assumptions underpinning specific account balances were appropriately disclosed. 
• read the climate risk and biomass acceptability risk disclosures included in the strategic report section of the annual report 
for consistency with the financial statements and our knowledge of the business environment.

7.4. Working with other auditors
The group audit team are responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and provide direct oversight, review, and 
coordination of our component audit teams. The group audit team interacted regularly with the component teams during each stage 
of the audit and reviewed key working papers. The group audit team maintained continuous and open dialogue with the component 
teams in addition to holding formal regular meetings to ensure that the group audit team were fully aware of their progress and results 
of their procedures. The group audit team also sent detailed instructions to the component audit teams and attended audit closing 
meetings.
8. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise 
to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.
11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non- compliance with laws 
and regulations, we considered the following:
• the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group’s 
remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;
• the group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error;
• results of our inquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment of the 
risks of irregularities; 
• the involvement of our internal fraud specialists in planning our response to potential fraud risk factors, in particular through 
attending engagement team discussions;
• any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:
 
– identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-
compliance;
 
– detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
 
– the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
• the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit team and relevant internal 
specialists, including forensics, tax, pensions, IT, valuations, financial instruments and ESG specialists regarding how and where 
fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

Financial statements
Independent Auditor’s report to the members of Drax Group plc continued
As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud 
and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: valuation of commodity, inflation and foreign exchange contracts, 
estimation of Customers accrued income and expected credit loss provision in Opus Energy, as well as cut-off of bilateral sales. 
In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of 
management override.
We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those 
laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The key laws and regulations we considered in this context the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, Tax legislation, 
and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the group operates, including the Office of Gas and Electricity 
Markets and biomass- related regulations.
In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements 
but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty.
11.2. Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified valuation of commodity, inflation and foreign exchange contracts, estimation 
of Customers accrued income and estimation of expected credit loss provision in Opus Energy as key audit matters related to the 
potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains these matters in more detail and also describes the specific 
procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. 
In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
• reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions 
of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements
• inquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
• performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud;
• reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence 
with HMRC and Ofgem;
• in addressing the risk of fraud in cut-off of bilateral sales, in addition to our testing described above we have performed focused 
testing on trades close to the year-end combined with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy and completeness of 
revenue recognised; and
• in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other 
adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and 
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including 
internal specialists and component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and 
regulations throughout the audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

13. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: 
• the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 
uncertainties identified set out on pages 76 and 77;
• the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period 
is appropriate set out on page 76 and 77;
• the directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 166;
• the board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on pages 76 and 77;
• the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out 
on pages 76 and 77; and
• the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 120.
14. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
14.1. Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
14.2. Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
15. Other matters which we are required to address
15.1. Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 
27 April 2021 to audit the financial statements for the years ending 31 December 2022 and 2023. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 18 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2005 
to 2022. Our last audit of the group, due to mandatory auditor rotation, will be the year ending 31 December 2023. 
15.2. Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance 
with ISAs (UK).
16. Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
As required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R, these financial 
statements form part of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) prepared Annual Financial Report filed on the National Storage 
Mechanism of the UK FCA in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditor’s report provides 
no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared using the single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.

Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using 
the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income 
and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling 
using the average monthly exchange rate to the extent that this 
approximates the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transactions. If the average monthly exchange rate is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, income and expenditure are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
retranslation of the operation’s net assets, and its results for 
the year, are recognised in OCI.
Climate change
The impact of climate change has been considered throughout 
the preparation of the Annual report and accounts. In particular, 
in the Strategic report the TCFD disclosures contain information 
on the four recommendations and 11 recommended disclosures 
of the FCA LR 9.8.6(8). Consideration in respect of the 
Consolidated financial statements focused on:
• Critical accounting judgements 
• Impairment of assets
• Going concern and viability
• Useful economic lives of fixed assets
Further information on these areas can be found in note 3.8 
to the Consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments 
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash 
flows, are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 4 to 91 
of this Annual report and accounts. The current energy market 
conditions and their impact on the Group are considered in the 
Financial review on page 20.
In the Viability statement on pages 75 to 76, the Directors state 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the next five years based on forecasts and projections 
that take into account reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance and other key assumptions. Consequently, the 
Directors also have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue in existence for the next 12 months from the date 
of signing these Consolidated financial statements and have 
therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing these 
Consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
These Consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial results of the Company and of all its subsidiaries made 
up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities controlled 
by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the 
date on which the Group obtains control of an entity to the date 
control ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
aligned where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses, 
unrealised profits and cash flows relating to transactions 
between the members of the Group are eliminated on 
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
transferred asset.
Introduction
The Consolidated financial statements provide detailed 
information about the financial performance (Consolidated 
income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income), financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), reserves 
(Consolidated statement of changes in equity), and cash flows 
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the 
Company) together with all of the entities controlled by the 
Company (collectively, the Group).
The notes to the Consolidated financial statements provide 
additional information on the items in the Consolidated income 
statement, Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
Consolidated balance sheet, Consolidated statement of changes 
in equity and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes 
include explanations of the information presented. In general, 
the additional information in the notes to the Consolidated 
financial statements is required by law, International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) or other regulations to facilitate 
increased understanding of the primary statements set out 
on pages 185 to 189, as well as voluntary information which 
management believe users of the accounts may find useful, 
in line with the principles of IFRS.
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the United Kingdom adopted International 
Accounting Standards (as issued by the UK Endorsement Board) 
and in conformity with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities 
that are measured at fair value (principally derivative financial 
instruments) and the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes (measured at fair value and using the 
projected unit credit method respectively).
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the average monthly exchange rate to the extent that this 
approximates the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. If the average monthly exchange rate is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, income and expenditure are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items measured at 
historical cost are translated at the date of the transaction using 
the average monthly exchange rate to the extent that this 
approximates the rate prevailing on the date the transaction 
occurred. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value are 
translated at the exchange rate at the date when fair value was 
determined. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such 
translations are recognised in the Consolidated income statement 
within foreign exchange gains or losses unless they relate to 
qualifying cash flow hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
on qualifying cash flow hedges are recognised within the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, within Other 
comprehensive income (OCI) and deferred within equity, to the 
extent the hedges are effective, until the hedged item impacts 
the Consolidated income statement.

Financial statements
Associates are tested for impairment whenever there are any 
indicators of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised to the 
extent that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses on associates are 
recognised within Income from associates in the Consolidated 
income statement.
Accounting policies
The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an 
individual item in the Consolidated financial statements are 
described in the note to the Consolidated financial statements 
relating to the item concerned (see contents on page 166).
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
Consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Group’s Consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, except for the 
change in accounting policy for Software as a Service (SaaS) 
costs (see Change in accounting policy section below for further 
details) and the adoption of new standards and amendments 
effective as of 1 January 2022. The Group has not early-adopted 
any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued 
but is not yet effective.
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and 
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these Consolidated 
financial statements is presented in note 8.2. The application 
of these new requirements has not had a material effect on the 
Consolidated financial statements. 
Change in accounting policy
In 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) finalised 
its agenda decision regarding how to account for costs of 
configuring or customising a supplier’s application software in 
a SaaS arrangement that conveys to the customer the right to 
receive access to the supplier’s application software over the 
contract term.
The agenda decision concluded that the right to receive access 
does not provide the customer with a software asset and 
therefore, the access to the software is a service that the 
customer receives over the contract term. The agenda decision 
also concluded that often the configuration and customisation 
costs do not result in an intangible asset belonging to the 
customer. Therefore, these costs should be recognised as an 
expense over the period to which they relate.
In limited circumstances, certain configuration and customisation 
activities may result in separate assets controlled by the 
customer. If this is the case the asset should be assessed 
to determine whether it is separately identifiable and if it meets 
the recognition criteria of IAS 38.
Any changes resulting from this agenda decision are a change in 
accounting policy. Assessing the impact of the agenda decision 
on the Group required detailed analysis of the historical amounts 
capitalised. The Group has now concluded its analysis on the 
impact of this agenda decision and has subsequently applied a 
new accounting policy for SaaS costs, consistent with the agenda 
decision, from 1 January 2022.
SaaS costs capitalised as intangible assets by the Group at 1 
January 2022, and impacted by this change in accounting policy, 
had a net book value of £5.7 million. As the impact of this change 
in accounting policy is immaterial, and the new policy has been 
applied prospectively from 1 January 2022, no restatement of 
prior periods has been necessary. These assets have been written 
off in the current period as an exceptional cost (see note 2.7). 
SaaS costs incurred from 1 January 2022 have been recognised 
in Operating and administrative expenses.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately 
from the Group’s equity. The interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are current ownership interests, entitling their 
holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation,  
may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying 
amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity.
Profit or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the 
owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Profit or loss and each component of OCI of the 
subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Parent Company 
and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the 
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
See note 4.5 for the accounting policy and further details on the 
Group’s accounting for non-controlling interests.
Joint arrangements are contractual arrangements where two 
or more parties have joint control over the arrangement. Joint 
arrangements are classified as either a joint operation or a joint 
venture based upon an analysis of the rights and obligations 
of the parties in the normal course of business. If the parties 
to the joint arrangement have direct rights to the assets, and 
direct obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, 
then it is a joint operation. If the parties to the joint arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, then it is 
a joint venture.
The Group currently only has one joint operation and no joint 
ventures. The Group recognises its direct right to assets, 
liabilities, revenue and expenses of the joint operation, as well 
as its share of any jointly entitled assets, liabilities, income and 
expenditure. These amounts are recognised within the 
appropriate Consolidated financial statement line items in 
accordance with the IFRS applicable for that line item.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and 
operating policies. This is generally the case where the Group 
holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of an entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost, which 
includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not separately recognised 
in relation to associates. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
carrying amount of investments in associates is adjusted to 
recognise the Group’s share of after tax profit or loss and OCI 
of equity-accounted associates, that are recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income respectively. Dividends received 
or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in 
the carrying amount of the investment. If the carrying amount 
of an associate reaches £nil, the Group only recognises its share 
of losses of the associate to the extent it has incurred obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its 
associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent 
of the Group’s percentage ownership in these entities. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of impairment. Accounting policies of equity-
accounted associates have been aligned where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Had the Group concluded biomass contracts were within the 
scope of IFRS 9, a £1 per tonne increase or decrease in the 
market price of biomass purchases would result in a £20.5 million 
fair value gain or loss respectively being recognised. The Group 
continues to assess developments in the biomass market on an 
ongoing basis to identify any impact on this assessment.
Capitalisation of development project costs
As the Group executes its strategy, as outlined on page 16, 
significant investment is likely to be required in large development 
projects, including bioenergy carbon capture and storage in the 
UK (UK BECCS) and the development of Cruachan 2. In 
accounting for this expenditure, judgements are required 
to determine whether these costs meet the criteria to be 
capitalised, or whether they should be expensed as incurred. 
The capitalisation of costs under IAS 16 and IAS 38 are based 
around the expectation that it is probable that economic benefit 
will flow to the Group as a result of the costs incurred to bring the 
asset into working condition. This judgement can be complex as it 
is dependent on several qualitative factors, including 
technological feasibility, economic feasibility and availability 
of finance. At 31 December 2022 the Group had capitalised 
£24.5 million relating to the UK BECCS development project, 
including £19.1 million in 2022. Had it been judged that the 
criteria for capitalisation had not yet been met, these costs would 
have been expensed as incurred. The Group has not capitalised 
any costs in relation to Cruachan 2 or any global BECCS projects 
as the recognition criteria of IAS 16 have not been judged to have 
been met.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key sources of estimation uncertainty that 
carry a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the 
carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year. These are the items where actual outcomes in the next 12 
months could vary materially from the estimates made 
in determining the reported amount of an asset or liability within 
the Consolidated financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment at Drax Power Station is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life 
(UEL). UELs are estimated based on past experience, anticipated 
future replacement cycles and other available evidence and are 
reviewed at least annually.
Given the continued focus on climate change, renewable sources 
of energy and transitioning to a net zero economy, the power 
generation industry is going through a period of transformation, 
which can impact on the UELs of assets. As the UK Government’s 
net zero strategy continues to evolve and become clearer, 
particularly in relation to UK BECCS, the Group will continue to 
assess any potential impact of these developments on UELs in 
relation to Drax Power Station. Once certainty over UK BECCS at 
Drax Power Station is achieved, UELs will be reassessed. The net 
book value of fixed assets being depreciated at Drax Power 
Station at 31 December 2022 is £911.5 million and depreciation 
on these assets in the year, based on the UELs disclosed in note 
3.1, was £74.6 million. If the UELs of assets, that are limited to the 
current assumed end of station life of 2039, were to increase by 
ten years the impact on the depreciation charge for the year 
would be a reduction of approximately £14.2 million.
See note 3.1 on page 211
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of these Consolidated financial statements 
requires judgement to be made in selecting and applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenditure. Actual results may 
subsequently differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements which have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the Consolidated financial statements, 
and the key estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are set 
out below. Further detail, including sensitivity analyses where 
appropriate for the key estimates and assumptions, is included 
in the related notes.
Critical accounting judgements
The critical judgements made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated 
financial statements are set out below.
Certain remeasurements and exceptional items
Each year management confirms the judgements made 
regarding transactions to exclude from the Adjusted results 
of the Group, as described under Alternative performance 
measures below. The judgement as to whether a transaction 
or group of transactions should or should not be classified 
as a certain remeasurement or an exceptional item can have 
a significant impact on the Adjusted results of the Group. 
An internal policy governs the judgements made by management 
and in all instances, these judgements are approved by the Audit 
Committee as set out on page 120. 
See note 2.7 on page 203
Accounting for biomass purchase and sale contracts
The Group buys and sells biomass for operational requirements 
in its Pellet Production and Generation segments. The Group’s 
risk management policies also permit some flexibility in trading 
activity to optimise the overall portfolio position and potentially 
release value in certain circumstances. As such, the Group 
undertook an assessment of whether contracts it holds to buy 
and sell biomass are within the scope of IFRS 9. If the contracts 
were deemed to be within the scope of IFRS 9, this would result 
in these contracts being recognised at fair value as derivative 
financial instruments from inception.
The Group assessed both biomass purchase and sale contracts 
and concluded that the nature of these contracts means they 
cannot be readily net settled in cash or other financial 
instruments and, as a result, they remain outside of the scope of 
IFRS 9. The Group concluded this due to the contractual terms 
having no net settlement provisions and the highly illiquid nature 
of the biomass market meaning contracts cannot be readily 
converted into cash. The lack of an active spot market means 
market participants cannot readily seek to make trading profits 
from short-term price fluctuations as prices and contracts are 
negotiated bilaterally with no active market price and no 
guarantee there will be a willing buyer or seller to trade with. 
Accordingly, biomass contracts are not recognised as derivative 
assets or liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet prior to 
delivery, consistent with the accounting in prior years.

Financial statements
Adjusted basic earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share (Adjusted basic EPS) is 
Adjusted profit from continuing and discontinued operations 
attributable to the owners of the Parent Company divided by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding. This is the same 
denominator used when calculating basic EPS. This metric is used 
in discussions with the investor community.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and 
certain remeasurements (defined in note 2.7). Adjusted EBITDA 
excludes gains or losses in disposal of fixed assets, income from 
associates and amounts directly attributable to non-controlling 
interests. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by 
Executive management and the Board to assess the financial 
performance of the Group as it provides a more comparable 
assessment of the Group’s year-on-year trading performance. 
It is also a key metric used by the investor community to assess 
the performance of the Group’s operations.
Exceptional items and certain remeasurements
Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, 
do not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. 
For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management 
considers the nature of the transaction, the frequency of similar 
events, any related precedent, and commercial context. 
Presentation of a transaction as exceptional is approved by the 
Audit Committee in accordance with an agreed policy.
There has been no change to the policy during the year ended 
31 December 2022. During the year, the application guidance 
for this policy was enhanced, in particular setting de minimis 
thresholds for classifying items as exceptional. These 
enhancements would not have materially changed the 
transactions classified as exceptional in the comparative period 
contained within these Consolidated financial statements.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses 
on derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts 
do not qualify for hedge accounting (or hedge accounting is 
not effective) which, under IFRS, are recorded in revenue, cost 
of sales, interest payable and similar charges or foreign exchange 
gains or losses. Management believes adjusting for fair value 
gains and losses recognised on derivative contracts provides 
readers of the accounts with useful information as this removes 
the volatility caused by movements in market prices over the 
life of the derivative. The Group regards all of its forward 
contracting activity to represent economic hedges and, 
therefore, the contracted price at delivery or maturity is relevant 
to the Group and its performance, rather than how the 
contracted price compares to the prevailing market price, as the 
Group is not seeking to make trading profits on these contracts 
through market price movements. 
The impact of excluding these fair value remeasurements is 
to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices 
(the price paid or received in respect of delivery of the commodity 
in question), taking into account the impact of associated 
financial derivative contracts (such as forward foreign currency 
purchases), in Adjusted results at the time the transaction 
takes place.
See note 2.7 on page 203
Pension liabilities
The Group records a net surplus or liability in its Consolidated 
balance sheet for the fair value of assets held by the pension 
schemes, less its obligation to provide benefits under approved 
defined benefit pension schemes. The actuarial valuations of the 
schemes’ liabilities are performed annually by an independent 
qualified actuary and contain assumptions regarding interest 
rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, mortality and 
other factors, any of which are subject to future change. Three of 
the key estimates within the valuation are the discount and 
inflation rates, and life expectancy. Sensitivities in the valuations 
are discussed in note 6.3. The value of the pension surplus 
recognised by the Group at 31 December 2022 in relation to the 
DPG ESPS scheme is £32.4 million and the value of the pension 
surplus recognised in relation to the Drax 2019 scheme is 
£6.1 million.
See note 6.3 on page 245
Derivative valuations
Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Group’s 
Consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair 
value is derived in part by reference to a market price for the 
instrument in question. The Group bases its assessment of 
market prices upon forward curves that are largely derived from 
readily obtainable quotations and published prices from third-
party sources. However, any forward curve is based, at least in 
part, upon assumptions about future transactions and market 
movements. Where such instruments extend beyond the liquid 
portion of the forward curve, the level of estimation increases as 
the number of observable transactions decreases. More detail on 
the assumptions used in the assessment of fair values is provided 
in note 7.1, and a range of sensitivities is provided in note 7.2.
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
The Group uses APMs throughout the Annual report and 
accounts that are not defined within IFRS but provide additional 
information about financial performance and position that is used 
by the Board to evaluate the Group’s performance. These 
measures have been defined internally and may therefore not 
be comparable to similar APMs presented by other companies. 
Additionally, certain information presented is derived from 
amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself a 
measure defined by IFRS. Such measures should not be viewed 
in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent IFRS measure.
Defined below are the key APMs used by the Board to assess 
performance. The APMs glossary table on page 287 provides 
details of all APMs used, including the APM’s closest IFRS 
equivalent, the reason why the APM is used by the Group and 
a definition of how each APM is calculated.
Adjusted results
The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured in 
accordance with IFRS, is shown in the Total results column on the 
face of the Consolidated income statement. Exceptional items 
and certain remeasurements are deducted from the Total results 
in arriving at the Adjusted results for the year. The Group’s 
Adjusted results are consistent with the way Executive 
management and the Board assess the performance of the 
Group. Adjusted results are intended to reflect the underlying 
trading performance of the Group’s businesses and are presented 
to assist users of the Consolidated financial statements in 
evaluating the Group’s trading performance and performance 
against strategic objectives.

Prior to 2022, the Group’s definition of Net debt did not include 
translating borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, 
for which the Group had entered into hedging arrangements 
associated with the currency exposure at the hedged rate. The 
impact of relevant hedging instruments was presented alongside 
the Net debt figures rather than being included in the definition.
In 2022, the Group has updated its definition of Net debt, 
which now includes translating borrowings at the hedged rate. 
This is deemed to provide more useful information and to better 
reflect the economic reality, as it includes the sterling value 
of borrowings that will ultimately be settled.
The table below shows Net debt calculated using both the 
current and prior year definitions:

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio
This metric is the ratio of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, expressed 
as a multiple. The Group has a long-term target for Net debt 
to Adjusted EBITDA of around 2.0 times. The Group’s 2.0 times 
target has not changed as a result of the update in the definition 
of Net debt described above, nor has the Group’s expectations 
in regard to meeting this target.
The Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio gives an indication of the 
size of the Group’s Net debt in relation to its trading performance.
Net debt
The Group defines Net debt as total borrowings less cash and 
cash equivalents. Borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, 
and where the Group has entered into hedging arrangements 
associated with this currency exposure, are translated at the 
hedged rate. This is to take into account the effect of financial 
instruments entered into to hedge movements in, for example, 
foreign exchange rates in relation to debt principal repayments. 
Borrowings that have no hedging instruments attributed 
to them are translated at the closing rate. Total borrowings 
includes external financial debt, such as loan notes, term loans 
and amounts drawn in cash under revolving credit facilities 
(RCFs) (see note 4.2) but excludes other financial liabilities 
such as pension obligations (see note 6.3), trade and other 
payables (see note 3.5) and lease liabilities calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 16 (see note 3.2). Net debt excludes the 
proportion of cash and borrowings in non-wholly owned entities 
that would be attributable to the non-controlling interests. 
As noted above, the Group does not include lease liabilities, 
calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of 
Net debt. This reflects the nature of the contracts included in 
this balance which are predominantly entered into for operating 
purposes rather than as a way to finance the purchase of an 
asset. The exclusion of lease liabilities from the calculation 
of Net debt is also consistent with the Group’s covenant 
reporting requirements.
Net debt is a key metric used by debt rating agencies and 
the investor community as a measure of liquidity and the ability 
of the Group to manage its current obligations.

Financial statements
Section 2: Financial performance
The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a 
summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (see note 2.1), analysis of certain Consolidated income statement 
items (notes 2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total results, dividends and retained profits (notes 2.7–2.10). 
Further commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year can be found in the Strategic report 
on pages 1 to 91, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions that have affected the results.
2.1 Segmental reporting
Reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker 
which is considered to be the Board. The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each. 
Central corporate and commercial functions provide certain specialist and shared services, including optimisation of the Group’s 
positions. The Board reviews the performance of each of these businesses separately, and each represents a reportable segment:
• Pellet Production: production and subsequent sale of biomass pellets at the Group’s processing facilities in North America;
• Generation: power generation activities in the UK; and
• Customers: supply of electricity and gas to non-domestic customers in the UK.
Operating costs are allocated to the reportable segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. 
Central corporate function costs that are not directly attributable to the activities of a reportable segment are included within 
Innovation, capital projects and other costs. Innovation, capital projects and other costs is not a reportable segment as it does 
not earn revenues.
When defining gross profit within the Consolidated financial statements, the Group follows the principal trading considerations applied 
by its Pellet Production, Generation and Customers businesses when making a sale. In respect of the Pellet Production business, this 
reflects the direct costs of production, being fibre, fuel and drying costs, direct freight and port costs, or third-party pellet purchases. 
In respect of Generation, this reflects the direct costs of the commodities to generate the power and the relevant grid connection 
costs that arise. In respect of Customers, this reflects the direct costs of supply, being the costs of the power or gas supplied, together 
with costs levied on suppliers such as network costs, broker costs and renewables incentive mechanisms. 
Accordingly, cost of sales excludes indirect overheads and staff costs (presented within operating and administrative expenses), and 
depreciation (presented separately on the face of the Consolidated income statement). See note 3.4 for details of the costs included in 
inventories.
Seasonality of trading
The primary activities of the Group are affected by seasonality. Demand in the UK for electricity and gas is typically higher in the winter 
period (October to March) when temperatures are lower, and thus drives higher prices and higher generation. Conversely, demand is 
typically lower in the summer months (April to September) when temperatures are milder, and therefore prices are generally lower. 
This trend is experienced by all of the Group’s UK-based businesses, as they operate within the UK electricity and gas markets. 
It is most notable within the Generation business due to its scale and the flexible operation of its thermal generation plant. 
The Pellet Production business incurs certain costs that are higher in winter months due to the impact of weather conditions, such 
as fibre drying costs and heating costs. Production volumes and margins are typically higher in the summer months. The business is 
protected from demand fluctuations as a result of seasonality by regular production and dispatch schedules under its contracts with 
customers, both intra-group and externally.

2.1 Segmental reporting continued 
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reportable segment for the year ended 31 December 2022. Revenue for 
each segment is split between sales to external parties and inter-segment sales. Inter-segment sales are eliminated in the intra-group 
eliminations column along with any adjustment required for unrealised profits.
The financial information in these tables is comprised solely of results from continuing operations. There were no amounts attributable 
to discontinued operations in the year ended 31 December 2022. Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment is presented in note 2.7.

Adjusted operating profit from discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2021 was £20.3 million. This amount was 
attributable entirely to the Generation segment and is described in further detail in note 5.4.
The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the reportable segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the 
same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated financial statements.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year for continuing operations were £174.7 million (2021: 
£209.7 million). In 2022, the cash outflow in relation to property, plant and equipment is lower than the cost capitalised in property, 
plant and equipment (see note 3.1) predominantly as a result of £64.6 million (2021: £nil) of deferred letters of credits issued in relation 
to the construction of the OCGT assets.
Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, 
equate to market prices. During 2022, the Pellet Production segment sold biomass pellets and provided associated services with a 
total value of £425.4 million (2021: £286.7 million) to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold electricity, gas and 
renewable energy certificates with a total value of £3,719.3 million (2021: £2,031.1 million) to the Customers segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation.
Major customers
There was no individual customer, in either the current or previous financial year, that represented 10% or more of total revenue.
Geographical analysis of revenue and non-current assets 
The geographic information analyses the Group’s revenue and non-current assets by the entity’s country of domicile. In presenting 
the geographic information, segment revenue has been based on the geographic location of customers and segment assets were 
based on the geographic location of the assets.
The Group’s revenue and non-current assets for the Generation and Customers segments are all UK based. The Group’s Pellet 
Production segment has third-party pellet sales to both the UK and other locations around the world. The Pellet Production segment’s 
non-current assets are located in North America, in both Canada and the US.

2.2 Revenue
The majority of the Group’s revenue is within the scope of IFRS 15. The other sources of the Group’s revenue outside the scope of 
IFRS 15 comprise certain remeasurements, amounts reclassified to revenue for gains and losses on UK CPI inflation swaps and income 
from the Government’s Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS). See note 2.7 for further details of certain remeasurements and note 7.2 for 
inflation risk management.

Accounting policy
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excludes transactions between Group companies. Revenue is presented gross in the 
Consolidated income statement when the Group controls the specified good or service prior to the transfer to the customer.
A summary of the Group’s principal revenue streams, along with the nature and timing of performance obligations, payment terms, 
methods of recognising revenue, and any estimation uncertainties, is given in the table below. Further details on significant elements 
of revenue, principally how the Contract for Difference (CfD) and Renewable Obligation (RO) schemes operate and the related 
accounting, are provided below the table.

Pellet sales
(Pellet Production)
The Group produces biomass pellets which are 
sold to external customers. Customers generally 
obtain control of the pellets at the point the 
pellets are loaded onto the shipping vessel for 
freight on board (FOB) sales.
Where freight is also arranged for the customer, 
these sales are known as Cost, insurance and 
freight (CIF) sales. The freight component is 
considered a separate performance obligation.
Invoices are raised in line with contractual terms 
and are usually payable within four-10 days.
Revenue is recognised at the point that the pellets 
are loaded onto the shipping vessel. The amount of 
revenue recognised is based on the contracted price 
of the pellets.
For CIF sales, revenue for the freight portion is 
recognised over the period the vessel sails.
Electricity sales 
(Generation)
The Group’s Generation business has contracts 
for wholesale electricity sales. Performance 
obligations for these contracts are deemed to be 
a series of distinct goods that are substantially 
the same and transfer consecutively. Control is 
deemed to have passed to the customer at the 
point that the electricity has been supplied. This is 
measured based on energy supplied to the 
customer with the amount billed based on the 
units of electricity supplied.
Invoices are raised in line with the Grid Trade 
Master Agreement (GTMA) contractual terms and 
are payable on the fifth banking day following the 
date of invoice.
Revenues are measured based upon metered output 
at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing 
market rates as applicable. These are recognised 
under the output method, whereby revenue 
is recognised based on the value transferred 
to the customer.
Renewable certificate 
sales
(Generation)
Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) and 
Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origins (REGOs) 
are sold to counterparties at a point in time.
ROCs sold to optimise working capital are 
invoiced in line with contractual terms and are 
usually payable within two days.
Invoices for ROC sales to third parties are raised 
when the ROCs are transferred, typically four-five 
months following the end of the compliance 
period in which they were generated. Invoices are 
usually payable within seven days.
External ROC and REGO sales are recognised 
at the point the relevant certificates are transferred 
to the counterparty.
See below for further details.

CfD income/payment 
(Generation)
The Group is party to a CfD with the Low Carbon 
Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-
owned entity responsible for delivering elements 
of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform 
Programme. Under the contract, the Group 
makes or receives payments in respect of 
electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-
fuelled generating unit.
Invoices are raised seven days following the date 
of supply and are settled within 10-28 days.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising 
from the CfD in the Consolidated income statement 
as a component of revenue at the point the Group 
meets its performance obligation under the CfD 
contract. This is considered to be the point at which 
the relevant generation is delivered and the payment 
becomes contractually due.
See below for further details.
Ancillary services 
(Generation)
Ancillary services refers to the provision of a 
range of system support services to National Grid. 
Most contracts are for the delivery of a specific 
service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis 
over a period of time.
Invoices are raised and subsequently settled in 
line with National Grid Company Ancillary 
Services settlement calendar, typically monthly.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage 
of completion of the contractual performance 
obligations, which are calculated by reference to 
the amount of the contract term that has elapsed.
Depending on contract terms, this approach 
may require judgement in estimating probable future 
outcomes.
Other income 
(All segments)
Other income is derived from the sale of goods 
(for example, by-products from electricity 
generation such as ash and gypsum) or the 
provision of services. The customer obtains 
control typically at the point of delivery to their 
premises or upon collection.
Revenue is recognised at the point the control of the 
goods is transferred to the customer.
Electricity and gas sales 
(Customers)
The Group’s Customers business sells electricity 
and gas directly to business customers. 
Energy supplied is measured based upon metered 
consumption and contractual rates.
The Customers business also has long-term 
contracts for the sale of electricity and gas, 
which are deemed as being satisfied over time in 
line with the progress of the contracts.
Invoices are raised in line with contractual terms. 
For small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) 
customers, payment is generally due within 
10-14 days. For Industrial and Commercial (I&C) 
customers, payment is generally due between 
28-90 days.
Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity or 
gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, 
a quantifiable price has been established or can be 
determined and the amounts receivable are expected 
to be recovered. 
Where supply has taken place but has not yet been 
measured or billed, revenue is estimated based on 
consumption statistics and selling price estimates 
and is recognised as accrued income. This estimate 
is not considered to be a key source of estimation 
uncertainty because historical experience has 
demonstrated that these estimates are materially 
accurate based on the subsequent billings 
and settlements.
Where contracts for the sale of electricity and gas are 
held, revenue is recognised in line with the progress 
of the contracts.
The revenue recognised per unit of energy supplied is 
based on the total estimated revenue and cost inputs 
for fixed price contracts and contracted prices for 
variable price contracts. Assumptions are applied 
consistently but third-party costs can vary, therefore 
actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
EBRS income  
(Customers)
The UK Government introduced the EBRS, 
running from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023. 
Energy supplied to non-domestic customers in 
this period will have a discount applied for the 
customer under the scheme to cap their energy 
tariff. The Customers business is claiming this 
discount back from the Government.
Payment is due 10 days post submission 
of a claim, which typically occurs monthly.
The discounted price of electricity and gas supplied 
under the EBRS is recognised in revenue as it is 
supplied. The discount amount claimed back from 
the UK Government is recognised within revenue 
over the same period as the underlying discounted 
revenue it relates to is recognised.
The revenue received from the UK Government is 
included within EBRS income in the table on page 
192. The Group does not recognise any additional 
revenue from the scheme than it would have done 
if it were not introduced.

Renewable certificate sales
The generation and sale of renewable certificates, primarily ROCs and REGOs, is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. 
The Renewable Obligation (RO) scheme places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their 
electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO scheme, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity 
which are then sold bilaterally to counterparties, including suppliers, to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations under 
the RO scheme. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually. CP1 commenced in April 2002. 
At 31 December 2022 the Group is operating in CP21.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the buy-out price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price rises annually 
in line with the UK Retail Price Index (RPI). The buy-out price for CP21 is £52.88 (2021: CP20 £50.80). ROCs are typically procured 
in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end 
of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the recycle fund, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis 
to the suppliers who presented ROCs during a CP.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the point of generation is comprised of two parts: 
the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third-party supplier relating to the buy-out price, and the expected value 
of the recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group also made sales and related purchases of 
ROCs to help optimise its working capital position. 
External sales of ROCs in the table below includes £604.5 million of such sales (2021: £339.8 million), with a similar value reflected 
in cost of sales.
REGOs are certificates that enable suppliers to prove that energy supplied to their customers came from a renewable source. 
One REGO is issued to a generator for every MWh of renewable energy they generate.
See note 3.3 for further details of ROCs and REGOs generated and sold by the Generation business and those utilised by the 
Customers business during the year.
CfD income/payment
The payment is calculated by reference to a strike price per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each 
year in line with the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2022 
was £126.37 per MWh (2021: £118.54).
When market prices (based on average traded prices in the preceding season) are above or below the strike price, the Group makes an 
additional payment to or receives additional income from LCCC equivalent to the difference between that market power price and the 
strike price, for each MWh produced from the relevant generating unit. Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the 
sale of the associated power in the wholesale market.
Gas sales
To support the Group’s ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, a decision was made in January 2023 to phase out the Group’s gas 
supply contracts in the Opus Energy part of the Customers business. Having already ceased acquiring new gas customers, following 
internal processes and a regulatory driven 60-day grace period, no renewal contracts will be offered after May 2023. It is anticipated 
that the portfolio will reduce by over 50% by the end of 2023 and be almost entirely gone by the end of 2024.

2.4 Impairment review of fixed assets and goodwill
Accounting policy
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s 
cash-generating units (CGUs) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. 
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets combined into a CGUs) whenever there is an indication that 
an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment at least annually.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference 
to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use), 
or the expected price that would be received if the asset or CGU were sold to market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial 
assessment of the recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.
The assessment of future cash flows is based on the approved long-term forecasts used to support the Board’s strategic planning 
process. It includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in 
their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Future cash flows include, where relevant, 
contracted cash flows arising from the Group’s cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes 
the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges. Assessments of future cash flows consider relevant environmental and climate 
change factors. In particular, macro-economic, commodity price and third-party cost assumptions reflect considerations in respect of 
the impact of climate change, growth in renewable technologies, electrification and the impact of relevant policies on longer-term 
supply and demand profiles.
As required by IAS 36, the additional value that could be obtained from enhancing the Group’s assets and the potential benefit of any 
future restructuring or reorganisation that the Group is not yet committed to, is not reflected in the value in use calculation. In 
determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a pre-tax nominal discount rate 
reflecting the specific risks attributable to the asset or CGU in question.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, based on its value in use and what a market 
participant would pay. If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the Consolidated financial statements, an 
impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. 
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.
An impairment loss relating to a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated and then to the other 
assets pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. When allocating an impairment loss to the other assets in the CGU, 
if the recoverable amount of an individual asset within that CGU is determinable, the impairment loss allocated to the individual asset 
will be limited to reducing the assets, carrying value to its individual recoverable amount. If this results in the impairment loss allocated 
to an asset being less than its pro-rata share the excess is allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining assets in the CGU. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that 
have an impairment loss recognised are reviewed in subsequent reporting periods for possible reversal of the impairment. Where an 
impairment reversal is identified, this is reversed immediately in the Consolidated income statement.

2.4 Impairment review of fixed assets and goodwill continued
The Pellet Production business consists of two CGUs – Northern Operations and Southern Operations. Goodwill recognised on the 
acquisition of Pinnacle was allocated to the Pellet Production segment due to the pellet operations as a whole being expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the larger, combined pellet operations.
In respect of the Generation business, the Group generally considers the smallest groups of assets that generate independent cash 
inflows to be the individual sites that share common infrastructure and control functions. Drax Power Station is comprised of two 
separate CGUs, one for biomass generation assets and one for coal generation assets. The coal CGU was previously fully written down 
following the decision to cease commercial coal generation. At the request of the UK Government, the Group has entered into an 
agreement with National Grid to keep its two coal units available to provide a “winter contingency” service to the UK power system 
from October 2022 until the end of March 2023. The units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and will 
only operate if, and when, instructed to do so by National Grid. Had no impairment loss been previously recognised on the coal assets, 
they would have already been fully depreciated at the time the contract with National Grid was agreed. As such, management have 
assessed the impact of this agreement on the coal CGU and determined no reversal of any prior impairment is required.
In respect of the Customers business, the Group considers the smallest groups of assets that generate independent cash inflows to be 
equivalent to the operating entities within those businesses.
The OCGT development projects are considered one CGU due to the intention to operate and contract the plants using a portfolio 
approach, resulting in forecast cash inflows that are interdependent.
The Innovation, capital projects and other function does not have any external cash inflows and therefore does not meet the definition 
of a CGU and so is not included in the assessment below.

A review of the Group’s CGUs gave rise to an indicator of impairment for two CGUs: the Daldowie fuel plant, due to the increase 
in energy prices resulting in a significant increase in input costs, and the OCGTs, due to a strategic review conducted during the year 
concluding that it was unlikely the Group’s fourth OCGT project at Abergelli would be developed.
In determining that no indicators of impairment existed in respect of the remaining CGUs, the Group considered changes in market 
prices for commodities, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in macro-economic conditions, potential impacts of climate change 
and regulatory requirements since the previous reporting date, and the impact of such changes on the Group’s long-term planning 
models and future forecast cash flows. In particular, consideration was given to the impact of higher commodity prices and the 
changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and inflation.
Whilst higher commodity prices (e.g. power, gas and fibre) were an impairment indicator for Daldowie, they were not deemed an 
impairment indicator for other CGUs which are less exposed to the impact of these higher prices. This is due to the nature of the 
industries in which they operate and the corresponding impact on revenues. In the Generation and Customers businesses, higher 
energy costs are an input cost but these are offset by higher revenues. Additionally, in the Pellet Production segment, higher fibre 
costs and energy prices have been offset by increased revenues, reflecting strong demand for biomass pellets.
In considering the economic environment, management concluded the Group’s CGUs tend to be less sensitive to changes in the economy, 
as energy and pellet production are required to power and heat homes and businesses in the UK and abroad, which are generally 
considered essential spend. The Generation, Pellet Production and Drax Energy Solutions CGUs also contract with high quality, stable 
counterparties. For the Opus Energy CGU, customers are typically in the SME sector and therefore the impact of the economic 
environment, combined with higher market prices could potentially impact the recoverability of debt. However this impact is offset by 
the work done to improve the average credit quality of customers, along with achieved operational efficiencies and so was not deemed 
to be an impairment indicator.
Higher interest rates were also considered, including their impact on discount rates. In the prior year, only the Galloway CGU was 
sensitive to changes in the discount rate. Therefore, whilst interest rates have increased, any impact on discount rates was not 
considered to be an impairment indicator. For the Galloway CGU, the impact of increases to power prices during 2022 would more 
than offset the impact of a higher discount rate and therefore this was not considered to be an impairment indicator.

Consideration was also given to assumptions regarding biomass generation and biomass prices post-2027, when current subsidies 
for biomass generation at Drax Power Station are due to expire, and whether that was an indicator of impairment (See the Principal 
risks section starting on page 77 for further details on biomass acceptability). The Group aims to reduce biomass costs over time, 
as part of a strategy to secure a long-term future for biomass generation. Whilst management’s forecasts extend beyond 2027, 
they indicate that a majority of the carrying amount of the Drax Power Station (biomass) CGU is supported by pre-2027 cash flows. 
Accordingly, the end of current subsidies in 2027 was not deemed to be an indicator of impairment. Drax Power Station is currently 
deemed to have a useful life until at least 2039 and an expectation of continuing to be in operation until that time.
Impairment review
For the purpose of impairment reviews the recoverable amounts of these CGUs, or groups of CGUs, were measured based on value in 
use calculations using the Group’s established planning models. These calculations depend on a broad range of assumptions, the most 
significant of which are outlined below for each CGU, or Group of CGUs, to which an impairment test has been performed in the 
current year. Management’s bases for these estimates are also outlined below.

For each group of CGUs, management has projected detailed cash flows based on a period of 15 years, reflecting consideration of 
aspects of the plan which are realised over a long-term horizon. This is longer than the five-year period specified by IAS 36, and the 
period the Group assesses viability over in the Viability statement, to align to the Group’s long-term strategic planning, which is 
relevant to take into account future structural changes forecast within the industries in which the Group operates. These longer-term 
structural changes are mainly linked to climate change and the transition to more renewable forms of energy and net zero. They are 
explained in more detail in each section below.
Cash flows beyond the 15 year period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2% in all models. This growth rate is based on 
prudent expectations of market share and profitability along with more general macro-economic factors which were obtained from 
the Group’s established planning model along with external macro-economic forecasts. The growth rate does not exceed the relevant 
long-term average growth rate for each of the industries in which the Group operates.

The discount rates used reflect the weighted average cost of capital derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The 
estimations use a risk free rate based on government bonds, market participant capital structures and beta estimates adjusted 
for the specific industry and markets in which the CGU operates (taking into account relevant peer data sets). This calculation uses 
the relevant tax rates to calculate a pre-tax discount rate.
As the Group does not believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment it is not 
considered a key source of estimation uncertainty and therefore any sensitivities provided below are for additional information only.
Further details on the assessments for each group of CGUs are given below. 
Pellet Production
The recoverable amount of the Pellet Production group of CGUs, consisting of the Northern Operations and Southern Operations 
CGUs, is measured at least annually due to the goodwill allocated to the group of CGUs. These CGUs are principally engaged in the 
production and sale of biomass pellets. Management has projected detailed cash flows based on a period of 15 years, reflecting 
consideration of aspects of the plan which are realised over a long-term horizon. This is longer than the five-year period specified by 
IAS 36, and the period the Group assesses viability over in the Viability statement, to align to the Group’s long-term strategic planning, 
which is relevant to take into account future structural changes forecast within the pellet industry such as climate change and the 
expected growth in the biomass industry as economies transition to more renewable forms of energy and net zero. Cash flows beyond 
the 15 year period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2%. This growth rate is based on prudent expectations of market 
share and profitability along with more general macro-economic factors which were obtained from the Group’s established planning 
model along with external macro-economic forecasts. The growth rate does not exceed the relevant long-term average growth rate 
for the pellet industry.

The pre-tax nominal discount rate of 10.5% (2021: 8.5%) was calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group.
The value in use for the Pellet Production group of CGUs was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. An increase in production 
costs of $20 per tonne in the calculation would reduce the headroom by £711.4 million and a 15% decrease in production volumes 
would reduce the headroom by £572.3 million. Neither scenario would result in an impairment. No reasonably possible change in the 
key assumptions would result in a recoverable amount that was lower than its carrying amount.
Drax Energy Solutions and Opus Energy
The recoverable amounts of the Drax Energy Solutions and Opus Energy CGUs are measured annually due to the existence of goodwill 
allocated to these CGUs. These businesses are principally focused on renewable electricity sales and therefore consideration of 
climate and environmental impacts are already a key feature of the business models. Management has projected detailed cash flows 
based on a period of five years, consistent with the period specified by IAS 36, and the period the Group assesses viability over in the 
Viability statement. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2%. This growth rate is 
based on prudent expectations of market share and profitability along with more general macro-economic factors which were 
obtained from the Group’s established planning model along with external macro-economic forecasts. The growth rate does not 
exceed the relevant long-term average growth rate for the energy supply industry.
The carrying amounts and discount rates applied to each CGU are set out in the table below:

The expected future cash flows of the Drax Energy Solutions CGU were discounted using a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 10.3% 
(2021: 8.7%), calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk 
factors affecting the Group’s Customers business. The Group believes that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-established 
Customers business, reflecting the comparatively long trading record and customer bases the business holds.
The value in use of the Drax Energy Solutions CGU was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. An increase in the discount 
rate to 11.4% combined with factoring in 0% growth in the calculation would reduce the headroom by £36.0 million, which would not 
result in an impairment. Reflecting the significant headroom in the analysis, the Group does not believe that any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Energy Solutions CGU that was lower than its 
carrying amount.

2.4 Impairment review of fixed assets and goodwill continued
The expected future cash flows of the Opus Energy CGU were also discounted using a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 10.3% 
(2021: 8.7%). The forecast future cash flows of the CGU are adjusted to reflect the relative risk profile of its customer base compared 
to Drax Energy Solutions, for example by incorporating higher levels of expected credit losses. Opus Energy operates in the same 
industry, under the same macro-economic conditions and is impacted by the same commodity prices and impacts of climate 
change as Drax Energy Solutions. As such, it is considered appropriate to use the same discount rate for both CGUs, supported 
by independent analysis.
The value in use of the Opus Energy CGU was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. An increase in the discount rate to 11.4% 
combined with factoring in 0% growth in the calculation would reduce the headroom by £57.9 million. This would not result in an 
impairment. Reflecting the significant headroom in the analysis and sensitivities performed, the Group does not believe that any 
reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in a recoverable amount for the Opus Energy CGU that was lower 
than its carrying amount.
Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan
The Group tests the Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan CGUs for potential impairment annually due to the existence of goodwill allocated 
to these CGUs. These CGUs are engaged in hydro and pumped storage power generation. Management has projected detailed cash 
flows based on a period of 15 years, reflecting consideration of aspects of the plan which are realised over a long-term horizon. 
This is longer than the five-year period specified by IAS 36, and the period the Group assesses viability over in the Viability statement, 
to align to the Group’s long-term strategic planning, which is relevant to take into account future structural changes forecast within 
the generation industry in the models used, such as climate change, changing weather patterns, and the continued transition to 
renewable forms of energy and net zero. Cash flows beyond the 15 year period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2%. 
This growth rate is based on prudent expectations of market share and profitability along with more general macro-economic factors 
which were obtained from the Group’s established planning model along with external macro-economic forecasts. The growth rate 
does not exceed the relevant long-term average growth rate for the generation industry.

The discount rates were calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances 
and risk factors affecting the Group’s hydro and pumped storage generation operations.
The value in use for all three CGUs (Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan) was in excess of their carrying amounts. An increase in the discount 
rate to 15% in each of the calculations would reduce the headroom for Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan by £26.0 million, £87.2 million  
and £257.6 million respectively. A decrease in power prices of 25% in each of the calculations would reduce the headroom for Lanark, 
Galloway and Cruachan by £28.9 million, £101.1 million and £154.4 million respectively. None of these changes would result in an 
impairment. No reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in a recoverable amount that was lower than their 
carrying amount.
Daldowie
The Daldowie CGU does not have any goodwill allocated to it but in the current year had an indicator of impairment present. The 
impairment indicator was due to higher energy input costs resulting in a reduction in the forecast earnings. A full impairment review 
was carried out as a result of this impairment indicator. This CGU is engaged in processing wastewater sludge into biomass pellets. 
Management has projected detailed cash flows based on a period of three years, reflecting the expected contract end date.
The carrying amount and discount rate applied to the CGU is set out in the table below:

An independent analysis commissioned by the Group calculated a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 8.9% which was applied to the 
expected future cash flows to determine the value in use of the fuel plant. The carrying amount of £16.9 million was higher than the 
value in use calculation and so an impairment charge was therefore recorded. As there is no goodwill associated with the Daldowie 
fuel plant, this charge of £8.0 million was applied to its fixed assets on a pro rata basis as described in the accounting policy section 
of this note. An increase in estimated energy input costs of 25% in the value in use calculation would increase the impairment by 
£4.2 million.

OCGTs
The OCGT CGU does not have any goodwill allocated to it but in the current year had an indicator of impairment present. Following a 
strategic review during the year, it was concluded that it was currently unlikely that the Group would develop its fourth OCGT project 
at Abergelli. The Abergelli OCGT development does not hold a Capacity Market contract. As a result of this strategic review, the Group 
has recognised an impairment charge of £8.6 million, representing the previously capitalised development costs for the individual 
project. The impairment indicator was specific to the Abergelli assets with the CGU. No impairment indicators were identified in 
relation to the other assets within the CGU, or the CGU as a whole, and therefore a full impairment assessment was not required.
Impairment of non-current assets
Due to a change in accounting policy in the current year an impairment charge has been recognised on intangible assets relating to 
SaaS costs previously capitalised (See Change in accounting policy section in the Basis of preparation on page 177 for further details). 
An impairment charge has also been recognised on a billing system where the Group has stopped development and is engaged in 
active discussion with the supplier reflecting the supplier’s failure to perform under this contract. See note 5.2 for further details.
The Group has incurred impairment losses in the year. It is the Group’s policy that any impairments of assets that have not yet been 
brought into use and depreciated or amortised are reflected in the cost of the asset being impaired. For impairments of assets that 
have already been brought into use, the impairment is reflected as an accelerated charge in the accumulated depreciation or 
amortisation of the asset.

treated as exceptional items. See note 2.7 for further details.
2.5 Net finance costs
Net finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing the debt structure (such as interest payable on bonds) as well as foreign 
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounts on provisions for reinstatement of the Group’s sites at the end of their useful 
lives (see note 5.3), interest income on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme surplus (see note 6.3) and lease liabilities (see note 
3.2). These are offset by interest income that the Group generates through use of short-term cash surpluses, for example through 
investment in money market funds.

2.5 Net finance costs continued
Foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances denominated in foreign 
currencies to prevailing rates at the reporting date.
Changes in the Group’s financing structure during 2022 are described in note 4.2.
The Group has a number of intercompany loans denominated in the functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries, that are owed 
to a sterling functional currency entity, and sterling intercompany loans owed by foreign subsidiaries to a sterling functional currency 
entity. Due to the weakening of sterling during the year, this has resulted in a foreign exchange gain of £29.0 million (2021: gain of 
£4.2 million) on the retranslation of intercompany loans in the Consolidated income statement of the sterling functional currency 
entity. The foreign exchange loss (2021: loss) on translating the foreign subsidiaries’ intercompany loans into the Group’s sterling 
presentational currency is recognised within the translation reserve. As such, on consolidation, a foreign exchange gain (2021: gain) 
arises in the Consolidated income statement and is part of the foreign exchange gains included in Adjusted results in the table above.
2.6 Current and deferred tax
The tax credit or charge includes both current and deferred tax. It reflects the estimated tax on the profit before tax for the Group for 
the year ended 31 December 2022 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in 
the Consolidated income statement, in line with IAS 12.
Accounting policy
Current tax includes UK corporation tax, corporate income tax in Canada and US income tax. It is based on the taxable profit or loss for 
the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit or loss before tax as reported in the Consolidated income 
statement, because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
A provision is made for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is considered probable that there will be a 
future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become 
payable. The assessment is based on the judgement of tax professionals within the Group supported by previous experience in respect 
of such activities and in certain cases is based on specialist independent tax advice. No uncertain tax provisions have been recognised 
in the current or prior year.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred taxes are credited or charged against profit or loss in the Consolidated income statement, except when they 
relate to items that are recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred taxes are recognised in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity respectively.
The Group has utilised the relief available under the Research and Development expenditure credit regime (RDEC). Under this regime, 
research and development tax credits are accounted for as development grants in line with IAS 20 and are recorded in operating profit 
within the Consolidated income statement. The credit is subject to corporation tax with the corresponding receivable offset against 
total corporation tax payable.
In accounting for tax, the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. 
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable, based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. These 
assumptions are consistent with other assumptions used in these financial statements. Full provision is made for deferred tax at the 
rates of tax prevailing at the reporting date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. The recoverability of the deferred tax asset is considered an 
estimate as it relies on the future profitability of the Group’s businesses. See table on page 202 for a breakdown of the net deferred tax 
asset or liability position for each jurisdiction.

UK corporation tax is the main income tax for the Group and is calculated at 19% (2021: 19%) of the assessable profit or loss 
for the year.
Due to the Group’s overseas operations, the US income tax rate of 21% (2021: 21%) and the Canadian corporate income tax rate 
of 27% (2021: 27%) are also relevant to the Group’s tax charge.
The tax rate for the full year, before the impact of changes in tax rates, is lower than the standard corporation tax rate applicable in the 
UK, principally due to the tax benefit arising from UK Patent Box claims and the UK super-deduction introduced in the Finance Act 
2021, which allows for a 130% in-year deduction for tax purposes against the cost of qualifying capital expenditure on plant and 
machinery incurred between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023.
Drax Power Limited was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology 
developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation, the company is entitled 
to apply a lower tax rate of 10% to profits derived from utilisation of the patented technology.
The Finance Act 2021 also contained legislation to increase the main rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% with effect from 
1 April 2023. The impact of this rate increase is a net £6.7 million deferred tax credit through Total results in the Consolidated income 
statement (2021: £49.0 million charge).

2.6 Current and deferred tax continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise they are shown 
separately in the Consolidated balance sheet. Within the above trade losses deferred tax asset of £80.1 million (2021: £60.0 million) 
there is £53.0 million (2021: £42.5 million) in relation to losses in the US Pellet Production business. The remaining £27.1 million relates 
to losses of the Canadian Pellet Production business (2021: £17.5 million).
The future expected reversal of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences, coupled with the profitability 
(inclusive of the impact of transfer pricing adjustments), stable output and forecast improvement in operational performance, mean 
that the US and Canadian businesses expect to generate sufficient profits in the short to medium term against which to utilise the 
deferred tax assets. The estimates used when assessing the future profitability of the US and Canadian businesses have been 
approved by the Board and are consistent with estimates used in the going concern assessment and in the Viability statement 
on page 75.
As at 31 December 2022 the Group held £79.2 million (2021: £79.2 million) of UK capital losses available for offset against future 
chargeable gains. These losses are unrecognised for deferred tax purposes as the Group does not currently expect UK taxable 
gains to arise that would be eligible to offset against these losses.
2.7 Alternative performance measures
The APMs glossary to these Consolidated financial statements on page 287 provides details of all APMs used, each APM’s closest 
IFRS equivalent, the reason why the APM is used by the Group and a definition of how each APM is calculated.
The Group presents Adjusted results in the Consolidated income statement. The Directors believe that this approach is useful as it 
provides a clear and consistent view of underlying trading performance. Certain remeasurements and exceptional items are excluded 
from Adjusted results and presented in a separate column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about 
the financial performance of the business and is consistent with the way Executive management and the Board assess the 
performance of the business.
The Group has a policy and framework for the determination of transactions to present as exceptional. All transactions presented 
as exceptional are approved by the Audit Committee. See the Audit Committee Report on page 116 for further details.
In these Consolidated financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items 
and presented separately:
• Impairment charges incurred on the application of the Group’s new accounting policy for SaaS costs, consistent with the IFRIC 
agenda decision (see Change in accounting policy section in the Basis of preparation on page 177) (2022, All segments), and on 
costs associated with the Customers billing system (2022, Customers). See note 5.2 for further information.
• Costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Pinnacle (2021, Pellet Production).
• Costs relating to the restructuring of the Customers business (2021, Customers).
• Operating expenditure which was incurred as a direct result of the decision to cease commercial coal generation (2021, Generation).
• Impact of UK tax rate change on deferred tax balances (2022 and 2021, Generation and Customers). See note 2.6 for further 
information.
Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to derivative contracts 
with a maturity in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the maturity of derivative contracts in the current period. The effect of 
excluding certain remeasurements from Adjusted results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices i.e. at the 
all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, and financial contracts in the period 
they are intended to hedge, to reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group in Adjusted results.

Section 2: Financial performance continued
2.7 Alternative performance measures continued
Volatility in financial and commodity markets has continued in 2022, in part due to the conflict in Ukraine. This has resulted in 
significant movements in the remeasurement gains and losses on certain derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for 
hedge accounting, or where hedge accounting is ineffective, as shown in the table below, principally relating to gas, certain foreign 
currency contracts, inflation and oil. Further detail on the Group’s derivative financial instruments is provided in Section 7.

Net debt
Net debt is calculated by taking the Group’s borrowings (note 4.2), adjusting for the impact of associated hedging instruments, 
and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.1).
The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments and interest in 
respect of the Group’s US dollar (USD) and euro (EUR) denominated debt (see note 4.2). USD and EUR balances are translated at the 
hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the reporting date, which impacts the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings. Net 
debt excludes the share of borrowings and cash and cash equivalents attributable to NCI. See the APMs glossary and the APMs 
section within the Basis of preparation for further details on the calculation of Net debt.

Borrowings include listed bonds, bank debt and RCFs (to the extent drawn in cash), net of any deferred finance costs. Borrowings 
do not include other financial liabilities such as lease liabilities and trade and other payables (including working capital facilities as 
described in note 3.7).
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of Net debt. This reflects the 
nature of the contracts included in this balance which, prior to the application of IFRS 16, were predominantly not held on the 
Consolidated balance sheet and instead disclosed as operating commitments. The exclusion of lease liabilities from the calculation 
of Net debt is also consistent with the Group’s covenant reporting requirements.
The Group does not include balances related to supply chain financing or factoring in the definition of Net debt. These facilities do not 
increase the Group’s working capital cycle beyond the Group’s standard payment terms and are only short-term balances. Therefore, 
the balances do not meet the Group’s definition of borrowings and so are excluded from Net debt. 
A reconciliation of the change in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on note 4.2.
As explained in the Basis of preparation, the Group has a long-term target for Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of around 2.0 times.

Further commentary on total cash and committed facilities is contained within the Financial review starting on page 20.
2.8 Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profit or losses) attributable to each ordinary share in issue. 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings attributable to owners of the Parent Company (profit or loss after tax in 
accordance with IFRS excluding amounts attributable to NCI) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue 
during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact of all outstanding share options that would vest on their future maturity dates if 
the conditions at the end of the reporting period were the same as those at the end of the contingency period (such as those to be 
issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2), were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the reporting date. 
Repurchased shares of 13.8 million (2021: 13.8 million) held in the Treasury shares reserve (see note 4.4) are not included in the 
weighted average calculation of shares. For the purpose of calculating diluted EPS, the weighted average calculation of shares 
excludes any share options that would have an anti-dilutive impact.

tax from discontinued operations in 2021 of £16.7 million, resulted in Adjusted basic EPS of 4.2 pence and Adjusted diluted EPS of 
4.1 pence.

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve 
payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 of 12.6 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £50 million) 
payable on or before 19 May 2023. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2022. This would bring 
total dividends payable in respect of the 2022 financial year to approximately £84 million.
The Group has a long-standing capital allocation policy. This policy is based on a commitment to robust financial metrics that underpin 
the Group’s strong credit rating: investment in the core business; paying a sustainable and growing dividend; and returning surplus 
capital to shareholders. The Board is confident that the dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow as the implementation of the 
Group’s strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In determining the rate of growth in dividends, 
the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Group’s commodity-linked 
revenue streams.
In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most appropriate 
mechanism to return this to shareholders.
Consideration of sustainability, including a link to the Group’s dividend, can be found in the Market context section on pages 4 and 5.
2.10 Retained profits
Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over its 
lifetime that are attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed to 
shareholders. The table below sets out the movements in retained profits during the year:

Distributable reserves
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and 
cash resources.
The Parent Company’s financial statements are set out on pages 277 to 283 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s 
distributable reserves of £306.3 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in 
accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors the level 
of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and 
that the Parent Company has access to these reserves. 
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £238.0 million are set out in note 4.1 and the recent history of cash generation within 
note 4.3. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management 
purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group.
The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.2) place customary conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any given 
year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable 
future. See the Viability statement on page 75 and note 4.2 for further details on the covenants relating to the financing facilities.

Section 3: Operating assets and working capital
This section gives further information on the operating assets the Group uses to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets 
and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise the Group’s working capital balances.
3.1 Property, plant and equipment
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by the Group.
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment is stated at net book value, which is its cost less any accumulated depreciation less impairment, 
if required, charged to date. Property, plant and equipment assets are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises: the purchase price 
(after deducting trade discounts and rebates); any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management; and the estimate of the present value of the costs 
of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site, where required. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and 
is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any expected residual value, and charging it to the Consolidated income statement 
on a straight-line basis from the date that the asset is brought into use and over its UEL. Where relevant, this is limited to the expected 
decommissioning date of the site where the asset is located.
The Group constructs many of its assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are under the course of construction 
are not depreciated until they are ready for use in the way intended by management.
The table below shows the weighted average remaining UELs of the main categories of assets held at the reporting date:

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited UEL and is not depreciated. The value of freehold land held 
at 31 December 2022 is £37.5 million (2021: £26.9 million).

3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued
An impairment charge is recognised immediately if the net book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is defined 
to be the higher of an asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The Group’s policy is to recognise an impairment charge 
through accumulated depreciation if the asset will continue to be used by the Group or if the asset will be subsequently sold. However, 
if the asset is still under construction, as no depreciation has yet been charged, the impairment charge is recognised in cost. Assets 
that will no longer be used by the Group are disposed of by removing both the cost and any accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the relevant plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are 
common to the whole plant.
Pellet Production plant includes the US and Canadian based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production business and the assets at the 
Daldowie fuel plant near Glasgow.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining UEL of the relevant power station or plant. 
Occasionally, plant spare parts are required to be used within maintenance projects. In this instance the net book value of the part 
is transferred from the property, plant and equipment balance and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement 
within operating and administrative expenses. These issues are reflected on the issues to maintenance projects line in the table below.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to assets are included in the carrying amounts or recognised as separate 
assets, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
expensed as incurred.
Estimated UELs and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory changes and commercial and technological 
obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the reporting date. Any changes to 
estimated UELs or residual values are applied prospectively.
At each reporting date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these 
assets may be impaired. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review 
conducted during 2022 and disclosures relating to the impairment of Daldowie and Abergelli assets, are set out in note 2.4.
During the year, the Group has capitalised £19.1 million (2021: £5.4 million) of costs relating to the UK BECCS project at Drax Power 
Station. The Group has also commenced construction of the Group’s three OCGT projects that have obtained Capacity Market 
contracts. The costs capitalised in the year on the OCGT projects total £90.2 million (2021: £7.8 million). 
The Group’s total commitment for future capital expenditure is disclosed in note 7.7.
Significant estimation uncertainty
Assets’ UELs are reviewed annually at each reporting date, taking into consideration the impact of climate and environmental change. 
See note 3.8 for further details. 
As disclosed on page 178, the Group has made an estimate regarding the UEL of Drax Power Station. Given the continued focus on 
climate change, renewable sources of energy and transitioning to a net zero economy, the power generation industry is going through 
a period of transformation, which can impact on the UELs of assets. As the UK Government’s net zero strategy becomes clearer, 
particularly in relation to UK BECCS, the Group will continue to assess any potential impact of these developments and whether 
the UEL of Drax Power Station is impacted. The continued rate of change in these areas increases the risk that UELs of Drax Power 
Station will be updated in the future as new information becomes available. As such, a change in UELs in relation to Drax Power 
Station’s biomass assets has been disclosed as a key source of estimation uncertainty. If UK BECCS is deployed at Drax Power Station 
this could result in an extension of the end of station life beyond the current assumed end date of 2039. If the UELs of Drax Power 
Station assets currently limited to end of station life of 2039 were to increase by a further 10 years, the annual depreciation charge 
for the year would decrease by approximately £14.2 million.

(1) The comparative amounts have been re-presented to split out the movement in the reinstatement asset. The reduction in the reinstatement asset of £2.7 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2021 was previously reported within the disposals line. 
(2) The comparative amounts have been re-presented to present the OCGT development costs in assets under the course of construction.
The depreciation expense in the Consolidated income statement of £208.0 million comprises of £195.6 million of depreciation charged 
on property, plant and equipment, £20.3 million charged on right-of-use assets (see note 3.2) offset by £7.9 million of depreciation 
included in closing inventories.
The increase in depreciation of pellet production plants during the year includes the impact of planned higher levels of capital 
expenditure in relation to plant upgrades and capacity expansions, and includes some accelerated depreciation for existing equipment 
that has been, or will be, replaced following capital investments. The UELs of impacted assets were reviewed and updated at the 
start of 2022 to reflect these plans, and the impact of these updates on the depreciation charge for 2022 was around an additional 
£22.0 million charge.

3.2 Leases
Accounting policy
IFRS 16 determines a control model to distinguish between lease agreements and service contracts on the basis of whether the 
use of an identified asset is controlled by the Group for a period of time. If the Group is deemed to have control of an identified asset, 
then a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability are recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet. 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the discount rate that is 
implicit in the lease. If this discount rate cannot be determined from the agreement, the liability is discounted using an incremental 
borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rates are updated biannually. The borrowing rate for leased property is derived with reference 
to property yields specific to the location of the leased property and property type. For non-property leases, the borrowing rate is 
derived from a series of inputs including counterparty specific proxies for risk-free rates, such as UK Gilt curves, and an adjustment 
for credit risk based on the Group’s credit rating. The liability is subsequently adjusted for interest, repayments and other 
modifications.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the initial calculation of the lease liability, estimated costs for dismantling or restoring 
the asset, any initial direct costs, and lease payments made or incentives received prior to commencement of the lease.
Lease modifications are accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or more 
underlying assets, and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price of the 
increase in scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and lease 
liability are adjusted, and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are 
accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
Lease extension or termination options are included within the lease term when the Group, as the lessee, has the discretion to exercise 
the option and where it is probable that the option will be exercised.
Leases with a term shorter than 12 months, or where the identified asset has a value below £3,500, are expensed to the Consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.

3.3 Renewable certificate assets
The Group earns renewable certificate assets including ROCs and REGOs which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity 
Markets (Ofgem), as a result of burning biomass pellets to generate electricity at Drax Power Station and generating renewable energy 
at a number of the Group’s hydro-electric plants. The Group’s ROC and REGO certificates are sold bilaterally to counterparties, 
including external suppliers, and also internally for utilisation by the Customers business. 
This note sets out the value of these certificate assets that the Group held at the reporting date.
Accounting policy
Renewable certificates, principally ROCs and REGOs, are first recognised as current assets in the period they are generated. 
The Group uses their fair value at initial recognition, based on anticipated sales prices, as deemed cost. The value of renewable 
certificates earned is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a reduction to cost of sales in the same period 
they are earned. 
Where the Customers business incurs an obligation to deliver renewable certificates, that obligation is provided for in the period 
incurred within cost of sales. 
ROCs and REGOs valuation are comprised of the expected value to be obtained in a sales transaction with a third-party supplier 
at the point of generation. If the Group has already agreed sales contracts to cover the renewable certificates generated in a period, 
then they are recognised at the contracted price. Any renewable certificates generated above this, or to be utilised by the Customers 
business, are recognised at an estimate of the expected market value, which is generally based on the amount to be obtained in 
a sales transaction with a third-party supplier.

3.3 Renewable certificate assets continued
ROC valuations are comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sales transaction with a third-party supplier relating 
to the buy-out price; and an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the CP, which 
runs from April to March each year. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who 
do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are redistributed to the suppliers who presented ROCs in a CP on a pro-rata 
basis. The estimate of the recycle value is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and also the demand 
for ROCs over the CP, and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its 
own forecasts in making these estimates. Historical experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuations are reasonable, 
but the recycle value remains subject to possible variation and may subsequently differ from assumptions at 31 December.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying value of renewable certificate assets held against updated anticipated sales 
prices or anticipated obligation requirements, and the estimated recycle value. Where relevant, this takes account of agreed forward 
sales contracts, the likely utilisation of renewable certificates generated to settle the Group’s own obligations, and any relevant 
information about the levels of wider renewable generation. Any impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement 
in the period incurred.

3.4 Inventories
The Group holds inventories of fuels and other consumable items that are used in the process of generating electricity, and raw 
materials used in the production of biomass pellets and waste pellets. This note shows the cost of biomass, coal, other fuels and plant 
consumables held at the reporting date.
Accounting policy
The Group’s raw materials and fuel inventory are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of purchased fuel inventories includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location 
and condition, including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes, and transport and handling costs. The Group uses forward 
foreign exchange contracts to hedge the costs of fuel denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated 
into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, the inventory cost is recognised at the hedged value, to the extent these hedges 
are effective, and all such gains and losses are included in cost of sales when they arise.
Both biomass and coal inventories are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting the Group’s sites using technology regularly 
calibrated to industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and 
thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing inventory volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject 
to a range of tolerable error. All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. Biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes 
with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. Biomass 
inventory is surveyed using regularly calibrated radar scanning technology to validate the accuracy of the weights and efficiency 
methods outlined above.
The cost of manufactured fuel inventories includes all direct costs incurred in production and conversion including raw materials, 
labour, direct overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their existing condition and location. It also includes 
an allocation of overheads, including depreciation and other indirect costs. Costs that do not contribute to bringing inventories to their 
present condition and location, such as storage and administration overheads, are excluded from the cost of inventories and expensed 
as incurred.
The valuation of fibre inventory involves estimations of the conversion rates to determine the volume of residual fibre stockpiles and 
log inventory. Third-party surveys are performed regularly to assess the volume of inventory and appropriate adjustments are made, 
if required, using conversion factors estimated by management. Internal inventory counts are performed periodically at all locations.

The net realisable value of coal in the prior year in the table above was stated after provisions of £0.9 million. No inventory provisions 
have been recognised in the current year.
The increase in the value of biomass finished goods held at the reporting date results from the planned build-up of inventories 
due to the reprofiling of generation into winter from summer when it was originally planned, along with higher biomass prices.
 At the request of the UK Government, the Group entered into an agreement with National Grid to keep the two coal units at 
Drax Power Station available to provide a “winter contingency” service to the UK power system from October 2022 until the 
end of March 2023. The units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and only operate if and when 
instructed to do so by National Grid. Under the terms of this contract, the Group no longer has control of any coal inventory.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2022 was £1,587.9 million (2021: £1,352.0 million). 
This includes the value of write downs of inventory in the year.
3.5 Trade and other receivables and contract assets
Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers for goods or services provided that have been invoiced for but have 
not yet been paid. Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered 
to customers that will be invoiced the following month.
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group has access to a receivables monetisation facility under which amounts receivable can be sold to a third-party on a non-
recourse basis. Receivables sold under such facilities are accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) 
in accordance with IFRS 9, due to the objective of the business model being achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and 
the selling of the financial assets. These receivables are derecognised at the point of sale which is shortly after the initial recognition 
of the receivable balance. As a result, no fair value gains or losses have been recognised. Fees are recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement as incurred within interest payable and similar charges. At 31 December 2022, the receivables sold under this 
facility were £400.0 million (2021: £200.0 million), reflecting the increase in the size of the facility during the year. Refer to note 4.3 
for further information about the facility.
Contingent consideration receivable is a financial asset. As the cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest, 
it does not meet the criteria for recognition at either amortised cost or FVOCI, and is therefore recognised at fair value through profit 
and loss (FVTPL).
The UK Government introduced the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS) from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023. Energy supplied to 
non-domestic customers in this period has a discount applied under the EBRS. The Group claims this discount back from the 
Government. The amount the Group is entitled to claim from the Government is either recognised in other receivables, if it has been 
claimed but has not yet been received from the Government, or accrued income if not yet claimed at the reporting date. See note 2.2 
for details of energy supplied under the EBRS within the Consolidated income statement.

3.5 Trade and other receivables and contract assets continued
Of total trade receivables and accrued income at 31 December 2022, £587.0 million (2021: £314.0 million) relates to the Customers 
business, £168.0 million relates to the Generation business (2021: £125.9 million), and £44.1 million (2021: £17.9 million) relates to the 
Pellet Production business.
The contingent consideration relates to the Group’s disposal of the CCGT generation portfolio in January 2021. Should the acquirer 
satisfy certain triggers in respect of the option to develop the land at the Damhead Creek 2 site, which was disposed of as part of this 
sale, £29.0 million of contingent consideration would become payable to the Group from the acquirer. The estimated fair value of this 
contingent consideration is £27.4 million (2021: £27.7 million). Contingent consideration is disclosed within current assets, however, 
the timing of receipt would be dependent on when a trigger was to occur, which may be in a period greater than 12 months from the 
end of the reporting period. See note 7.1 for further details on the contingent consideration.
Accrued income includes contract assets which relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where 
the entitlement to consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time. The Group has recognised a contract 
asset for any services provided where payment is not yet due. Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified 
to trade receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer, usually in the following financial period. Contract assets at 
31 December 2022 were £20.0 million (2021: £6.0 million).
Impairment of financial assets
Accounting policy 
The Group applies the impairment model in IFRS 9 to provide for expected credit losses on the Group’s financial assets including trade 
receivables, accrued income, contract assets and other financial assets. The provision for impairment of trade receivables and accrued 
income (including contract assets) is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. Contract assets relate 
to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts and, therefore, have substantially the same risk characteristics 
as trade receivables for the same types of contracts.
For other financial assets, the Group recognises a lifetime expected credit loss provision when there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, 
the Group recognises a 12-month expected credit loss provision.
The greatest concentration of credit risk exists in the Customers business. For the larger consumers within the Customers business 
(and also customers within the Generation and Pellet Production businesses) a provision matrix method is adopted. For the SME 
consumers within the Customers business, the risk is higher due to the wide range of customer characteristics within the portfolio. 
The loss provisioning for these customers is complex and requires a provisioning tool that is more dynamic than the provision matrix 
method and so a combined probability method is applied. Both of these approaches are described in more detail below. 
Under the Group’s debt recovery strategy, a breach in terms could lead to the customer being disconnected or pursued legally 
for recovery of the balance. The Group writes off a financial asset when there is no realistic prospect of recovery and all attempts 
to recover the balance have been exhausted. An indication that all credit control activities have been exhausted is where the debt 
on an account is exclusively greater than 365 days past due and active recovery attempts have failed, or where there are known 
insolvency issues relating to the customer. 
Combined probability method
The Group uses a machine learning algorithm to calculate expected credit losses for its SME customer base. The algorithm predicts 
the future performance of debt on an individual account basis using a broad range of indicators that are specific to the customer. 
The algorithm forms predictions, based on historical experience, of the debt on each account reaching greater than 365 days past due. 
A timeframe of 13 months is the normal period of historic data to which the algorithm is trained. The customer’s behaviours and 
performance in this period inform the current provisioning for the existing debt portfolio.
As required by IFRS 9, the calculation of expected credit losses incorporates both historical and forward-looking information. 
Management considers the 13 month period on which the algorithm is trained and determines whether any additional provision is 
required as a result of specific factors or forward-looking macro-economic conditions. At 31 December 2022, these factors included, 
but were not limited to, expectations around future inflation and interest rates, customer pricing and the impact of Government 
support for customers. In the current period, management concluded that no additional provision was required (2021: no additional 
provision was required).

3.5 Trade and other receivables and contract assets continued
Provision matrix method
Larger consumers within the Customers business and customers within the Generation and Pellet Production businesses are grouped 
according to the age of the debt based on the number of days past due. The provision rates are based on historical collection rates 
and an expectation of future cash collection.
The movement in the overall allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables is presented in the following table:

The provision above relates to trade receivables in the Customers business. If the calculated provision rates were 10% higher than the 
provision rates calculated at the reporting date, the impact to the provision would be an increase of £4.0 million. The provision matrix 
method has resulted in a £nil provision applied to both Generation and Pellet Production businesses.
The risk of default within the Pellet Production and Generation businesses is considered to be remote. This is supported by strong 
historic collection rates and timely receipts.
The Pellet Production business has a remote risk of default because the external customer base are high-quality counterparties with 
long-term supply contracts. Furthermore, invoices are usually settled within seven days with negligible levels of aged debt. 
The current economic environment and pressure on energy markets resulted in significantly higher commodity prices during 2022, 
and in turn higher bills raised to some of the Group’s customers. This has resulted in an increase in the total gross value of trade 
receivables and thus increased the value of the expected loss provision, particularly for SME customers. Prices for the deemed 
customer portfolio have seen the most significant increases. Deemed supply is where electricity or gas is supplied to a site or customer 
that is yet to enter into a contract and, as a result, they are charged on a standard variable tariff based on merchant power and gas 
prices. Given the increases in these standard variable prices during the year, the recoverability of these balances has become more 
challenging. The expected credit loss provision has been updated to reflect this change. The coverage levels of the provision are in line 
with the outturn performance experienced during Covid-19, a period which was also significantly impacted by challenging macro-
economic conditions.
In October 2022, in response to the significant increase in energy prices, the Government introduced support for non-domestic 
customers through the EBRS. This has provided financial support to customers during this period as described in more detail 
in note 2.2. The Group received no incremental revenue over that to which it was contractually entitled, due to this scheme.
The net charge to the Consolidated income statement in 2022 for impairment losses on financial assets was £48.0 million 
(2021: £16.3 million). This is the net of the additional amounts provided against in relation to trade receivables of £56.6 million 
(2021: £33.7 million) less an £8.6 million (2021: £17.4 million) benefit in the period in respect of resolution of legacy credit balances. 
The value of provisions calculated using the combined probability model is set out below. This shows the trade receivables balances 
for SME consumers within the Customers business grouped by the combined probability assigned by the model.

3.6 Contract costs
The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the Customers business.
Accounting policy
Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts 
are recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs at the point the fee is paid. The fees are amortised 
over the contract period in line with the recognition of revenue and are charged to cost of sales. The balance is included within 
prepayments in note 3.5. This amount includes both current and non-current balances. The reconciliation from opening to closing 
contract costs is as follows:

3.7 Trade and other payables and contract liabilities
Trade and other payables represent amounts the Group owes to its suppliers for trade purchases and ongoing costs, taxes and social 
security amounts due in relation to the Group’s role as an employer, and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course 
of business. The Group makes accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of the Group’s activities 
in the current period (e.g. fuel received but for which the Group has not yet been invoiced). Contract liabilities represent the Group’s 
obligation to transfer goods and services to its customers whereby the Group has already received the consideration in advance 
or where the amount is due from the customer at the reporting date. 
Accounting policy
Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.
The Group facilitates a supply chain finance scheme, a form of reverse factoring under which certain suppliers can obtain early access 
to payments. There are no changes to the Group’s payment terms under this arrangement, nor would there be if the arrangement 
was to cease. The amount due is recognised in trade payables.
The Group also has access to payment facilities, utilised to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing. Under these 
facilities the Group benefits from an extension to payment terms of less than 12 months for a small fee. The original liability 
is derecognised and the amount due to the facility provider is recognised in other payables. Fees are either recognised 
in the Consolidated income statement, or capitalised if they are directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset, 
in the period incurred.
The Group does not include trade and other payables in its calculation of Net debt (see note 2.7).

Trade payables are unsecured and are usually paid within 60 days of recognition. The carrying amounts of trade and other payables 
are the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
Trade payables includes £53.9 million (2021: £50.4 million) related to reverse factoring. Other payables includes £214.5 million 
(2021: £62.2 million) due under other payment facilities which includes amounts due under deferred letters of credit in respect of the 
construction of the Group’s three OCGT assets that obtained a Capacity Market contract.
Energy supply accruals includes £315.0 million (2021: £264.3 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising 
from activities in the Customers business. The remaining balance principally comprises third-party grid charge accruals of 
£108.5 million (2021: £48.2 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £46.8 million (2021: £19.8 million). Energy supply accruals have 
increased as a result of both higher supply volumes and higher prices.
Other accruals includes £11.1 million (2021: £39.3 million) in respect of the Group’s estimated obligation to deliver carbon emissions 
allowances under the UK Emission Trading Scheme (UK ETS). Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
Other accruals also includes accruals for capital and operating expenditure where the invoices have not yet been received.
Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas contracts, 
for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the contract. The balance reduces as revenue is subsequently 
recognised in the following periods, offset by further advanced consideration received. Additions in the year include £14.4 million 
in the Generation business in relation to the winter coal contract with the National Grid to provide a ‘winter contingency’ service 
to the UK power system. The reconciliation of opening to closing contract liabilities is as follows:

3.8 Climate change
Climate change, and tackling it, is pervasive to the Group’s purpose, as set out in the Strategic report on pages 2 to 91. The Sustainable 
development report, starting on page 36 sets out how the Group’s ambition is to be climate positive and the TCFD disclosures, starting 
on page 52, set out the Group’s approach to managing climate risks, including scenario analysis. Climate change is factored into short, 
medium and long-term forecasts and estimates used by the Group.
Several areas of the Consolidated financial statements have climate considerations in relation to them, namely:
Area
Description
Page reference
Judgements in relation to key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of assets, UELs of property, plant and equipment and 
capitalisation of development project costs are all sensitive to 
climate change. Please see further details below.

Impairment of assets
The Group’s expectations around the impacts of climate 
change, and in particular the requirements of the UK Government’s 
commitment to reach net zero by 2050, are integral 
to the forecasts used to underpin the Group’s impairment analyses. 
For example, the forward power price curves used take into 
account expectations regarding the impact of climate change and 
the changing mix of generating assets on the UK power system.
Governmental and societal responses to climate change are still 
developing, and therefore financial statements cannot capture all 
potential future scenarios as these are not yet known. This 
presents uncertainty around future cashflows from an IAS 36 
perspective. Sensitivities modelled, including around biomass 
acceptability, seek to capture some of these potential scenarios. 
Also, operational outages, whether caused by climate related 
events or other factors, are some of the sensitivities modelled 
in the impairment testing.

Going concern and viability
As above, forecast power prices and operational outages are also 
incorporated into the going concern and viability assessments.
176 for going 
concern and 75 
for viability
Fixed asset UELs
Climate impacts are one of the factors assessed in determining 
how long the Group anticipate both additions and existing assets 
to operate for. For example, the OCGT assets under development 
will be given a UEL commensurate with the Group’s expectations 
around the UK’s transition to a net zero position by 2050.
Although, as outlined in the Key sources of estimation uncertainty, 
the likelihood is that UELs at Drax Power Station will be extended, 
were UELs to be shortened by 10 years, whether as a result of 
climate change or otherwise, depreciation would increase by 
approximately £65 million per year.

Section 4: Financing and capital structure
This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from 
operations during the year.
4.1 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, short-term bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less, and money 
market funds. The carrying amount of these assets is approximately equal to their fair value. It is the Group’s policy to invest available 
cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts.

Cash collateral is sometimes paid or received in relation to the Group’s commodity and treasury trading activities. When derivative 
positions are out of the money for the Group, collateral may be required to be paid to the counterparty. When derivative positions are 
in the money, collateral may be received from counterparties. These positions reverse when contracts are settled and the collateral 
is returned.
At 31 December 2022, net postings of £234.0 million had been made to counterparties (2021: £172.8 million of net receipts from 
counterparties) to support energy hedging activity. Cash collateral payments of £234.0 million (2021: £32.8 million) were recognised 
in other receivables and £nil (2021: £205.6 million) of cash collateral receipts were recognised in other payables. The increase in cash 
collateral payments is predominantly due to the significant price increases seen in the power, gas and carbon markets as well as an 
increase in the use of collateralised exchange based trading. See note 7.6 and 4.3 for details on collateral requirements the Group has 
met through its available non-cash credit facilities.
4.2 Borrowings
Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the 
principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the 
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the expected life of the 
instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Loan commitment fees payable to the lender that entitle the Group to draw down at any 
time over a fixed period, with a fixed repayment date regardless of when the loan is drawn down, are recognised on a systematic basis 
over the period the Group is able to draw down if draw down is probable. Loan commitment fees payable to the lender that entitle the 
Group to draw down at any time over a fixed period, where the loan has the same fixed term regardless of when the loan is drawn 
down, are deferred until draw down and are recognised over the life of the instrument as part of the effective interest rate if draw 
down is probable. If drawdown is not probable then loan commitment fees are recognised on a systematic basis over the period the 
Group is able to draw down.
Fees that are paid for the availability of a facility where the amount and timing of draw down can vary at the Group’s discretion, 
such as a revolving credit facility (RCF), are recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the facility.
Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with any exchange gains and 
losses being recognised as a component of foreign exchange gains or losses in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign 
currency risk and interest rate risk in accordance with the policies set out in note 7.2. Where hedging instruments are used to fix 
cash flows associated with debt instruments, the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately 
on the Consolidated balance sheet. Where hedge accounting is applied to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk on debt 
instruments, gains and losses are recycled to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income within either foreign exchange 
gains/(losses) or interest payable and similar charges, to match the exposure they are hedging, where effective. The borrowings 
amounts disclosed in the tables below exclude any impact of hedging instruments.

(3) The index-linked loan facility matured in March 2022. On maturity the principal amount of £35 million plus £6.4 million of indexation was repaid wholly from cash 
reserves. 
(4) These comprise committed facilities totalling £375 million with a range of maturities extending out to between 2024 and 2029. Interest rate swaps have been used to fix 
floating rates. This equates to an effective sterling interest rate of 3.3%.
(5) These comprise committed facilities totalling £98 million and €126.5 million with a range of maturities extending out to between 2024 and 2030. Interest rate swaps have 
been used to fix sterling floating rates on sterling facilities. Cross-currency interest rate swaps have been used to fix the sterling value of interest payments on euro 
facilities. This instrument also fixed the sterling repayment of the principal. This equates to an effective sterling interest rate of 2.5%.
(6) This facility matures in 2024 with the option to extend by two years and has a customary margin grid reference over the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR). No 
interest rate or cross-currency interest rate swaps are in place to hedge the facility, so the Group is exposed to movements in both floating interest rates and movements 
in the Canadian dollar.
(7) This is an uncommitted short-term facility with a maturity term of one month, however this term may be extended at the option of the lender. The average fixed interest 
rate for this facility is 2.4%.
The Group has a committed £300 million RCF and C$10 million RCF. These had no cash drawings as at 31 December 2022 or 
31 December 2021. The Group has never had cash drawings under this facility since its inception, three years ago. The Group also 
has access to certain non-recourse trade receivable monetisation facilities and payment facilities, as described in note 4.3, which are 
utilised to accelerate working capital cash inflows and defer cash outflows.
In December 2022, the Group secured a new £200 million committed liquidity facility with banks within its lending group. This facility 
provides an additional source of liquidity to the Group’s existing undrawn RCFs, over the 12 months following the reporting date. 
This facility was temporarily drawn during December, to support optimisation of generation and associated cash collateral postings, 
but was undrawn at 31 December 2022. The Group has a €50 million uncommitted facility that was drawn during the second half 
of 2022 and at 31 December 2022 €50 million remained drawn (2021: £nil). This facility was also drawn to support optimisation of 
generation and associated cash collateral postings. See note 2.7 for further details on the Group’s cash and committed facilities.
The Group’s secured borrowings are secured against the assets of a number of the Group’s subsidiaries, with the exception of property 
owned by the US subsidiaries. 
The weighted average interest rate payable at the reporting date on the Group’s borrowings was 4.14% (2021: 3.49%).
Compliance with loan covenants
The Group has customary financial covenants, principally in relation to consolidated net income and the consolidated net income 
to debt ratio. The consolidated net income to debt ratio broadly equates to an EBITDA to Net debt calculation and is calculated in line 
with the Group’s financial covenant requirements in the loan facility agreements(1). The Group is required to test its financial covenants 
every six months at financial full-year and half-year reporting periods, and has complied with all financial covenants during the current 
and prior year. The Group has significant headroom and expects to continue to comply with these financial covenants in future periods 
under all reasonably possible downside scenarios. See the Viability statement on page 75 for further details on the scenarios 
considered. The Group also has conditions placed on its dividend payments as a result of the financing facilities.
(1) The net debt calculation for financial covenants is based on Net debt including cash and borrowings attributable to non-controlling interests, but excludes the impact 
of hedging.

As disclosed above, the Group has a number of cross-currency interest rate swaps that fix the principal repayment of certain foreign 
currency denominated borrowings. Accordingly, the foreign exchange losses (2021: gains) on borrowings disclosed in the above tables 
have been offset by £62.0 million of foreign exchange gains (2021: 21.2 million of losses) on cross-currency interest rate swaps that 
have been recycled to profit and loss as part of the hedging relationship. See note 2.7 for further details of the impact of the Group’s 
cash flow hedging relationships on Net debt.

4.3 Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement
Accounting policy
In accordance with IAS 7 the Group has elected to classify cash flows from interest paid and interest received as cash flows from 
operations, dividends paid as cash flows from financing activities, and dividends received as cash flows from investing activities. 
The interest repayment on lease liabilities is included within interest paid, and the lease principal repayment is presented within 
cash flows from financing activities.
Cash generated from operations
Cash generated from operations is the starting point of the Group’s Consolidated cash flow statement on page 185. The table below

(1) Certain remeasurements of derivative contracts includes the effect of non-cash unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated income statement and their 
subsequent cash realisation. It also includes the cash and non-cash impact of deferring and recycling gains and losses on derivative contracts designated into hedge 
relationships under IFRS 9, where the gain or loss is held in the hedge reserve and then released to the Consolidated income statement in the period the hedged 
transaction occurs.
(2) The £168.3 million increase in collateral received in the prior year has been re-presented. Previously this was included in the movement in receivables as a £30.6 million 
increase and movement in payables as a £198.9 million increase.
(3)  The comparative figure has been re-presented to combine the defined benefit scheme current and past service costs and contributions into a net defined benefit 
pension obligation.
The Group has generated cash from operations of £320.3 million during the year (2021: £354.5 million). This resulted from a cash 
inflow from operating activities before working capital of £733.7 million (2021: £336.8 million). This was offset by a £10.6 million (2021: 
£9.6 million) cash outflow in respect of pension obligations and a net working capital outflow of £402.8 million (2021: £27.3 million 
inflow), principally due to collateral payments. The most significant factors making up these cash movements are explained in further 
detail below.
The £288.7 million adjustment for certain remeasurements of derivative contracts (2021: £(74.6) million adjustment) in the current year 
predominantly relates to net unrealised losses recognised within the Consolidated income statement, where cash has not yet been paid 
or received by the Group. These net unrealised losses were offset by a net cash outflow due to realised losses on maturing trades.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 227
 
Financial statements
4.3 Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement continued
From time to time, where market conditions change, the Group can rebase foreign currency contracts including cross-currency 
interest rate swaps. Rebasing trades accelerates certain cash flows at the point of rebasing that would have been received on 
maturity or at contractual payment dates per the original terms of the trade. There is an equal and opposite reduction in cash flows 
(less rebasing fees) on the original maturity or contractual payment dates. At 31 December 2022 the Group had accelerated 
£43.1 million of cash flows through the use of rebasing (2021: £48.1 million). The reduction in accelerated cash flows reflects the 
unwinding of the cash benefit as the original maturity or contractual payment dates pass. The accelerated cash flows related wholly 
to rebased cross-currency interest rate swaps in the current and prior year. The impact of rebasing is reflected within the Certain 
remeasurements of derivative contracts line in the table above.
The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and managing liquidity. The Group enhances its working capital position by 
managing payables, receivables, inventories and renewable certificate assets to make sure the working capital committed is closely 
aligned with operational requirements. The impact of these actions on the cash flows of the Group is explained further below.
High levels of volatility in power and commodity markets have continued during 2022. Cash collateral is sometimes paid or received 
in relation to the Group’s commodity and treasury trading activities. When derivative positions are out of the money for the Group, 
collateral may be required to be paid to the counterparty. When derivative positions are in the money, collateral may be received 
from counterparties. These positions reverse when contracts are settled and the collateral is returned. 
The Group actively manages the liquidity requirements, including collateral, associated with the hedging of power and other 
commodities. At 31 December 2022 the Group had a net posting of collateral. However, the design of the Group’s trading agreements 
and methods of posting collateral, such as being able to utilise letters of credit and surety bonds to meet collateral requirements, 
aims to minimise cash outflows resulting from collateral requirements where possible. The Group has had a net cash outflow of 
£406.8 million during the year due to collateral (2021: £168.3 million inflow). At 31 December 2022 the Group held £nil in cash 
collateral receipts (2021: £205.6 million) recognised in payables and had posted £234.0 million (2021: £32.8 million) of cash collateral 
payments recognised in receivables. The Group also had £54.5 million (2021: £42.5 million) of letters of credit and £165.0 million (2021: 
£107.1 million) of surety bonds utilised covering commodity trading collateral requirements. Letters of credit and surety bonds utilised 
at the reporting date have reduced the requirement for cash collateral payments, which has reduced the amount by which receivables 
has increased. See notes 4.1 and 7.6 for further details on cash collateral receipts and non-cash collateral postings respectively.
The £379.0 million (2021: £27.4 million) cash outflow due to an increase in receivables in 2022 is predominantly related to the 
Customers business as a result of higher power and gas prices during the year, resulting in higher amounts receivable from customers. 
The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with amounts receivable 
from energy supply customers on a non-recourse basis. The Group has refinanced this facility during the year, extending the maturity 
to January 2027 and increasing the size of the facility to £300.0 million from £200.0 million. The Group also agreed a further increase 
to the £300.0 million limit, to £400.0 million, for the period November 2022 to January 2024. Utilisation of the facility was 
£400.0 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: £200.0 million). The additional utilisation of this facility has resulted in a £200.0 million 
cash inflow which has offset the increase in receivables described above to lead to the net £379.0 million cash outflow.
The movement in renewable certificate assets during the year includes a combination of generation, utilisation, purchases and sales, 
as described in note 3.3. The £113.7 million cash inflow is predominantly due to the Group’s use of standard renewable certificate sale 
and renewable certificate purchase arrangements. Cash from renewable certificates, and in particular ROCs, is typically realised 
several months after they are earned; however, through these arrangements, the Group is able to accelerate cash flows over a 
proportion of these assets. At 31 December 2022 the Group had accelerated £331.2 million of cash flows using these standard 
renewable certificate sales (2021: £199.8 million). This cash inflow was offset by a net cash outflow as a result of renewable 
certificates generated and still held by the Group.
The Group had a £431.8 million (2021: £15.0 million) cash inflow due to an increase in payables during the year. This increase is 
predominantly due to increased levels of power repurchases within the Generation business in the current year, as well as higher 
accruals as a result of both increased volumes and higher prices in the Customers business.
The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some 
reducing terms. The Group’s suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be 
accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms. At 31 December 2022, the Group had trade payables of £53.9 million (2021: 
£50.4 million) related to reverse factoring. The facility does not directly impact the Group’s working capital, as payment terms remain 
unaltered with the Group and would remain the same should the facility fall away.
The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing, 
whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short extension of payment terms of less than 12 months. 
The amount outstanding under these facilities at 31 December 2022 was £214.5 million (2021: £62.2 million) resulting in a cash 
inflow of £152.3 million. Utilisation of these payment facilities has reduced the cash outflow in the purchases of property, plant and 
equipment line in the Consolidated cash flow statement by £64.6 million and has also impacted the movement in payables line 
in the table above by £87.7 million. 
The cash outflow of £133.4 million as a result of the increase in inventories results in part from the planned build-up of inventories 
due to the reprofiling of generation from summer into winter.

The capital redemption and treasury share reserves arose when the Group completed previous share buyback programmes. 
The 13.8 million shares held in the treasury share reserve have no voting rights attached to them.
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s US and Canadian subsidiaries from their 
functional currencies (USD and CAD) into sterling for presentation in these Consolidated financial statements are recognised in the 
translation reserve.
Movements in the hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve, which reflect the change in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments designated into hedge accounting relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, are set out in notes 7.3 and 7.4.
4.5 Non-controlling interests
Accounting policy
In accordance with IFRS 3, the Group elects on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis whether to measure non-controlling interests (NCIs) 
at their proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date, or at fair value. The Group treats 
transactions with NCIs that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity owners of the Parent Company. A change in 
ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling interests and NCIs to reflect their relative 
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to NCIs and the fair value of any consideration paid 
or received is recognised in equity, within retained profits.
At 31 December 2022, the Group has two (2021: three) subsidiary undertakings with NCIs. These subsidiaries were acquired during 
the prior year through the acquisition of Pinnacle. During the year, the Group purchased the remaining 10% of NCI in Alabama Pellets 
LLC increasing the Group’s interest in the subsidiary to 100%. See the Transactions with NCI section below for further information.

Transactions with NCI
When the Group acquired Pinnacle during 2021, the NCI in Alabama Pellets LLC (APLLC) was 30%. In July 2021, the Group acquired 
a further 20% interest in APLLC for £21.5 million ($29.7 million), increasing the Group’s total interest in APLLC to 90% and reducing 
the NCI to 10%. This resulted in a £0.2 million charge recognised in equity, within retained profits, for the difference between the 
adjustment to NCI and the fair value of any consideration paid. In September 2022, the Group acquired the remaining 10% of NCI 
in APLLC for £20.2 million ($22.2 million), resulting in the Group now owning 100% of APLLC. This resulted in a £9.3 million charge 
recognised in equity, within retained profits, for the difference between the adjustment to NCI and the fair value of any consideration 
paid, and a decrease in the translation reserve of £0.7 million.
The following table summarises the impact of changes in the Group’s ownership of APLLC:

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities
This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, 
including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions.
5.1 Business combinations
Accounting policy
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point 
the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration transferred, the identifiable assets acquired, and 
the liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. Amounts relating to the settlement of pre-existing 
relationships are recognised in the Consolidated income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the consideration transferred 
to reflect the fact that part of the consideration is deemed to relate to the settlement of the pre-existing relationship.
From the acquisition date, the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet, and 
the revenues and profit or loss of the acquired businesses are recognised in the Consolidated income statement. Acquisition-related 
costs are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement in the period that they are incurred.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the:
• consideration transferred; less
• amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and
• acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity;
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Share-based payment awards held by employees of the acquired business that are voluntarily replaced are recognised as post-
acquisition remuneration. Share-based payment awards held by employees of the acquired business that are obliged to be replaced 
are allocated between post-acquisition remuneration, which is treated as an expense, and pre-acquisition remuneration, which is 
treated as part of the overall consideration.
Acquisition of Pinnacle
In the prior year the Group completed the acquisition of Pinnacle. The primary reason for the acquisition was to advance the Group’s 
biomass strategy by more than doubling its production capacity, significantly reducing its cost of biomass production and adding a major 
biomass supply business underpinned by long-term sales contracts with high-quality Asian and European counterparties. The Group 
completed the acquisition on 13 April 2021. The purchase consideration was valued on a fully diluted equity basis at £222 million 
(C$385 million), a price of C$11.30 per share representing a premium of 13% based on the closing market price on 5 February 2021 
of C$10.04 per share.
The purchase consideration consisted of the following:

The Group’s one year measurement period from the acquisition date, to finalise the acquisition accounting, ended in the current 
reporting period. There were no changes to the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and NCI 
as at 13 April 2021 that were recognised in the 2021 Consolidated financial statements. Detailed below are the relevant acquisition 
values and the methods used to estimate them, as presented in the prior year.

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued
5.1 Business combinations continued
As part of the accounting for the Pinnacle acquisition, the assets and liabilities acquired were measured at fair value on the acquisition 
date. The valuation was performed by an independent valuation specialist. A fair value uplift of £23.6 million (C$40.8 million) was 
recognised on the carrying value of property, plant and equipment acquired as part of the acquisition. If different assumptions and 
inputs were used, this could have resulted in a different fair value.
The Pinnacle business held a number of long-term customer contracts at the acquisition date. As part of the acquisition accounting, 
these existing customer contracts were required to be measured at their fair value. In determining the fair value of these contracts, 
estimates were required for inputs to the valuation, such as the margin associated with these customer contracts, the required return 
for assets used to generate these contract revenues, retention rates, and an appropriate discount rate based on the risk profile of 
these contracts. A change to any of these inputs could significantly impact the fair value calculated for these customer contracts. 
A customer-related intangible asset with a fair value of £35.9 million (C$62.1 million) was recognised in relation to customer contracts 
at acquisition and is being amortised over its remaining UEL. See note 5.2 for further details of the valuation approach, the key 
valuation inputs, the carrying value and remaining amortisation period.
The Group and Pinnacle had a pre-existing relationship relating to long-term supply contracts under which Pinnacle supplied the 
Group with biomass pellets at a fixed price. On acquisition, the Group assessed the terms of these supply contracts compared to 
current market transactions for an identical contract. Pricing for current market transactions for the purpose of this exercise was 
assessed based on the existing portfolio of the Group and Pinnacle contracts. These supply contracts were determined to be 
consistent with the pricing for current market transactions for an identical contract and the settlement provision for terminating these 
contracts would have been immaterial. As a result, no consideration was attributed to the settlement of the pre-existing relationship 
and therefore no gain or loss relating to the pre-existing relationship was recognised in the prior year.
The fair values of the acquired property, plant and equipment, customer-related intangible asset and pre-existing relationship are 
inherently judgemental and involve a high degree of estimation, meaning valuations based on different methodologies or assumptions 
may have resulted in a materially different fair value. However, these valuations were performed by specialists, using appropriate 
methodologies and information. 
Goodwill on acquisition predominantly related to the value of uncontracted revenues and synergies expected to be realised by 
combining Pinnacle with the Group’s existing Pellet Production business. The increased size of the Group’s Pellet Production business 
has enabled greater flexibility, opportunities to optimise the Group’s operations and logistics across the enlarged portfolio and has 
increased knowledge. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is required to be denominated in the functional 
currency of the operations to which the goodwill is allocated to. The goodwill on the Pinnacle acquisition relates to both CAD and USD 
functional currency operations. This resulted in goodwill of C$97.4 million and $151.9 million which, when translated at the acquisition 
date, resulted in £165.9 million of goodwill. These goodwill balances are translated at the rates prevailing at each reporting date into 
the Group’s presentational currency of GBP (see note 5.2 for further details).
The NCI was measured at the proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date 
(see note 4.5 for further details on NCI).

Acquired receivables
The Group acquired receivables with a fair value and a gross contracted value of £22.9 million (C$39.6 million). No provision for 
receivables was recognised due to the risk of default within the Pinnacle business, as well as the wider Pellet Production business, 
being considered to be remote, as explained further in note 3.5.

No contingent liabilities or indemnification assets were recognised on acquisition of Pinnacle.

Acquisition of Princeton pellet plant
On 3 August 2022, the Group announced that it had signed an agreement with Princeton Standard Pellet Corporation (PSPC) 
to acquire its pellet plant in Princeton, British Columbia, Canada for consideration of £7.6 million (C$11.5 million), subject to customary 
working capital adjustments. The sale subsequently completed on 1 September 2022. The plant has nameplate capacity to produce 
90kt of biomass pellets a year from sawmill residuals and will contribute to the Group’s strategy to increase pellet production capacity.
In addition to the pellet plant itself, the Group also acquired certain other assets from PSPC including inventories and other working 
capital balances. As part of the transaction, the employees of PSPC joined the Group. Although the legal structure of the transaction 
was that of an asset purchase agreement, it was concluded that the substance of the transaction met the criteria of a business 
combination as defined by IFRS 3 and therefore the Group accounted for the transaction under the acquisition method.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired were as follows:

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued
5.2 Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. 
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill 
can be acquired in business combinations, purchased separately or internally developed.
Accounting policy
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the:
• consideration transferred;
• amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and
• acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity; 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation is treated as an asset of that operation and therefore denominated in the 
functional currency of the operation to which it is allocated. Goodwill denominated in a foreign currency is translated at the rate 
prevailing at each reporting date. Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life, is not depreciated, and is assessed annually for impairment (see note 2.4).
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are 
measured initially at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring 
the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated UELs, which are reviewed at each reporting date. No changes to UELs were 
made during the period. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained in further detail below.

The Group has incurred research and development expenditure of £12.5 million (2021: £11.4 million), which is included within 
Operating and administrative expenses in the Consolidated income statement.
Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets primarily reflects the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017 
and the acquisition of Pinnacle in April 2021, which provided the Group with access to customer bases with contracted cash flows.
The Opus Energy asset acquisition date fair value of £211.0 million reflected the estimated value of the future cash flows associated 
with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins 
and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted using an asset specific discount rate of 10.7%. The asset 
has an estimated UEL from acquisition of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis which shows how many 
customers are expected to leave the business in a given year, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the 
diminishing rate of contract renewals over time. At 31 December 2022, the Opus Energy asset had a carrying value of £47.8 million 
(2021: £64.2 million) and a remaining UEL of approximately five years (2021: six years).
The Pinnacle asset acquisition date fair value of £35.9 million (C$62.1 million) was estimated based on a multi-period excess earnings 
method. This was based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the customer-related intangible 
asset, after deducting a contributory asset charge that represented the required return for fixed assets, net working capital and the 
assembled workforce that are required to generate the cash flows. The valuation estimates an appropriate margin to apply to 
the contracts.

The Pinnacle customer-related asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis to reflect the even spread of contract maturities 
over the UEL. At 31 December 2022, the Pinnacle asset had a carrying value of £31.5 million (2021: £33.8 million) and a remaining 
UEL of approximately eight years (2021: approximately nine years). 
The Other customer-related assets primarily relate to pellet sales contracts acquired from Pacific BioEnergy on 31 December 2021.
Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11.3 million on a relief-from-royalty 
method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10-year UEL from acquisition.
Computer software and licences
Additions in the period include those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business 
systems to support the Customers segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated UEL ranging 
from three to 10 years.
In March 2021 The IFRIC finalised its agenda decision regarding how to account for cost of configuring or customising a supplier’s 
application software in a SaaS arrangement. The agenda decision concluded that the configuration and customisation costs do not 
normally result in an intangible asset and should therefore be recognised as an expense. The Group has subsequently applied a new 
accounting policy for SaaS costs, consistent with the agenda decision, from 1 January 2022.
SaaS costs capitalised by the Group at 1 January 2022, and impacted by this change in accounting policy, had a net book value of 
£5.7 million. These assets have been impaired during the year, with the charge being recognised against accumulated amortisation 
in the table above, and recorded as an exceptional cost (see note 2.7). SaaS costs incurred from 1 January 2022 have been recognised 
in Operating and administrative expenses. See the Change in accounting policy section in the Basis of preparation for further details.
As at 31 December 2022, computer software assets under the course of construction amounted to £18.3 million (2021: £39.3 million). 
The comparative amount included £19.2 million for a billing system where the Group has stopped development and is engaged in 
active discussion with the supplier following the supplier’s failure to perform under the contract. Proceedings have been issued against 
the supplier to recover damages for misrepresentation and breach of contract. The Group no longer expects that future economic 
benefits will be recovered as an ongoing intangible asset and as a result, the asset has been impaired in the current financial period. 
The impairment charge has been recognised against the cost the asset in the table above, and recorded as an exceptional cost. 
See notes 2.7 and 7.6 for further information.
See note 2.4 for a summary of impairment charges recognised on fixed assets during the year.

5.3 Provisions
The Group makes provisions for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing or remediating the 
sites of its generation assets at the end of their useful economic lives (UELs). The Group has recognised a restructuring provision 
in respect of coal closure. Other provisions primarily relate to dilapidation provisions for leased assets.
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount required to settle the obligation.
Specifically, a provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the UEL of the Group’s generating assets, when 
a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a site-by-site basis and represents 
the present value of the expected future costs. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant 
and equipment and is depreciated over the UELs of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable 
and similar charges.
The Group recognises a restructuring provision when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised 
a valid expectation that it will carry out the restructuring either by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features 
to those affected by it. The restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring programme. 
These are costs that would have been avoided if the restructuring programme did not go ahead. Any costs to be incurred relating 
to the ongoing activities of the Group are excluded from the provision.
A provision for termination benefits is recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination 
benefit and when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.

(1) The unwinding of discount and changes in the discount rate is comprised of a £1.1m increase to the provision relating to unwinding of the discount (see note 2.5) and a 
£22.4m decrease in the provision relating to changes in the discount rate (see note 3.1). 
Decommissioning provisions are made in respect of Drax Power Station. The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption 
that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected UEL of Drax Power Station, currently estimated 
to be 2039. This has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated 
on a triennial basis as a minimum, but more regularly where deemed appropriate due to changes in plans for decommissioning the 
site that would impact the expected costs. The most recent update took place in December 2020.
This cost of decommissioning was estimated to be £56.0 million. An inflation curve was then applied to estimate the decommissioning 
costs in 2039. This value was then discounted to calculate the present value of the provision to be recognised.
The discount rate used is a nominal risk-free rate that reflects the duration of the liability. The discount rate is estimated using forward 
UK Gilt curves as a proxy for risk-free rates. The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows have 
built-in risks specific to the liability. The discount rate used for the Group’s decommissioning provision is 4.05% (2021: 1.16%).
The decommissioning provision is not considered a key source of estimation uncertainty to which there is a significant risk of a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount within the next financial year. Decommissioning provisions are based on costs sufficiently far in the 
future that, given the length of time, it is not anticipated that any new, more reliable, or accurate information will be available within 
the next financial year to update this estimate that would result in a material adjustment. The cost of decommissioning a site the size 
of Drax Power Station will be impacted by things such as the exact composition and volumes of materials used in the structures to be 
decommissioned, and the presence of contaminants. Full site surveys and investigations will need to be performed once the site 
ceases operation to ascertain further information necessary to decommission the site which could impact the potential costs. 
Notwithstanding this, due to the high degree of estimation and uncertainty regarding the potential costs and timing of 
decommissioning Drax Power Station, there remains a risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount in the longer-term.

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued
5.3 Provisions continued 
The present value recognised for the decommissioning provision is dependent on the inflation rate and discount rate used. Inflation 
rates are estimated using forward inflation curves. An increase of 10% to the cost estimates would increase the decommissioning 
provision by £4.7 million (2021: £6.8 million). An increase of 100 basis points in the inflation and discount rates used would result 
in a £9.5 million (2021: £13.8 million) increase and a £7.0 million (2021: £11.1 million) decrease respectively in the amount recognised. 
The relationship between the change in basis points and change in amount recognised is relatively linear therefore the impact 
of similar sensitivities may be interpolated and extrapolated from these amounts.
The restructuring provision consists of redundancy costs relating to the formal closure of the coal units at Drax Power Station which 
was initially planned for September 2022. It also includes costs for engineering works required to make the coal units and related 
assets safe when they cease operating. At the request of the UK Government, the Group has entered into an agreement with National 
Grid to keep the two coal units available to provide a “winter contingency” service to the UK power system from October 2022 until 
the end of March 2023. The units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and will only operate if and when 
instructed to do so by National Grid. This has delayed the formal closure of the coal units and has resulted in the utilisation of certain 
amounts of the restructuring provision also being delayed. This has not materially impacted the expected costs.
The amount of the restructuring provision utilised in the year predominantly relates to engineering and redundancy costs. Of the 
balance remaining at 31 December 2022, £11.6 million relates to engineering works, of which £3.2 million is expected to be utilised 
in 2023 with the remaining amounts expected to be utilised in the period 2024 to 2026. A further £0.6 million relates to redundancy 
costs, which are expected to be utilised in 2023, and the remaining £0.5 million relates to other costs, which are expected to be utilised 
in the period 2024 to 2026. The full provision has been presented within non-current liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet.
5.4 Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and meets one of the 
following criteria outlined in IFRS 5:
• represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations;
• is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Accounting policy
The component is classified as a discontinued operation at the earlier of when it is disposed of or when the component meets the held 
for sale criteria.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation its results are presented separately in the Consolidated income statement. 
The results of the discontinued operation are also re-presented in the Consolidated income statement as discontinued in the 
comparative period.
Sale of CCGT portfolio
On 31 January 2021, the Group completed the sale of its CCGT generation portfolio to VPI Generation Limited for cash consideration 
of up to £193 million, subject to customary adjustments. This included £29 million of contingent consideration associated with the 
option to develop the site at Damhead Creek (see notes 3.5 and 7.1). The sale price represented a return over the Group’s period of 
ownership significantly ahead of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The Group received initial consideration of £188 million in February 2021 which was amended to £186 million in July 2021 following 
conclusion of the completion accounts process. The Group recognised an overall net gain on disposal of £8.5 million spread across 
the financial years ending 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021. 
The Group recognised certain transaction-related and mark-to-market costs, as incurred, during the year ended 31 December 2020. 
As a result, recognition of the net gain on disposal in the Group’s Consolidated income statement is spread across 2020 and 2021, 
as illustrated below. No amounts have been recognised in the current financial year in relation to this disposal.

6.2 Share-based payments
The Group operates three share option schemes for employees: the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive directors and senior 
employees (which replaced the Performance Share Plan (PSP) from 2020), the Deferred Share Plan (DSP) for Executive directors, and 
the Sharesave Plan (SAYE) for all UK qualifying employees. Awards are made to certain employees below senior management under 
the rules of the LTIP – such awards are retention and recognition awards, designated as One Drax Awards, for more junior colleagues. 
The Group incurs a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in the Consolidated income statement, which is set out below along 
with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding at the reporting date.
Accounting policy
The LTIP, PSP, DSP, One Drax Awards and SAYE share-based payment schemes are equity-settled. In accordance with IFRS 2, 
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The corresponding 
expense is recognised in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an 
estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions, which is 
revised at each reporting date. Market based conditions are factored into the calculation of the fair value of options granted at the 
date of grant and are not subsequently remeasured.

The fair value of share options is calculated using either a Monte-Carlo model or a Black-Scholes model, depending on which model is 
deemed most appropriate for the nature of the share options. The Black-Scholes model compares exercise price to share price at the 
date of grant. The Monte-Carlo model takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting for share options with 
market based conditions. The key inputs to the valuation models for the options are the share price at the date of grant, expected 
volatility and risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

LTIP
The LTIP was introduced in 2020 for Executive directors and senior employees. This replaced the PSP, which operated from 2017 
to 2019 (see below). Under the LTIP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration 
to Executive directors and other senior employees up to a maximum of 200% of their annual base salary. Vesting of a proportion 
of shares (50%) is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined 
in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years, and vesting of a proportion of shares (50%) is conditional upon performance 
of cumulative Adjusted EPS (defined to be derived from Adjusted results) over three years.
Shares are forfeited due to employees failing to meet the continuing service conditions of the grant and as such do not attract 
a charge. 
Shares expire due to employees not meeting market-based conditions, withdrawing (by choice) part way through the vesting period 
or for any other reason not exercising their options in the exercise period after they vest. Under IFRS 2 such options still attract

The PSP was introduced for Executive directors and senior employees to replace the Bonus Matching Plan from 2017. Under the PSP, 
annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration up to a maximum of 175% of their annual 
base salary. Vesting of a proportion of shares (50%) was conditional upon whether the Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an index 
(determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares (50%) was conditional upon 
performance against the Group Scorecard (see page 147). 
DSP
The Group operates the DSP, under which Executive directors receive 40% (2021: 40%) of their annual bonus in shares. DSP awards 
are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination provisions. 
One Drax Awards 
One Drax Awards are granted under the rules of the LTIP to certain employees below senior management and vest after one year 
subject to continuous employment. The number of shares awarded to the employee is equivalent to 10% of their base salary based 
on the Group’s share price as at the grant date.
SAYE
In April 2022, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all UK qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to 
acquire shares at a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price at the grant date, determined in accordance with the scheme rules. 
The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts.
Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report 
on pages 138 and 139.

Trustee governance (defined benefit pension schemes)
The UK defined benefit schemes are administered by a board of Trustees, which is legally separate from the Group. The Trustees are 
composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant 
beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy for the assets and the day-to-day administration of the benefit schemes.
Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them 
to the contributions. The Consolidated income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the total 
contributions to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 245
 
Financial statements
6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains 
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately 
in the Consolidated balance sheet with a charge or credit to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in 
which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements, are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in 
which they occur. The net interest expense or credit is recognised in interest payable and similar charges or interest receivable.
Significant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the defined benefit pension obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, 
including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed 
annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the schemes 
are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of pension scheme actuaries. However, actual results may 
differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2022 have been prepared in accordance with independent actuarial advice received and are consistent 
with those applied in the prior period.
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates five defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution 
schemes are as follows:

paid over to the schemes. The Group has no further outstanding payment obligations in respect of the current reporting period once 
these contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit schemes
Any pension surplus and obligation are shown gross on the Consolidated balance sheet as there is no legal right of offset between 
the two defined benefit pension schemes. The net pension surplus for the two defined benefit pension schemes is as follows:

The DPG ESPS and the Drax 2019 Scheme are collectively referred to as “the Schemes” below. At 31 December 2022, application of 
the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Schemes, which are described in further detail below, continued to result in a net 
position of surplus assets over liabilities. 
Both of the Schemes are defined benefit final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed 
level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service and their salary in the final years 
leading up to retirement. Pension benefits are updated in line with inflationary increases.
The DPG ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they had qualified through being existing members of 
another part of the ESPS. Employed members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme. 
Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus 
a tax-free lump sum of three times the member’s annual pension at retirement.
The Drax 2019 Scheme was set up following a transaction on 31 December 2018, when the Group acquired assets from Scottish 
Power Limited. Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, employees with defined benefit pension rights who moved 
to the Group as part of the transaction were able to build up a future defined benefit pension and were also able to transfer their 
defined benefits they had already built up to the Group. The scheme was set up to facilitate this from 1 January 2020. From this date, 
96 members joined the Drax 2019 scheme and continued to build up a future defined benefit pension. Of these, 81 members agreed 
to transfer their past service benefits into the scheme.
Under the Drax 2019 Scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final salary on attainment of retirement age 
(or earlier withdrawal or death). No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme is open to future accrual of benefits 
but closed to new members.

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The Group and Trustees have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes an 
asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Schemes by investing in assets that 
perform in line with the liabilities to protect against interest rates being lower or inflation being higher than expected, for example.
The Schemes expose the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk
The Schemes’ liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if assets underperform this yield, this creates a deficit. The DPG ESPS holds a significant proportion of growth 
assets (diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, though expected to 
outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation 
to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given this scheme’s long-term objectives.
The Drax 2019 Scheme’s long-term investment strategy and strategic asset allocation is 70% in gilts and 
cash to support liability hedging and equity derivative overlay strategies, 15% allocated to synthetic credit 
and 15% to credit opportunities. The scheme has moved towards a fully hedged position but continues 
to maintain return-generating assets such as equity options and credit strategies.
Discount rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the Schemes’ liabilities, although 
this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes’ bond holdings.
Longevity risk
The majority of the Schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the Schemes.
Inflation risk
The majority of the Schemes’ obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation 
leads to higher liabilities. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme 
inflation. The Schemes have a significant holding in liability-driven investments and around 85% of inflation 
risk in the Schemes is hedged on a low-risk measure (2021: around 85%).
Credit risk
Around 85% of the Schemes’ overall funded liabilities are currently hedged against interest rates and inflation 
using liability-driven investments. The Schemes hedge interest rate risks on a statutory and long-term funding 
basis (gilts) whereas AA corporate bonds are implicit in the discount rate and so there is a degree of 
mismatching risk to the Group should yields on gilts and corporate bonds diverge. The Schemes’ holding 
in corporate bonds mitigates this risk to some extent.
During the year, particularly around September and October 2022, there was significant yield volatility. However, with the exception 
of one week over which hedge ratios reduced for the DPG ESPS, the Schemes were able to maintain their target hedge levels 
throughout this period.
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing 
the burden on pension schemes through new regulation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion 
of members with dependents eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits are payable 
on death before retirement.
A qualified independent actuary, Aon, carried out the most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS as at 31 March 2019, 
and the most recent funding valuation of the Drax 2019 Scheme as at 31 March 2021. The actuarial review at 31 December 2022 
is based on the same membership and other data as these funding valuations. The Schemes’ Boards accepted the advice of the 
actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the Schemes’ costs. 
The results of the latest funding valuations have been adjusted to 31 December 2022, taking into account experience over the period 
since that date, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method. 
The principal assumptions for the Schemes are set out below. Where absolute assumptions differ between the two schemes, 
reflecting differences in the expected duration of the Schemes’ liabilities, a weighted average is shown.

Whilst actual inflation has been high over 2022, long-term expectations as at 31 December 2022 are in line with long-term 
expectations as at 31 December 2021. The defined benefit obligation for the Schemes allows for expected benefit increases that 
will be awarded in 2023, based on known 2022 indices.
Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of the Schemes’ members and allow for expected future 
improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2022 will live, on average, for a further 26 years 
if they are male (2021: 26 years) and for a further 28 years if they are female (2021: 28 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male 
and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 29 years respectively (2021: 27 and 29 years respectively). 
The weighted average duration of the DPG ESPS at 31 December 2022 based on the IAS 19 position was 18 years (2021: 20 years). 
The weighted average duration of the Drax 2019 Scheme at 31 December 2022 based on the IAS 19 position was 21 years 
(2021: 24 years).
The DPG ESPS defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (45%), former employees of the Group 
who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (50%). The Drax 2019 Scheme defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current 
employees of the Group (55%), former employees of the Group who are yet to retire (43%) and retired pensioners (2%).
The net surplus recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet in respect of the Schemes is the excess of the fair value of the plan 
assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation, determined as follows:

On 31 January 2021, the Group completed the sale of its CCGT generation portfolio to VPI Generation Limited. The past service credit 
in 2021 relates to this sale, which led to 42 members, of a pre-transaction total of 96, ceasing to accrue benefits in the Drax 2019 
Scheme and becoming deferred members. 
The past service credit calculation was performed by a qualified independent actuary using the same assumptions as those applied 
to the rest of the Schemes. The past service credit represents the difference between the liability relating to the standard Drax 2019 
Scheme benefits as an active member as per the reserve in the calculation of the Group’s IAS 19 position at that time, and the 
corresponding liability in respect of the equivalent benefits as deferred members (including allowance for two members who were 
offered enhanced past service benefits).

The actuarial gains of £123.6 million (2021: £15.4 million) reflect gains of £133.3 million (2021: £10.3 million) arising from changes

(2021: £0.8 million) arising from changes in demographic assumptions.
The gains due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the Schemes’ liabilities 
arising as a result of the movement in discount rate assumption to 4.8% p.a. (2021: 1.9% p.a.) following an increase in corporate bond 
yields, coupled with a slight decrease in overall long-term inflationary assumptions reflecting market pricing.

liability hedging and equity derivative overlay strategies, 15% allocated to synthetic credit and 15% to credit opportunities.
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds.
(3) Other assets include £29.9 million (2021: £27.1 million) of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle which is not quoted in an active market. 
The fair value of these investments is derived in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines. All other assets are quoted 
in an active market.
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The valuation of the pension liabilities has been disclosed as a key source of estimation uncertainty due to the assumptions used in the 
valuation. The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate (and related inflation linked benefits) and life expectancy have a potentially 
significant effect on the measurement of the Schemes’ surpluses. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the 
net pension surplus at 31 December 2022 to changes in these assumptions, considering the impact on the defined benefit obligation 
only. If a combination of the below reasonably possible changes to key assumptions were used in the valuation of the pension liabilities, 
this could result in a material change to the amount recognised.

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The Group is exposed to investment and other risks. However, this risk is mitigated by the Schemes being around 85% hedged against 
movements in government bonds and inflation of appropriate duration. This means from a discount rate perspective that the Schemes 
are broadly only exposed to changes in credit spreads plus around 15% of changes in underlying gilt yields and, for inflation, 
the Schemes’ exposure is around 15% of any actual changes.
Future contributions
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently (i.e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing 
benefits). This funding is carried out with reference to actuarial valuations which are required by law to take place at intervals of no 
more than three years. Following each valuation, the Trustees and the Group must agree the contributions required (if any) such that 
the Schemes are fully funded over time on the basis of suitably prudent assumptions. 
The Group expects to make total contributions of £12.8 million to the Schemes during the 12 months ending 31 December 2023.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Drax 2019 Scheme which was carried out as at 31 March 2020 resulted in a funding surplus of 
£1.3 million and so no deficit recovery plan was required. The last actuarial valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out as at 31 March 
2019. Following this actuarial valuation, the Group agreed to repair the funding deficit of £35.9 million as at 31 March 2019 over the 
period to 30 June 2024, subject to the actuarial assumptions adopted for the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2019 being borne out 
in practice. The agreement includes payments of £7.2 million per annum (indexed with RPI) to be paid until 30 June 2024. 
The Group has also agreed to make additional contributions to the DPG ESPS over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the 
self-sufficiency deficit. At this point, the DPG ESPS is expected to be self-sufficient and fully funded, unless material adverse changes 
in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the valuation. The Group is satisfied that the additional contributions are 
manageable within the Group’s business plan. 
The Trust Deeds of the DPG ESPS and the Drax 2019 Scheme provide the sponsors of the Schemes with an unconditional right 
to a refund of surplus assets assuming the gradual settlement of plan liabilities over time. Furthermore, in the ordinary course of 
business, the Trustees have no right to unilaterally wind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of the DPG ESPS. 
Based on these rights, any net surplus in the plan is recognised in full in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Post balance sheet event
On 31 January 2023 the DPG ESPS’s assets and liabilities were transferred to the Drax 2019 Scheme, and it is expected that the DPG 
ESPS will be wound-up in due course. The Drax 2019 Scheme will continue to provide the same level of pension benefits to current 
and former employees as they were previously entitled to, with the combination allowing the resulting scheme to operate in a more 
efficient and focused manner, with a reduced administrative burden and associated cost.

Section 7: Risk management
This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments the Group uses 
to mitigate such risks.
7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values
The Group holds a variety of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, 
payables and receivables arising from operations.
Accounting classifications and fair values
IFRS 13 requires categorisation of the Group’s financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain 
the basis on which their fair values have been determined:
• Level 1 – Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
• Level 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices, included within Level 1, 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, including their levels in the fair value 
hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13. It does not include fair value information for leases or for financial assets and financial liabilities 
not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.1), 
trade and other receivables (note 3.5) and trade and other payables (note 3.7) generally have a short time to maturity. For this reason, 
their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, are approximate to their fair values. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to the 
publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans (note 4.2). These financial liabilities are measured 
at amortised cost.

Note:
(1) The UK CPI inflation rate contracts contain unobservable inputs in their fair value techniques. However, these unobservable inputs are not material to the valuation 
and therefore they have been categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy in line with IFRS 13. Inflation rate contracts contain £1.3 million of derivative assets 
and £11.5 million of derivative liabilities relating to the UK CPI inflation rate contracts.
The derivative financial instruments used by the Group and not subject to the own-use exemption have been categorised as follows:
• Commodity contracts – forward contracts for the sale or purchase of a physical commodity which is expected to be settled through 
delivery of the commodity.
• Financial contracts – weather-related contracts, as well as contracts for commodities that are not expected to be settled through 
physical delivery of the commodity.
• Foreign currency exchange contracts – currency related contracts including forwards, vanilla options and structured 
option products.
• Interest rate and cross-currency contracts – contracts which swap one interest rate for another in a single currency, including 
floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, and contracts which swap interest and principal cash flows in one currency for another 
currency, including fixed-to-fixed and floating-to- fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps.
• Inflation rate contracts – swap contracts, such as floating-to-fixed, which are linked to an inflation index such as RPI or CPI, 
and inflation swaptions.

Financial statements
7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued
Fair value measurement
• Commodity contracts – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated 
by reference to forward market prices at the reporting date.
• Financial contracts – The fair value of financial contracts is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the reporting date.
• Foreign currency exchange contracts – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward 
currency exchange market rates at the reporting date.
• Interest rate contracts – The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to forward market curves at the reporting 
date for the relevant interest index. 
• Cross-currency interest rate swap contracts – The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is calculated using the relevant 
forward currency exchange market rates for fixed-to-fixed swaps and by using the relevant forward currency exchange market 
rates and interest index for floating-to-fixed swaps.
• Inflation rate contracts – The fair value of inflation rate swaps is calculated by reference to forward market curves at the reporting 
date for the relevant inflation index.
Given the maturity profile of all these contracts, liquid forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect both the time value of money and credit risk inherent 
within the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments have been considered to be a key source of estimation uncertainty in 2022. The increased volatility 
and higher prices in markets during the year has resulted in the fair value of derivative contracts fluctuating significantly. 
The assessment of fair value is derived in part by reference to a market price for the instrument in question. The Group bases its 
assessment of market prices upon forward curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations and published prices 
from third-party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least in part upon assumptions about future transactions and market 
movements. Due to the increased volatility in the valuations of derivative financial instruments, minor differences in the inputs, 
assumptions or methodologies used can result in appropriate, but materially different, estimates of fair values to those recognised by 
the Group. There may be choices to be made of which methodology or data source to use in the calculation of fair value. Assumptions 
may also need to be made where forward curves are not an exact match for the Group’s derivative contracts (e.g. due to quoted 
product types, maturity dates or time periods not exactly matching the terms of the Group’s derivative contracts). Where such 
instruments extend beyond the liquid portion of the forward curve, the level of estimation increases as the number of observable 
transactions decreases. Sensitivities are provided in note 7.2 for the impact of changes in inputs on the fair value.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. The 2025 USD loan notes, the 2025 EUR 
loan notes, and the 2020 Infrastructure private placement facilities all contain early repayment options that meet the definition of 
embedded derivatives. However, in all cases, these do not require separate valuation as they are deemed to be closely related to the 
host contract.
The fair value of commodity contracts, financial contracts, foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate, cross-currency 
contracts and inflation swaps are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the swap price; therefore, 
these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the current or prior year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
The Group is responsible for determining the policies and approach to valuations required for financial reporting purposes, including 
Level 3 fair values. Internal or external specialists are utilised where necessary. Valuation policies, approaches and the results are 
discussed with and approved by the CFO and the Audit Committee as required, based on the size, complexity and judgement required 
with each valuation.
Level 3 fair values
The fair value of the UK CPI inflation swaps comprises an RPI and CPI component. Whilst the RPI component is based on observable 
market rates, CPI is based on unobservable rates and therefore deemed to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. However, this 
component is not material to the overall valuation and therefore the instruments as a whole have been classified as Level 2.
The valuation technique used for non-listed equity investments comprises unobservable inputs and these are therefore classified as 
Level 3. However, given the valuation as a whole for Level 3 equity investments are immaterial, it is not deemed necessary to include 
all Level 3 disclosures in these Consolidated financial statements.
The consideration receivable by the Group for the sale of the CCGT generation portfolio in 2021 includes £29.0 million that is 
contingent on certain triggers in respect of the option to develop the Damhead Creek 2 land disposed of as part of the sale of these 
assets. The fair value measurement for the contingent consideration has been categorised as Level 3 based on the inputs to the 
valuation techniques used.

Valuation approach
Significant unobservable inputs and range 
of inputs (probability weighted)
Relationship between significant unobservable input 
and fair value measurement
Contingent 
consideration
The fair value of the contingent 
consideration is determined using a 
discounted cash flow model. The 
valuation approach is based on a 
calculation of the probability of the 
option to develop the Damhead Creek 
land being exercised. This probability is 
calculated using a range of forecasts 
for future Capacity Market auctions 
and the assumption that the option to 
develop the land would be exercised 
if the Capacity Market price were to 
clear above a certain level, providing 
sufficient certainty on the economics 
of the development.
Forecasted future Capacity Market 
clearing prices:
£7.00/kW – £64.64/kW 
(£35.91/kW)
(2021: £4.81/kW – £64.13/kW) 
(2021: (£18.70/kW))
Estimated bid price at which Damhead 
Creek 2 is to be entered into the 
Capacity Market auction:
£40.00/kW
(2021: £20.00/kW)
The fair value measurement would 
increase/(decrease) with:
–  higher/(lower) forecasted Capacity 
Market clearing prices causing 
a higher/(lower) probability of the 
option over the Damhead Creek 2 
land being exercised.
–  higher/(lower) estimated bid price 
required for the Damhead Creek 2 
development to proceed causing 
a higher/(lower) probability of the 
option over the Damhead Creek 2 
land being exercised.

Accounting for derivatives
Derivatives (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which represents the difference between 
the price the Group has secured in the contract, and the price the Group could achieve in the market at the reporting date.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the Consolidated income statement or the hedge reserve and cost of hedging 
reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS 9 (see note 7.2).
Where applicable the Group applies the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-
market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the Group’s own purchase, 
sale or usage requirements.
Contracts for non-financial assets which do not qualify for the own-use exemption (principally power, gas, financial oil and carbon 
emissions allowances) are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the Consolidated balance sheet 
at fair value. Changes in fair value are reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.3) to the extent that the contracts are designated as 
effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the Consolidated income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not 
met, or the hedges are ineffective. To ensure these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are 
excluded from the Adjusted results in the Consolidated income statement until the contract matures (see note 2.7 for further details).

Financial statements
7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued
The Group’s biomass risk management policy permits some flexibility in trading activity to optimise the overall portfolio position and 
potentially release value in certain, limited circumstances. As such, the own-use exemption would likely not apply to these biomass 
contracts. However, the nature of these contracts means they cannot be readily net settled in cash or other financial instruments and, 
as a result, they remain outside of the scope of IFRS 9 and are excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting.

Rebasing is explained in the glossary. When the Group rebases derivative contracts, the Group retains the contractual rights to the 
cash flows, the risks and rewards, and control of the derivative asset. The Group does not assume any obligation to pay the cash flows 
to another recipient. Accordingly, the derivative asset is not derecognised.
The cash flows received at the point of rebasing reduce the cash flows to be received on maturity of the trade, and as such the 
cash flows over the life of the instrument are the same whether a trade is rebased or not, minus fees.
At the point of rebasing, the Group recognises a reduction in the fair value of the derivative asset, equivalent to the fair value 
difference between the original rate per the contract and the rebased rate. The Group also recognises the cash received, or due, 
as a result of the rebasing. Any difference between the reduction in the fair value of the derivative asset, and the cash received, 
is recognised as a fee charged for rebasing and is recognised within operating and administrative expenses.
The total gain or loss recognised in the period on the derivative contract, including rebased amounts, is included within Total results. 
No amounts are recognised in Adjusted results at the point of rebasing. The total gain or loss on the derivative contract, 
including the amount rebased, is recognised in Adjusted results on the contractual maturity date of the contract. If a rebased trade 
is hedge accounted, the rebased amount is deferred or released from the hedge reserve in line with the hedge accounting 
requirements of IFRS 9.
Section 7: Risk management continued
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022

Financial statements
7.2 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, 
inflation risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the Risk 
management committees as explained in the Principal Risks and uncertainties section (page 77) which identify, evaluate and hedge 
financial risks in close co-ordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors.
7.2.1 Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of power, gas, biomass pellets and fibre, 
other fuels and the price of carbon emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the financial 
results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices and the impact on profit after tax and 
other components of equity of reasonably possible increases or decreases in commodity prices. The analysis assumes all other 
variables were held constant.
Financial and commodity markets have become increasingly volatile in 2022, in part due to the conflict in Ukraine. This volatility has 
impacted economies and markets around the world, including the UK energy market, which has in part contributed to rising inflation. 
The geopolitical environment and concerns over the macro-economic outlook have also contributed to a weakening in sterling during 
2022. See the Principal risks and uncertainties section on page 77 for further details on both the conflict in Ukraine and energy 
market conditions. As a result of these factors, the valuation of the Group’s derivative financial instruments, in particular power, gas, 
foreign currency contracts, inflation and oil, were subject to significant fluctuations during 2022.
Sensitivities for a 10% change in prices have been included in the current year. The impact of smaller and larger price changes can be 
interpolated and extrapolated from the below table as changes in prices have a relatively linear relationship with the impact on profit 
after tax and on the hedge reserve.

Profit after tax is sensitive to increases or decreases in commodity prices as a result of the impact on the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are sensitive to increases 
or decreases in commodity price risk and the impact on the hedge reserve resulting from these movements.
Commodity risk management
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales and purchases of fuel when it is profitable to do so and is in line with specified 
limits under approved policies. Forward power sales can be secured up to 100% of forecast availability two years ahead. 
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow 
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of power.
The Group purchases biomass pellets and other fuels under either a fixed or variable priced contract with different maturities 
principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. If these contracts 
are within the scope of IFRS 9, the Group, where possible, either applies the own-use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance 
with IFRS 9. If the own-use exemption or hedge accounting are not applicable then the contracts are recognised at FVTPL.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2022 257
 
Financial statements
7.2 Financial risk management continued
Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of 
power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of the Customers business 
and for its Daldowie fuel plant. To support the Group’s ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, a decision was made in January 2023 
to phase out the Group’s gas supply contracts in the Opus Energy part of the Group, within the Customers business.
The Group purchases carbon emissions allowances under fixed price contracts to cover the Group’s purchase requirements under the 
UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) in relation to the Group’s carbon emissions. These are designated as cash flow hedges as they 
reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of carbon emissions allowances. Carbon emissions 
allowances are also purchased as part of proxy power hedges in the same way as financial gas described above. These proxy hedges 
are not designated as cash flow hedges. 
Hedge accounting
The Group has cash flow hedges relating to commodity contracts, principally commitments to sell power and purchase carbon. 
Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting date for the 
effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then 
released to the Consolidated income statement as the related contract matures. For power sales contracts, this is at the point that 
the underlying power is delivered.
Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released 
to the Consolidated income statement in the period the hedged transaction has occurred. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement on continuing commodity or financial hedges in the year (2021: £nil). Due to the use of ‘all-in-one’ 
hedges, this results in the movement in fair value for the hedged items and hedging instruments being identical.
The only source of ineffectiveness regarding the ‘all-in-one’ hedges would be if delivery of the commodities was no longer expected 
to occur, which would result in hedge accounting being discontinued. The main sources of ineffectiveness regarding financial 
contracts would be as a result of timing differences and credit risk.
The Group had a number of forward sale contracts for power relating to forecast generation from the CCGT assets that were 
designated as cash flow hedges. All subsequent fair value movements on hedges that had been discontinued were recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement. By January 2021 the Group had closed out all derivative positions in relation to the CCGT assets. 
As such, from this point, no further gains or losses occurred in relation to these trades. The remaining CCGT trades matured in the 
first half of 2022. Prior year amounts relating to these trades are included within discontinued operations, and no further gains 
or losses were recognised in the current period.
The reconciliation of the reserves and time period when the hedge will affect the Consolidated income statement are disclosed 
in note 7.3.

7.2.2 Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency rates as a result of committed and forecast transactions in foreign currencies, 
principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Generation business and principal and interest payments relating to foreign 
currency denominated debt. These fuel purchases are typically denominated in US dollars (USD), Canadian dollars (CAD) or euros 
(EUR), and the foreign currency debt is denominated in USD, CAD and EUR (see note 4.2 for further details on the Group’s borrowings).
The Group also has an exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US and Canadian subsidiaries within the 
Pellet Production business.
Foreign currency sensitivity

Profit after tax is sensitive to the strengthening or weakening of other currencies as a result of the impact on the fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. The Group designates certain foreign 
currency derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such, other components of equity are sensitive 
to the strengthening or weakening of other currencies in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements. Prior year 
foreign currency sensitivities have been restated to fully reflect the impact of option contracts and relevant strike prices, which limit 
the impact of fluctuations in underlying exchange rates.
Foreign currency risk management
It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to protect the sterling values of foreign 
currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative contracts 
in line with the currency risk management policy, including forwards and options, to manage the risks associated with its anticipated 
foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period, covering contracted exposures and a proportion of highly probable 
forecast transactions.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in USD, CAD and EUR 
(see note 4.2). The Group utilises derivative contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, to manage exchange risk on 
foreign currency debt with the exception of CAD denominated debt.

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain foreign currency exchange contracts as hedging instruments, predominantly forwards and swaps. 
Foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated as hedges are transferred from equity to inventories for hedges of fuel 
purchases when the Group takes ownership of the fuel.
Cross-currency interest rate swap gains and losses that are effective at hedging the foreign exchange risk on the interest payments 
are released to interest payable and similar charges. Gains and losses that are effective at hedging the foreign exchange risk on the 
USD or EUR principal are released to foreign exchange gains/(losses) to offset gains and losses on retranslating the USD and EUR 
denominated hedged borrowings.
The Group has taken out fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the future cash flows associated with the 
$500 million and €250 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows. The Group 
has taken out a combination of fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps in order to fix the sterling 
cash flows payable on the €126.5 million facilities agreed as part of the 2020 Infrastructure private placement facilities (see note 4.2 
for further details on borrowings).
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to foreign currency exchange contracts are timing differences and credit risk. The main 
sources of ineffectiveness relating to cross-currency interest rate swaps are differences in the critical terms, differences in repricing 
dates and credit risk.
A reconciliation of reserves and the time period when the hedge will affect the Consolidated income statement or will be removed 
from equity and included in the initial cost of the non-financial item, are disclosed in notes 7.3 and 7.4.
A summary of amounts relating to the hedging instruments, and any related ineffectiveness in the period, is presented in the table 
below. Ineffectiveness on foreign currency exchange contracts is recognised in cost of sales if it relates to hedges of fuel purchases. 
Ineffectiveness on cross-currency interest rate swaps that are hedging principal and interest payments is recognised in foreign 
exchange gains/(losses) if it relates to the principal repayment, and interest payable and similar charges if the ineffectiveness relates 
to interest payments.
There are €95 million of floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps that are hedging both foreign currency risk and interest 
rate risk. These swaps have been separated into synthetic floating-to-floating cross-currency interest rate swaps, that are hedging 
foreign currency risk, and synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps, that are hedging interest rate risk. The synthetic 
floating-to floating cross-currency interest rate swaps are disclosed in this section, and the synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest 
rate swaps are disclosed in note 7.2.3 relating to interest rate risk.
The average forward rates quoted below only reflect the rates applicable to the portion of the Group’s foreign currency hedging 
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. The rates do not reflect the overall average rate of the 
Group’s total portfolio of derivatives that are used to protect the sterling value of future cash flows.

7.2.3 Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to variable rate debt, cash and cash equivalents and the RCF, should 
it be drawn. The Group has Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments 
on the £375 million private placement issued in 2019. For the 2020 Infrastructure private placement facilities, the Group has fixed the 
interest rate payable on the £98 million of GBP denominated facilities through floating-to-fixed SONIA interest rate swaps. The Group 
had a number of GBP London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-linked derivative and non-derivative financial instruments with maturity 
dates beyond 31 December 2021, the date LIBOR ceased publication. As such, during the prior year the Group’s IBOR programme 
transitioned these financial instruments away from GBP LIBOR to SONIA.
The Group has also fixed the interest rate payable on the variable rate EUR denominated 2020 Infrastructure private placement debt 
through Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps. As detailed in section 7.2.2 
above, the floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps are hedging both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, and as 
such the disclosures relating to interest rate risk are included in this section. See note 7.2.2 for the foreign currency risk disclosures 
relating to the floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2022, the Group has fixed interest rate payments in GBP on all of its debt instruments through the use of swaps, 
with the exception of the Group’s CAD denominated debt, which is the only outstanding debt that remains variable and does not have 
fixed interest rate payments.
The returns generated on the Group’s cash balance, or payable on amounts drawn on the RCF, are exposed to movements 
in short-term interest rates. The Group actively manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in interest rates 
whilst retaining liquidity.
Further information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided 
in note 4.2.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments at the reporting date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability 
outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding for the whole year.
The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of a reasonably possible increase or decrease 
in interest rates. The analysis assumes all other variables are held constant.

(11.3)
An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect profit after tax as a result of the impact on the interest payable in the period on 
any variable rate debt. The Group has reduced its exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt through the use of floating-to-fixed 
interest rate swaps and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on profit after tax. The Group designates 
certain floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such, other components of 
equity are sensitive to an increase or decrease in interest rates in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements.
Certain amounts of the Group’s variable rate debt and interest rate swaps have a floor of 0% for the benchmark interest rate. As a 
result of very low or negative benchmark interest rates in 2021, a 100 basis point increase had a larger impact on profit after tax and 
other components of equity, than a 100 basis points decrease. Given the increase in interest rates during the year a larger decrease in 
interest rates would be needed to reach the 0% floor and therefore in the sensitivities above for the current year an increase and a 
decrease in interest rates have a more comparable impact. The Group also has CAD denominated debt that has a variable rate based 
on Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR). At 31 December 2022 no swaps were in place to hedge the CAD denominated debt. 
Therefore in relation to this debt a change in interest rates has an impact on profit after tax but not on other components of equity.
Interest rate risk management
The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to interest rate risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, 
the use of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast interest rate exposure.

7.2 Financial risk management continued
Hedge accounting
The Group designates its floating-to-fixed SONIA interest rate swaps and the floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps 
as hedging instruments against interest rate risk. The SONIA interest rate swaps are hedges of the interest payments relating to the 
£375 million private placement (2019) and the £98 million GBP facility part of the 2020 Infrastructure private placement. The cross-
currency interest rate swaps are hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk relating to the variable rate €95 million 
facility part of the 2020 Infrastructure private placement. As such this has been separated into synthetic floating-to-floating cross-
currency interest rate swaps and synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps. The synthetic floating-to-floating cross-currency 
interest rate swaps swap the €95 million variable rate EURIBOR linked debt to variable rate SONIA linked GBP debt with a principal 
of £85.8 million. The synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate then swaps the variable interest rate for a fixed GBP interest rate. 
Details of the floating-to-fixed SONIA interest rate swaps are included in the disclosures below.
Gains and losses on the interest payments on interest rate swaps are released to interest payable and similar charges at the same time 
as the interest is expensed on the hedged borrowings. 
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to interest rate risk hedges are differences in the critical terms, differences in repricing 
dates and credit risk.
A summary of the amounts relating to the sterling interest rate hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period 
is presented in the table below.

7.2.4 Inflation risk
The Group is exposed to inflation risk on elements of its revenues and cost base. The Group’s ROC revenue is linked to UK RPI and its 
CfD income is linked to UK CPI (see note 2.2 for further information on ROC and CfD income). In addition, a proportion of the Group’s 
fuel costs are linked to either US or Canadian CPI. The Group has UK CPI and RPI swaps to hedge certain revenues linked to inflation.
Inflation risk sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to inflation rates on inflation linked derivatives at the 
reporting date.
The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of a reasonably possible increase/decrease

The Group designates the UK CPI and RPI inflation swaps as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such, other 
components of equity are sensitive to the impact on inflation linked derivatives recognised in the hedge reserve of an increase or 
decrease in UK inflation rates. Profit after tax is sensitive to an increase or decrease in UK inflation rates due to the impact these rate 
changes would have on the over-hedged portion of the inflation swaps, with this impact being recognised directly in the Consolidated 
income statement. Profit after tax in 2021 was sensitive to the impact on inflation linked derivatives of an increase or decrease 
in UK inflation rates due to the impact this would have on the fair value of the unhedged UK RPI inflation swaptions.
Inflation risk management
The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to inflation risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, 
the use of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast inflation exposure.
Hedge accounting
The Group has contracts for which the revenue is contractually linked to UK CPI inflation. The Group has designated this risk 
component as a hedged item. UK CPI and UK RPI inflation swaps are utilised as the hedging instruments for these inflation risks.
Gains and losses on the inflation swaps are held in the hedge reserve and reclassified to revenue in the Consolidated income 
statement at the same time the revenue with inflation linked contracts impacts on the Consolidated income statement or if the 
hedged item is on longer expected to occur.
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to the inflation swaps are the basis point difference between the RPI swaps and the 
CPI-linked revenues they are hedging, calculation differences, and the hedged item no longer being expected to occur. Calculation 
differences occur due to differences between the reference months used to calculate the inflationary increase per the swaps and the 
reference months used to calculate the inflationary increase for the CPI-linked revenues.
During the current year, as a result of a decrease in the forecast CfD generation, the Group has recycled £39.5 million of losses on 
hedge accounted inflation linked derivative contracts to the Consolidated income statement, due to the hedged item no longer being 
expected to occur. The Group has also recognised £18.5 million of ineffectiveness due to the basis difference between the RPI hedging 
instruments and the CPI exposure.

7.2.5 Liquidity risk
The Treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board. 
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains 
a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding 
for business requirements.
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items, 
principally those related to ROC sales and Customers’ power sales. In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis and, 
accordingly, the ROC assets and other items are derecognised from the Consolidated balance sheet at the point of sale. The Group also 
utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on time. The impact on the 
Group’s cash flows is described in note 4.3.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include 
both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest payments or receipts are floating rate, the undiscounted amount 
is derived from interest rate curves at the reporting date.

Interest payments are calculated based on forward interest rates estimated at the reporting date using publicly available information.
The weighted average interest rate payable at the reporting date on the Group’s borrowings was 4.14% (2021: 3.49%).
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial liabilities which are marked-to-market. 
Where the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, 
foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates or interest rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the 
reporting date. Where derivatives are expected to be gross settled, the gross cash flows have been presented. Commodity contracts 
and vanilla foreign currency exchange contracts are expected to be gross settled. Where derivatives are expected to be net settled, 
the undiscounted net cash flows expected to occur based on the current fair value have been disclosed. Financial contracts and other 
foreign exchange contracts (excluding forwards and swaps) are expected to be net settled. Interest rate contracts and inflation rate 
contracts are presented based on net settlement of the interest rate and inflation rate differentials. Gross settlement of both the 
interest and principal on cross-currency interest rate swaps is expected and as such this element of the swap is presented gross.

7.2.6 Credit risk
The Group’s gross exposure to credit risk for financial instruments is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised 
at the reporting date, as summarised below:
As at 31 December
2022 
£m
2021 
£m
Financial assets:
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.1)

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables of £60.9 million 
(2021: £46.6 million), expected credit losses on accrued income of £7.6 million (2021: £8.6 million) and contingent consideration 
of £27.4 million (2021: £27.7 million). The balance excludes non-financial receivables such as prepayments.
The Group‘s three reportable segments (Pellet Production, Generation and Customers) are exposed to different levels and 
concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers.
The Pellet Production segment sells biomass pellets both intra-group and to external parties. Credit risk for the Group relates to the 
sales made to external parties. The majority of the Pellet Production segment’s external sales are with large utility customers in Europe 
and Asia. The Pellet Production segment manages its credit risk by reviewing individual sales contracts, considering the length of the 
contract and assessing the credit quality of counterparties prior to signing contracts and throughout the duration of contracts.
For the Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as the sale of by-products 
from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category 
of credit rating. Counterparty credit exposures are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce 
credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs 
a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of Parent Company guarantee, deeds of charge, cash 
collateral, letters of credit and surety bonds. The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related 
energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit 
default swaps.
The highest credit risk exposure is in the Customers segment, with a large number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety 
of markets. In particular, its SME customers carry lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk, owing to a customer base 
comprised of smaller retail and commercial entities. Credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial 
strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. 
Further details on the impact of credit risk on trade and other receivables is disclosed in note 3.5. 
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds 
are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those 
funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements and 
maximum investments with any one counterparty based on their rating and the maturity profile.
Whilst cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss 
was immaterial.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on derivative contracts, to which the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are not applied as the 
fair value requirements of IFRS 13 are applicable. The carrying amount of these financial assets, disclosed above, represents the 
Group’s maximum credit risk exposure.

Financial statements
7.2 Financial risk management continued
Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third-party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of currency, biomass pellets and other goods 
and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. For financial instruments this risk is limited 
to the credit risk, as discussed above. The Group is also exposed to counterparty risk on non-financial instruments, such as the 
purchases of biomass and capital expenditure. If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its 
contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers. 
The Group enters into purchase and sale contracts for a wider variety of goods and services, for example the sale of power 
to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations may 
cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group. The Group has acceptance procedures in place to ensure 
the counterparties the Group contracts with are appropriate. The Group also has limits in place, and actively monitors its exposures 
to individual counterparties to minimise this risk.
Capital management
The Group is disciplined in its management of capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern; maintain a strong credit rating 
underpinned by robust financial metrics; invest in its core business and pay a sustainable and growing dividend whilst maximising 
the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus Net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings, 
cash and cash equivalents attributable to owners of the Parent Company and is inclusive of the impact of associated hedging 
instruments as disclosed in note 2.7.
See note 4.2 for details of loan covenants, and the Viability statement on page 75 for details of scenario analysis performed 
on covenant restrictions of the Group’s financing facilities.

7.3 Hedge reserve
The Group designates certain hedging instruments that are used to address commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate 
risk and inflation rate risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and 
hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing 
basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash 
flows of the hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the 
hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.
The table below details the gains and (losses) recognised in the current and prior year on hedging instruments, the amounts 
reclassified from equity due to the hedged item affecting the Consolidated income statement, and the amounts reclassified due to the 
hedged future cash flows no longer being expected to occur. See section 7.2 for further details on these amounts.

7.4 Cost of hedging reserve
The Group allocates unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of hedge accounted foreign currency derivative contracts 
to a cost of hedging reserve in accordance with IFRS 9.
A large proportion of the derivative contracts held relate to foreign currency exchange contracts, including forward contracts, 
options and swaps. Consistent with prior periods, for foreign currency exchange contracts to which the Group has applied hedge 
accounting, the Group has continued to designate the change in the spot rate as the hedged risk in the Group’s cash flow hedge 
relationships. The Group designates the cost of hedging – being the change in fair value associated with forward points including 
currency basis – to equity. All amounts within the cost of hedging reserve relate to foreign currency exchange risk.
The table below details the cost of hedging gains or (losses) recognised in the year on hedging instruments and the amounts

legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously. The Group also has financial assets and liabilities with certain counterparties that are subject to 
master netting agreements. Some financial assets and liabilities do not meet the criteria for offsetting at the reporting date but are 
subject to an enforceable master netting agreement that in certain circumstances, such as a bankruptcy, would allow for the amounts 
to be offset and a single net amount payable.
The table below shows the impact if the carrying amounts that are subject to these master netting agreements were offset:

The aforementioned collateral assets and liabilities are recorded in other receivables and other payables respectively, see note 4.3.
7.6 Contingent assets and liabilities
Contingent assets are potential future inflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of the Group. 
The amount or timing of any receipt is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of the 
Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Guarantees
In addition to the amounts drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number 
of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2022, the Group’s 
contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued amounted to £85.9 million (2021: £74.4 million), of which £46.0 million 
(2021: £74.4 million) was issued under the RCF.
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £202.0 million 
(2021: £142.1 million).
Collateral is sometimes required to be provided in relation to the Group’s commodity and treasury trading activities. When derivative 
positions are out of the money for the Group, collateral may be required to be provided to the counterparty. These positions reverse 
when contracts are settled, and the collateral is returned. The Group has access to certain facilities to enable it to cover collateral 
requirements to counterparties through letters of credit or surety bonds.
The letters of credit and surety bond figures above include amounts utilised to cover commodity trading collateral requirements 
of £54.5 million (2021: £42.5 million) and £165.0 million (2021: £107.1 million) respectively. See note 4.1 for details on net cash collateral 
the Group has paid to or received from counterparties.
Contingent liabilities
Smart meter targets
In late February 2023, the Group received notice from Ofgem that its failure to fully achieve installation targets for Smart Meter 
installations in the Opus Energy business during 2022 had been referred to Ofgem’s Enforcement team. They will consider this matter 
in due course and make a decision on any future action. No amount has been provided in respect of this matter in the Consolidated 
financial statements, given the early stage of the process and the uncertainty in future outcome. 
Contingent assets
Billing system
Drax Energy Solutions Limited has lodged a claim against a supplier for damages caused by the supplier’s misrepresentation and failure 
to perform under a contract for delivery of a new billing system. The directors have considered the potential legal outcomes of the 
claim with external professional advisors and believe that a favourable outcome is probable. However, a contingent asset is disclosed 
rather than a receivable recognised at 31 December 2022, as receipt of the amount is dependent on the outcome of the claim and 
therefore it is not virtually certain to be received.

7.7 Commitments
The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not 
recorded in the Consolidated balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the 
future purchase of sustainable biomass, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily 
for the delivery of sustainable biomass pellets for use in electricity generation at Drax Power Station. To the extent these contracts 
relate to the purchase of biomass pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing as they are not within the 
scope of IFRS 9, and are therefore not required to be measured at fair value. See the Critical accounting judgements section in the 
Basis of preparation for further details on this judgement.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC).
The principal activity of the Company is being the ultimate Parent Company of the Drax Group plc group of companies.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
The Company applied certain new and amended standards for the first time in 2022. The full list of standards adopted is set out 
in the Consolidated financial statements in note 8.2. These updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Company.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation 
to presentation of a cash flow statement, financial instruments, share-based payments, capital risk management, standards not 
yet effective and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Consolidated financial 
statements.
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are summarised below and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where relevant, provision for impairment.
Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records amounts by which the proceeds from issuing shares 
exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 are met, in which case 
the difference is recorded in retained profits.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company applies the impairment model in IFRS 9 to provide for expected credit losses on its financial assets including amounts 
due from other Group companies and other financial assets. The provision for impairment of amounts owed by Group companies is 
measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. If there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a 12-month expected credit loss provision 
is recognised.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies
There were no critical accounting judgements made in preparation of the Company’s financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
There were no areas of significant estimation uncertainty within the Company’s financial statements. 
4. Profit and loss account
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021. The Company’s financial statements were approved by the Board 
on 22 February 2023. The net profit attributable to the Company is £186.5 million (2021: £78.1 million).
The Company received dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings totalling £185.0 million in 2022 (2021: £80.0 million).
The Company has no employees other than the Directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and a proportion 
was recharged to the Company.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2022 was £26,078 
(2021: £23,774).

8. Distributable reserves
The Company considers its distributable reserves to be comprised of the retained profits, less credits in respect of share schemes, 
less treasury shares, with a total value of £306.3 million (2021: £198.7 million). Accordingly, the Company considers itself to have 
sufficient distributable profits from which to pay the current proposed final dividend for 2022 of approximately £50 million. Based 
on a total dividend for 2022 of approximately £84 million, the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay three years of 
dividend at the current level without generating further distributable profits. In addition to its own reserves, the Company has access 
to the distributable reserves of its subsidiary undertakings with which future dividend payments can be funded (see note 2.10 to the 
Consolidated financial statements for additional information).
The Company is dependent upon its subsidiaries for the provision of cash with which to make dividend payments. The Group has 
sufficient cash resources with which to meet the proposed dividend (see note 4.1 to the Consolidated financial statements for 
additional information).
9. Contingent liabilities
The Company has provided unsecured guarantees to third parties in respect of contracts held by subsidiary companies. 
The guarantees have been issued for £nil consideration and the Company has not charged the subsidiaries for the guarantees.
The Company has provided guarantees over the liabilities of its subsidiaries that have taken advantage of the audit exemption 
available in section 479A of the Companies Act 2006. The list of subsidiaries who have taken this exemption can be found in note 5.
The possibility of an economic outflow in relation to the above guarantees is considered remote.
The Company has granted a charge over the assets of certain subsidiaries, in respect of the Group’s borrowings (detailed in note 4.2 
to the Consolidated financial statements), which is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the subsidiary undertakings of the 
Company that is party to the security arrangement. The Company itself is not a guarantor of the Group’s borrowings.

resources/equity-investors-faq/.
Tax on dividends
Below is a brief summary of the guidance provided by HMRC as it relates to the current tax year. If you are in any doubt as to the 
impact on your personal circumstances, you are recommended to seek your own financial advice from a professional adviser 
authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
There is a tax-free Dividend Allowance of £2,000 per annum in the 2022-2023 tax year (2021-2022: £2,000) This means that there 
is no tax to pay on the first £2,000 of dividend income, no matter what non-dividend income a shareholder may have. Dividends paid 
on shares held within pensions and ISAs are tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income of more than £2,001 but less than £10,000 are required to notify 
HMRC that they have this source of income. 
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income of more than £10,001 are required to file a self-assessment 
return with HMRC. 
The above requirements apply to Share Incentive Plan participants receiving cash dividends on their plan shares.
Further information and updates on tax on dividends can be found on the Gov.UK website at www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends
Beneficial owners and information rights
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, receive 
information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. In order for this to happen, you must contact the third-party 
registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications by beneficial owners of shares where the shares are held by 
third-party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder and not to Drax or Equiniti.
ShareGift
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing 
to dispose charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no capital 
gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. Further information 
can be obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org.

Shareholder information
Share frauds (boiler room scams)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message in the correspondence, 
claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. At the time of this report, the Company 
was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such as those outlined are usually made 
by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. Below is the advice from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out 
to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, 
if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud:
• Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
• Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
• Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
• Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
• Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call them back.
• Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
• Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.
• Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service  
or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
• Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, 
where you can find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Alternative performance measures (APMs) glossary table
The measures described below are used throughout the Annual report and accounts and are measures that are not defined within 
IFRS but provide additional information about financial performance and position that is used by the Board to evaluate the Group’s 
trading performance. These measures have been defined internally and may therefore not be comparable to APMs presented by other 
companies. Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself 
a measure defined under IFRS. Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent IFRS measure.

Purpose

Adjusted results
Total results
The Group’s Adjusted results are consistent 
with the way Executive management and 
the Board assess the performance of the 
Group. Adjusted results are intended to 
reflect the underlying trading performance 
of the Group’s businesses and are 
presented to assist users of the financial 
statements in evaluating the Group’s 
trading performance and performance 
against strategic objectives 
on a consistent basis.
Adjusted results excludes exceptional items 
and certain remeasurements.
Exceptional items are those transactions 
that, by their nature, do not reflect the 
trading performance of the Group in  
the period.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair 
value gains and losses that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting. The Group regards 
all of its forward contracting activity to 
represent economic hedges and therefore 
by excluding the volatility caused by 
recognising fair value gains and losses prior 
to maturity of the contracts, the Group can 
reflect these contracts at the contracted 
prices on maturity, reflecting the intended 
purpose of entering these contracts and 
the Group’s underlying performance.
Adjusted results are the metrics used 
in the calculation of Adjusted basic and 
Adjusted diluted EPS.
Total results measured in accordance with 
IFRS excluding the impact of exceptional 
items and certain remeasurements 
(defined in note 2.7).
Adjusted EBITDA 
Operating profit(1)
Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure 
used by Executive management and the 
Board to assess the financial performance 
of the Group as it provides a more 
comparable assessment of the Group’s 
year-on-year trading performance. 
It is also a key metric used by the investor 
community to assess the performance 
of the Group’s operations.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, gains or losses on 
disposal of assets, fair value adjustments 
on contingent consideration, and 
impairment of non-current assets, 
excluding the impact of exceptional items 
and certain remeasurements (defined 
in note 2.7). Adjusted EBITDA excludes 
any earnings from associates and 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to 
non-controlling interests.
Adjusted EBITDA is stated from both 
continuing operations and discontinued 
operations, where appropriate.
Adjusted basic EPS
Basic EPS
Adjusted basic EPS represents the 
amount of Adjusted earnings 
(Adjusted post-tax earnings) attributable 
to each ordinary share.
Adjusted basic EPS is calculated by 
dividing the Group’s Adjusted earnings 
attributable to the owners of the Parent 
Company (Adjusted profit after tax) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period.

Adjusted diluted  
EPS
Diluted EPS
Adjusted diluted EPS demonstrates the 
impact upon the Adjusted basic EPS if all 
outstanding share options, that are 
expected to vest on their future maturity 
dates and where the shares are considered 
to be dilutive, were exercised and treated 
as ordinary shares as at the reporting date.
Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated by 
dividing the Group’s Adjusted earnings 
attributable to the owners of the Parent 
Company (Adjusted profit after tax) by 
the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period and 
dilutive potential ordinary shares under 
share plans.
Net debt
Borrowings less cash 
and cash equivalents
Net debt is a key measure of the Group’s 
liquidity and its ability to manage 
current obligations.
Net debt is used as a basis by debt rating 
agencies and in the calculation of the 
Group’s financial covenant requirements.
The impact of hedging instruments 
included within Net debt shows the 
economic substance of the Net debt 
position, in terms of actual expected 
future cash flows to settle that debt.
Total borrowings including the impact of 
hedging instruments less cash and cash 
equivalents. Total borrowings include 
external financial debt, such as loan notes, 
term loans and amounts drawn in cash 
under revolving credit facilities but 
excludes other financial liabilities such as 
lease liabilities calculated in accordance 
with IFRS 16 (see note 3.2), pension 
obligations (see note 6.3) and trade and 
other payables (see note 3.7). Net debt 
excludes the proportion of cash and 
borrowings in non-wholly owned entities 
that would be attributable to the non-
controlling interests.
Net debt includes the impact of hedging 
instruments meaning that any borrowings 
that have hedging instruments in place 
are adjusted to reflect those borrowings 
at the hedged rate.
Net debt to 
Adjusted EBITDA  
ratio
Borrowings less cash 
and cash equivalents 
divided by operating 
profit
The Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is 
a debt ratio that gives an indication of how 
many years it would take the Group to pay 
back its debt if Net debt and Adjusted 
EBITDA are held constant.
The Group has a long-term target for 
Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of around 
2.0 times.
Net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. 
Expressed as a multiple.
Cash and 
committed facilities
Cash and cash

This is a key measure of the Group’s 
available liquidity and the Group’s ability 
to manage its current obligations.
It shows the value of cash available 
to the Group in a short period of time.
Total cash and cash equivalents plus 
the value of the Group’s committed but 
undrawn facilities (including the Group’s 
RCFs, loan facilities and the Customers 
trade receivable factoring facility).
Cost of production
Cost of sales
A key metric showing the cost of 
produced biomass. 
Also, a key metric in monitoring the 
Group’s strategy to reduce biomass costs.
Costs of sales attributable to biomass 
production plus an allocation of operating 
expenses not directly attributable to 
biomass production, divided by tonnes 
of biomass produced.
Expressed as a cost per tonne produced.
Capital expenditure
Property, plant and 
equipment (PPE) 
additions and

Used to show the Group’s total spend 
on PPE and intangible assets in a year.
PPE additions plus intangible 
asset additions.

Biogenic carbon cycle
Biogenic refers to something that is produced by, or originates 
from, a living organism. The biogenic carbon cycle is the natural 
process of plants and animals releasing CO2 into the atmosphere 
through respiration and decomposition, and plants absorbing CO2 
via photosynthesis. 
Biomass 
Organic material of non-fossil origin, including organic waste, that 
can be converted into bioenergy through combustion. The Group 
uses low-grade roundwood, sawmill residues and forest residues 
in the form of compressed wood pellets, to generate electricity 
at Drax Power station or sell the pellets to third-parties.

sustainable forest management. It happens when most (or all) 
trees in an area are harvested simultaneously. It is a 
well-established forestry practice in many regions, including 
the UK, Europe and North America. 
Contracts for Difference (CfD) 
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity 
generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for generators 
at a fixed price level known as the ‘strike price’. Generators will 
receive revenue from selling their electricity into the market as 
usual, however, when the market reference price is below the 
strike price, they also receive a top-up payment for the additional 
amount. Conversely, if the reference price is above the strike 
price, the generator must pay back the difference. 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) 
A form of highly efficient energy generation technology that 
combines a gas-fired turbine with a steam turbine. 
Dispatchable power
An electricity generator produces dispatchable power when 
the power can be ramped up and down, or switched on or off, 
at short notice to provide a flexible response to changes 
in electricity demand. Biomass, pumped storage, coal, oil, and 
gas electricity generation can meet these criteria and hence 
can be dispatchable power sources. Nuclear can be dispatched 
against an agreed schedule but is not flexible. Wind and solar 
electricity cannot be scheduled and hence are not Dispatchable. 
An electricity system requires sufficient dispatchable power 
to operate and remain safe.

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023
Proposed new Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy)
The Policy sets out the Company’s forward-looking policy on Directors’ remuneration and is subject to a binding shareholder vote by 
ordinary resolution at least once every three years. Drax has continued to evolve since the last full review of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in 2020.
To ensure that our approach to remuneration supports the strategy, in 2022 the Remuneration Committee undertook a full review 
of the existing policy, taking into account the Group’s ambitious growth strategy, shareholder feedback on the current policy, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and wider best practice. Our principal aims are to ensure that executive pay is closely linked to Group 
performance, underpins our purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and aligns reward with delivering 
the strategy.
Following this review, we are inviting you to approve our proposed new Policy this year, further details of which can be found on pages 
135 to 146 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Action to be taken
Ordinary shareholders
Whether or not you propose to attend the AGM in person or online, you are requested to:
(a)  complete and sign the enclosed Form of Proxy in accordance with the instructions printed thereon. Completed Forms of Proxy 
should be returned to Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA as soon as possible and in 
any event so as to be received by Equiniti Limited no later than 12.30pm on Monday 24 April 2023; or
(b)  register the appointment of your proxy electronically at www.sharevote.co.uk. You will need your Voting ID, Task ID and 
Shareholder Reference Number (this is the series of numbers printed on your Form of Proxy). Alternatively, if you have already 
registered with Equiniti’s online portfolio service, Shareview, you can submit your Form of Proxy at www.shareview.co.uk using 
your usual user ID and password. Full instructions are given on both websites and your Form of Proxy must be received by no later 
than 12.30pm on Monday 24 April 2023.
If you hold shares in CREST you may appoint a proxy by completing and transmitting a CREST proxy instruction to Equiniti Limited 
(CREST participant ID RA19) so that it is received by no later than 12.30pm on Monday 24 April 2023.
The return of a completed Form of Proxy will not prevent you from attending and voting at the AGM in person or online should you 
choose to do so.
Voting arrangements
Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM will be by poll so that all votes are included whether or not the shareholder 
is able to attend the meeting.
The results of the voting at the meeting will be announced to the London Stock Exchange as soon as practicable following the meeting 
and will also appear on the Company’s website www.drax.com/investors/announcements-events-reports/regulatory-news-alerts/.
The Company has included on the Form of Proxy a ‘Vote withheld’ option in order for shareholders to abstain from voting on any 
particular Resolution. You should note, however, that a ‘Vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not be counted in determining the 
proportion of votes cast ‘For’ and ‘Against’ a Resolution on a poll.
Recommendation
The Directors of the Company consider that the Resolutions to be put to shareholders at the AGM are in the best interests of the 
Company and its members as a whole.
Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of all the proposed Resolutions as they intend to do so 
in respect of their own beneficial interests.
Yours sincerely
Philip Cox CBE 
Chair

A summary of the key changes to the Policy are highlighted 
below. For further information on the proposed Policy, please see 
pages 136 to 146 of the Annual Report and Accounts.

Summary of changes
Rationale
Base salary
• Adopt consistent wording for the ability to move base 
salaries to the market rate where Executive Directors 
are either (i) an external appointment made on a 
below market base salary; or (ii) an internal promotion 
on a below market base salary.
• The change aligns Drax with standard FTSE 350 
market practice. The default base salary increase 
for Executive Directors remains an increase up 
to the rate typically applied to the workforce. 
Where the quantum increase exceeds the norm, 
an explanation will be provided by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonus
• Simplifying the wording on the choice of performance 
metrics. The majority of the annual bonus must still be 
earned based on performance against financial 
targets as opposed to the current approach that 
defined a set percentage of the bonus (60%) as being 
subject to financial targets.
• Simplification of current approach to that part of 
annual bonus which is deferred in shares. The change 
will specify that 40% of any annual bonus earned is 
deferred into the Company’s shares. This approach 
replaces the prevailing more complex approach 
whereby 100% of any bonus earned against strategic 
targets takes place subject to 40% of the total bonus 
outcome being deferred.
• Removal of the two-year holding period on deferred 
bonus shares so that any deferred shares that vest 
will be released at the end of the three-year vesting 
period. These shares will need to continue to be 
held (as a minimum on a net of tax basis) until the 
Company’s share ownership guidelines have 
been met.
• The changes to the operation of the annual 
bonus plan align Drax with standard FTSE 350 
market practice.
• Requiring at least half the bonus to be subject 
to financial targets provides greater flexibility 
for the Remuneration Committee in operating 
the annual bonus plan and mirrors standard 
market practice.
• The current approach to bonus deferral was 
overly complex with differing proportions of the 
parts of the bonus subject to financial and 
strategic targets taking place dependent upon 
the level of bonus earned against each measure. 
This was administratively complex with the 
change simplifying the deferral process.
• Deferring a proportion of any bonus into shares 
which vest at a future date is standard practice. 
Holding periods are not typically applied to  
deferred share bonus awards at the point of 
release. To note, the holding period will continue 
to apply to shares vesting under the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP). The change brings the 
Company into line with standard FTSE 350 
market practice.
Pension
• The policy is being updated to reference that 
Executive Director pensions are now aligned with the 
rate typically provided to the UK wider workforce for 
new joiners at 10% of base salary.
• The change conforms the policy with institutional 
investors best practice expectations with 
Executive Director pensions being reduced to the 
rate typically provided to the UK wider workforce 
of 10% from their prior rates of 20% (CEO) and 
16% (CFO) of base salary.

Summary of changes
Rationale
LTIP
• The overall LTIP structure remains the same.
• N/a
Non-Executive 
Directors
• The changes to the current Policy provide flexibility 
for the Company to provide a limited range of benefits 
and travel allowances to Non-Executive Directors.
• The Policy will also specify that the default is to 
increase Non-Executive Directors’ base fees at a 
rate that is up to the rate typically applied to the 
UK wider workforce
• The changes to the Non-Executive Directors’ 
Policy mirror standard practice for FTSE 350 
companies with an international footprint.
• The ability to provide a limited range of benefits 
and allowances will ensure that Drax has the 
flexibility to appoint international Non-Executive 
Directors of an appropriate calibre to support 
Drax through the next phase of its development. 
The change will enable Drax to provide support to 
Non-Executive Directors (specifically from 
outside the UK) in relation to initial set up and 
ongoing support with filing tax returns such that 
this is cost neutral to the individual.
• Introducing the ability to increase Non-Executive 
Director fees up to the rate of increase awarded 
to the wider workforce brings the Company’s 
Policy into line with standard market practice.
If Resolution 3 is approved, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy will be effective immediately following the meeting. 
If shareholders do not approve the revised Remuneration Policy 
for any reason, the Company will continue to make payments 
to Directors and former Directors (in their capacity as Directors) 
under the existing Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved 
on the 22 April 2020 and will seek shareholder approval for 
a revised policy at the 2024 AGM.
Resolution 4
To approve the final dividend
Resolution 4 seeks shareholder approval to pay the final dividend 
of 12.6 pence per ordinary share, which is recommended by the 
Directors for payment to those shareholders who are on the 
Register of the Company at 6.30pm on 21 April 2023. If approved 
by shareholders at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid 
on 19 May 2023.
Resolutions 5 to 13
To re-elect the Directors
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, and in 
line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), each of the Directors will retire and offer 
themselves for re-election by shareholders.
The skills and experience for each of the Directors are set out in 
Part F of this Notice (and on pages 97 to 99 of the Annual Report 
and Accounts).
The Board has determined that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors being proposed for re-election are independent 
in character and judgement, and there are no relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, 
their independence.
During 2022, the Board completed an externally-led evaluation of 
the performance of both the Board as a whole and of individual 
Directors. Following that evaluation, the Chair is satisfied that the 
performance of each Director standing for re-election continues 
to be effective and that each Director continues to demonstrate 
commitment to the role. A separate assessment of the 
performance of the Chair was conducted, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, which concluded that the performance 
of the Chair continues to be effective, and the Chair continues 
to demonstrate commitment to the role and has the time required 
to devote to the performance of the function of Chair. More 
information about this can be found on pages 107 and 108 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolutions 14 and 15
Re-appointment of auditor and determination of their 
remuneration
The Company must appoint or re-appoint an auditor at every 
general meeting at which accounts are presented and it is 
normal practice for the Company’s Directors, acting through 
the Audit Committee, to be authorised to determine the 
auditor’s remuneration.
The Board further recommend that Deloitte LLP be appointed as 
auditor of the Company for the year ending 31 December 2023. 
Deloitte LLP has advised its willingness to continue in office as 
auditor of the Company.
Resolution 16
Political donations and expenditure
Part 14 of the CA 2006 contains restrictions on companies 
making political donations or incurring political expenditure.
Drax is a politically neutral organisation and did not make any 
political donations or incur any political expenditure (within the 
ordinary meaning of those words) in 2022.
It is not the policy of the Company to make donations to political 
parties, and the Directors have no intention of changing that 
policy. However, the CA 2006 defines political donations and 
political expenditure terms very widely. This means that activities 
that form part of the normal relationship between the Company 
and bodies concerned with policy review, law reform and other 
business matters affecting the Company, which might not be 
thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could 
require shareholders’ consent under the CA 2006.
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM continued
 
 
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023 
7
In view of the broad wording adopted in the CA 2006, and the 
Board’s wish to avoid any inadvertent infringement of it, it is 
seeking shareholders’ consent for the Company, and any wholly 
owned subsidiary company, to incur total annual expenditure for 
such purposes, provided that the aggregate amount of any such 
donations and expenditure shall not exceed £125,000, in order 
that the Company may continue to engage with regulators and 
policymakers without inadvertently breaching the applicable 
legislation. Further information on how the Company engaged 
with political parties in 2022 can be found on pages 29 and 160 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts, and the Political Engagement 
Policy is available on our website at www.drax.com/about-us/
corporate-governance/compliance-and-policies/drax-political-
engagement-policy/.
It is the intention that the Company will seek to renew this 
authority, if appropriate, at each subsequent AGM.
Resolution 17
Authority of Directors to allot shares
Resolution 17 seeks renewal of the Directors’ authority to allot 
shares, as required under Section 551 CA 2006. Upon the passing 
of Resolution 17, the Directors will have authority (pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of the Resolution) to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £15,444,255, which is approximately one-third 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares) as at 1 March 2023 (being the latest practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice). This authority will 
expire immediately following the AGM in 2024 or on 30 June 
2024, whichever is the earlier.
In addition, in accordance with the Investment Association Share 
Capital Management Guidelines (which set out the expectations 
of institutional investors in relation to, among other things, the 
authority of Directors to allot shares), upon the passing of 
Resolution 17, the Directors will have authority (pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of the Resolution) to allot ordinary shares in 
connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders 
up to a maximum nominal value of £30,888,510, as reduced by 
the nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph (a) of 
Resolution 17.
This amount (before any reduction in respect of issuances under 
paragraph (a)) represents approximately two-thirds of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 1 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date 
before the publication of this Notice). This authority will also 
expire immediately following the AGM in 2024 or on 30 June 
2024, whichever is the earlier. In line with guidance issued by the 
Investment Association, Resolution 17 will give the Directors 
authority to allot ordinary shares representing up to 
approximately two-thirds of the Company’s current issued share 
capital pursuant to a rights issue.
The Directors will continue to seek to renew these authorities at 
each AGM, in accordance with current best practice from time to 
time. The Directors have no current plans to exercise this authority, 
except in connection with employee share plans, but consider 
it prudent to have the flexibility that this authority provides.
As at 1 March 2023, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this Notice, the Company held 13,841,295 treasury 
shares, which represented 3.34% of the Company’s issued share 
capital at that date.
Resolution 18
General disapplication of pre-emption rights
If the Directors wish to exercise the authority granted under 
Resolution 17 and offer shares (or sell any shares which the 
Company may purchase and elect to hold as treasury shares) for 
cash, the CA 2006 requires that, unless shareholders have given 
specific authority for the waiver of their statutory pre-emption 
rights, the new shares must be offered first to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. In 
certain circumstances, it may be in the best interests of the 
Company to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) for 
cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 18 will authorise the Directors to do this by allowing 
the Directors to allot shares for cash: (i) by way of a rights issue 
(subject to certain exclusions); (ii) by way of an open offer or other 
offer of securities (not being a rights issue) in favour of existing 
shareholders in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to 
their shareholdings (subject to certain exclusions) and (iii) 
otherwise than under (i) or (ii), up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £4,633,277 which is equivalent to approximately 10% of the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury 
shares) on 1 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this Notice). The Resolution also applies to 
the sale and re-issue of ordinary shares held as treasury shares by 
the Company. As at 1 March 2023, being the latest practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice, the Company held 
13,841,295 treasury shares.
The authority sought is in line with institutional shareholder 
guidance, including the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of 
Principles as revised in November 2022 (the Statement of 
Principles). The Directors acknowledge the provisions of the 
Statement of Principles and confirm that the Board will follow the 
general principles set out therein.
If approved by the shareholders, the authority contained in 
Resolution 18 will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
AGM in 2024 or on 30 June 2024. The Directors intend to renew 
such power at successive AGMs, in accordance with current 
best practice.
The Directors have no current plans to exercise this authority but 
consider it prudent to preserve maximum flexibility for the future 
whilst ensuring that existing shareholders’ interests are protected 
in line with institutional investor body guidance.
Resolution 19
Additional disapplication of pre-emption rights
Resolution 19 authorises the Directors to allot new shares (or sell 
treasury shares) for cash, without the shares first being offered 
to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings, 
in addition to the authority set out in Resolution 18, in connection 
with the financing (or refinancing, if the authority is to be used 
within 12 months of the original transaction) of an acquisition 
or specified capital investment which is announced 
contemporaneously with the allotment or which has taken place 
in the preceding 12-month period and is disclosed in the 
announcement of the allotment.

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM continued
The authority under Resolution 19 is limited to an aggregate 
nominal value of £4,633,277 which is equivalent to approximately 
10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
(excluding treasury shares) on 1 March 2023 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice).
The Resolution also applies to the sale and re-issue of ordinary 
shares held as treasury shares by the Company. As at 1 March 
2023, being the latest practicable date before the publication 
of this Notice, the Company held 13,841,295 treasury shares. 
The authority sought is in line with institutional shareholder 
guidance, including the Statement of Principles. The Directors 
acknowledge the provisions of the Statement of Principles 
and confirm that the Board will follow the general principles 
set out therein.
If approved by the shareholders, the authority contained in 
Resolution 19 will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
AGM in 2024 or on 30 June 2024. The Directors intend to renew 
such power at successive AGMs, in accordance with current 
best practice.
As with Resolution 18, the Directors have no current plans to 
exercise this authority, but consider it prudent to preserve 
maximum flexibility for the future whilst ensuring that existing 
shareholders’ interests are protected in line with institutional 
investor body guidance.
Resolutions 18 and 19 have been separated in accordance with 
the guidance issued by the Pre-Emption Group.
Resolution 20
To authorise the Company to purchase its own shares 
Resolution 20 is to authorise the Company to buy back up to 
40,108,970 ordinary shares. The authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the 2024 AGM or, if earlier, on 30 June 2024. 
The Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent 
AGMs in accordance with current best practice.
Resolution 20 specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares 
which may be purchased (representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 1 March 2023) and the 
maximum and minimum prices at which they may be bought, 
exclusive of expenses, reflecting the requirements of the 
CA 2006 and the Listing Rules.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this 
authority, other than in relation to employee share plans or where 
it is considered appropriate in order to return value to 
shareholders. The granting of this authority should not be taken 
to imply that any ordinary shares will be purchased. Except in 
relation to the above, no purchase of ordinary shares will be made 
unless it is expected that the effect will be to increase earnings 
per share and the Directors consider it to be in the best interests 
of shareholders.
Under the CA 2006, the Company is allowed to hold its own 
shares in treasury following a buy back, instead of having to 
cancel them. This gives the Company the ability to re-issue 
treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively (including pursuant 
to the authority under Resolution 17 above) and provides the 
Company with additional flexibility in the management of its 
capital base. The Company currently holds 13,841,295 shares in 
treasury following a buy back programme between April 2018 
and January 2019.
Such shares may be re-sold for cash but all rights attaching to 
them, including voting rights and any right to receive dividends, 
are suspended whilst they are held in treasury. If the Directors 
exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 20, the Directors 
intend to hold such shares in treasury, but will assess which 
option to pursue at the relevant time and form a decision.
The total number of options to subscribe for, and awards over, 
shares, outstanding at 1 March 2023, being the last practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice was 16,761,392. This 
represents approximately 4.18% of the issued share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) at that date. If the Company was to 
buy back the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted 
pursuant to this Resolution then the total number of options to 
subscribe for ordinary shares, outstanding at 1 March 2023, 
would represent approximately 4.64% of the reduced share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) at that date.
Of the total share options outstanding as at 1 March 2023 
(16,761,392), an aggregate number of approximately 9.7m are 
expected to vest in 2023 under the Company’s various share 
plans. This includes approximately 6.8m under the all UK-
employee Sharesave Plan which matures in June 2023 when the 
three year savings contract period concludes for approximately 
900 participating employees. More information on outstanding 
awards and associated share-based payments can be found in 
note 6.2 to the Consolidated financial statements in the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022.
Resolution 21
To allow general meetings to be held on 14 clear days’ notice in 
certain circumstances
Resolution 21 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold general 
meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice.
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations state that the notice period 
required for general meetings of the Company is 21 clear days, 
unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which 
cannot, however, be less than 14 clear days. AGMs will continue 
to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
In order to preserve the Company’s ability to call general 
meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice, Resolution 
21 seeks such approval. The shorter notice period would not be 
used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the 
flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought 
to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
The CA 2006 requires that, in order to be able to call a general 
meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company must 
make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders 
for that meeting. The Company provides this facility currently 
and would do so at any such meeting (see Part D of this document 
for the Company’s arrangements for electronic voting).

AGM either in person or online using the Lumi AGM platform. 
The doors of the AGM venue will open at 12.00pm and the 
AGM will start promptly at 12.30pm. Please bring the 
Attendance Card which is attached to the Form of Proxy with 
you if you attend the meeting in person. It will authenticate 
your right to attend, speak and vote and will speed up your 
admission to the meeting. You may also be asked to provide 
proof of identity. If you do not have your Attendance Card, 
you may be asked to provide two forms of identity (which 
may require photo identity and verification of your address). 
If you have been appointed as a proxy for a shareholder 
entitled to vote and you attend the AGM in person, please let 
the admission staff know. You should bring proof of identity 
with you and you will be asked to confirm the details of the 
shareholder you are representing. Further details on how you 
can join us online using the Lumi AGM platform are set out in 
Appendix 1 of this Notice.
2. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 (as amended) and for the purposes of 
Section 360B CA 2006, the Company specifies that only 
those shareholders registered on the Register at 6.30pm on 
the day two business days before the date of the meeting (the 
Specified Time) (or if the meeting is adjourned to a time more 
than 48 hours after the Specified Time, by 6.30pm on the day 
which is two business days prior to the time of the adjourned 
meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote thereat in 
respect of the number of shares registered in their name at 
the Specified Time. If the meeting is adjourned to a time not 
more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, that time will 
also apply for the purposes of determining the entitlement 
of members to attend and vote (and for the purposes of 
determining the number of votes they may cast) at the 
adjourned meeting. Changes to the Register after the relevant 
deadline shall be disregarded in determining rights to attend 
and vote.
3. If you have sold or transferred all your shares, this booklet and 
any accompanying documents (but not the personalised Form 
of Proxy or Form of Direction) should be passed to the person 
through whom the sale or transfer was made for transmission 
to the purchaser or transferee.
Voting
4. Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM will be 
by poll, so that all shares voted are included, whether or not 
the member is able to attend the meeting. The results of the 
voting at the meeting and the number of proxy votes cast for 
and against and the number of votes abstained in respect of 
each of the Resolutions proposed at the meeting will be 
announced to the London Stock Exchange as soon as 
practicable following the meeting and also will be published 
on the Company’s website www.drax.com.
5. Members are reminded of their right under section 360BA 
CA 2006 to request, within 30 days of a general meeting, 
information which enables them to determine that their vote 
on a poll at the general meeting was validly recorded and 
counted by the Company.
Questions at the meeting
6. Questions for the Board can be submitted in advance or at the 
AGM through the Lumi platform. To enable the Board to 
address as many member questions as possible, we would 
request that where possible, questions are submitted in 
advance of the AGM.
7. If multiple questions on the same topic are received in 
advance of the AGM, the Chair may choose to provide a single 
answer to address member queries on the same topic.
8. Any member joining the meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must cause to be answered any 
question relating to the business being dealt with at the 
meeting put by a member joining the meeting. However, 
members should note that no answer need be given in the 
following circumstances:
• if to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation of 
the meeting or would involve a disclosure of confidential 
information;
• if the answer has already been given on a website in the 
form of an answer to a question; or
• if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the 
good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Appointment of proxies
9. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in 
note 2 above, you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies 
to exercise all or any of your rights to join and ask questions 
at the meeting. Your proxy does not need to be a member 
of the Company. If a member appoints more than one proxy 
to join the meeting, each proxy must be appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to a different share or shares held by 
that member.
10. If a member wishes to appoint more than one proxy and so 
requires additional proxy forms, the member should contact 
the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited, at Aspect House, 
Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using 
their telephone helpline service on 0371 384 2030 from 
within the UK or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK. 
Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday – 
excluding public holidays in England and Wales.
11. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in 
these notes and the notes on the Form of Proxy. A Form of 
Proxy is enclosed. To be effective, the Form of Proxy must be 
completed and signed and, together with the power of 
attorney or authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a duly 
certified copy of any such power or authority) must be lodged 
with the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours, 
excluding non-business days, before the time of the meeting 
or must be lodged using the CREST proxy voting services 
(see note 13 below).
10 
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023
12. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint 
holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. 
Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of 
the joint holders appear in the Register in respect of the joint 
holding (the first-named being deemed the most senior).
13. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by 
utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may 
do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof utilising 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via 
www.euroclear.com). CREST personal members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who 
have appointed (a) voting service provider(s) should refer 
to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who 
will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using 
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated 
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications and must contain the information required 
for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual.
14. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be 
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent 
(Equiniti Limited CREST participant ID RA19) by the latest 
time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 11 
above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the 
message by the CREST applications Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time 
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through 
other means. CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member 
or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary 
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time.
15. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and 
timings www.euroclear.com.
16. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
17. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the 
vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or 
against the Resolution. If you either select the “discretionary” 
option or if no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote 
or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will 
vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation 
to any other matter which is put before the meeting.
18. If you are not a member of the Company but you have been

Nominated persons
24. Any person receiving a copy of this Notice of Meeting as a 
person nominated by a member to enjoy information rights 
under Section 146 CA 2006 (a Nominated Person) should 
note that the provisions in this Notice concerning the 
appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting in 
place of a member, do not apply to a Nominated Person as 
only shareholders have the right to appoint a proxy. However, 
a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement 
between the Nominated Person and the member by whom 
he or she was nominated to be appointed, or to have someone 
else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated 
Person has no such proxy appointment right, or does not 
wish to exercise it, he or she may have a right under such 
an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the 
exercise of voting rights at the meeting. If you are a person 
who has been nominated under Section 146 CA 2006 to 
enjoy information rights:
• you may have a right under an agreement between you and 
the member of the Company who has nominated you to 
have information rights (Relevant Member) to be appointed 
or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the 
meeting; and
• if you either do not have such a right or if you have such 
a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right 
under an agreement between you and the Relevant 
Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member as 
to the exercise of voting rights. Nominated Persons should 
also remember that their main point of contact in terms 
of their investment in the Company remains the member 
who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy information 
rights (or, perhaps the custodian or broker who administers 
the investment on their behalf). Nominated Persons should 
continue to contact that member, custodian or broker (and 
not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating 
to the Nominated Person’s personal details and interest 
in the Company (including any administrative matter). 
The only exception to this is where the Company expressly 
requests a response from a Nominated Person.

connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts

28. The Company may not require the members requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with Sections 527 or 528 CA 2006. Where the Company is 
required to place a statement on a website under Section 527 
CA 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s 
auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt 
with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company 
has been required under Section 527 CA 2006 to publish 
on a website.
