EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Drax Group plays a key role in the British energy market, generating and 
supplying low-carbon energy, and providing energy solutions to 
industrial and business consumers across the country. 
Drax Group generated and supplied 5% of the UK’s electricity in 2019. 
This includes the hydro and gas generation assets the Group recently acquired 
from ScottishPower—now operating as Drax Generation Enterprise Limited 
(DGEL). The acquisition of the new sites across Scotland and England made 
Drax Group the fourth largest electricity generator in the UK. 
The Group is at the forefront of efforts to reduce the UK’s carbon 
footprint and accounts for 12% of the country’s renewable energy 
production. Drax Power Station is the largest single source of renewable 
electricity in the UK, producing 11% of the nation’s renewable electricity. The 
Station’s major decarbonisation project that has seen its increasing use of 
biomass generation has helped the Group reduce its carbon emissions by 85% 
between 2012 and 2019.  
In addition to energy generation, the Group—through Haven Power and 
Opus Energy—supplies energy to 419,000 meter points at businesses 
throughout Britain. As well as supplying energy, Haven Power and Opus 
Energy also promote energy efficiency and sustainability among other 
businesses, offering 100% renewable power to supply customers. 
Through its operations and investments, Drax Group supports significant 
economic activity throughout the UK. This report quantifies Drax Group’s 
economic contribution to the UK and its constituent nations and regions in 
2019. It encompasses the Group’s direct impact, indirect and induced impact of 
the Group’s activities. 
Drax Group has a sizeable economic footprint in the UK. With sites across 
the UK’s nations and regions, Drax Group spent £1.5 billion with external UK-
based suppliers in 2019. 
In total, Drax Group’s operations contributed over £2.2 billion to UK GDP 
in 2019. This figure includes the value created by the Group’s production and 
supply of wholesale energy, the activity supported along the Group’s supply 
chain by its procurement spending, and the activity sustained by the wage-
induced spending of its staff (and suppliers’ staff) in the consumer economy. 
One-quarter of this GDP impact, some £548 million, was generated in the 
Yorkshire and the Humber region, home of Drax Power Station.  
In addition to these contributions to economic output, Drax Group 
supported 19,200 jobs across the UK in 2019. The jobs sustained by the 
Group were spread throughout the UK’s nations and regions, reflecting the 
spread of the Group’s operations. By region the most jobs were supported in 
the Yorkshire and the Humber region, at 4,200. 
Drax Group supported £480 million in tax revenues to the UK Exchequer 
in 2019. This contribution would be sufficient to pay the annual salaries of 
17,300 nurses across the UK.

1. INTRODUCTION 
This report—commissioned by Drax Group—sets out the results of Oxford 
Economics’ assessment of Drax Group’s economic contribution to the UK 
during 2019. It is the latest analysis in a series produced by Oxford Economics 
for Drax Group, that has quantified the Group’s economic impact in 2015, 
2016, and 2017.1  
 
1.1 DRAX GROUP 
Drax Group is a leading British energy company. In recent years it has 
increased its focus on Biomass energy—the use of sustainably-sourced wood 
pellets—and has acquired Haven Power and Opus Energy as suppliers to 
commercial users. And its growth has continued with the recent acquisition of 
ScottishPower’s pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation, now known 
as Drax Generation Enterprise Limited. The Group’s total power generation 
and storage capability has risen to 6.5 gigawatts.  
Drax Group is playing an important role in the UK’s transition towards a low-
carbon economy. In keeping with this goal, the Group has announced plans to 
become carbon negative by 2030, and has already started making significant 
strides towards this. In the first half of 2019, it reported a 52% reduction in its 
carbon emissions compared to the same period in the previous year. Some 
94% of the electricity now generated at Drax Power Station is renewable, 
making it the largest source of the renewable energy in the UK. 
Drax has several businesses working across the energy sector in the UK, that 
are considered in this report. The Group’s three main activities are pellet 
production; power generation; and energy supply (including energy services to 
businesses). We present results broken down into the following entities: 
• 
Drax Power, Drax’s generation business that owns and operates Drax 
Power Station in North Yorkshire. In our analysis, the activities of the 
Group’s head office are included within this entity; 
• 
Haven Power, a leading supplier of energy to industrial and 
commercial users; 
• 
Opus Energy, one of the largest suppliers of energy to small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK; and 
• 
Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (DGEL), a generation business 
that owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-
fired generation stations across the UK (new to this year’s report).2 
 
 
1 The economic impact of Drax Biomass Inc., Drax’s subsidiary based in the United States, falls outside the remit 
of these studies. 
2 This includes Cruachan Power Station (pumped storage); Hydro-electric schemes in Lanark and Galloway 
(Scotland); and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House, Shoreham and Blackburn 
Mill (all England).

METHODOLOGICAL OUTLINE 
Oxford Economics assessed the economic benefits of Drax Group using a standard means of 
analysis, called an economic impact assessment. Impact analysis traces the economic 
contribution of a company through three separate channels: 
• 
Its direct impact refers to activity conducted directly by the Group in the UK, such as 
the GDP it generates and its direct employment; 
• 
Its indirect impact encapsulates the activity and employment supported in the 
Group’s, or contractors’ supply chains as a result of their procurement of goods and 
services; and, 
• 
Its induced impact, comprising the wider economic benefits that arise when 
employees within the Group and contractors, and their supply chain spend their 
earnings, for example in local retail and leisure establishments. 
Fig. 1:  The channels of Drax Group’s economic impact 
 
These economic impacts can be measured in one of three ways: 
• 
GDP, or more specifically, the Group’s gross value added (GVA) contribution to 
GDP; 
• 
Employment meaning the number of people employed, measured on a headcount 
basis; and, 
• 
Tax revenue, the estimated fiscal contribution resulting from corporate activity and 
employment sustained by the Group. 
The calculations undertaken to quantify these impacts draw upon data supplied by Drax 
Group. The modelling is conducted using an Input-Output (I-O) based model of the UK 
economy, and regional modules describing the economies of its constituent nations and 
regions. This model was constructed by Oxford Economics, using macroeconomic, 
employment and tax data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HMRC.

2. RESULTS 
2.1 DIRECT IMPACT 
The activities of Drax Group directly contributed £549 million to UK GDP 
during 2019. This figure encompasses the gross profits it earned through its 
operations, and the gross wages paid to its workers. This figure represents an 
increase of 55 percent, relative to 2017.  
The Group also employed some 2,724 workers in 2019 across the UK, 
measured as the average of monthly employment levels during the year. These 
staff were highly productive. The average gross value added per employee was 
£201,600 in 2019.3 This means the Group’s workers were 3.5 times more 
productive than the average worker in the UK, and 4.2 times more productive 
than the average worker in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. 
Fig. 2: Direct impact of Drax Group, by entity, 2019 
 
In addition to these GVA and employment contributions, the Group directly 
generated around £48 million in tax revenues. This total is made up of 
Corporation Tax paid by the Group along with the labour taxes generated by its 
direct workforce: income tax, and employers’ and employees’ National 
Insurance Contributions (NICs).

2.2 INDIRECT IMPACT 
The Group’s indirect impact on the UK economy is driven by its procurement of 
goods and services from other domestic businesses. In order to avert double-
counting, this indirect impact excludes the spending between the various 
entities of Drax Group. The economic benefits of this spending are already 
captured within the direct impact, discussed above. 
Drax Group spent £1.5 billion with UK-based suppliers in 2019. The 
majority of this spending, some £1.1 billion, was with suppliers in the power 
and utilities sector, including the Group’s National Grid spending (£2.1 billion 
with international suppliers. 
Fig. 3). The Group spent a further £2.1 billion with international suppliers. 
Fig. 3: Drax Group's total procurement expenditure, by sector, 2019 
 
In order to meet the intermediate demands of Drax Group, these businesses 
make purchases from their own suppliers, and so on down the supply chain. 
The sum of all these supply chain interactions produces the indirect impact, 
which ripples out across the regions and nations of the UK.  
The Group’s indirect impact supported a £1.2 billion gross value added 
contribution to GDP during 2019, and over 9,500 jobs throughout the UK. 
The Group’s indirect jobs contribution is nearly three times larger than its direct 
employment, pointing towards the capital-intensive nature of its activities. This 
illustrates that Drax Group’s spending within the UK is with predominately with 
relatively more labour-intensive industries. The largest indirect contribution to 
GDP was in the East of England (25% of the total), while 20% of the indirect 
jobs were supported in the Yorkshire and the Humber region (Fig. 4).

The economic activity supported along Drax Group’s supply chain 
created a further £319 million in tax receipts. Labour taxes made up some 
£177 million of this total, while the induced activity was also associated with 
£65 million in taxes on products (such as VAT). 
 
2.3 INDUCED IMPACT 
Drax Group paid £128 million in gross employee compensation across 
the UK in 2019. This figure encompasses wages and salaries, pensions 
contributions, share-based payments and compensation costs (where 
relevant). This remuneration—the regional distribution of which is shown in Fig. 
5—supports further economic activity across the UK as the Group’s staff, along 
with those employed in its domestic supply chain, use their wages to purchase 
goods from the consumer economy, in local retailers and leisure facilities, for 
instance.

We estimate Drax Group’s induced GVA impact reached £477 million in 
2019. The wage-induced spending that can be attributable to the Group also 
supported 7,000 jobs across the UK. This induced impact is spread more 
broadly across the UK’s nations and regions (Fig. 6). The largest impact was, 
however, in the Yorkshire and the Humber region where 16% of the induced 
GDP impact and 18% of the induced jobs were supported.  
This induced activity was also associated with tax revenues of £114 
million. This sum encompasses all the taxes on profits, wages and 
procurement discussed previously; while also including the VAT accrued as a 
result of Drax Group’s induced consumption impact.

2.4 TOTAL IMPACT 
By adding the three channels discussed above, we arrive at our estimates for 
the total impact of Drax Group’s activities during 2019. This can be considered 
the Group’s total ‘footprint’ on the UK economy in that year.   
We estimate Drax Group’s activities generated £2.2 billion in GVA during 
2019, and supported a total of 19,200 jobs. The contribution of each of Drax 
Group’s major entities is shown in Fig. 7, while the regional distribution is 
shown in Fig. 8. In total, this is a sizeable contribution to the UK’s economy, 
with the Group’s total contribution to GDP equivalent to 13% of Sheffield’s 
economy.
