Appendix 1: Definitions 
API2/4/6 
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on 
board (“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered 
FOB to Newcastle, Australia. 
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE 
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges). 
BM 
BALANCING MECHANISM 
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption 
or reduce generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the 
system minute by minute. 
CESP 
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME 
CESP has been created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It requires gas 
and electricity suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic 
consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 
2009.  The CESP obligation period ran from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.  
DECC 
DEPARTMENT FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
DIRECT INJECTION 
A process whereby biomass is fed directly (i.e. avoiding the pulverising mills) to the burners situated in 
the boiler walls. 
EBITDA 
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative 
contracts. 
ELV

NOX, SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the forthcoming PPC permit. 
EUA 
EU ALLOWANCE 
European Union Allowances, the tradable unit under the EU ETS. Equals 1 tonne of CO2. 
EU ETS 
EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME 
Trading Scheme within the European Union. The first compliance phase is from 2005-07, the second 
compliance phase continues from 2008-12 and the third phase is proposed to run from 2013-2020. 
IUK 
INTERCONNECTOR UK 
Sub sea gas pipeline and terminal facilities providing a bi-directional link between the UK and 
continental European energy markets.

Appendix 1: Definitions 
LNG 
LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS 
LTIR 
LOST TIME INJURY RATE 
The frequency rate calculated on the following basis (number of accidents/hours worked * 100,000). 
Accidents are defined as occurrences where the injured party is absent from work for more than 24 
hours. 
NERP 
NATIONAL EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLAN 
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD and the one selected by Drax. This sets 
annual limits on the emissions of NOX, SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the 
forthcoming PPC permit. 
NOx 
Nitrogen oxides, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD. 
OFGEM 
OFFICE FOR GAS AND ELECTRICITY MARKETS 
OPTED-IN / OPTED-OUT 
An opted-in plant is a power station that has elected to comply with the LCPD emissions standards. 
Opted-out plant has not elected to comply and is therefore only permitted to run for 20,000 hours and 
must in any event close by the end of 2015. 
POND FINES 
Coal dust and waste coal from the cleaning and screening process which can be used for coal-fired 
power generation. 
RO 
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION 
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity 
from eligible renewable sources.  
ROC 
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE 
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of 
the electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable 
energy sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation 
dependant on date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded. 
ROSPA 
ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS 
SCR 
SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION 
Converting nitrogen oxides with the aid of a catalyst into diatomic nitrogen and water. A gaseous 
reductant, typically anhydrous ammonia, is added to a stream of flue gas and absorbed onto a catalyst. 
SO2 
Sulphur dioxide, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD.  
TRIR 
TOTAL RECORDABLE  INJURY RATE 
TRIR is calculated on the following basis (lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries)/ 
hours worked * 100,000.


Based on fuel (coal) consumption 
Tax per tonne CO2 set annually  
– 2 years in advance 

Based on difference between Government’s 
(HMT) target carbon price trajectory  
and traded price 

For 2013 this is £19 - £14 = £5/tonne CO2;  
equivalent to £12/tonne coal 

For 2014 this is c. £10/tonne CO2;  
equivalent to £22/tonne coal 

Current estimate of 2015/16 rate is £18/tonne

Appendix 14: ROC Mechanics 
Mechanism 
Renewables Obligation (RO) –  
suppliers must source increasing  
volume of renewable power 
Obligation can be met in two ways: 

Surrender ROCs or pay a buy-out 
All buy-out funds recycled to suppliers 
that surrender ROCs 

Buy-out is mandated price with RPI 
indexation; currently c. £41/MWh 
Mechanism in place to ensure: 

Obligation increases annually; and 

Obligation > expected ROC production 
Cash flows 

Obligation is annual (April – March) 

ROCs surrendered or buy-out paid by  
1 September following March year end 

Recycled funds paid out in October

Cash Flows and Accounting 
ROC generation measured in annual 
compliance periods (April – March) 
ROC cash flows typically 6 months after 
annual compliance period ends 

Impacts working capital 
Drax historically recognised ROC benefit  
in P&L only at time of ROC sale 

Similar timing to cash flows 
Drax accounting change in 2012 –  
P&L benefit in period of ROC generation 

Matches ROC support with biomass fuel costs 

ROC value estimated based on market price 
No significant impact on earnings in 2012

than expected; increasing competitive pressures in the industry; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting the relevant 
industry, both domestically and internationally, being less favourable than expected. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these
