INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the non-technical summary of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for the Progress Power 
Project (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’).  It has been prepared by 
Parsons Brinckerhoff on behalf of Progress Power Limited (PPL). 
1.1.2 
PPL is promoting a new natural gas fired power station on land at the 
former Eye Airfield located in Eye, Mid Suffolk. 
1.1.3 
The four main elements of the proposed Project would comprise: 
 
A Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) gas fired power generating 
station (referred to as the ‘Power Generation Plant’) designed to 
provide an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW); 
 
A new electrical connection (referred to as the ‘Electrical 
Connection’) to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant 
to the substation within the Electrical Connection Compound;  
 
A new electrical connection compound comprised of a new 
substation and sealing end compound (SEC) (referred to as the 
‘Electrical Connection Compound’) to export electricity from the 
Power Generation Plant to the National Grid; and 
 A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the ‘Gas Connection’) 
to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the existing 
National Gas Transmission System (NTS) in the vicinity of the site; 
together with all access requirements. 
1.1.4 
It is proposed that the Power Generation Plant would operate as a 
‘peaking plant’.  This means that it would have an intermittent operating 
regime (i.e. not running 24/7), with maximum operational hours not 
exceeding 1500 hours per year.  It is designed to provide back-up 
generation capacity to respond quickly and efficiently to both short-term 
variation in customer demand and intermittent output from renewable 
power generation. 
1.1.5 
The proposed Project is classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project, which means that a Development Consent Order 
(DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it.  The proposed DCO 
Application will be processed and examined by the Planning 
Inspectorate who will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State 
for Energy and Climate Change (Secretary of State).  The final decision 
on the application is made by the Secretary of State (SoS).  The main

PEIR and this non-technical summary have been prepared in 
accordance with Regulations 2 and 10 of the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009.  They present 
information specifically aimed at assisting consultees and local 
communities to understand the nature, scale, and location of the 
proposed Project. 
1.1.6 
Copies of the main PEIR and this non-technical summary may be 
examined during a consultation exercise being carried out by PPL 
between 3 October 2013 until 7 November 2013 at Ipswich County 
Library, Diss Library, Eye Library, Ixworth Library and Stradbroke 
Library.

1.1.9 
Representations must be received on or before 7 November 2013.  
1.2 
Needs and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Projects are set out in National Policy Statements 
(NPSs). NPS EN-1 (the Overarching Energy NPS) states that “gas will 
continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing 
vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation 
and to maintain security of supply” (paragraph 3.6.2).  
1.2.2 
Gas is a reliable fuel source.  It is acknowledged by the Government as 
being essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s 
energy security.  In addition, gas provides back-up to power generation 
from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an 
increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source.  Modern gas fired 
power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of 
electricity power generation.

1.3 
Planning Policy Context 
1.3.1 
The Department for Energy and Climate Change has published a 
number of NPSs in relation to energy infrastructure, which were 
designated by the SoS in July 2011. These NPSs set out national 
policy against which proposals for Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Projects are assessed and decided on.  
1.3.2 
Due to the nature of the proposed Project (which would generate over 
50 MW of electricity), four of the designated NPSs are considered 
relevant to the determination of the proposed DCO Application:  
 Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy EN-1: This sets 
out national policy for energy infrastructure as defined by the 
Planning Act 2008, which provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS;  
 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure EN-2: This sets out policies specific to the 
determination of applications for fossil fuel electricity generating 
infrastructure; 
 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas 
and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This sets Government policy on the 
relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into 
account as to route selection for developers for, inter alia, gas 
pipelines; and  
 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5): This provides the primary basis for decisions taken by SoS 
on applications it receives for electricity network NSIPs, including 
the relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into 
account related to route selection.  
1.3.3 
NPS EN-1 states that consideration may be given to planning policy 
outside the NPSs where it is important and relevant to the SoS's 
decision.  Other national planning policies have therefore been 
considered in the preparation of the PEIR as these may be relevant to 
the determination of the proposed DCO Application. 
1.4 
The Developer 
1.4.1 
The developer of the Project is Progress Power Limited (PPL).  PPL is 
an energy development company established for the Project by Watt 
Power Limited (WPL) of Edinburgh.  WPL wishes to develop gas fired 
power plants at Eye and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.

Purpose of the Document 
1.5.1 
Due to the nature and size of the proposed Project, PPL is undertaking 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  The EIA considers the 
potential impacts, both positive and negative, of the proposed Project. 
1.5.2 
This document is a summary (in non-technical language) of the PEIR 
for the proposed Project.  It has been prepared to provide information 
on the proposed Project as part of the pre-application consultation 
process for the proposed DCO Application.  It presents a summary of 
the preliminary environmental information and assessments which have 
been completed to date and identifies the additional information or 
studies required in order to complete the EIA.  Feedback received 
during the pre-application consultation process will help to influence the 
final designs of the proposed Project and refine the EIA. 
1.5.3 
The findings of the EIA will be presented in an Environmental 
Statement (ES) that will be submitted with the proposed DCO 
Application to the Security of State (SoS).

PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
2.1 
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is shown in Figure 2.1, being the current project red 
line boundary which includes all options currently under consideration 
by PPL as explained in further detail in this non-technical summary.  
Any temporary areas for equipment / material laydown, required during 
construction of the Project, would also be located within the Project 
Site.  The Project Site lies entirely within the administrative boundary of 
Mid Suffolk District Council (MSDC). 
2.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be situated within a 10 hectares 
(ha) plot of land located within the former Eye Airfield.  The former Eye 
Airfield accommodates several industrial parks, including: Brome 
Industrial Estate (to the north), Eye Airfield Industrial Estate (to the 
north-east), Mid Suffolk Business Park (to the east) and Oaksmere 
Business Park (to the west).  The Project Site is located approximately 
1 kilometre (km) north west of Eye Town Centre.  The footprint of the 
Power Generation Plant would, however, be smaller than the full 10 ha 
site.  Figure 2.1 shows the preliminary preferred location of the Power 
Generation Plant within the 10 ha site. 
2.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant site and immediate surrounding area is 
characterised by agricultural land and the remnants of a former World 
War 2 airfield, including the runway and the access roads.  Buildings 
that once formed part of the airfield have been replaced by units

accommodating various industrial activities including a power 
generation facility (the Eye Chicken Litter Power Plant) and a National 
Grid Gas Compressor Station.  Additionally, there are two large (130m 
high) wind turbines (Eye Airfield Wind Turbines) within 200m to the 
north west of the proposed Power Generation Plant site. Two more 
wind turbines (130m high) have received planning permission and 
these will be constructed by Eye Wind Power Ltd to the south of the 
site at Baldwin Farm. 
2.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant site can be accessed from the existing 
road network via a private road to the south, Potash Lane, which in turn 
connects to Castleton Way, via the former main runway.  Castleton 
Way provides connectivity to the B1077 to the east and the A140 to the 
west.  The closest point of the B1077 to the site is approximately 460m 
east. 
2.1.5 
At this stage in the proposed Project, the preferred route options for the 
Gas Connection, Electrical Connection and the location and layout of 
the Electrical Connection Compound have yet to be finalised.  The 
options under consideration are illustrated in Figure 2.1. 
2.1.6 
Construction and maintenance access for the two options for the 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound is likely to 
follow the final Electrical Connection route corridor once agreed, 
although some small maintenance access may utilise Leys Lane.  It is 
likely, however, that access improvement works would be required at 
the northern end of Old Norwich Road, between White House Farm 
and the fishing pond.  Construction of the Electrical Connection would 
require the carrying out of road works on the A140, Old Norwich Road 
and Leys Lane, as both Electrical Connection Option 1 and Electrical 
Connection Option 2 will run across these roads. 
2.1.7 
Construction and maintenance access for Gas Connection Option 1 
(see Figure 2.1) would be via Castleton Way and Potash Lane.  
2.1.8 
Construction and maintenance access for Gas Connection Option 2 
(see Figure 2.1) would be via Castleton Way and Potash Lane and an 
access over private land.  Construction of Gas Connection Option 2 
would involve some temporary road works across Potash Lane whilst 
the underground pipe was being installed.

Power Generation Plant and Generating Technology 
2.2.1 
PPL has determined that an SCGT plant is the preferred and most 
appropriate technology choice for the Power Generation Plant (refer to 
Section 3.3).  There are, however, several options of SCGT plant 
available to generate up to 299 MW.  These different options mainly 
relate to the number and type of gas turbine generator (GTGs) used.

2.2.2 
SCGT plant usually use aero-derivative GTGs (i.e. turbines derived 
from the aeronautical industry), primarily because of their suitability to 
frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability 
maintenance options.  However, ‘industrial’ type units can also be used.  
These are typically larger and often more suited to longer operational 
hours.  For the Power Generation Plant, PPL envisages using 3, 4 or 5 
individual aero-derivative GTGs or, alternatively 1 or 2 individual 
industrial GTGs to generate up to 299 MW.  To allow for a 
precautionary approach, the assessments in the PEIR have been 
based on the Power Generation Plant using 5 individual aero-derivative 
GTGs unless otherwise stated.  This is because 5 GTGs would 
generally have greater impacts on the environment than fewer units 
and is therefore considered to be the realist worst case scenario. 
2.2.3 
Figure 2.2 shows a simple schematic of SCGT operation.  In the gas 
turbines air is compressed and natural gas is injected.  The fuel is then 
burned in the combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases.  
This gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine, which drives the 
electrical generators to produce electricity.  The waste gases and heat 
produced from this process are released to the atmosphere via stacks. 
Figure 2.2: A simple schematic of SCGT operation 
 
2.2.4 
PPL envisages that the Power Generation Plant would have up to 5 
stacks, each up to 30m in height, depending on the number and type of 
GTGs used (so in the realistic worst case scenario of 5 GTGs, there 
would be 5 stacks each a maximum height of 30m).  Each stack would

be equipped with emissions control technologies, which would reduce 
emissions released to the atmosphere. 
2.2.5 
In addition to the main GTG units at the Power Generation Plant site, 
the following would also be present: 
 
Process Water Tank: to supply make up water to the plant.  
 
Fire Water Tank: designed to comply with the relevant fire 
regulations and would be installed together with fire pumps, hose 
reels, fire hydrants and portable extinguishers. 
 
Control Building: to monitor the plant operation and house plant 
controls. 
 
Workshop and Stores Building: to store certain strategic and 
routine maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out 
minor maintenance of the plant. . 
 
A Gatehouse: needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc. 
 
A Switchyard: to connect the electrical infrastructure from the 
Power Generation Plant to transformers before export to the 
National Grid; and  
 
A Gas Receiving Installation: to process gas coming from the 
NTS to feed into the Power Generation Plant site at the right flow 
and pressure conditions. 
2.2.6 
An illustrative visual of the Power Generation Plant site is provided in 
Figure 2.3.  The final layout proposal for the Power Generation Plant 
site would incorporate a degree of flexibility with respect to the actual 
sizing and siting of the structures and buildings shown. 
2.2.7 
Subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the Power 
Generation Plant could enter commercial operation in 2018.

Gas Connection 
2.3.1 
A new underground gas pipeline would be required to connect the 
Power Generation Plant to the NTS in order to provide a reliable supply 
of fuel. 
2.3.2 
Two route corridor options are currently being assessed for their 
suitability, as illustrated by Figure 2.1.  Gas Connection Route Corridor 
Option 1 is approximately 0.1 km in length and runs west into the 
National Grid Gas Compressor Station located adjacent to the Power 
Generation Plant site.  Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 is 
approximately 1.5 km in length and runs in a southerly direction 
terminating in a field to the north of Castleton Way where a new Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) would be situated. 
2.3.3 
The route choices for the Gas Connection will be refined as the 
proposed Project progresses and after public consultation.  It is PPL's 
intention to choose a single preferred route corridor option prior to 
submission of the proposed DCO Application.  This preferred option will 
then be assessed in the ES and applied for in the proposed DCO 
Application.

Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
2.4.1 
A new underground Electrical Connection together with a new Electrical 
Connection Compound would be required to connect the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing nearby overhead power line, which is 
part of the National Electricity Transmission System.  The existing line 
runs in a north-south direction, a little over 1 km west of the Power 
Generation Plant site at its closest point.  
2.4.2 
The Electrical Connection Compound (illustrated in Figure 2.4) would 
consist of a substation with maximum dimensions 150 m x 150 m, up to 
12.5 m in height, and a SEC with dimensions approximately 45 m x 22 
m, up to 10 m in height. 
Figure 2.4: Illustrative Visual of the Electrical Connection Compound  
 
Note this visual shows the Electrical Connection Compound on either side of an existing 
pylon for the existing line; the proposed Project does not involve any overhead lines rather 
an underground electrical cable 
2.4.3 
The location and layout of the Electrical Connection Compound have 
yet to be finalised.  As illustrated by Figure 2.1, two possible areas of 
approximately 12 ha have been identified, along with preliminary 
preferred locations for the Electrical Connection Compound within each 
12 ha site.  These options are: 
 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1: located to the south of 
the The Leys, within agricultural land to the north of Mellis Road.

 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 2: located to the north of 
the The Leys, within agricultural land off Leys Lane between The 
Leys and Goswold Hall. 
2.4.4 
The Electrical Connection route corridor for the proposed Project will be 
dependent upon which of the two Electrical Connection Compound 
options is preferred.  At this stage, two potential route corridor options 
have been identified, as illustrated by Figures 2.5 and 2.6. 
2.4.5 
The location and layout of the Electrical Connection Compound and the 
route of the Electrical Connection will be refined as the Project 
progresses and after public consultation.  It is PPL's intention to choose 
a single preferred option prior to submission of the proposed DCO 
Application.  The preferred option will then be assessed in the ES and 
applied for in the proposed DCO Application.

SITE SELECTION, ALTERNATIVES AND DESIGN EVOLUTION 
3.1 
Introduction  
3.1.1 
An overview of the alternatives that have been considered for the 
proposed Project as part of the design evolution process is provided 
below. 
3.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
3.2.1 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment for the Project, WPL looked 
at a range of sites around the UK to support power generation plants of 
this nature.  The key factors which WPL considered necessary in a site 
were broadly four fold: technical (e.g. the size of the site and the 
proximity to appropriate gas and electrical connection points), 
environmental, economic and whether the proposals would be in line 
with local planning policy. 
3.2.2 
Based on these factors, the site at the former Eye Airfield was 
considered suitable as it is within close proximity (<1 km) to the gas 
 
 
 
Progress Power Project PEIR Non-
Technical Summary

- 17 - 
NTS and (<1.5 km) to a high voltage electrical transmission 
infrastructure.  The site is within an existing industrial estate and 
surrounded by similar industrial developments and the area is identified 
in the emerging Eye Airfield Development Framework as an area that 
MSDC has aspirations to develop as an energy park.  In addition, there 
is more than adequate space on the former Eye Airfield site to develop 
the Power Generation Plant and integral infrastructure. 
3.3 
Power Generation Plant 
3.3.1 
Three potential technology options were originally considered for the 
299 MW Power Generation Plant at Eye: SCGT plant, Combined Cycle 
Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) 
plant.  The potential for utilising Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
opportunities at the site using these technologies was also considered. 
3.3.2 
PPL has undertaken a number of studies to refine the technology 
choice and it has been concluded that an SCGT peaking plant is the 
most suitable technology choice.  This has been determined based on 
the following environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
 
Visual impact: the use of a SCGT plant over a CCGT plant limits 
the height of the stack(s) required and therefore the visual impacts 
associated with the Power Generation Plant.   
 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is 
significantly lower than for a CCGT and CHP plant. 
 
Financial: based on the current electricity market, it is essential that 
the plant of the size proposed at Eye will be particularly cost 
effective, as it would be called upon to operate flexibly to balance 
out the National Grid and meet changing demands of customers. 
Currently SCGT plants are more cost effective than CCGT plants 
and better suited to this type of operational regime.  
 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down 
much quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, 
better suited to meeting flexible demands. 
3.4 
Gas Connection 
3.4.1 
Seven potential Gas Connection route corridor options were originally 
identified to connect the Power Generation Plant to the NTS.  Further 
analysis has determined that five of these route corridor options are no 
longer feasible due to a combination of factors, including the proximity 
to the recently consented wind turbines, the potential to render large 
areas of fields unusable and the potential to cause significant disruption 
to a currently busy and operational part of the former Eye Airfield 
Industrial Estate.  The remaining two route corridor options (as

- 18 - 
identified in Section 2.3) are still under consideration for the proposed 
Project and have been assessed as part of the PEIR.   
3.4.2 
Continued consultation and environmental assessment on the Gas 
Connection options is required before each can be confirmed. 
3.5 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
3.5.1 
A large Electrical Connection ‘opportunity area’ was originally identified 
to the west of the A140, where studies into possible Electrical 
Connection route corridor options were to be concentrated.  A number 
of ecological surveys have now been undertaken, which has enabled 
further refinement of this area.  As such, it is now likely that the 
connection point would be located in the area between Vine Farm and 
Goswold Hall, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. 
3.5.2 
As discussed in Section 2.4, two areas are currently being investigated 
to site the Electrical Connection Compound.  These areas have both 
been subject to environmental studies, some of which are ongoing.  
The exact configuration and route of the Electrical Connection will be 
dependent upon the outcome of the preferred Electrical Connection

considered as illustrated in Figures 2.5 and 2.6.

Continued consultation and environmental assessment on the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound options is required 
before each can be confirmed.

PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
4.1 
Environmental Impact Assessment Methodology 
4.1.1 
In accordance with relevant regulations, the EIA process for the 
proposed Project incorporates the following steps: 
 
Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including 
obtaining a Scoping Opinion from the SoS; 
 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives;  
 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the site and the relevant 
study areas for each topic;  
 
Identifying the potential environmental impacts resulting from the 
proposed Project;

 
Determining how the potential environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
 
Assessing the significance of the potential environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the proposed Project 
and those from other neighbouring developments and / or sources 
(in-combination and cumulative impacts); and 
 
Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored.  
4.1.2 
The PEIR is an intermediate step of the EIA process required by the 
Infrastructure 
Planning 
(Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment) 
Regulations 2009, reporting on information currently available and 
some likely approaches to mitigation measures which might be used to 
avoid, reduce and if possible remedy any significant adverse impacts 
and thus minimise residual impacts.   
4.1.3 
Before commencing the EIA for the proposed Project, PPL requested a 
Scoping Opinion from the SoS in May 2013.  The views given in the 
formal Scoping Opinion, received in June 2013, were taken into 
account when preparing the PEIR. 
4.2 
Air Quality 
4.2.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon air quality.  To date, a desk 
based assessment together with preliminary air dispersion modelling 
has been undertaken to assess any potential impacts upon air quality 
from the proposed Project.  A summary of the results from this 
preliminary assessment is provided below. 
BASELINE 
4.2.2 
The study area for the preliminary air quality assessment is based on a 
20 km by 20 km grid.  Receptors within this area which may be 
sensitive to changes in air quality include the residential settlements 
nearest to the Power Generation Plant (namely Brome, Eye and 
Yaxley), sensitive ecological receptors within 10 km of the Project Site 
(including the statutory designated sites referred to in Section 4.4), 
business / industrial occupiers nearest to the Power Generation Plant 
(Eye Airfield Industrial Estate and Mid Suffolk Business Park) and local 
agricultural holdings.  In April 2011 MSDC undertook an Updating and 
Screening Assessment of ambient air quality within its jurisdiction.  The 
Assessment report states: “The Air Quality Objectives have not been 
exceeded in the Mid Suffolk district in 2010” and “There are no other 
areas that are of concern within the area of MSDC”.

PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.2.3 
During the construction and subsequent decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant, the main potential impacts on air quality would be 
from 
dust 
emissions 
generated 
from 
on-site 
construction/decommissioning activities and exhaust emissions from 
construction/decommissioning traffic movements.  It is, however, 
considered unlikely that the levels of atmospheric dust which would be 
generated would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to local people 
or industry.  Impacts would be minimised through successful 
implementation of an agreed Construction Environmental Management 
Plan (CEMP). 
4.2.4 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential 
impacts on air quality are associated with the stack emissions arising 
as a result of the combustion of natural gas and include the release of 
Nitrous Oxides (NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).  Modern gas fired 
power plants are, however, inherently clean and produce far fewer 
emissions than other fossil fuel power plants when compared on an 
energy output basis.  For the purposes of assessing operational 
impacts, the preliminary air quality impact assessment for the Power 
Generation Plant has examined two different project scenarios: 
 
Operation of five aero-derivative GTGs (each of around 60 MW); 
 
Operation of two industrial GTGs (each of around 150 MW). 
4.2.5 
The impact of the emissions from the stacks has been quantitatively 
assessed using air dispersion modelling techniques.  This has 
concluded that the realistic worst case project scenario for air quality 
impacts is a Power Generation Plant operating with 5 aero-derivative 
GTGs.  The modelling has also indicated that a minimum stack height 
of 20 m would provide adequate dispersion of the flue gases.  Taking 
into consideration potential differences in technology and the 
requirement to fit constant emissions monitoring systems and silencers 
into the stack(s), it is envisaged that the maximum height of the 
stack(s) at the Power Generation Plant would be 30 m (irrespective of 
the type and number of GTGs / stacks). 
4.2.6 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, the Power 
Generation Plant is not predicted to have any likely significant effects 
on air quality.

Gas Connection 
4.2.7 
Impacts upon air quality from the construction and subsequent 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection are not anticipated to be 
significant due to the small scale of the works proposed.  Any impacts 
would be minimised through successful implementation of an agreed 
CEMP.  It is currently anticipated that when the proposed Project is 
decommissioned, the Gas Connection would remain in-situ, as 
removing the pipeline would likely be more environmentally damaging. 
4.2.8 
Significant effects on air quality are also not predicted during operation 
of the Gas Connection, although there may be infrequent emissions 
due to the venting of gas from the AGI under non-normal, maintenance 
or emergency conditions.  There are not considered to be significant 
differences in the potential impacts between the two Gas Connection 
route corridor options currently under consideration. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.2.9 
Impacts upon air quality from the construction and subsequent 
decommissioning 
of 
the 
Electrical 
Connection 
and 
Electrical 
Connection Compound are not anticipated to be significant due to the 
small scale of the works proposed.  Any impacts would be minimised 
through successful implementation of an agreed CEMP.  During 
operation there is a very limited scope for potential impacts on air 
quality.  There are not considered to be significant differences in the 
potential impacts between the Electrical Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound options currently under consideration. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.2.10 
A detailed air quality impact assessment will be undertaken to 
determine the likely environmental impacts of operation of the proposed 
Power Generation Plant, both in isolation and in conjunction with other 
significant emissions sources identified through consultation with the 
relevant authorities.  The impact of emissions from traffic during the 
construction and decommissioning phases of the proposed Project will 
also be assessed.  The results of this assessment work will be 
presented within the ES. 
4.3 
Noise and Vibration 
4.3.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon local ambient noise levels and 
generate vibration, which may impact on sensitive receptors.  To date, 
a desk based assessment, noise survey and preliminary noise 
 
 
 
Progress Power Project PEIR Non-

- 22 - 
modelling have been undertaken to assess any potential impacts.  A 
summary of the preliminary assessment results is provided below. 
BASELINE 
4.3.2 
The baseline noise climate in the area surrounding the Power 
Generation Plant site is largely dominated by road traffic during the 
daytime.  During the night time when road traffic levels reduce, a 
continuous low level noise is audible from the existing power plant.   An 
attended noise survey has been undertaken to determine the spread of 
noise in the area.  The survey was conducted over a 24 hour period 
between 21st and 22nd July 2013 at six noise sensitive receptor (NSR) 
locations: Haygate, Hammond Farm (Old Norwich Road), Goswold 
Hall, Junction near The Maltings, Four Oaks Park and Mullberrybush 
Nursery.  The study area, noise survey methodology and NSR 
locations were defined in consultation with MSDC, Suffolk County 
Council (SCC) and the Environment Agency (EA). 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.3.3 
Preliminary noise predictions associated with the construction and 
subsequent decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant indicate 
that there would be no significant effects on the six NSR locations.  Any 
potential impacts would be minimised through the successful 
implementation of an agreed CEMP and proper communication with 
local residents.  Core site working hours would also be agreed with 
MSDC and SCC in advance of works commencing. 
4.3.4 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, preliminary noise 
modelling (which has taken the intermittent operating nature of a 
peaking plant into consideration) has indicated that significant effects 
before mitigation cannot yet be ruled out at three of the NSR locations; 
namely Haygate, Goswold Hall and the Junction near The Maltings.  
These results are, however, subject to change once a more detailed 
operational noise modelling assessment has been undertaken.  In 
addition, mitigation measures would be put in place to minimise any 
impact, including the fitting of high performance silencers, the acoustic 
cladding of all GTGs and the use of inherently quiet plant items, 
wherever practicable.  A programme of noise monitoring, including a 
noise survey shortly following the commissioning of the new plant, shall 
be agreed with MSDC and implemented at regular intervals. 
4.3.5 
No significant effects are predicted from operational vibration impacts, 
given the distances involved between the Power Generation Plant site 
and the NSR locations.

Gas Connection 
4.3.6 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, significant effects on 
NSRs cannot yet be ruled out from noise impacts associated with the 
construction and decommissioning of Gas Connection route corridor 
option 2 (although these impacts will be temporary in nature) and from 
the operation of both Gas Connection options.  The noise impact at 
sensitive 
receptors 
from 
the 
identified 
construction 
and 
decommissioning activities associated with Gas Connection route 
corridor option 2 and from operation of both Gas Connection options is 
anticipated to be moderate adverse.  During operation, detailed noise 
mitigation would be required to control the noise from pressure release 
valves at the AGI. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.3.7 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, significant effects on 
NSRs cannot yet be ruled out from noise impacts associated with the 
construction and decommissioning of the Electrical Connection and 
Electrical Connection Compound options, with the noise impact at 
sensitive receptors anticipated to be moderate adverse.  During 
operation of the Electrical Connection Compound, substation cooling 
systems have the potential to create minor annoyance at NSRs and 
detailed noise mitigation would be required to minimise any impact.  
There are, however, not considered to be significant differences in the 
potential impacts between the Electrical Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound options currently under consideration. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.3.8 
Detailed noise modelling will be undertaken to determine the 
significance of the potential impacts from the operation of the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection the Electrical Connection and the 
Electrical Connection Compound.  In addition, a detailed construction 
noise and vibration assessment will be undertaken for the Electrical 
Connection Compound and the Gas Connection once the preferred 
option is chosen and a traffic noise impact assessment will be 
completed.  The results of this additional assessment work will be 
presented within the ES.

Ecology 
4.4.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon the local ecology and disturb 
various sensitive species.  The Power Generation Plant also has the

potential to provide ecological value, for example, by reinforcing 
existing habitats or through the introduction of screen planting, which 
could provide additional habitat for some species. 
BASELINE 
4.4.2 
In order to establish the ecological baseline of the proposed Project 
Site a desk based assessment along with two extended Phase 1 
habitat surveys have been undertaken.  One survey, completed in May 
2013, covered the area of the former Eye Airfield and encompassed the 
Power Generation Plant site and the Gas Connection route corridor 
options.  The survey area comprises an arable landscape, with 
hedgerows, dense scrub, scattered trees and hardstanding along the 
respective arable boundaries.  Industrial areas are located on the far 
side of these features to the north, east and west.   
4.4.3 
The second Phase 1 habitat survey covered the Electrical Connection 
‘opportunity area’ (refer to Section 3.5) and was first undertaken on 3rd 
May 2013, with the remainder of the site surveyed on 12th and 13th 
June 2013 due to access restrictions.  The survey area comprises a 
largely arable landscape.  Smaller areas of buildings and hardstanding, 
and semi-improved grassland occur in the northern, eastern and 
western areas of the site.   
4.4.4 
The desk based assessment identified the presence of 36 statutory 
designated sites (including ancient woodland) within 10 km of the 
proposed Project Site, although only two of these are of international 
importance (Redgrave and South Lopham Fens Ramsar site and 
Waveney and Little Ouse Valley Fens Special Area of Conservation) 
and eight of national importance. 
4.4.5 
Based on the results of the Phase 1 habitat surveys, the following 
Phase 2 protected species surveys were commissioned (some of which 
are still ongoing): badger, bat (tree inspection and activity survey), 
breeding bird, great crested newt (GCN) and reptile.  All surveys have 
been conducted in accordance with applicable best practice and 
followed standard methodologies. 
4.4.6 
A summary of the preliminary Phase 2 survey results obtained to date 
is provided below: 
 
Badger: No signs of badger were noted within the proposed 
Project Site, although the discovery of a nearby roadkill confirms 
presence within the wider surrounds. 
 
Bats (tree inspection): 65 trees were inspected from the ground 
for signs of bats / bat roosting potential, 55 of which were

considered to have varying levels of potential to support roosting 
bats.  There are no trees with any bat roosting potential within the 
Power Generation Plant site or Gas Connection route corridor 
options.  Twelve trees with varying degrees of bat potential have 
been identified within the Electrical Connection Compound options 
and Electrical Connection route corridor options. 
 
Bats (activity survey): Three monthly surveys (May, June and 
July) have been carried out, the last of which incorporated a dusk 
and dawn survey effort.  Low levels of bat activity have so far been 
recorded across the proposed Project Site with only three common 
bat species recorded (common pipistrelle, noctule and soprano 
pipistrelle).  No bat roosts have been identified during the activity 
surveys. 
 
Breeding Birds: Three surveys have been completed between the 
beginning of June and end of July 2013.  A potential hobby nest 
was identified near to the Power Generation Plant site.  A potential 
barn owl nesting site was also identified in the original Electrical 
Connection ‘opportunity area’ within a mature tree. 
 
GCN: Presence / absence surveys have been completed.  The 
results of the surveys indicate GCN are present, albeit in low 
numbers, in one water body approximately 500m north-west of the 
footprint of the Electrical Connection Compound option 1.  Surveys 
of a number of ponds both on-site and within 250m of the Project 
Site were not possible due to lack of access permissions and/or 
health and safety concerns.  A precautionary approach has 
therefore been adopted whereby it is considered that GCN may 
also be distributed elsewhere across the Project Site. 
 
Reptiles: All reptile surveys have been completed and no reptiles 
have been discovered during these targeted reptile surveys. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.4.7 
During the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant no significant direct impacts on internationally 
designated sites or sites of national, regional or local importance are 
envisaged, although indirect impacts cannot yet be ruled out. 
4.4.8 
Based on the preliminary results of the Phase 2 protected species 
surveys, impacts on GCN can also not be ruled out.  One pond (pond 
4) was found situated approximately 150m to the north of the Power 
Generation Plant site.  The presence of GCN in this pond could not be 
discounted due to survey access constraints and, therefore, a 
precautionary approach has been taken which assumes GCN are

present.  Further ponds were present in the wider landscape, however; 
the presence of roads is considered to provide effective barriers for 
dispersal of GCN in to the Power Generation Plant site from these 
locations.  With appropriate mitigation, including the exclusion of GCN 
from the construction footprint and the enhancement of habitat 
surrounding pond 4, significant impacts are not envisaged. 
4.4.9 
Impacts on badgers, roosting bats, Schedule 1 bird species and reptiles 
are not currently envisaged.  In addition, impacts to breeding birds are 
not currently envisaged provided mitigation measures are implemented, 
such as careful design and avoidance of key areas and timing of the 
works. 
Gas Connection 
4.4.10 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects cannot yet be ruled out entirely while ecological surveys are still 
ongoing and the Gas Connection route corridor options are still under 
consideration.  However, impacts on internationally designated sites 
resulting from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Gas Connection (regardless of which option is chosen) are currently 
considered negligible and no impacts on sites of national, regional or 
local importance are envisaged.  In addition impacts on badgers and 
Schedule 1 bird species are not currently envisaged.  Impacts to 
breeding birds are also not envisaged provided mitigation measures 
are implemented, such as careful design and avoidance of key areas 
and timing of the works.  Impacts on roosting bats are considered to be 
negligible and impacts on GCN are not considered likely.  Impacts to 
grass snake are considered to be very low to negligible. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.4.11 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects cannot yet be ruled out entirely while ecological surveys are still 
ongoing and the location of the Electrical Connection Compound and 
Electrical Connection route corridor is still under consideration.  
However, impacts on internationally designated sites resulting from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound (regardless of which 
option is chosen) are currently considered negligible and no direct 
impacts on sites of national, regional or local importance are 
envisaged.  In addition impacts on badgers and Schedule 1 bird 
species are not currently envisaged and impacts to breeding birds are 
also not envisaged provided mitigation measures are implemented, 
such as careful design and avoidance of key areas and timing of the

works.  Impacts to grass snake in the area are considered to be very 
low. 
4.4.12 
Impacts to roosting bats are not envisaged within the area for either of 
the Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound options 
unless the trees noted with potential for bat roosts cannot be 
purposefully avoided. 
4.4.13 
Impacts on GCN cannot be ruled out until the preferred location of the 
Electrical Connection Compound and the route of the Electrical 
Connection have been determined.  Although GCN were found likely to 
be absent from ponds surveyed within the footprint of the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound options during the 
presence/absence surveys carried out in May and June 2013, a 
number of ditches and ponds within 250m of the footprint for either 
option could not be surveyed due to access constraints and/or health 
and safety concerns.  Further consideration of these waterbodies 
through survey would be necessary should it not be possible to avoid 
an area of 250m surrounding these waterbodies.  Note: 250m is 
considered an appropriate distance for consideration in this 
assessment due to the localised and temporary nature of works during 
construction and operation. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.4.14 
Following the completion of all of the Phase 2 species surveys, a 
detailed assessment of the potential impacts of the proposed Project on 
ecology will be undertaken, the results of which will be presented within 
the ES.  This will include a Habitat Regulations Assessment Screening 
to identify any potential impacts on internationally designated sites.  
When a greater understanding of the ecological baseline is understood, 
it will also be possible to consider opportunities of ecological 
enhancement. 
4.5 
Water Resources 
4.5.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon local water quality and water 
resources. Although it is assumed that the Power Generation Plant 
would utilise air cooling, substantially reducing the need for water 
during operation, small quantities of water would still be required during 
all life cycle phases of the proposed Project.  Consequently, any water 
use at the Project Site has the potential to impact upon the water 
resources in the area, including potential pollution to ground and 
surface water bodies, changes in the surface water drainage regime 
and potential to increase flood risk.

- 28 - 
BASELINE 
4.5.2 
Based on an initial high level desk based assessment, the main water 
bodies within the vicinity of the proposed Power Generation Plant site 
are considered to be: 
 
Three ponds located next to Parke’s Farm approximately 1.5 km 
north east of the Power Generation Plant site boundary; 
 
Two ponds located north at approximately 2.5 km north of the 
Power Generation Plant site boundary;  
 
One reservoir located at approximately 770 m east of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary;  
 
One pond located at approximately 525 m west of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary; and 
 
One small drain or watercourse approximately 750 m south west of 
the Power Generation Plant site boundary. 
The proposed Gas Connection route corridor options do not cross any 
water bodies.  The Electrical Connection Compound options and the 
Electrical Connection route corridor options contain a number of 
surface watercourses, although there are no material differences 
between the two options. 
4.5.3 
The bedrock of the Project Site is classified as a Principal Aquifer.  The 
aquifer has a very low vulnerability to pollutants given the low 
permeability / leaching potential of the superficial deposits and soils 
overlying the site. 
4.5.4 
The River Dove runs to the south of the Power Generation Plant site.  
The channel and banks of this river are classified as a Flood Zone 3 
(i.e. without defences this area has a 1% (1 in 100) or greater chance 
of flooding each year).  The Project Site is, however, located with Flood 
Zone 1 and thus is not considered to be at risk from fluvial flooding.  
Flood risk will be assessed further in a standalone Flood Risk 
Assessment (FRA), which will be appended to (and referred to in) the 
ES. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
4.5.5 
A conceptual site model has been used to assess the potential effects 
of the proposed Project on water quality and water resources.  This 
examines both the cause of the impact and the water resource that 
could be affected.  A summary of the preliminary assessment results is 
provided below.

Power Generation Plant 
4.5.6 
The main potential impact that may result from construction and 
subsequent decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant would be 
from the risk of contaminated material entering a surface water body.  
There are, however, not anticipated to be any impacts on the water 
bodies listed above as the majority are a significant distance from the 
Power Generation Plant site.  Best practice would also be employed 
during construction and decommissioning to protect the water 
environment, in accordance with guidelines published by the EA.   
4.5.7 
During operation, the Power Generation Plant site would be equipped 
with a surface water drainage system and a sewerage system.  The 
surface water drainage system would remove any potentially polluted 
runoff, prior to reaching the main sewerage network.  It is currently 
anticipated that the on-site sewerage system would connect to a new 
onsite septic tank, which would be maintained and emptied by suitable 
contractors.  It is also predicted that the proposed Project would lead to 
a slight increase in the amount of runoff from within the Power 
Generation Plant site due to the increase in hardstanding.  However, 
this additional runoff would be captured by the surface water drainage 
system so that existing greenfield runoff rates are not exceeded.  An 
assessment of the potential for the application of sustainable drainage 
systems (SUDS) will be undertaken as the proposed Project design is 
refined. 
4.5.8 
Due to the intermittent water demand of the Power Generation Plant, it 
is likely that water would be tankered to site and stored in water storage 
tanks.  No surface water or groundwater abstraction would be required.  
An alternative option of using potable water from the town supply will 
be assessed in the ES. 
4.5.9 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects on local water quality and water resources from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant are not predicted. 
Gas Connection 
4.5.10 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects on local water quality and water resources from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Gas Connection 
are not predicted.  There are not considered to be significant 
differences in the potential impacts between the two Gas Connection 
route corridor options currently under consideration.

Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.5.11 
Both the Electrical Connection Compound options are located in areas 
that contain several unnamed surface water features.  As such, it is 
likely that these features may need to be crossed to facilitate the 
construction of the Electrical Connection Compound.  Such works, if 
required, would be carried out to industry best practices to ensure that 
the potential impacts are minimised as much as possible.   
4.5.12 
In addition, it is likely at a number of small watercourses may need to 
be crossed during the construction of the Electrical Connection.  Based 
on the preliminary assessment to date, it is anticipated that the impacts 
of Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 and Electrical 
Connection Compound option 2 would be similar to those for Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 1 and Electrical Connection 
Compound option 1, albeit to a lesser extent due to a reduced number 
of water bodies. 
4.5.13 
During operation, the Electrical Connection itself would be buried and 
would therefore have no impact on water resources, while water usage 
at the Electrical Connection Compound is expected to be minimal.  
Construction of a permanent access route along the Electrical 
Connection route would, however, result in the generating of additional 
surface water runoff, although this is likely to be minimal and would be 
controlled with an appropriately designed drainage system. 
4.5.14 
In summary, the preliminary environmental assessment has identified 
that impacts on local water quality and water resources from the 
construction of the Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection 
Compound cannot yet be ruled out, albeit the significance is likely to be 
negligible. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.5.15 
Once the Electrical Connection route corridor options have been 
refined the magnitude of impact on individual water bodies will be re-
assessed.  A Water Framework Directive Assessment will be 
undertaken on any waterbodies likely to require modification.  The 
results of this additional assessment work will be presented within the 
ES. 
4.6 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture 
4.6.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon geology, ground conditions 
and agriculture by, for example, the removal of good quality agricultural 
land.  The proposed Project also has the potential to result in impacts

on human health and sensitive ecological receptors from contamination 
(existing or created). 
BASELINE 
4.6.2 
An initial desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the 
baseline geology and ground conditions underlying the Project Site.  
The assessment studied information regarding previous land uses of 
the site and the surrounding area, the soils and geology present at the 
site and any potential contamination issues resulting from former site 
uses.  Much of the Project Site is covered by agricultural land, which is 
classified as being of ‘good to moderate quality’.  The soils in the area 
are classified as being slowly permeable, seasonally wet, slightly acid, 
but base-rich loamy and clayey soils.  The bedrock of the Project Site is 
classified as a Principal Aquifer.  The aquifer has a very low 
vulnerability to pollutants given the low leaching potential of the soils 
overlying the site.  Potential sources of contamination include the 
former Eye Airfield runways and fuel storage facilities and the existing 
Eye Chicken Litter Power Station.  Due to the proposed Project being 
sited on a the former Eye Airfield, the presence of unknown unexploded 
ordnances / munitions cannot be ruled out. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
4.6.3 
A conceptual site model approach has been used to assess the risk 
posed by contaminants on human health and sensitive ecological 
receptors.  This examines the potential sources of contamination (e.g. 
historical sources), the potential receptors that could be affected (e.g. 
soil and construction workers) and the pathways to these receptors 
(e.g. 
leaching 
in 
surface 
water 
and 
inhalation 
of 
airborne 
contaminants). 
Power Generation Plant 
4.6.4 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant would result in the 
sterilisation of up to 10 ha of good / moderate quality agricultural land, 
although at this stage this is not considered to be a significant impact.  
4.6.5 
Existing soil conditions are not anticipated to negatively impact upon 
construction workers.  Potential impacts to health would be 
appropriately mitigated by working in accordance with best practices 
and the use of correct and appropriate Personal Protective Equipment.  
These mitigation measures would be detailed within the CEMP. 
4.6.6 
The construction of deep foundations (e.g. piled foundations on to 
bedrock) could offer a preferential pathway for contaminants to impact 
upon groundwater bodies beneath the proposed Power Generation 
Plant site.  The depth of the bedrock which is classified as a Principal

- 32 - 
Aquifer is, however, well below the depth of any foundations that would 
be required for the construction of the Power Generation Plant and thus 
the potential to create a pathway to the underlying Aquifer is 
considered negligible. 
4.6.7 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, no further impacts on 
geology, soils and agriculture are anticipated as there would be no 
further ground disturbance. 
4.6.8 
The impacts during decommissioning would be temporary and in line 
with those described above for construction. 
4.6.9 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects on geology, ground conditions and agriculture from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant are not predicted.   
Gas Connection 
4.6.10 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, significant effects on 
geology, ground conditions and agriculture from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Gas Connection are not 
predicted.  The main difference between the Gas Connection route 
corridor options is that some agricultural land would be sterilised along 
Gas Connection route corridor option 2, whereas Gas Connection route 
corridor option 2 crosses developed land.  Once installed, there would 
be a permanent easement around the pipeline expected to be 
approximately 10 m wide, resulting in the permanent sterilisation of a 
narrow corridor of land.  This land is likely to be reinstated when the 
pipeline is decommissioned. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.6.11 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, significant effects on 
geology, ground conditions and agriculture from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Electrical Connection and 
Electrical Connection Compound are not predicted.  There are not 
considered to be significant differences in the potential impacts 
between 
the 
Electrical 
Connection 
and 
Electrical 
Connection 
Compound options currently under consideration. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.6.12 
As the proposed Project is refined a detailed desk based assessment 
will be carried out, along with further assessments including, but not 
limited to, a site walkover.  The potential for unknown unexploded

ordnances / munitions to be present at the site of the former Eye 
Airfield will also be explored further.  The results of this assessment 
work will be presented within the ES. 
4.7 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
4.7.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon the landscape character and 
visual amenity of the area. 
BASELINE 
4.7.2 
A preliminary landscape and visual impact assessment has been 
prepared after an initial site visit in June 2013.  This has identified that 
there are no nationally designated landscapes, English Heritage 
Registered Parks and Gardens or land designated by Natural England 
for its outstanding scenic, historic and scientific interest within 15 km of 
the Project Site.  The area in the immediate vicinity of the Project Site 
comprises medium to large scale industrial development within the 
former World War 2 airfield and is surrounded by semi-rural landscape, 
the A140 major transport route, prominent pylons and an overhead 
transmission line and small villages / farmsteads.  The Project Site and 
wider industrial estate are relatively flat.  Much of the southern part of 
the area is in agricultural use.  The overall sensitivity of this landscape 
is considered to be low due to a lack of local distinctiveness and the 
presence of out of keeping landscape elements. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.7.3 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant impacts would arise 
from the presence of large scale construction equipment and 
movement of construction related traffic. 
4.7.4 
During operation the introduction of the buildings and hard-surfaced 
areas associated with the Power Generation Plant site, would add man-
made elements to the landscape. It is currently predicted that the 
Power Generation Plant would be visible from the wider landscape to 
the south, south-east and south-west of the Power Generation Plant 
site. In general, the upper portions of the stack(s) (up to 30m high) 
would be visible, although these would be seen in the context of other 
tall industrial structures within Eye Airfield industrial estate. 
4.7.5 
As the proposed Project progresses a landscape strategy will be 
developed to help mitigate the adverse impacts.  This will consider, for 
example, the design, layout, selection of materials and colours for the

proposed Project structures and associated infrastructure and the 
extent of screen planting required. 
4.7.6 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction would be experienced. 
4.7.7 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects cannot yet be been ruled out on landscape and visual amenity, 
although effects would be localised due to the industrial character of 
the area surrounding the Power Generation Plant site, and by the 
extensive network of hedgerows and woodland within the vicinity of the 
area.  Localised effects arising from the Power Generation Plant would 
be of moderate significance and would reduce gradually as the 
perimeter landscape screen planting matures. 
Gas Connection 
4.7.8 
During construction, similar potential impacts to those identified for the 
Power Generation Plant may be experienced, although construction of 
the Gas Connection would be a smaller undertaking.   
4.7.9 
During operation, landscape and visual impacts would be substantially 
mitigated as the pipeline is buried underground, although the 
introduction of the AGI enclosed by security fencing 2m high, required 
for Gas Connection route corridor option 2, has the potential to cause 
adverse impacts.  Gas Connection route corridor option 2 would add 
man-made elements to an area of rural landscape, given that the route 
is situated within agricultural land.  In contrast, Gas Connection route 
corridor option 1 would add man-made elements to a landscape where 
similar structures already exist as it would connect directly into the 
adjacent National Grid Gas Compressor Station.  This option would, 
however, require the removal of mature tree planting on the western 
and/or southern boundary of the National Grid Gas Compressor 
Station. 
4.7.10 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
4.7.11 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects cannot yet be been ruled out on landscape and visual amenity 
from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Gas 
Connection.  Impacts on landscape and landscape character arising as 
a result of Gas Connection route corridor option 1 would have a slight 
to moderate significance, whereas impacts on visual amenity would 
have a slight significance, depending on the extent of screen planting

removed from the southern boundary of the National Grid Gas 
Compressor Station.  In contrast, impacts on landscape and landscape 
character and visual amenity arising as a result of Gas Connection 
route corridor option 2 would have a slight significance. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.7.12 
During construction, similar potential impacts to those identified for the 
Power Generation Plant may be experienced, although construction of 
the Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound would 
be a smaller undertaking.   
4.7.13 
During operation, landscape and visual impacts from the Electrical 
Connection would be substantially mitigated by burying the cable 
underground.  The route would also be designed to avoid loss of 
hedgerows and disruption to agriculture, where possible.  Once 
constructed, the Electrical Connection Compound would add man-
made elements to the landscape, which are not in keeping with the 
surrounding areas. The compound would be of a significant scale and 
would be visible over a wide area, particularly during the winter months 
following leaf fall.  Effects would be reduced by screen planting using 
native species.  There are not considered to be significant differences 
in the potential impacts between the Electrical Connection and 
Electrical Connection Compound options currently under consideration. 
4.7.14 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction would be experienced. 
4.7.15 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects cannot yet be been ruled out on landscape and visual amenity 
from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.7.16 
A detailed landscape and visual impact assessment is currently being 
undertaken, the methodology for which is based on current best 
practice and guidance.  It will include a visual survey during the winter 
to assess potential views of the Project when screening from vegetation 
is at its least effective.  Further consultation will be undertaken with 
MSDC, SCC, Babergh District Council, and South Norfolk Council in 
order 
to 
select 
appropriate 
viewpoints 
for 
the 
assessment.  
Consultation will also be undertaken with MSDC and SCC with respect 
to the landscape strategy for the Project.

Waste Management and Health 
4.8.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to generate a variety of waste material that 
would need to be handled and disposed of with care.  In addition, the 
proposed Project has the potential to impact upon public health. 
BASELINE 
4.8.2 
In this section, potential receptor groups refer only to human receptors 
that could potentially come into contact with contaminants resulting 
from the Project.  Receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site include 
surrounding towns and villages, namely Eye (1.7 km south east of the 
Power Generation Plant), Langton Green (1.3 km east of the Power 
Generation Plant), Yaxley (1.5 km South West of the Power Generation 
Plant) and Diss (4.75 km north of the Power Generation Plant) and 
adjacent commercial users include other businesses within the Eye 
Airfield Industrial Estate. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.8.3 
It is anticipated that the majority of waste would be generated during 
the construction and decommissioning phases of the Power Generation 
Plant, when significant quantities of wastes such as concrete, spoil and 
scrap metal would be produced. During operation, the production of 
waste is likely to be significantly reduced, although minimal quantities 
of both non-hazardous and hazardous waste would be likely to be 
produced, including used air filters, scrap metal, used insulation 
material, general office waste, and other miscellaneous wastes, as well 
as small quantities of waste water. 
4.8.4 
All of these types of waste can have a detrimental impact on the 
environment if not appropriately managed and controlled, including the 
potential to pollute adjacent land or water bodies.  PPL would, 
therefore, ensure that all waste would be dealt with in a manner that 
complies with the relevant regulations and (upon leaving the site) waste 
would be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors.  As 
such, taking into account potential mitigation measures, the preliminary 
environmental assessment has identified that the proposed Power 
Generation Plant is not predicted to have any likely significant effects 
on waste management. 
4.8.5 
At present, it is anticipated that the main potential impacts to public 
health arising from the proposed Power Generation Plant would result 
from changes to local air quality, although potential impacts may also 
arise from contaminated land, site run-off and noise impacts.  A

Conceptual Site Model approach has been used to assess the risks 
posed by contaminants to public health.  This examines the cause of 
the impact (e.g. stack emissions may result in a change in air quality), 
the potential human receptors that could be affected and the pathways 
to these receptors.  Based on the results of the preliminary 
environmental assessment, taking into account potential mitigation 
measures, the proposed Power Generation Plant is not predicted to 
have any likely significant effects on public health. 
Gas Connection 
4.8.6 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, there are not 
predicted to be likely significant effects on waste management and 
public health as a result of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection (regardless of which option is 
chosen). 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.8.7 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, there are not 
predicted to be likely significant effects on waste management and 
public health as a result of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning 
of 
the 
Electrical 
Connection 
and 
Electrical 
Connection Compound (regardless of which option is chosen). 
NEXT STEPS 
4.8.8 
Further assessment work will be undertaken to fully characterise any 
impacts on human health from noise and air quality from all aspects of 
the Project.  Further details on the likely quantities and composition of 
waste will also be provided in the ES, once more is known about the 
construction programme. 
4.9 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
4.9.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon the local transport network, 
through the generation of additional traffic movements. 
BASELINE 
4.9.2 
The Power Generation Plant site can be accessed from the existing 
road network via Castleton Way (an unrestricted country road) via an 
existing junction to the former main runway. Castleton Way provides 
access to the B1077 to the east and the A140 to the west.  The A140,

- 38 - 
which runs north-south linking Ipswich and Norwich, is a major 
transport route from which the national road network is easily reached.  
For all life cycle phases of the proposed Project, it is proposed that 
access to / from Castleton Way would be mainly via the A140.  In terms 
of public transport, Diss is the nearest railway station to the Power 
Generation Plant site, and is an important local transport hub 
approximately 5 km north of the Airfield.  An hourly bus service exists 
from Ipswich to Diss via Eye.  Castleton Way forms part of National 
Cycle Route 30 (Rivers Lowestoft to Kings Lynn via Diss).  A number of 
public rights of way are located within the proposed Project Site, 
although these are poorly connected. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.9.3 
During construction there is likely to be an increase of traffic on the 
A140 as construction workers travel to and from the Power Generation 
Plant site and Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) access the site.  
Abnormal load routing would be agreed with SCC officers in advance, 
which would ensure planned routes are agreed and adhered to and any 
street furniture is removed prior to arrival. 
4.9.4 
During operation there would be minimal impacts as operational staff 
numbers would be low and the delivery and removal of goods to the 
Power Generation Plant site are also expected to be low during the 
day.  Decommissioning impacts are likely to be similar to those from 
the construction phase. 
4.9.5 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects on traffic and transport cannot yet be ruled out from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant.  Potential effects are likely to be most significant for receptors 
within the local community and employees at the former Eye Airfield, 
although any user of the A140, B1077 and of the local public rights of 
way around the airfield could also be impacted.  During construction 
and decommissioning, impacts of a moderate significance are 
predicted on the A140 and Castleton Way junction and there would be 
a minor disruption to the road network during off peak times.  During 
operation, at this stage in the Project, the impacts on the surrounding 
road network are considered to be negligible.  This assessment may be 
refined in the ES.

Gas Connection 
4.9.6 
The number of construction workers required to construct the Gas 
Connection would be low in relation to the Power Generation Plant.  As 
such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with additional trips 
on the network.  During operation, maintenance vehicles are expected 
to be infrequent and are not anticipated to cause any detriment to the 
local transport network.  Access to both Gas Connection route corridor 
options 
would 
be 
via 
Castleton 
Way 
and 
Potash 
Lane. 
Decommissioning impacts are likely to be similar to those from the 
construction phase. 
4.9.7 
The main difference between the Gas Connection options is that there 
would be a requirement to undertake temporary road works across 
Potash Lane when constructing Gas Connection route corridor option 
2.  Any impacts from this would be controlled through temporary traffic 
management arrangements. 
4.9.8 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects on traffic and transport from the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection (regardless of which option is 
chosen) 
are 
not 
anticipated. 
 
During 
construction 
and 
decommissioning, there is predicted to be a low / minor increase of 
traffic levels on the A140 and Castleton Way and there would be minor 
planned disruption to the road network during off peak times.  During 
operation, at this stage in the Project, the impacts on the surrounding 
road network are considered to be negligible.  This assessment may be 
refined in the ES. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.9.9 
The number of construction workers required to construct the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound would be low in 
relation to the Power Generation Plant.  There would, however, be 
some additional traffic caused by the arrival and departure of 
construction workers and HGVs delivering and removing goods from 
the construction corridor.  The roads which could be impacted include 
the A140, Eye Road, The Street and Old Norwich Road. 
4.9.10 
During construction, temporary traffic management would be required 
as both Electrical Connection route corridor options run across the 
A140, Old Norwich Road and Leys lane.  Consideration will be given to 
off peak traffic working over the A140 to limit adverse impacts on traffic. 
4.9.11 
For both Electrical Connection Compound options, the preferred option 
for access is for construction of a new access road that would allow

access from Old Norwich Road.  This would cater for all vehicle types 
including abnormal loads, although maintenance vehicles are expected 
to be infrequent and are not anticipated to cause any adverse impact 
on the local transport network. Alternative access road options will be 
discussed in the ES. 
4.9.12 
Decommissioning impacts are likely to be similar to those from the 
construction phase. 
4.9.13 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, likely significant 
effects on traffic and transport cannot yet be ruled out from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound (regardless of which 
option is chosen).  During construction, there is predicted to be a minor 
/ moderate increase of traffic levels on the A140, Eye Road, The Street 
and Old Norwich Road and there would be minor planned disruption to 
the road network during off peak times.  In addition, road works over 
the A140, Old Norwich Road and Leys Lane during trenching works 
would result in a minor impact on the A140 and negligible impacts on 
Old Norwich Road and Leys Lane.  During operation, at this stage in 
the Project, the impacts on the surrounding road network are 
considered to be negligible.  During decommissioning there would be a 
limited impact on the A140 and Castleton Way junction, as well as 
minor planned disruption to the road network during off peak times.  
This assessment may be refined in the ES. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.9.14 
A detailed Transport Assessment (TA) is currently being prepared, the 
scope of which has been defined in consultation with SCC.  As the TA 
progresses, transport related environmental effects will be assessed for 
the following factors: traffic flows, delay (time spent in traffic queues), 
road safety, intimidation and fear, severance (the perceived division 
that can occur within a community when it becomes separated by a 
major traffic artery) and pedestrian amenity (relative pleasantness of a 
journey).  The results of this assessment will be presented within the 
ES. 
4.10 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology 
4.10.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon both surface and buried 
archaeological assets, as well as having an impact upon the setting 
and appreciation of assets of Cultural Heritage importance, including 
surrounding Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation 
Areas.

BASELINE 
4.10.2 
An archaeological desk based assessment has been undertaken which 
has investigated all historical records within the Scoping Report 
proposed redline boundary (referred to as the desk based assessment 
Study Area) and the surrounding 1 km (referred to as the 1 km study 
area).  A site visit was also carried out in June 2013.  The desk based 
assessment has identified 47 heritage assets within the 1 km study 
area.  Of these, 11 heritage assets have been recorded within the desk 
based assessment Study Area, three of which are Grade II listed 
buildings.  A total of 43 findspots reported to the Portable Antiquities 
Scheme have also been recovered within the 1 km study area.  Two 
non-designated heritage assets are located within the boundary of the 
Power Generation Plant site: HA30 - field boundary, and HA31/EYE072 
– former Eye Airfield.  One non-designated heritage asset is located 
within Gas Connection route corridor option 2: MSF 27050 - artefact 
scatter.  Five non-designated heritage assets are present within 
Electrical 
Connection 
route 
corridor 
option 
1: 
12/YAX006 
- 
findspot/pottery, 18/YAX007 - findspot/flint, MSF27002 - findspot/bow 
brooch, MSF047 - findspot/artefact and MSF030 - findspot/metalwork.  
In addition, six non-designated assets are located within Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 2: 9/YAX005 - findspot/lead seal, 
MSF27032 - findspot/key, MSF27041 - findspot/flint, MSF225 - 
findspot/metalwork, MSF237 - findspot/metalwork and MSF242 - 
findspot/metalwork.  There is also the potential for previously unknown 
heritage assets (buried archaeological remains) to be present within the 
desk based assessment Study Area. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.10.3 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant, there would be a 
direct impact on the two identified non-designated heritage assets from 
construction related ground disturbance.  There is also potential for a 
direct impact on previously unknown buried archaeological assets.  
Although no listed buildings lie within the Power Generation Plant site, 
due to the low-lying nature of the local topography there could be an 
indirect impact on the setting of quite a number of listed buildings.  
4.10.4 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, following a suitable 
programme of archaeological mitigation, there would be no direct 
impacts on either known or potential heritage assets.  It is anticipated, 
however that the indirect adverse impact on the setting of the listed 
buildings (as discussed above) would continue.

- 42 - 
4.10.5 
During decommissioning there would be no direct impacts on either 
known or potential heritage assets, but there would be an indirect 
positive impact on the setting of the listed buildings. 
4.10.6 
Based on the results of the preliminary assessment, taking into account 
potential mitigation measures, likely significant effects cannot yet be 
been ruled out as a result of indirect visual impact on listed buildings 
within 1 km of the Power Generation Plant site. 
Gas Connection 
4.10.7 
During the construction of Gas Connection there is the potential for a 
direct impact on previously unknown buried archaeological assets.  In 
addition, although no listed buildings lie within either of the Gas 
Connection route corridor options it is likely that due to the low-lying 
nature of the local topography that there would be an indirect impact on 
the setting of a number of this asset type, although due to the nature of 
the works the significance of the effect would be very low and 
temporary. For Gas Connection route corridor option 2, construction 
works would also potentially impact on the site of the artefact scatter, 
however, the artefacts (finds) have been removed from site and so the 
importance of the findspot relates to the potential for unknown 
associated heritage assets to be present rather than the artefacts. 
4.10.8 
During operation of the Gas Connection, following a suitable 
programme of archaeological mitigation, there would be no direct 
impacts on either known or potential heritage assets and no indirect 
impacts on the setting of the listed buildings. 
4.10.9 
During decommissioning of the Gas Connection there would be no 
direct impacts on either known or potential heritage assets, although 
there could be a temporary indirect adverse impact on the setting of the 
listed buildings if infrastructure is removed.  The effect would be of very 
low significance and temporary. 
4.10.10 
Based on the results of the preliminary assessment, taking into account 
potential mitigation measures, likely significant effects cannot yet be 
been ruled out on cultural and heritage and archaeology as a result of 
the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Gas 
Connection. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.10.11

associated heritage assets to be present rather than the artefacts.  
There is also the potential for a direct impact on previously unknown 
buried archaeological assets.  In addition, as with the Gas Connection, 
there could be an indirect impact on the setting of a number of listed 
buildings, although due to the nature of the works the significance of 
the effect would be very low and temporary. 
4.10.12 
During operation, following a suitable programme of archaeological 
mitigation, there would be no direct impacts on either known or 
potential heritage assets, although there would be an indirect impact on 
listed buildings throughout the operation of the Electrical Connection 
Compound.   
4.10.13 
During decommissioning of the Electrical Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound there would be no direct impacts on either 
known or potential heritage assets, although there could be a 
temporary indirect adverse impact on the setting of the listed buildings 
if infrastructure is removed.  The degree of indirect impact would be 
very low significance and temporary. 
4.10.14 
Based on the results of the preliminary assessment, taking into account 
potential mitigation measures, likely significant effects cannot yet be 
been ruled out on cultural and heritage and archaeology as a result of 
the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Electrical 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.10.15 
A written scheme of investigation detailing the archaeological mitigation 
and comprising a method statement will be compiled and submitted to 
the Suffolk County Archaeologist for comment.  The mitigation will 
include a programme of geophysical survey (magnetometer) to be 
undertaken within the proposed Project Site. This will inform intrusive 
site investigations (trial trenching), which will target areas of known 
archaeology and potential archaeology.  It is likely that an 
archaeological watching brief will also be undertaken in specific areas.  
The results of this assessment work will be presented within the ES.

Socio-economics 
4.11.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to significantly impact upon the local economy 
and community through for example, job creation and increased use of 
local services.  Recreation and tourism in the area may also be 
impacted.

BASELINE 
4.11.2 
The local area surrounding the proposed Project is characterised by 
relatively low levels of unemployment, with a relatively high proportion 
of people employed in skilled manual labour.  Retail occupations are 
the main employment category in the local area, but manufacturing, 
construction and agriculture type employment is also higher than the 
national average.  The population in the area is predicted to increase 
between 2012 and 2021, although there is a weakening population 
structure with a high and enlarging retirement age population. 
4.11.3 
Within 5 km of the Project Site there are a range of community services 
such as schools, libraries, care homes, hospitals, dentists, community 
centres and parks.  Tourism related businesses are present, but not at 
a large scale and Mid Suffolk has a below national average proportion 
of tourism related jobs. 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS 
Power Generation Plant 
4.11.4 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant would have minor positive impacts on the socio-
economic status of the area through both employment creation and 
capital expenditure and worker spending in the local economy. It is 
anticipated that up to 250 workers would be required at the site during 
peak periods during the construction phase.  These workers would not 
only benefit the economy directly, but would also have knock on effects 
on other businesses (e.g. guest houses and bakeries).  During 
operation, up to 15 skilled workers would be directly employed at the 
Power Generation Plant site, but additional related employment 
opportunities may arise in the local and wider economy. 
4.11.5 
Impacts on tourism and community infrastructure during the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant may occur as result of visual, noise, traffic / accessibility and air 
quality impacts, however, these impacts are not predicted to be 
significant.   
Gas Connection 
4.11.6 
During construction of the Gas Connection there are likely to be minor 
positive socio-economic impacts due to employment creation and 
capital expenditure and worker spending in the local economy.  Minor 
negative impacts would be felt on tourism and community infrastructure 
in the local area as a result of visual, noise, traffic and accessibility, and 
air quality impacts.

4.11.7 
During operation the Gas Connection would be buried underground, 
although minor negative impacts could be felt on tourism and 
community infrastructure in the local area as a result of visual, noise 
and traffic / accessibility impacts related to the AGI. 
4.11.8 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
4.11.9 
There are not considered to be significant differences in the potential 
impacts between the two Gas Connection route corridor options 
currently under consideration. 
Electrical Connection and Electrical Connection Compound 
4.11.10 
During construction of the Electrical Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound there are likely to be minor positive socio-
economic impacts due to employment creation and capital expenditure 
and worker spending in the local economy.  Minor negative impacts 
would be felt on tourism and community infrastructure in the local area 
as a result of visual, noise and traffic / accessibility impacts.

would 
be 
buried 
underground, although minor negative impacts could be felt on tourism 
and community infrastructure in the local area as a result of visual, 
noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality impacts from the Electrical 
Connection Compound. 
4.11.12 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
4.11.13 
There are not considered to be significant differences in the potential 
impacts between the two Electrical Connection and Electrical 
Connection Compound options currently under consideration. 
NEXT STEPS 
4.11.14 
A detailed assessment of the economic impact of the proposed Project 
will be undertaken.  This will be informed in part by a Business Survey, 
which will ask local tourism-related businesses in the area what impact 
the proposed Project would have on their business and on tourism in 
the wider area.  The results of this assessment work will be presented 
within the ES. 
4.12 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.12.1 
Cumulative impacts can be either:

 
Type 1 Cumulative Impacts: These are combined effects of different 
types of impact on a single receptor.  For example: dust, noise and 
visual impacts resulting from construction and operation of the 
proposed 
Project 
and 
other 
reasonably 
foreseeable 
future 
developments; or   
 
Type 2 Cumulative Impacts: These are the same type of impact 
from the proposed project and current or reasonably foreseeable 
future developments which may individually be insignificant, but could 
be cumulatively significant.  For example: cumulative traffic impacts 
during construction. 
4.12.2 
As part of the preliminary cumulative impact assessment a number of 
(current or reasonably foreseeable future) developments have been 
considered as part of the cumulative impacts, including: 
 
Diss National Grid Gas Compressor Station (operational); 
 
Eye Chicken Litter Power Station (operational); 
 
Eye Airfield Wind Turbines (operational); 
 
Eye Wind Power Ltd (consented) 
 
Industrial development within the former Eye Airfield (operational); 
 
National Grid Electrical Transmission System (operational). 
4.12.3 
Based on the assessment work done to date, potential for significant 
cumulative impacts to arise from the majority of these developments will 
likely be ruled out as the EIA progresses.  The primary development that, at 
this stage, may have a cumulative impact is the consented, but not yet built, 
Eye Wind Power Ltd wind turbine development.  
4.12.4 
There are also other possible cumulative impacts with existing 
developments such as the Eye Chicken Litter Power Station and the 
existing Eye Airfield Wind Turbines.  These developments in associated 
with the proposed Project could cause cumulative landscape and visual 
impacts, due to ’Landscape Saturation’.  This is the phenomenon where 
slow, piecemeal developments are introduced to the landscape over an 
extended period of time, which could result in small incremental impacts, 
but the cumulative impact of all the developments when considered 
together could be greater. 
4.12.5 
A similar situation can occur where numerous, relatively low noise sources 
can, result in a significant increase in background noise over a period of 
time.   
4.12.6 
Both of these processes will be considered, and reported upon in greater 
detail in the ES when all relevant studies have been completed.
