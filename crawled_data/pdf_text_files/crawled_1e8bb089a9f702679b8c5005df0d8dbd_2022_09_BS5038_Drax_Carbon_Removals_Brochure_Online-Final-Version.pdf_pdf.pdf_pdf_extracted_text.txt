The Opportunity
Carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) through BECCS 
(Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) by Drax are:
Going further, 
faster with 
carbon removals
The science is clear. To tackle climate 
change and reach net zero, the world 
needs to remove carbon dioxide that’s 
already in the atmosphere — reducing 
dangerous CO2 levels that are already 
causing extreme weather events, rising 
sea levels, and increased forest fires.

Long term contracts for our high integrity 
carbon removal process guarantees 
sustainability and financial certainty.
Working alongside carbon reduction 
measures and traditional offsets, CDRs 
can be delivered rapidly at scale through 
BECCS by Drax, enabling you to meet your 
climate commitments faster.
Purchasing CDRs not only complements 
your business, it enables the growth of the 
carbon removal market. 
Procure CDRs that give your business 
confidence that carbon is being 
removed from the atmosphere and 
permanently stored.
BECCS by Drax is one of the most 
affordable CDR technology available. 
With CDRs available at competitive prices.

Every business sector will need to reduce 
its carbon emissions, but reducing 
emissions won’t be enough. To meet our 
climate targets on time, we must also 
remove carbon from the atmosphere. 
Beyond this, the U.S. will need to remove 
0.8 to 2 billion1 metric tonnes of carbon 
by 2050 to do its share of tackling climate 
change. Given the scale of the challenge
and what’s at stake, experts everywhere, 
including the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), the California 
Air Resources Board (CARB) and the U.S. 
Government, agree that to reach net zero 
we must remove dangerous levels of 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
It will permanently remove 2 million tons 
of carbon from the atmosphere while 
also generating 2 terawatt hours of 24/7 
renewable power. And this is just the 
beginning. Drax is developing a pipeline 
of BECCS projects in the U.S. that will be 
available as early as 2025.
BECCS is the most scalable and affordable
carbon removal technology available and
can be deployed quickly — playing a key
role in achieving a clean energy grid by
2035. BECCS offers high-integrity,
permanent carbon removals that
can complement your business strategy
to decarbonize directly and enable you
to meet your net zero goals. Now is your
chance. Capture the opportunity and go
further, faster with BECCS by Drax.

How it works
Why is BECCS important for 
decarbonization?
Unlike the linear, irreversible process 
of emitting carbon from fossil fuels, 
sustainable biomass exists in a closed 
carbon cycle. By adding carbon capture 
and storage technology, the carbon cycle 
is broken. Instead of being released into 
the atmosphere, carbon is transported and 
stored in a secure, geological formation 
underground, producing what’s known as 
an engineered carbon dioxide removal.
How is the carbon removed 
from the atmosphere?
BECCS uses a post-combustion carbon 
capture process, where solvents isolate 
carbon from the flue gases produced when 
the biomass is combusted. The captured 
carbon is pressurized and turned into a 
liquid-like substance so it can then be 
permanently sequestered underground.
How is the carbon stored?
Captured carbon can be safely and 
permanently injected deep underground 
into naturally occurring porous rock 
formations. The carbon is trapped in 
multiple ways:
1. Structurally — an impermeable 
caprock above the reservoir stops CO2 
migrating back to the surface.
2. In solution — porous rocks often 
contain salty water which CO2 
dissolves into.
3. Residually — as tiny isolated bubbles in 
the pore space of the rock.
4. As a mineral — CO2 can react with 
the surrounding rock creating new 
solid minerals. 
The process of BECCS
BECCS is the process of generating renewable electricity 
from sustainable biomass. The carbon created during 
the process is then captured and permanently stored — 
not only reducing carbon emissions but removing them 
permanently from the atmosphere.
BECCS by Drax can help the U.S. 
provide climate leadership quickly 
and affordably by enabling the rapid 
procurement of renewable, 24/7 
baseload electricity and capturing 
carbon from the atmosphere.

The right 
biomass
 Residues of forest harvesting, an 
activity that is carried out to maintain 
forests while also meeting the demand 
of solid wood product sectors such as 
furniture and construction.
Sawmill residues (or “secondary 
residues”) such as sawdust, chips, 
and agricultural waste. 
Low-grade roundwood or pulpwood, 
often resulting from the sustainable 
forest management activity, 
“thinning,” which foresters carry out 
to improve the density of trees. It 
involves the removal of trees that are 
either dead, rotting, or diseased, to 
improve the quality and growth of the 
remaining trees.
These activities encourage growth 
and reduce the risk of forest fires 
and pest infestation, safeguarding 
biodiversity across a range of species. 
The National Climate Assessment 
found that the number of heatwaves, 
heavy downpours, and major 
hurricanes have increased in the U.S., 
and the strength of these weather 
events has also increased. With more 
extreme climate conditions expected, 
carbon removals are needed to help 
mitigate and reduce the impact.
Sourcing the right biomass
Ensuring the biomass that we use for BECCS is sustainable 
and responsibly sourced is fundamental to our business.

for us all
Drax believes in creating climate, nature, 
and people positive outcomes through 
using sustainable biomass for both 
renewable power and CDRs. We have a 
proven track record in decarbonization, 
transforming Western Europe’s largest 
coal-fired power station to use sustainable 
biomass and cutting our own fossil carbon 
emissions by more than 90% since 2012. 
We have a multi-site, multi-technology 
portfolio of flexible, low-carbon and 
renewable power assets, are a world 
leader of sustainable biomass production, 
and aim to capture 12 million tons of 
carbon removals every year by 2030.
