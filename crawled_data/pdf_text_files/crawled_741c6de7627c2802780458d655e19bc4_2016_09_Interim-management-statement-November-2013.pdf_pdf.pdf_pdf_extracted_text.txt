DRAX GROUP PLC 
(Symbol: DRX) 
 
Interim Management Statement 
 
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 July 2013 to 
date. 
 
Trading Performance  
Since publishing our half year results on 30 July, trading conditions in the markets in which 
we operate have continued to be good.  
 
We have also benefited from solid operating performance from our coal generating units and 
the performance of our first unit converted to burn biomass in place of coal has been 
encouraging. In addition, commissioning of our new biomass delivery, storage and 
distribution systems is progressing very well. 
 
As a result, we now anticipate that full year EBITDA(1) and underlying earnings per share(2) 
for 2013 will be materially ahead of current market consensus forecasts(3). 
 
Power Sales Under Contract for 2013 and 2014 
We have strengthened our contracted position, including additional power sales of 3.4TWh 
for 2014 compared to the position reported in our half year results announcement. As at 6 
November 2013, the power sales under contract for 2013 and 2014 were as follows:  
 
 
2013 
2014 
Power sales (TWh) comprising: 
25.6

– Fixed price power sales (TWh)

 at an average achieved price (per MWh) (4) 
at £51.1 
at £53.1 
– Fixed margin and structured power sales (TWh) (5) 
0.4 
2.6 
 
 
 
 
 
Biomass Transformation  
Drax hosted a capital markets day for investors and analysts at Drax Power Station on 17 
October, which focused on progress of the Group’s on-going transformation to a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled electricity generator.  
 
We confirmed at this event that we have so far made good progress with the transformation. 
In particular, commissioning of the new on-site facilities for the first converted unit is on 
schedule to be complete by year end and we remain on track to convert our second unit in 
the second quarter of 2014. Capital investment is on schedule and budget.  
 
We now have over six months’ experience operating the largest converted unit in the world. 
As described above, the unit is performing well and, whilst optimisation work continues, we 
have developed technical solutions to deliver output of 600MW from a converted Drax unit. 
 
 
 
 
Presentation materials from the capital markets day are available on the Group’s web site 
and may be accessed via the following link:

Financial Position 
Other than as described above, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any 
material change in the underlying financial position of the Group during the period. 
 
We will announce our preliminary results for the year ending 31 December 2013 on 18 
February 2014. 
 
 
Notes: 
(1) EBITDA is profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains/losses on derivative 
contracts. 
(2) Underlying earnings per share excludes the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts, and exceptional items. 
(3) Drax calculated consensus based on the average of market forecasts (published since 1 July 2013) of £203 
million for EBITDA and 27 pence for underlying earnings per share. 
(4) Fixed price power sales include approximately 2.2TWh supplied to Centrica in the period 1 January 2013 to 6 
November 2013 under the five year 300MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
(5) Fixed margin and structured power sales include approximately 0.4TWh in 2013 and 2.6TWh in 2014 in 
connection with the above contract. Under this contract the Group will supply power on terms which include 
Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices, and delivering matching CO2 emissions 
allowances amounting in aggregate to approximately 2.4 million tonnes in each of 2013 and 2014. The 
contract provides the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green spreads agreed in October 2009.
