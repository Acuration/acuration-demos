Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2016
Voting arrangements
Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM will be by poll, 
rather than on a show of hands, so that all votes are included whether or 
not the shareholder is able to attend the meeting. The Board believes 
this to be the most democratic procedure for voting on the Resolutions 
as member votes will be counted according to the number of shares 
held.
The results of the voting at the meeting and the number of proxy votes 
cast for and against and the number of votes actively withheld in 
respect of each of the Resolutions proposed at the meeting will be 
announced to the London Stock Exchange as soon as practicable 
following the meeting and will also appear on the Company’s website 
www.drax.com.
The Company has included on the Form of Proxy, and the Form of 
Direction, a “Vote withheld” option in order for shareholders to abstain 
from voting on any particular Resolution. However, an abstention is not 
a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion 
of votes “For” or “Against” the relevant Resolution.
Recommendation
The directors of the Company consider that the Resolutions to be put to 
the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its members as a 
whole.
Accordingly, the directors unanimously recommend that you vote in 
favour of all the proposed Resolutions as they intend to do so in respect 
of their own beneficial interests.
Yours sincerely
Philip Cox CBE
Chairman

Notice of the Annual General Meeting (continued)

Drax Group plc   
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2016
Resolution 1
To receive and adopt the Company’s Annual report and accounts
The directors are required to present to the meeting the Annual report 
and accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. This 
includes (i) the audited accounts (ii) the directors’ report; (iii) the 
directors’ remuneration report; (iv) the strategic report; and (v) the 
report of the auditor of the Company on the audited accounts and the 
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report. Resolution 1 seeks 
shareholder approval to receive and adopt the Company’s Annual report 
and accounts.
Resolution 2
Directors’ remuneration report
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Annual statement to 
shareholders by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the 
Annual report on remuneration which can be found on pages 75 to 94 of 
the Annual report and accounts. The Annual report on remuneration 
gives details of the implementation of the Company’s current 
Remuneration Policy in terms of the payments and share awards made 
to the directors in connection with their performance and that of the 
Company during the year ended 31 December 2015. This vote is advisory 
and will not affect the way in which the Remuneration Policy has been 
implemented.
The Company’s auditor during the year, Deloitte LLP, has audited those 
parts of the directors’ remuneration report that are required to be 
audited and their report may be found on pages 99 to 103 of the Annual 
report and accounts.
Resolution 3
To approve the final dividend
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval to declare the final dividend of 
0.6 pence per ordinary share, which is recommended by the directors for 
payment to shareholders on the register of members of the Company on 
22 April 2016. If approved by shareholders at the AGM, the final dividend 
will be paid on 13 May 2016.
Resolutions 4 to 10
To elect the directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all directors retire at 
least every three years and that all newly-appointed directors retire at 
the first AGM following their appointment. However, and in accordance 
with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
directors have resolved that they will all retire and that those wishing to 
serve again shall submit themselves for re-election by the shareholders. 
Accordingly, each of the directors will retire at the forthcoming AGM 
and, with the exception of Melanie Gee who is not seeking re-election, 
the remaining directors, each being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election (or, in the case of Will Gardiner and Andy Koss who were 
appointed since the last AGM, election) through separate Resolutions 
numbered 4 to 10. Each of the director’s biographical notes are set out 
on pages 62 to 64 of the Annual report and accounts.
The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-
executive directors being proposed for election or re-election meet the 
independence criteria prescribed in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
as all are independent in character and judgement and there are no 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear 
to affect, their judgement.
During the year, the Board completed an annual evaluation of its 
performance and that of its Committees and individual directors. 
Following that evaluation, the Chairman is satisfied that the 
performance of each director standing for re-election continues to be 
effective and that each director continues to demonstrate commitment 
to the role. More information about these matters can be found on page 
69 of the Annual report and accounts.
Resolutions 11 and 12
Reappointment of auditor and determination of their remuneration
The Company must appoint or reappoint the auditor at every general 
meeting at which accounts are presented and it is normal practice for 
the Company’s directors, acting through the Audit Committee, to be 
authorised to determine the auditor’s remuneration.
Deloitte LLP has advised its willingness to continue in office as auditor 
of the Company.
Resolution 13
To give authority to make certain expenditure in accordance with the 
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (the “2000 
Act”) imposed restrictions on companies making donations to EU political 
organisations or incurring EU political expenditure without shareholders’ 
consent. It is not the policy of the Company to make donations to political 
parties and the directors have no intention of changing that policy.
However, it is possible that normal business activities and certain types of 
expenditure, which might not be thought to be political expenditure in the 
usual sense, could require shareholders’ consent under the 2000 Act. For 
example, activities such as communicating with government and political 
parties at local, national and European level, expenditure on organisations 
concerned with policy review, law reform and representation of the 
business community and making provisions for employees to take time off 
work to campaign for and hold public office could fall within the wide 
definition of EU political expenditure. In view of the broad wording 
adopted in the 2000 Act, and the Board’s wish to avoid any inadvertent 
infringement of it, it is seeking shareholders’ consent for the Company, and 
any wholly owned subsidiary company, to incur total annual expenditure 
for such purposes of not more than £200,000 in the 12-month period 
ending on the anniversary of the conclusion of the AGM. This authority will 
not be used to make political donations as they are normally understood; 
including contributions towards any general political party expenses or in 
connection with general election campaigns.
It is the intention that the Company will seek to renew this authority, if 
appropriate, at each subsequent AGM.
Resolution 14
Authority of directors to allot shares
The authority given to the directors to allot further shares in the capital 
of the Company requires the prior authorisation of the shareholders in 
general meeting under Section 551 Companies Act 2006. Upon the 
passing of Resolution 14 the directors will have authority (pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of the Resolution) to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £15,659,604, which is approximately one-third of the 
current issued ordinary share capital as at 13 March 2016 (being the 
latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice). This 
authority will expire immediately following the AGM in 2017 or on 
30 June 2017, whichever is the earlier.
In addition, in accordance with the Investment Association Share Capital 
Management Guidelines (which set out the expectations of institutional 
investors in relation to, among other things, the authority of directors to 
allot shares), upon the passing of Resolution 14, the directors will have 
authority (pursuant to paragraph (b) of the Resolution) to allot ordinary 
shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders 
up to a maximum nominal value of £31,319,208, as reduced by the nominal 
amount of any shares issued under paragraph (a) of Resolution 14. This 
amount (before any reduction) represents approximately two-thirds of 
the Company’s current issued ordinary share capital as at 13 March 2016 
(being the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice). 
This authority will also expire immediately following the next AGM or on 
30 June 2017, whichever is the earlier. As a result, if Resolution 14 is 
passed, the directors could allot shares representing up to two-thirds of 
its current issued share capital pursuant to a rights issue.
PART C
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM
6
Drax Group plc   
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2016
The directors will continue to seek to renew these authorities at each 
AGM, in accordance with current best practice from time to time.
The directors have no current plans to exercise this authority except in 
connection with employee share plans.
As at 13 March 2016, being the latest practicable date before publication 
of this Notice, the Company held no equity securities in treasury.
Resolution 15
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
If the directors wish to exercise the authority under Resolution 14 and 
offer shares (or sell any shares which the Company may purchase and 
elect to hold as treasury shares) for cash, the Companies Act 2006 
requires that, unless shareholders have given specific authority for the 
waiver of their statutory pre-emption rights, the new shares must be 
offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing 
shareholdings. In certain circumstances, it may be in the best interests 
of the Company to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) for 
cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion 
to their holdings.
Resolution 15 would authorise the directors to do this by allowing the 
directors to allot shares for cash (i) by way of a rights issue (subject to 
certain exclusions), (ii) by way of an open offer or other offer of securities 
(not being a rights issue) in favour of existing shareholders in proportion 
to their shareholdings (subject to certain exclusions) and (iii) otherwise 
than under (i) or (ii), up to an aggregate nominal value of £2,348,941 
which is equivalent to approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the company on 13 March 2016 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this Notice). The Resolution also applies 
to the sale and re-issue of ordinary shares held as treasury shares by the 
Company.
If approved by the shareholders, the authority contained in Resolution 
16 will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM or on 
30 June 2017. The directors intend to renew such power at successive 
AGMs in accordance with current best practice.
The directors have no current plans to exercise this authority except in 
connection with employee share plans and any scrip dividend plan (but 
they consider its grant to be appropriate in order to preserve maximum 
flexibility for the future).
In addition, and in line with best practice, the Company has not issued 
more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a non-pre-emptive basis 
over the last three years. In accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities, the 
directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) for cash on a 
non-pre-emptive basis in any rolling three-year period without prior 
consultation with shareholders.
As at 13 March 2016, being the latest practicable date before the 
publication of this Notice, the Company held no equity securities in 
treasury.
Resolution 16
To authorise the Company to purchase its own shares
This Resolution is to authorise the Company to buy back up to 
40,668,310 ordinary shares. The authority would expire at the 
conclusion of the 2017 AGM or, if earlier, on 20 October 2017. The 
directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent AGMs in 
accordance with current best practice.
The Resolution specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares which 
may be purchased (representing 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital as at 13 March 2016) and the maximum and minimum 
prices at which they may be bought, exclusive of expenses, reflecting 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules.
The directors have no present intention of exercising this power other 
than with a view for use in relation to the Company’s share plans and the 
granting of this authority should not be taken to imply that any ordinary 
shares will be purchased, other than in relation to share plans. Except in 
relation to share plans, no purchase of ordinary shares will be made 
unless it is expected that the effect will be to increase earnings per 
share and the directors consider it to be in the best interests of all 
shareholders.
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company is allowed to hold its own 
shares in treasury following a buy back, instead of having to cancel 
them. This gives the Company the ability to re-issue treasury shares 
quickly and cost-effectively (including pursuant to the authority under 
Resolution 15 above) and provides the Company with additional 
flexibility in the management of its capital base.
Such shares may be re-sold for cash but all rights attaching to them, 
including voting rights and any right to receive dividends, are suspended 
whilst they are held in treasury. If the directors exercise the authority 
conferred by Resolution 16, the Company will have the option of either 
holding in treasury or of cancelling any of its own shares purchased 
pursuant to this authority and will decide at the time of purchase which 
option to pursue.
The total number of options to subscribe for, and awards over, shares 
outstanding at 13 March 2016, being the latest practicable date before 
the publication of this Notice, was 7,604,764. This represents 
approximately 1.87% of the issued share capital at that date. If the 
Company was to buy back the maximum number of ordinary shares 
permitted pursuant to this Resolution then the total number of options 
to subscribe for ordinary shares, outstanding at 13 March 2016, would 
represent approximately 2.08% of the reduced issued share capital.
Resolution 17
To allow general meetings to be held on 14 clear days’ notice in certain 
circumstances
Resolution 17 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold general 
meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice. The Shareholders’ 
Rights Regulations state that the notice period required for general 
meetings of the Company is 21 days, unless shareholders approve a 
shorter notice period, which cannot, however, be less than 14 clear days. 
AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
In order to preserve the Company’s ability to call general meetings (other 
than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice, Resolution 17 seeks such 
approval. The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of 
routine for such meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the 
business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of 
shareholders as a whole.
Note that the Companies Act 2006 requires that, in order to be able to 
call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company 
must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for 
that meeting. The Company provides this facility (see paragraph 11 of 
Part D on page 8 of this document for the Company’s arrangements for 
electronic proxy appointments).

Drax Group plc   
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2016
Entitlement to attend and vote
1. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 (as amended) and for the purposes of Section 
360B CA 2006, the Company specifies that only those shareholders 
registered on the Register at 6.00pm on the day two business days 
before the date of the meeting (the “Specified Time”) (or if the 
meeting is adjourned to a time more than 48 hours after the 
Specified Time, by 6.00pm on the day which is two business days 
prior to the time of the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend 
and vote thereat in respect of the number of shares registered in 
their name at that time. If the meeting is adjourned to a time not 
more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, that time will also apply 
for the purposes of determining the entitlement of members to 
attend and vote (and for the purposes of determining the number of 
votes they may cast) at the adjourned meeting. Changes to the 
Register after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in 
determining rights to attend and vote.
2. If you have sold or transferred all your shares, this booklet and any 
accompanying documents (but not the personalised Form of Proxy 
or Form of Direction) should be passed to the person through whom 
the sale or transfer was made for transmission to the purchaser or 
transferee.
Appointment of proxies
3. If you are a member of the Company, at the time set out in note 1 
above, you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all 
or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. 
Completion and return of a Form of Proxy will not prevent a member 
from attending in person and voting at the meeting. If a member 
appoints more than one proxy to attend the meeting, each proxy 
must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that member.
 
If a member wishes to appoint more than one proxy and so requires 
additional proxy forms, the member should contact the Company’s 
Registrars, Equiniti Limited, at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, 
West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using their telephone helpline service 
on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK . Lines are open from 8.30am 
to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday – excluding Bank Holidays; or 
+44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK.
4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must 
attend the meeting for the member’s vote to be counted. Your proxy 
could be the Chairman, another director of the Company or another 
person who has agreed to attend to represent you. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman or another person (or persons) as your proxy 
using the Form of Proxy are set out in the notes to the Form of Proxy. 
Appointing a proxy does not preclude you from attending the 
meeting and voting in person.
5. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these 
notes and the notes on the Form of Proxy. A Form of Proxy is 
enclosed. To be effective, the Form of Proxy must be completed and 
signed and, together with the power of attorney or authority, if any, 
under which it is signed (or a duly certified copy of any such power or 
authority) must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars not later 
than 48 hours, excluding non-business days, before the time of the 
meeting or must be lodged using the CREST proxy voting services 
(see note 7 below). Return of a completed Form of Proxy will not 
preclude a member from attending and voting personally at the 
meeting.
6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders 
purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the 
most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the 
order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Register 
in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being deemed the 
most senior).
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the 
meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof utilising the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). 
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their 
behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using 
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and 
must contain the information required for such instructions, as 
described in the CREST Manual.
 
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment 
of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be 
received by the issuer’s agent (Equiniti Limited CREST participant ID 
RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments 
specified in note 5 above. For this purpose the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the 
message by the CREST applications Host) from which the issuer’s 
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means.
 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any 
particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will 
therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It 
is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored 
member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that 
his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time.
 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, 
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings  www.euroclear.com.
 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
8. A  vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will 
not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the 
Resolution. If you either select the “discretionary” option or if no 
voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting 
at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as 
he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before 
the meeting.

Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2016
9. If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is given 
discretion as to how the votes the subject of those proxies are cast 
and the voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies, when 
added to the interests in the Company’s securities already held by 
the Chairman, result in the Chairman holding such number of voting 
rights that he has a notifiable obligation under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make necessary notifications 
to the Company and the Financial Conduct Authority. As a result, any 
member holding 3% or more of the voting rights in the Company who 
grants the Chairman a discretionary proxy in respect of some or all of 
those voting rights and so would otherwise have a notification 
obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, need not 
make a separate notification to the Company and the Financial 
Conduct Authority.
10. If you are not a member of the Company but you have been 
nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information rights, 
you do not have a right to appoint any proxies under the procedures 
set out in this “Appointment of proxies” section. Please read the 
section “Nominated persons” below.
Appointment of proxy electronically
11. Alternatively, members may register the appointment of a proxy for 
the meeting electronically by accessing the website 
www.sharevote.co.uk where full details of the procedure are given. 
This website is operated by the Company’s Registrars.
 
The proxy appointment and any power of attorney or other authority 
under which the proxy appointment is made must be received by the 
Company’s Registrars not less than 48 hours, excluding non-
business days, before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned 
meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than at or on the 
same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) for the taking of the 
poll at which it is to be used. Please note that any electronic 
communication sent to the Company or to the Company’s Registrars 
that is found to contain a computer virus will not be accepted. The 
use of the internet service in connection with the AGM is governed 
by the Company’s Registrars’ conditions of use set out on the 
Sharevote website, www.sharevote.co.uk, and may be read by 
logging on to that site. If you want to appoint more than one proxy 
electronically please contact the Company’s Registrars on 0371 384 
2030 from within the UK . Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, 
Monday to Friday – excluding Bank Holidays; or +44 121 415 7047 
from outside the UK.
Website giving information regarding the meeting
12. A copy of this Notice and other information required by Section 311A 
CA 2006 can be found on the Company’s website www.drax.com.
Changing proxy instructions
13. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy 
appointment. You will need to request a new Form of Proxy from the 
Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited, by contacting them at Aspect 
House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using 
their telephone helpline service on 0371 384 2030 from within the 
UK . Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday – 
excluding Bank Holidays; or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK. 
Note that the cut-off time for receipt of Forms of Proxy (see note 5 
above) also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended 
proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be 
disregarded and you will be required to vote at the meeting, if you 
wish to change your vote.
14. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of a 
single share, the appointment received last before the latest time for 
the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Nominated persons
15. Any person receiving a copy of this Notice of Meeting as a person 
nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under Section 
146 of the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006) (a Nominated Person) 
should note that the provisions in this Notice concerning the 
appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting in place of a 
member, do not apply to a Nominated Person as only shareholders 
have the right to appoint a proxy. However, a Nominated Person may 
have a right under an agreement between the Nominated Person 
and the member by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed, 
or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If a 
Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right, or does not 
wish to exercise it, he or she may have a right under such an 
agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of 
voting rights at the meeting. If you are a person who has been 
nominated under Section 146 of CA 2006 to enjoy information 
rights:
• you may have a right under an agreement between you and the 
member of the Company who has nominated you to have 
information rights (“Relevant Member”) to be appointed or to 
have someone else appointed as a proxy for the meeting; and
• if you either do not have such a right or if you have such a right 
but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right under an 
agreement between you and the Relevant Member to give 
instructions to the Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting 
rights. Nominated Persons should also remember that their main 
point of contact in terms of their investment in the Company 
remains the member who nominated the Nominated Person to 
enjoy information rights (or, perhaps the custodian or broker who 
administers the investment on their behalf). Nominated Persons 
should continue to contact that member, custodian or broker 
(and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating 
to the Nominated Person’s personal details and interest in the 
Company (including any administrative matter). The only 
exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a 
response from a Nominated Person.
Voting
16. Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM will be by poll, 
rather than a show of hands, so that all shares voted are included, 
whether or not the shareholder is able to attend the meeting. The 
Board believes this to be the most democratic procedure for voting 
on resolutions as member votes will be counted according to the 
number of shares held.
 
The results of the voting at the meeting and the number of proxy votes 
cast for and against and the number of votes actively abstained in 
respect of each of the Resolutions proposed at the meeting will be 
announced to the London Stock Exchange as soon as practicable 
following the meeting and also will be published on the Company’s 
website www.drax.com.
Issued shares and total voting rights
17. As at 13 March 2016, being the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of this Notice, the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 406,683,099 ordinary shares of 1116/29 pence each. Each 
ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of 
the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company is the same as the number of shares in issue. The Company 
does not hold any shares in treasury.
18. This Notice, together with information about the total numbers of shares 
in the Company in respect of which members are entitled to exercise 
voting rights at the meeting as at 13 March 2016, being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice and, if applicable, 
any members’ statements, members’ resolutions or members’ matters of 
business received by the Company after the date of this Notice, will be 
available on the Company’s website www.drax.com.

Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2016
Website publication of audit concerns
19. Under Section 527 CA 2006, members meeting the threshold 
requirements set out in that Section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter 
relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the 
auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid 
before the meeting; or any circumstance connected with an auditor 
of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at 
which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with 
Section 437 CA 2006.
 
The Company may not require the members requesting any such 
website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 
527 or 528 CA 2006. Where the Company is required to place a 
statement on a website under Section 527 CA 2006, it must forward 
the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when 
it makes the statement available on the website. The business which 
may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under Section 527 CA 2006 to publish 
on a website.
Corporate representatives
20. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that it does not do so in relation to the 
same shares.
Questions at the meeting
21. Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. 
The Company must cause to be answered any question relating to 
the business being dealt with at the meeting put by a member 
attending the meeting. However, members should note that no 
answer need be given in the following circumstances:
• if to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation of the 
meeting or would involve a disclosure of confidential information;
• if the answer has already been given on a website in the form of 
an answer to a question; or
• if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good 
order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Electronic address
22. Any electronic address provided either in this Notice or in any related 
documents (including the Form of Proxy) may not be used to 
communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those 
expressly stated.
Meeting arrangements
23. The doors of the AGM venue will open at 10.30am and the AGM will 
start promptly at 11.30am. Please bring the Attendance Card which is 
attached to the Form of Proxy with you if you attend the meeting. It 
will authenticate your right to attend, speak and vote and will speed 
up your admission to the meeting.
24. You may be asked to provide proof of identity, as well as your 
attendance card from your Form of Proxy. If you do not have your 
attendance card, you may be asked to provide two forms of identity 
(which may require photo identity and verification of your address). If 
you have been appointed as proxy for a shareholder entitled to vote, 
please let the admission staff know. You should bring proof of 
identity with you and you will be asked to confirm the details of the 
shareholder you are representing.
