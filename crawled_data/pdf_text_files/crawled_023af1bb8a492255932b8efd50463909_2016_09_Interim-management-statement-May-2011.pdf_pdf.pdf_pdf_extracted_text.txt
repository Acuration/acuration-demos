Interim Management Statement
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 January 2011
to date.
Trading Performance
Trading conditions in the commodity markets in which we operate have improved so far this
year, although they remain volatile and we are therefore cautious in our outlook. We have
taken advantage of better dark green spreads to strengthen our contracted position. This,
together with continued good operating performance, currently underpins expectations for
the full year.

Notes to Positions Under Contract:

and the five year 300MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 October 2010.
(2) Fixed margin and structured power sales include approximately 4.9TWh in 2011, 7.9TWh in 2012 and
2.6TWh in 2013 in connection with the above contracts. Under these contracts the Group will supply power
on terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices, and delivering matching
CO2 emissions allowances amounting in aggregate to approximately 7.2 million tonnes in each of 2011 and
2012 and 2.4 million tonnes in 2013.
The contracts provide the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green 
spreads, with the spreads in the first contract having been agreed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006 and with those
in the second contract having been agreed in October 2009.
We will next update the market on the Group’s positions under contract on 2 August 2011,
when we announce our half year results for the six months ending 30 June 2011.
Eurobond Tax Position Agreed
On 5 April 2011, we announced that we had reached agreement with HM Revenue &
Customs (“HMRC”) in relation to the Group’s Eurobond financing structure (1), which will
result in the release of £180 million cash tax relief for the business. In addition, a number of
other minor legacy tax issues were also agreed.
This agreement, and in particular the resolution of the Eurobond position, provides certainty
over cash tax relief for the Group now and in the future, as follows:

Cash ring fenced on the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 of £117 million now
released to the business; and

Remaining agreed losses with cash tax value of approximately £63 million will be realised
over the coming years (2).
We noted in the tax announcement that if we received appropriate regulatory support, this
cash would form an integral part of the capital required to deliver our biomass strategy, which
in turn would provide the UK with cost effective, reliable and flexible renewable electricity.
Other than as described above, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any
material change in the underlying financial position of the Group during the period.
Notes to Eurobond Tax Position:
(1) Eurobond financing structure
 The Eurobond debt structure was put in place under a previous financing in 1999 to acquire Drax Power
Station.
 Under this structure, the Group prepaid an amount of interest which facilitated its refinancing and listing on
the London Stock Exchange in 2005. In accordance with accounting and tax rules, we would ordinarily
have expected to obtain tax relief for this interest in the ensuing years to 2015.
 In 2008, HMRC issued draft legislation which updated rules on the tax deductibility of such interest. As a
consequence, the Eurobond structure was unwound in December 2008 in order to protect past benefits.
This resulted in the acceleration of interest deductions where tax losses with a cash tax value of
approximately £220 million were crystallised, subject to confirmation by HMRC.
(2) Remaining losses
 The remaining losses, which are calculated based on current corporation tax rates, are non-trade losses
and can only be offset against future non-trade profits.
