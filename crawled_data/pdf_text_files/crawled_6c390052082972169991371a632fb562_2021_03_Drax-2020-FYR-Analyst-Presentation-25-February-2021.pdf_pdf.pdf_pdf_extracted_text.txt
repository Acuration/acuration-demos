Forward Looking Statements
25 February 2021
3
This announcement may contain certain statements, expectations, statistics, projections and other information that are or may be forward-looking. The 
accuracy and completeness of all such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial position, strategy, projected costs, 
plans, beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc ("Drax") and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), including in respect of the 
proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (‘Pinnacle) and, (subject to and conditional upon shareholders approval and other material matters 
precedent to completion), thereafter the performance and integration of Pinnacle as part of Drax, together forming the enlarged business, are not warranted 
or guaranteed. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may 
occur in the future. Although Drax believes that the statements, expectations, statistics and projections and other information reflected in such statements are 
reasonable, they reflect the Company’s current view and no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Such events and statements involve risks 
and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. There are a 
number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Group, which could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, factors such as: future revenues being lower than expected; 
increasing competitive pressures in the industry; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting the relevant industry, both domestically and 
internationally, being less favourable than expected. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these projections or other forward-looking statements to 
reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, and we do not assume any responsibility for doing so.

UK Energy White Paper
Description of biomass and BECCS
41
By 2022, we will establish the role which BECCS can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy 
and, as part of a wider biomass strategy, set out how the technology could be deployed. Biomass is unique 
amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of applications in which it can be used as a substitute for 
fossil-fuel based products and activities, from power generation to hydrogen production and even new 
forms of plastics. Along with its ability to deliver negative emissions, this makes biomass one of our most 
valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions.
In the government’s response to Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) latest annual progress report to 
Parliament, we announced that we will publish a new Biomass Strategy in 2022. As part of this strategy, we 
will set out the results of a review of the amount of sustainable biomass available to the UK, and how this 
resource could be best utilised across the economy to help achieve our net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
target by 2050.
Our review will assess the UK’s current biomass sustainability standards, which are already some of the world’s 
most stringent, to see where and how we can improve them even further. Our review will also consider the role 
biomass can play in delivering our wider environmental targets, including on air quality. We will shortly issue a 
call for evidence: ‘Biomass for net zero’, to inform the development of our strategy. We will issue a preliminary 
position paper by summer 2021, once the evidence has been reviewed. Critical to our consideration will be 
the role of BECCS in our energy system. BECCS plants could deliver negative emissions, by capturing the 
carbon released during biomass combustion, gasification and other processes, provided supply chain emissions 
are sufficiently low. There are a number of applications for BECCS across the economy, including clean 
hydrogen production, power generation, waste management and in heat for industrial processes and we need 
to ensure that it is deployed where it has the greatest value in reducing emissions. For example, current 
support for electricity generation, which converted from coal to using biomass as a fuel source, expires in 
2027. BECCS could provide a long-term future for this capacity
