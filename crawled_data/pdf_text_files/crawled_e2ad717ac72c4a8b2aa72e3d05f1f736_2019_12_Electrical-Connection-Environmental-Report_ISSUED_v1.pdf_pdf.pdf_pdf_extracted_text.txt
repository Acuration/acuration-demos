Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This Environmental Report has been prepared on the behalf of Abergelli Power 
Limited (APL) for a planning application for an Electrical Connection from the 
proposed Abergelli Power Station to the existing Swansea North substation 
(hereafter referred to as the “Electrical Connection”). The location of the Electrical 
Connection can be viewed on Figure 1: Site Location Plan.  
1.1.2 
A screening request was submitted pursuant to Regulation 6(1) of the Town and 
Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2017 
(the ‘EIA Regulations’) to City and County of Swansea Council (CCS) regarding the 
need for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Electrical Connection 
on the 15th June 2018.  
1.1.3 
On the 19th July 2018, CCS confirmed that the Electrical Connection was not EIA 
Development. 
This 
Environmental 
Report 
therefore 
provides 
detailed 
Environmental Information to support this planning application under the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 ("TCPA 1990").   
1.2 
Background 
1.2.1 
APL proposes to construct and operate an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (“OCGT”) 
peaking power generating station (the "Power Generation Plant") and new 
connections to the gas and electricity networks on land adjacent to the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN (the 
“Project”).   
1.2.2 
APL's project is split into three different elements which are described below, which 
together form the "Abergelli Power Project".  These elements are referred to as the 
Power Generation Plant, the Gas Connection, and the Electrical Connection. 
1.2.3 
The three main elements of the Project comprise:  
 An Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled 
by natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
o 
Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to 
as the “Generating Equipment”) which are located within the 
“Generating Equipment Site”; 
o 
An Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site - from the B4489 
which lies to the west, formed by upgrading an existing access road 
between the B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation (the 
“Substation”) and constructing a new section of access road from the 
Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; and 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
11 
 
o 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant 
and equipment as well as containing site accommodation and welfare 
facilities, temporary car parking and temporary fencing (the “Laydown 
Area”). A small area within the Laydown Area will be retained 
permanently (the “Maintenance Compound”). 
o 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement within the 
Project Site Boundary;    
o 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and 
surface water drainage system.  
 A Gas Connection in the form of a new Above Ground Installation (AGI) and 
underground gas connection (the “Gas Pipeline”) to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Gas Transmission System; and 
 An Electrical Connection in the form of a new underground electrical cable to 
export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS).  
1.2.4 
The Electrical Connection is the focus of this Environmental Report.  
1.3 
Development Consent under the Planning Act 2008 
a) 
Power Generation Plant 
1.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant described above would have a rated electrical output 
of up to 299 MW of electricity and is therefore classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (“NSIP”) under section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 (as 
amended) (“PA 2008”).   
1.3.2 
As such, APL is applying to the Secretary of State (“SoS”) for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy under section 31 of the PA 2008 for a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) for powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation 
Plant. The DCO Application was submitted on 25th May 2018. 
b) 
Associated Development 
1.3.3 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development associated 
with the NSIP (“associated development”).   
1.3.4 
The PA 2008 restricts associated development for which consent can be sought 
under a DCO in Wales to development that is associated with a generating station 
with a capacity in excess of 350 MW.  As the Power Generation Plant would have 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW, associated development to the Power 
Generation Plant cannot be included in any application for DCO under the PA 2008.  
The application for a DCO therefore only includes the Power Generation Plant and 
related mitigation as "authorised development" and does not seek development 
consent for the Gas Connection or the Electrical Connection. 
c) 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990  
1.3.5 
APL is seeking for planning permission for the Electrical Connection under the 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

d) 
Abergelli Power Project Environmental Statement  
1.3.6 
The Abergelli Power Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal 
generating station with a heat output of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1, 
paragraph 2(1) of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009. As such, an EIA has been carried out in respect of the 
development.  
1.3.7 
Mitigation has been identified within the EIA carried out for the Abergelli Power 
Project which is applicable to the Electrical Connection. This mitigation includes 
both embedded mitigation (mitigation inherent in to the design of the Project and 
also specifically to the Electrical Connection), or additional mitigation (which is 
required to mitigate any residual adverse effects of the Project). This has been 
identified in this Environmental Report for clarity using notation with the Project EIA 
where appropriate.  
1.4 
The Developer 
1.4.1 
The Applicant is APL, an energy development company established for the 
Abergelli Power Project and owned by Drax Group plc (Drax). 
1.4.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 6% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via Drax 
power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers and is 
committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal off the 
system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created by 
intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.  
1.4.3 
Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag Energy 
Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management 
services to Watt Power in relation to APL. Stag Energy continues to provide 
resources to APL through a management services agreement. Stag Energy was 
founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth of experience within a team 
that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation and related 
infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in 
the UK. 
1.4.4 
APL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK Government’s 
drive to a low carbon economy.  APL recognises the need to balance commercial 
issues with the environmental benefits and concerns relating to energy projects and 
believes this balance can be responsibly delivered. The Electrical Connection as 
part of the Abergelli Power Project will be designed and developed to high quality, 
safety and environmental standards. 
1.4.5 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at 
www.abergellipower.co.uk or www.drax.com. 
1.5 
Structure of Report  
1.5.1 
The remainder of this report is structured as follows: 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
13 
 
 Section 2 presents a detailed description of the Electrical Connection; 
 Section 3 presents a description of the current land use at the Electrical 
Connection and surrounding area;  
 Section 4 provides an overview of the potential environmental effects 
associated with the Electrical Connection;  
 Section 5 presents a summary of effects; and  
 Section 6 presents the Report conclusions. 
1.5.2 
An EIA Screening Request and Screening Matrix have been completed for the 
Electrical Connection and are included in Appendix 1 of this Report. A Mitigation 
Register has been prepared that outlines all the embedded and additional 
mitigation which has been identified to avoid, reduce or remedy any significant 
residual effects from the Project as a whole, but specifically for the Electrical 
Connection. The Mitigation Register is included in Appendix 2.1 of this Report and 
has been abbreviated from the wider Abergelli Power Project Mitigation Register to 
include mitigation required for the Electrical Connection only. The Electrical 
Connection Mitigation Register is cross-referenced throughout this Report for 
consistency and ease of reference.  
1.5.3 
The Report summarises the environmental assessments conducted as part of the 
Abergelli Power Project Environmental Statement and provides technical 
conclusions based on those assessments in relation to the likely significant effects 
of the Electrical Connection.  
2. 
Project Description 
2.1.1 
The Electrical Connection will enable power to be exported from the Abergelli 
Power Station to the NETS. The connection will be approximately 900 metre (m) in 
length. It will consist of a 400 kilovolt (kV) underground cable to the Substation and 
associated works inside the Substation to connect to a gas-insulated switchgear 
(GIS) bay. The GIS bay will be consented and owned by National Grid with APL 
providing and installing a 400 kV cable for termination into the GIS bay as well as 
installing feeder protection and settlement metering for the GIS Bay.  
2.1.2 
The Substation is proposed to be extended by National Grid at the eastern end of 
the building to house the GIS bay. National Grid is responsible for securing any 
necessary planning permissions for this work and therefore this is not considered 
as part of this project description or application. 
2.1.3 
The Electrical Connection route (see Figure 2: Site Layout Plan) will run 
immediately adjacent to the alignment of the new section of Access Road for the 
Abergelli Power Project. At the eastern extent, the Electrical Connection leaves the 
Abergelli Power Project Generating Equipment Site, passing underground through 
open land to the east and south-east of the National Grid Gas Transmission 
System. The route crosses into National Grid’s land to the east of tower 4YW251 
heading towards the Substation. Once within National Grid’s land the Electrical 
Connection turns to the north-west to run outside the Substation and parallel with 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited

the Substation fence line. The Electrical Connection then turns into the Substation 
close to the northern corner.  
2.1.4 
The Electrical Connection passes twice under one 400 kV overhead lattice tower 
mounted transmission line and once under one wooden pole mounted 11 kV 
overhead distribution line. The route crosses two ditches and a Local Transmission 
System pipeline within the field to the east of tower 4YW251. The Electrical 
Connection will be drilled (for example using drilling techniques such as Horizontal 
Directional Drill (HDD)) under a Water Main and a decommissioned oil pipeline 
(referred to as the “Oil Pipeline” throughout) with at least 2 m clearance from the 
underside of the Water Main.  
2.2 
Construction 
2.2.1 
The Electrical Connection will be constructed within the curtilage of the new section 
of Access Road within a 5 m working width adjacent to the road. A cable duct will 
be installed adjacent to the new section of Access Road to allow the cable to be 
pulled through at a later date. Short sections of open cut trench will be required at 
either end of the cable route where it does not coincide with the Access Road. The 
installation of the cable within the Substation is anticipated to be in cable ducts, 
although National Grid has recently started using direct buried cables within the 
Substation. 
2.2.2 
The Electrical Connection will require temporary bridges to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site (for example a temporary Bailey Bridge) over the Water 
Main and Oil Pipeline during the construction phase to enable access from the new 
section of Access Road and Laydown Area to the Generating Equipment Site. The 
temporary Bailey Bridge will be approximately 5 m in height from the anchor points 
on the existing ground level. 
2.3 
Operation and Maintenance 
2.3.1 
No regular maintenance is anticipated to be carried out on the underground 
electrical cable. Maintenance of the electrical cable will be limited to repair in the 
event of a fault in the cable, in which case the cable will be isolated for repair in line 
with industry good practice. 
2.3.2 
The electrical equipment would be subject to periodic inspection. To perform such 
inspections, pedestrian access is adequate.  
2.3.3 
The route would be regularly checked to ensure that there are no excavation or 
construction works in the direct vicinity of the cables, that mounds of soil are not 
deposited above the cables and that trees are not planted above the cables; this 
should normally require little more than a drive past. 
2.3.4 
In addition, periodic inspection of any above ground equipment associated with the 
cable system would be required. The above ground equipment would include cable 
terminations, and structures, and bonding system link housings; this would require 
access to the equipment. In some case dirt and debris can deposit on cable

termination insulators which may therefore require cleaning. It is also 
recommended that the integrity of the cable oversheath be tested at least once 
every two to three years; this would require access to the cable terminations and 
the bonding system link housings. In the event that the oversheath is found 
degraded or damaged then a repair may be required which would necessitate 
some excavation along the cable route (in most cases, oversheath damage results 
from the actions of third parties). 
2.4 
Decommissioning 
2.4.1 
It is assumed that the Electrical Connection would be decommissioned after 25 
years, which is the design life of the Power Generation Plant. However, it is 
important to note that elements of the Connection (such as the GIS bay) would be 
owned and operated by National Grid. In accordance with its statutory duties, 
National Grid may use these assets in the future as part of its wider network.  
2.4.2 
As such, though the date of decommissioning of some elements of the Electrical 
Connection cannot be certain, a 25 year working assumption has been used to 
allow for a reasonable assessment of decommissioning effects in this Report.  
2.4.3 
Finally, it is assumed that elements of the Electrical Connection may be left in situ 
at the point of decommissioning, as this approach is likely to cause less 
environmental 
effects 
than 
removal. 
Any 
potential 
effects 
linked 
to 
decommissioning elements of the Electrical Connection are considered to be either 
less than or comparable with the construction phase, and are therefore not 
discussed separately.   
2.5 
Embedded Mitigation 
2.5.1 
Mitigation which is either implicit in the design of the Electrical Connection or its 
construction and operation through standard control measures routinely used, such 
as working within best practice guidance during construction, is known as 
embedded mitigation. The embedded mitigation implemented on the Electrical 
Connection is summarised as follows but is outlined in greater detail within the 
Mitigation Register in Appendix 2.1 (using the notation for ease of reference): 
 Production of an Outline Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) 
(ref GEN01) which includes waste management (OE01) (Appendix 2.2); 
 Production of an Outline Landscape & Ecology Mitigation Strategy (LEMS) 
(GEN02) (Appendix 2.3); 
 Management of dust and air quality mitigation (AQ01 – AQ04); 
 Management of noise, noise generation and vibration management (N01 – 
N08); 
 Protection of sensitive habitats, sensitive ecological features, protected species 
and designated sites (E01 – E02); 
 Production of an Outline Surface Water Management Plan (WQ01) (Appendix 
2.4), and drainage (WQ08 and WQ09); 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
16 
 
 Protection of groundwater and hydrogeology features, peat management, 
identification and management of unexpected contamination (G01 – G06); 
 Landscape and visual mitigation from Public Rights of Way (PRoW) and other 
amenity viewpoints (LV01); 
 Production of a Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) (Appendix 2.5) 
(including safety, severance and traffic management such as speed 
restrictions) in addition to a Construction Staff Travel Plan (CSTP) (Appendix 
2.6) (T01 – T05); and 
 Archaeological investigation including a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) 
(CH01 and CH02). 
2.5.2 
This embedded mitigation applies to the Electrical Connection and has been 
assumed for Environmental Report to be in place from the outset. The 
assessments included in this Report therefore consider the likely significant effects 
of the Electrical Connection including embedded mitigation.   
2.5.3 
Any required additional mitigation is set out within the relevant assessment in 
Section 4 of this Report and cross referenced within the Mitigation Register in 
Appendix 2.1. The management plans committed to as embedded mitigation are 
also referenced where relevant.  
3. 
Site Description 
3.1 
Electrical Connection Location 
3.1.1 
The Electrical Connection Site (see Figure 1: Site Location Plan) is located on open 
agricultural land approximately 2 kilometres (km) north of Junction  46 on the M4, 
approximately 3 km to the north of the city of Swansea, 1 km southeast of Felindre 
and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The current land use is improved grazing for 
sheep and horses on improved grassland (Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) 
Grade 4).   
3.1.2 
The western extent of the Electrical Connection encompasses parts of the 
Swansea North Substation (“Substation”) (comprising a 400 kV and 132 kV 
substation), a car park owned by National Grid between the Substation and 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station, as well as the existing Access Road from the 
B4489. There are no residential dwellings located within the Electrical Connection 
Site.   
3.1.3 
Ground levels vary from approximately 93.8 m above ordnance datum (AOD) at the 
highest point to the east and approximately 77.1 m AOD along the southern extent, 
with ground levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction. The 
CCS Unitary Development Plan (UDP) Proposals Map (Ref.3.1 and included in 
Figure: 4.22) identifies mineral deposits within the Electrical Connection Site 
including coal and sand and aggregates. There is a groundwater body below the 
Electrical Connection of poor current and projected Water Framework Directive 
(WFD) (Ref.3.2) status.

3.1.4 
The Electrical Connection coincides with an area classified as Ancient Woodland as 
the route enters the Substation. This is part of a wider area of Ancient Woodland 
surrounding the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station, and the existing 
Access Road leading to these facilities from the B4489. The woodland is also 
partially within the Lletty-Morfil Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SINC) (no. 
106). The Lletty-Morfil SINC is comprised of five distinct areas, the closest of which 
is immediately adjacent to the north of the Electrical Connection Site. 
3.1.5 
The Electrical Connection crosses two drainage ditches that discharge into the Afon 
Llan. The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which 
discharges into Carmarthen Bay through Bury Inlet, 7 km west of the Abergelli 
Power Station Site. Carmarthen bay and its estuaries are designated as a Special 
Area of Conservation (SAC) and Bury Inlet is designated as a Special Protection 
Area (SPA), Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and as a wetland of 
international importance under the Ramsar Convention. There are no Main Rivers 
within the Electrical Connection Site. 
3.2 
Surrounding Area 
3.2.1 
The area surrounding the Electrical Connection is, at present, predominantly rural 
in character, although there is the Felindre Park and Share facility to the south and 
a substantial amount of utility infrastructure in the area, some of which the Electrical 
Connection will cross. 
3.2.2 
The Electrical Connection crosses underground utilities and overhead lines which 
lead to and from the Substation. The Felindre Water Treatment Works is located to 
the northwest, while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli Solar Farm are 
located to the east of the Electrical Connection. A further three solar parks are built 
in the vicinity; Lletty-Morfil Solar Farm, Brynwhilach Solar Park and Gelliwern Isaf 
Solar Park.  
3.2.3 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks that link 
the Electrical Connection Site to the wider area. Of particular note is the LC117 
which crosses the Electrical Connection at its western end. There are a number of 
residential properties between 180 m and 875 m from the Electrical Connection. 
These include Cefn-betingau to the east, Feline Wen Farm and Llwynhelig to the 
south east, Maes-eglwys to the south, and Lletty-Morfil Farm to the west and 
Abergelli Farm to the north west. 
3.2.4 
There is a paintball activity centre located to the west of the Electrical Connection 
off the B4889. Other tourist attractions and resources include the Cwm Clydach 
Nature Reserve woodland and nature reserve at Clydach, 3 km east of the 
Electrical Connection and the National Cycle Route 43, which passes through 
Clydach on route to Swansea from Builth Wells. 
3.2.5 
In addition to the Lletty-Morfil SINC, there is another SINC, Rhos Fawr (no.316), 
1.2 km north of the Electrical Connection across the Rhyd-Y-Pandy road. The 
Rhyd-Y-Pandy SINC (no. 315) is 883 m to the east and Waun Garn Wen SINC (no. 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited

105) 637 m to the north.  There is also a Wildlife Trust Reserve (Coed Barcud) to 
the north east and an area of Ancient Woodland 150 m to the north.  The Mawr 
Uplands Special Landscape Area (SLA) is located within 5 km of the Electrical 
Connection, extending from the north-west round to the east.  
4. 
Potential Environmental Effects 
4.1.1 
The following sections describe the potential effects from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Electrical Connection. Throughout the topic 
specific sections, reference will be made to both the Electrical Connection Site and 
the wider Project Site Boundary; the former is the subject of this Environmental 
Report but where surveys or data collection has been made on the Project Site 
Boundary, this has been made clear.  
4.1.2 
In addition, reference will also be made to study areas. These may change in size 
and proximity to the Electrical Connection, and in some topics, relate to the Project 
Site Boundary. Where relevant, this has been clearly set out.  
4.1.3 
In the interests of aiding the reader, these definitions are repeated for ease of 
reference: 
 Electrical Connection - An underground electrical cable to export power from 
the Generating Equipment to the NETS. 
 Electrical Connection Site - The area required for the construction and 
operation of the Electrical Connection.   
 Electrical Connection Site Boundary - The boundary of the Electrical 
Connection Site. 
 Project Site Boundary - The boundary of the Project Site to contain the 
‘Project’; The OCGT, Power Generation Plant and new connections to the gas 
and electricity networks on land adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN. 
4.2 
Ecology 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.2.1 
Previous ecological surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 and 
have been repeated by AECOM in 2017 and 2018. The baseline reports are 
contained within the Appendices referred to throughout this section.  Given the time 
between initial 2014 surveys and submission of the DCO Application for the Project, 
ecology surveys have been repeated to provide more recent ecological survey 
information to support the Project.  
4.2.2 
It should be noted that the Electrical Connection fits entirely within the Project Site 
Boundary (used in the AECOM Reports), and the 2014 study areas (used by BSG 
Ecology and Parsons Brinckerhoff) are more extensive than the 2017/2018 survey 
extents as the Project Site Boundary was larger in 2014. The Project Site Boundary 
has since been further refined to that shown on Figure 1 and Figure 2, and the 
study areas reduced as required.

4.2.3 
The Project Site Boundaries for both 2014 and 2017/2018 surveys are shown on 
Figure 4.1: Ecological Study Area, and therefore references to study areas and any 
associated buffer zones or extents required for species specific surveys should be 
understood in the context of these boundaries.  
4.2.4 
A summary of the baseline conditions has been provided in the following sections 
using the results of the surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology and AECOM.  Detailed 
information such as survey data has been provided for each element in Appendices

Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar 
7.8 km south-west  
A component site of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries/Bae Caerfyrddin ac Aberoedd European 
Marine Site. Partially overlaps the Carmarthen Bay SAC.  
Burry Inlet is a large estuarine complex located between the Gower Peninsula and Llanelli in South 
Wales. It includes extensive areas of intertidal sand- and mud-flats, together with large sand dune 
systems at the mouth of the estuary. The site contains the largest continuous area of saltmarsh in 
Wales (2,200 ha). The estuary experiences large tidal fluctuations (about 8 m), which has the 
consequence of exposing a large extent of intertidal sediments on a regular basis. These are mostly 
sandy, but muddy substrates are to be found in more sheltered areas. The Burry Inlet regularly 
supports large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that feed in the saltmarshes and on the 
intertidal areas.

Nant Y Crimp SSSI 
1.9 km north west 
Nant y Crimp is of special interest for its wet pastures, species-rich neutral grasslands and semi-
natural woodland as well as associated scrub, which are host to several uncommon plant species. 
Notable plant species recorded at the site include petty whin Genista anglica, cranberry Vaccinium 
oxycoccos, narrow buckler fern Dryopteris carthusiana and whorled caraway Carum verticillatum, the 
latter an Atlantic species characteristic of unimproved pastures in the South Wales coalfield. 
In addition, there is also a colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia at the site. This is 
a declining species confined, in South Wales to wet agriculturally unimproved pastures where its 
food plant, devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, grows in profusion.

iii. Protected Species Records 
4.2.7 
A wide range of historical records of protected and/or notable species were 
received from SEWBReC.  Relevant records are reported in the Preliminary 
Ecological Assessment and corresponding technical baseline reports (Appendices 
3.1 – 3.19).  Historic records and survey results are considered together in the 
evaluation of ecological features below.  
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
4.2.8 
The land within the Electrical Connection Site supports woodland, rows of trees, 
standalone trees, dense and scattered scrub, improved grassland, semi-improved 
grassland, marshy grassland, tall ruderal vegetation, running water, fences and 
bare ground (hard standing).

Invasive Plant Species 
4.2.10 During the 2014 survey, BSG Ecology did not identify any invasive plant species 
subject to legal controls within the Electrical Connection Site. Similarly the Phase 1 
Habitat survey in 2017 found no invasive plant species within the Electrical 
Connection Site.  
4.2.11 Both surveys did however identify invasive species within the wider Project Site 
Boundary including Rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Japanese knotweed 
(Fallopia japonica) and Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). In addition the 
BSG Ecology survey in 2014 also identified floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle 
ranunculoides) and montbretia (Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora).  
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM

4.2.12 The closest identified invasive plant species to the Electrical Connection Site, in 
both surveys were Rhododendron and Japanese knotweed present at the end of 
the Substation, approximately 250 m to the west.  
Invertebrates 
4.2.13 Invertebrate surveys were carried out by BSG Ecology in 2014 for moths, beetles, 
and aquatic macroinvertebrates (in ponds and watercourses) (Appendix 3.3). The 
survey covered the Electrical Connection Site as an area within the wider Project 
Site Boundary.   
4.2.14 Several records of notable moths and the protected marsh fritillary butterfly 
(Euphydryas aurinia) were returned from the local records centre. However, there is 
no habitat with the potential to support marsh fritillary within the study area (shown 
on Figure 4.1) and they are considered to be absent from the Electrical Connection 
Site.  
4.2.15 As part of the invertebrate survey, one watercourse (listed as watercourse 8 in 
Appendix 3.3) was surveyed within the Electrical Connection Site. No rare species 
were identified and the assemblage of invertebrate species present suggested 
good biological and water quality.  
4.2.16 Thirteen Section 7 species of moth and two notable or priority beetles were 
recorded during the invertebrate survey and are listed in Table 4.4 below. Although 
they were identified within the wider Project Site Boundary, their habitat 
requirements fit with the habitats present within the Electrical Connection Site, and 
as such it is likely they are present.

Amphibians 
4.2.17 Records of common toad (Bufo bufo), palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus) and 
common frog (Rana temporaria) were returned from the local records centre. The 
habitat in the Electrical Connection Site is suitable for common amphibians.  
4.2.18 The potential for great crested newts (GCN) to be present on the Electrical 
Connection Site was assessed as part of the Habitat Suitability Assessment 
conducted in 2017 (Appendix 3.4). The survey identified twenty-six ponds within the 
study area, which was defined as the wider Project Site Boundary with a 500 m 
buffer (Figure A8.4.1 of Appendix 3.4). Three of the identified ponds were within the 
wider Project Site Boundary; none were located within the Electrical Connection 
Site.  
4.2.19 From the results of the Habitat Suitability Assessment and where access allowed 
seven ponds were subject to further surveys for GCN including eDNA analysis. No 
GCNs were recorded during the surveys and the eDNA analysis returned negative 
results for GCN for each of the ponds.  A number of the ponds were found to 
support common toads, smooth newts (Lissotriton vulgaris), and/or palmate newts.  
4.2.20 It is considered unlikely that GCN will be present along the Electrical Connection 
due to the absence of GCN from ponds within 500 m of the Electrical Connection 
Site.  
Reptiles 
4.2.21 The desk study confirmed the presence of slow-worm (Anguis fragilis), grass snake 
(Natrix helvetica helvetica), adder (Vipera berus) and common lizard (Zootoca 
vivipara) within 2 km, and the presence of grass snake and common lizard within 
the Electrical Connection Site.  
4.2.22 During the 2017 reptile survey (study area as shown on Figure 2 of Appendix 3.5), 
a total of 51 adult and juvenile common lizard observations were recorded, with a 
peak count of six adults recorded on one survey visit.  Observations of common 
lizard were recorded from across the reptile study area within the Project Site 
Boundary.  The majority of records were from the verges either side of the grassy 
track running through the centre of the Project Site and from the semi-improved 
neutral grassland present around the Substation.  
4.2.23 During the course of the reptile survey, male, female, and juvenile common lizards 
were recorded, which confirmed that there was a breeding population present 
within the Project Site Boundary.  
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM

4.2.24 Based on the survey results and the criteria laid out in Froglife Advice Sheet 10 
(Ref.3.1), the Site supports a ‘Good population’ of common lizard.  
4.2.25 The Electrical Connection and the area within the wider Project Site Boundary do 
not meet the criteria for a ‘Key Reptile Site’.  
4.2.26 No grass snakes were identified within the 2017 reptile study area although the 
species was recorded in a survey in 2014.  However, there is the potential for grass 
snake to be present within the Electrical Connection Site and to have gone 
unrecorded since:  
 
Grass snake are wide ranging;  
 
The pond, outside of the Electrical Connection, where the majority of the 2014 
records were from, was mostly dry throughout the 2017 reptile survey period, 
making the areas less suitable for supporting grass snake; and,  
 
The area in the north of the reptile study area where grass snake was recorded 
in 2014 could not be accessed for survey in 2017 due to grazing livestock.  
4.2.27 As such, it should be assumed grass snake is likely to be present at low densities 
within the Electrical Connection Site and surrounding habitat.  
Breeding Birds 
4.2.28 Breeding bird surveys were undertaken in 2014 (BSG Ecology report, Appendix 
3.16) and in 2017/2018 (AECOM, Appendix 3.6a and Appendix 3.6b). The study 
areas are as shown on Figure 4.1, the area is more extensive in 2014 as the 
Project Site Boundary was larger. The 2017/2018 surveys were undertaken on a 
refined Project Site Boundary but covered the same core areas which make up the 
Project.  
4.2.29 The BSG Ecology surveys identified nine Section 7 bird species (previously 
referred to as species of principal importance for nature conservation in S42 of the 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, now repealed by 
Environment (Wales) Act 2016) comprising cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), grasshopper 
warbler (Locustella naevia), dunnock (Prunella modularis), house sparrow (Passer 
domesticus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), lesser redpoll (Acanthis cabaret), skylark 
(Alauda arvensis), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), and tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) 
were considered likely to breed within the wider Project Site Boundary.  
4.2.30 All nine Section 7 species recorded are also red-listed species of conservation 
concern in Wales, with the exception of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An 
additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), mistle thrush 
(Turdus viscivorus), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), reed bunting (Emberiza 
schoeniclus), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), whitethroat (Sylvia 
communis) and willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilis) were also considered to 
have bred.  
4.2.31 No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) (“Schedule 1 species”) were recorded, 
although two Schedule 1 species were recorded during the surveys, as follows. A 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM

pair of red kite was recorded mobbing a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) in May.  
A pair of red kite was also recorded flying over the breeding bird study area on the 
same survey day. Given the timing of the records, and that at least one pair were 
recorded during survey it is likely that red kite breed locally but that the single 
record of peregrine referred to a transient bird.  No evidence was found to suggest 
breeding of either species occurred within the breeding bird study area during 
2014.  
4.2.32 The single breeding bird survey undertaken in 2017 revealed the same nine 
Section 7 bird species as recorded during the 2014 survey (cuckoo, grasshopper 
warbler, dunnock, house sparrow, linnet, lesser redpoll, skylark, song thrush and 
tree pipit). Nine further species listed on the Amber List were also recorded 
(bullfinch, common redstart, meadow pipit, mistle thrush, meadow pipit, reed 
bunting, stock dove, whitethroat and willow warbler) although no species listed on 
Schedule 1 were recorded within the Project Site Boundary. The survey results 
from 2017 are largely found to be in line with what was identified in 2014 and there 
is no significant difference in species breeding within the Project Site Boundary 
between the two surveys.  
4.2.33 A survey for goshawk was undertaken in February 2018 of habitats suitable for 
supporting the species and with the potential to be impacted by the Project. During 
the survey there were no observations of goshawk.  
4.2.34 Four further breeding bird surveys were conducted between April and May 2018. 
Due to the progressed stage of the Project design, a more targeted study area was 
implemented that covered a smaller area than the earlier surveys discussed above. 
The 2018 surveys recorded similar species assemblages as for 2014 and 2017, but 
the numbers of birds were lower, in line with the smaller study area.  
Bats 
4.2.35 All of the distances specified in this section are relative to the wider Project Site 
Boundary not just the Electrical Connection Site. In addition, bat features are 
explained in the wider context of the Project Site Boundary where relevant due to 
the connectivity of features for commuting, foraging and roost, and therefore may 
be outside the Electrical Connection Site Boundary.  
4.2.36 Bat surveys were undertaken by BGS in 2014 (Appendix 3.8), AECOM in 2017 
(Appendix 3.7a) and completion of remaining surveys in 2018 to provide an 
updated report (Appendix 3.7b).   
4.2.37 The desk study identified no sites designated for bats within 10 km of the Project 
Site Boundary.  The desk study confirmed the presence of the following species 
from within 2 km of the Project Site Boundary: Daubenton's Myotis daubentonii, 
Natterer's Myotis nattereri, Noctule Nyctalus noctule, pipistrelle species Pipistrellus 
sp., common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
pygmaeus, long-eared species Plecotus sp., brown long-eared Plecotus auritus 
and generic records of bat species Chiroptera. None of these records of bats were 
from within the Project Site.

4.2.38 The desk study identified the following records of known roost sites within 2 km of 
the Project Site: 
 A noctule tree roost approximately 1 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 Common pipistrelle roost approximately 1.3 km east of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1.8 km south-east of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1 km southeast of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 A soprano pipistrelle roost approximately 2 km south-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 A soprano pipistrelle roost approximately 2 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 A long-eared bat and brown-long-eared bat  roost approximately 1.6 km east of 
the Project Site Boundary; and, 
 A long-eared bat and brown long-eared bat roost approximately 1.1 km north-
west of the Project Site Boundary. 
4.2.39 The specific locations of the bat roosts are confidential.  
Bat Roosts 
4.2.40 There are no buildings suitable for supporting bats within the Electrical Connection 
Site, or the within the wider Project Site Boundary.  
4.2.41 Buildings adjacent to the Project Site Boundary were assessed, and summarised 
below. Building locations can be found in Appendix 3.7b, Figure 2.   
 AECOM Building 1:  Unknown Roost Status. Not surveyed by AECOM or BSG 
Ecology, Building is approximately 125m from the Project Site Boundary; 
 AECOM Building 2:  Confirmed as a long-eared and pipistrelle roost by BSG in 
2014 (Appendix 3.8). Not surveyed by AECOM. It is approximately 120 m 
outside of the Project Site Boundary;  
 AECOM Building 3:  No Roost; 
 AECOM Building 4:  No Roost; 
 AECOM Building 5:  No Roost; 
 AECOM Building 6:  No Roost; 
 AECOM Building 7:  Confirmed as a lesser horseshoe, long-eared and 
pipistrelle roost by BSG Ecology in 2014 (Appendix 3.8). Surveyed by AECOM 
in 2018 (Appendix 3.7b) and confirmed summer, non-maternity roost for at 
least two lone roosting common pipistrelle bats, a summer roost, possibly 
maternity, for at least 8 long-eared bats and a suspected roost for at least one 
Myotis sp.  
 AECOM Building 8: BSG Ecology internal inspection did not find evidence of 
bats but not all areas were accessible (Appendix 3.8). Due to the bat roost 
features identified by BSG Ecology an internal inspection only is not sufficient 
to determine if this building is being used as a bat roost. Therefore it was 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report

surveyed in 2018 by AECOM (Appendix 3.7b) and confirmed as a summer non-
maternity roost for at least two lone roosting common pipistrelle bats.  
4.2.42 Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  
No other trees were identified as bat roosts. A photograph of Tree 19 is shown in 
Appendix 3.7b, Plate 1.1.  
4.2.43 A trial shaft (mining feature) and a mine adit are located within the Project Site 
Boundary. A safety investigation confirmed that the trial shaft has been filled in. The 
respective landowner has confirmed that the mine adit, located next to Building 4, is 
an underground feature that has been capped and is now covered by grass. 
Therefore, there is no likelihood of hibernating bats or any suitable bat habitat being 
present in either of the mine related features within the Project Site Boundary. 
Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
4.2.44 At least 13 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close 
proximity of and within the Project Site Boundary.  The following species have been 
identified during bat surveys at the Project Site Boundary during the bat surveys 
undertaken in 2017/2018: 
 Greater horseshoe; 
 Lesser horseshoe; 
 Common pipistrelle; 
 Soprano pipistrelle; 
 Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 Daubenton’s; 
 Natterer’s; 
 Mytois species; (including calls with characteristics of Bechstein's, Brandt's 
Myotis brandtii and Whiskered Myotis mystacinus); 
 Noctule; 
 Serotine; 
 Leisler’s; 
 Long-eared species; and, 
 Indeterminate species.  
4.2.45 Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site (Appendix 3.7b).  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 87.3% of all 
passes recorded on the walked transect surveys and 93.8% of the static detector 
surveys. They were also the most commonly recorded species during the 
emergence/re-entry surveys.  Pipistrelle species comprised of 89.9% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 85.6% of the passes recorded on the South 
Transect.   
4.2.46 Similarly, pipistrelle species were the most commonly recorded species during the 
BSG 2014 transect and static detector surveys (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.47 Two passes of Nathusius’ pipistrelle were recorded during the July 2017 transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one record from the North 
Transect, making up 0.2% of total bat passes.  
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM

4.2.48 Overall Myotis species comprised 9.5% of the total calls recorded on the transect 
surveys. Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North 
Transect and 10.8% of the calls recorded on the South Transect. 
4.2.49 Activity levels for Myotis species during the transect surveys were comparable with 
the activity levels recorded during the BSG 2014 transect surveys (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.50 Noctule, serotine and Leisler’s (N/S/L) bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded 
on walked transect surveys. N/S/L bats comprised of 1.6% of the passes recorded 
on the North Transect and 2.0% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.  
The percentages by species within Appendix 3.7a and 3.7b are not comparable to 
2014 surveys as the species were not split by species (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.51 Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.4% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.4% recorded on the South Transect   
surveys. BSG Ecology did not breakdown these species into percentages but 
figures are comparable between years (Appendix 3.8). 
4.2.52 There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass, recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the total 
passes for the Project Site Boundary.  This was recorded in August 2017 (Appendix 
3.7a).  BSG Ecology also recorded a single pass of lesser horseshoe on the South 
Transect (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.53 Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Transect (713 bat passes; 
15.4 Bat Activity Index (BAI)), compared to the Northern Transect (555 bat passes, 
12.3 BAI). The bat activity levels across the Project Site Boundary however are 
broadly similar.  
4.2.54 Bat activity was recorded across the Project Site (Appendix 3.7a.b, Figure 5.1). 
Vegetated stream or wet ditch corridors appear to be important for bats within the 
Project Site Boundary. The distribution of bat calls suggests the following general 
patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment only: 
 Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 Myotis species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas 
near water; 
 Noctule, serotine and Leisler bats were primarily recorded at height over open 
fields across the Project Site; 
 Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are 
focused more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The 
passes recorded are within approximately 315m to 700m of the confirmed long-
eared roost in Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG 
confirmed long-eared roost in Building 2;  
 The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a 
mature tree line approximately 900m south of the closest known lesser 
horseshoe roost in Building 2. 
4.2.55 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017 and 
April and May 2018 (Appendix 3.7a,b).

4.2.56 August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 
17.2 and the South Transect had a BAI of 24.9. 
4.2.57 May had the second highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI 
of 15.1 and the South Transect had a BAI of 20.4. 
4.2.58 For the static detector surveys, July had the highest BAI of 456.8; the second 
highest BAI was 428.3 in May and third highest BAI was 423.0 in August.  
4.2.59 As seen in Plate 1.4 the month of August has a greater level of species richness 
than April and September.  This was a statistically significant result as seen in 
Appendix 3.7b, Appendix 4A: Tables 2.3 and 2.4.  
4.2.60 The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data showed that there is 
no significant difference between the bat activity in each month sampled (Appendix 
3.7b, Plate 1.2 and Appendix 4A: Table 2.2) as there was not statistically significant 
results between any of the months.   
4.2.61 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.  
Bat Activity – Static Detectors  
4.2.62 Static detector locations are presented in Appendix 3.7b, Figure 3.4.  
4.2.63 In total 83,329 bat passes were recorded during the static detector surveys. 
Appendix 3.7b, Table 1.22 gives the bat activity by the Static Detector Location 
Groups. Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Static Detector 
Locations (20,470 total bat passes; 264.1 BAI), compared to the Northern Static 
Detector Locations (21,492 total bat passes, 231.1 BAI), reflecting the pattern of 
the walked transect. 
4.2.64 Using the first night data from static detector surveys, the species richness 
recorded across different locations was not statistically significant (Appendix 3.7b, 
Appendix 4A: Table 2.3), i.e. one location did not support a significantly different 
diversity of bats than any other location.  
4.2.65 The distribution of bat echolocation calls detected during the static detector surveys 
suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment 
only:  
 Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 Myotis species were recorded across the Project Site; 
 Noctule, Serotine and Leisler bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 Long-eared bats were recorded across the Project Site, with highest numbers 
recorded at Lane 3, followed by South 3 and  North 2;   
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
11 
 
 Greater horseshoe bats were recorded across the Project Site, with the South 
having the highest number of passes; and, 
 Lesser horseshoe bats were recorded across the Project Site within the highest 
number recorded in the south and south-west of the Project Site at South 2, 
South 3, Lane 1 and Lane 2. 
4.2.66 The highest level of activity was recorded in the Lane Static Detector Locations 
(41,367 total bat passes, 537.23 BAI). The Lane Static Detector Locations (even 
with the equipment malfunctions, see Limitations) had higher levels of activity 
compared to both the North and South Static Detector Locations combined. This 
may be because the Lane is likely used for foraging, along the sheltered woodland 
edge, and detectors may have been recording multiple passes by the same bats up 
and down the Lane. 
Dormouse 
4.2.67 No records of dormouse were returned from the local records centre.  No evidence 
of dormouse was identified during the field surveys.  
Water Vole 
4.2.68 No records of water vole were returned during the desk study.  
4.2.69 A water vole survey was conducted in 2017, the full results are available in 
Appendix 3.10. The water vole study area was identified as the area within the 
wider Project Site Boundary plus a 100 m buffer (shown in Figure 1.1. of Appendix 
3.10).  
4.2.70 Four watercourses that had potential for supporting water vole were recorded within 
the water vole study area, none of which were inside the Electrical Connection Site.  
Two of the four had limited potential for water vole due to the relative isolation of 
these watercourses within the landscape (i.e. not connected to watercourses with 
potential to support water vole). Burrows suitable for water vole were found along 
the other two watercourses, but there was no evidence of current occupancy.  It 
was therefore not possible to determine if the burrows had been excavated by 
brown rat or water vole. It is likely that water vole is absent from the Electrical 
Connection Site as part of the water vole study area.  
4.2.71 These findings are consistent with a Water Vole study conducted by BSG Ecology 
in 2014 (Appendix 3.14).  
Otter 
4.2.72 Three watercourse suitable for otter commuting were identified within the Electrical 
Connection Site.  
4.2.73 Outside of the Electrical Connection Site, but within the wider Project Site Boundary 
plus a 100 m buffer; a further ten watercourses were identified as being suitable for 
supporting commuting otter and two watercourses were suitable for supporting 
foraging otter, holt and couch creation. One potential couch was identified with a 
trampled vegetation track leading to it which suggested occasional use by a 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
12 
 
mammal.  Two mammal tracks were identified; these may have been fox or another 
mammal.  No spraints, holts, footprints, anal jelly or other signs were identified 
during the otter surveys.  
4.2.74 One couch and slide next to a watercourse with a pathway leading from an area of 
marshy grassland, and feeding remains and a spraint were identified during the 
badger survey.  These were recorded outside of the otter study area Figure 1.1. of 
Appendix 3.10) but adjacent to a watercourse that flows through and immediately 
adjacent to the wider Project Site Boundary.  
4.2.75 Due to the confirmed presence of otter upstream from the Electrical Connection 
Site in 2015, the presence of spraints and a footprint from a nearby pond in May 
2017 and the presence of a couch, slide pathway, feeding remains and a spraint 
from a watercourse that flows through and immediately adjacent to the Project Site 
Boundary it can be concluded that otters are still active in the locality.  As such it is 
likely that otters use the suitable watercourses within the Electrical Connection Site 
for occasional commuting and potentially other activities although no evidence was 
found during survey.  
Brown Hare 
4.2.76 No records of brown hare Lepus europaeus were returned from the local records 
centre.  
4.2.77 Sightings of brown hare were made during surveys for other species. A targeted 
survey for brown hare was not undertaken.  
4.2.78 Scrub, woodland edge and grassland habitat present along the Electrical 
Connection are suitable for supporting the species.  
Badger 
4.2.79 A badger survey was conducted in November 2017. The badger study area 
encompassed all suitable habitats accessible within the wider Project Site 
Boundary and within a 100 m radius from the Project Site Boundary (shown on 
Figure 1 of Appendix 3.11) including the Electrical Connection Site.  
4.2.80 The scrub, woodland edge and grassland habitat present along the Electrical 
Connection are suitable for supporting the species. Five setts were identified during 
the badger survey, all of which were well outside of the Electrical Connection Site 
Boundary.  
4.2.81 The survey also identified signs of badger activity including a latrine and a dung pit 
within the Electrical Connection Site. It is therefore likely that badger use the 
Electrical Connection Site on a regular basis for foraging and to commute between 
foraging areas within the wider landscape.

ii. Operation 
4.2.83 No effects are anticipated through the operation phase of the Electrical Connection. 
4.3 
Flood Risk and Water Quality 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.3.1 
For this section, a 1 km study area from the wider Project Site Boundary has been 
adopted based on a potential “zone of influence”, which is defined as a distance 
over which significant effects on important water receptors/features can reasonably 
have the potential to occur. The Electrical Connection Site sits completely within the 
study area.   
4.3.2 
This section is supported by the assessment demonstrated in: 
 Appendix 4.1: Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA); and 
 Appendix 4.2: WFD Screening Assessment. 
 
i. 
Topography and Land Use  
4.3.3 
The topography of the study area is reasonably elevated and steeply sloping. 
Ground levels across the Electrical Connection Site vary from approximately 93.8 
m AOD at the highest point to 77.1 m AOD at the lowest. The Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station is located immediately to the north of the Access Road and is 
constructed on raised ground at a level of approximately 87 m AOD. This is 
approximately 5-8 m above the flood plain of the field drainage and ordinary 
watercourse to the south of the existing Access Road, which drains to the Afon 
Llan. 
4.3.4 
The land within the Electrical Connection Site is currently used for sheep and horse 
grazing with existing development consisting of the National Grid car park between 
the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station and access roads. The area 
surrounding the Electrical Connection Site is, at present, predominantly rural, 
although there is Felindre Park and Share to the south and a substantial amount of 
utility infrastructure in the area, some of which cross the Electrical Connection Site. 
There are a number of solar farms in fields to the north east of the Electrical 
Connection Site. In addition, there are some springs and drainage channels/ditches 
within the Electrical Connection Site that drain the land and discharge into the Afon 
Llan River. The current land uses are considered “Less vulnerable” to flooding 
according to the classifications within the Welsh Government’s Technical Advice 
Note (TAN) on Development and Flood Risk (Ref.4.2). 
ii. Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology 
4.3.5 
The British Geological Survey (BGS), online mapping data, provides details of both 
the regional and local geology of the study area. The data indicates that the study 
area is underlain by bedrock of the Grovesend Formation, comprising mudstone, 
siltstone and sandstone (Figure 4.5: Bedrock Geology). Superficial deposits across 
the study area are quite variable. However, they primarily comprise till and 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
16 
 
glaciofluvial deposits (sands and gravels) with a smaller area of peat, to the north of 
the Electrical Connection Site (Figure 4.6: Superficial Geology). The thickness of 
the superficial deposits beneath the Electrical Connection Site is currently 
unknown. Groundwater occurs in both the superficial and bedrock beneath the 
study area. 
4.3.6 
Natural Resource Wales (NRW) has designated the bedrock geology beneath the 
study area as a Secondary A aquifer with the superficial deposits designated a 
mixture of Secondary A aquifer and unproductive strata. Secondary A aquifers are 
permeable layers capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than 
strategic scale and, in some cases, can form a vital source of base flow to rivers. 
Unproductive strata are rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have 
negligible significance for water supply or river base flow. Soils in the study area 
are variable, designated to have high, intermediate and low leachate potential. 
4.3.7 
Groundwater movement within the underlying geology is likely to be limited 
considering the aquifer designations as discussed above. Although the Electrical 
Connection Site is elevated, shallow or perched groundwater within the superficial 
deposits is expected to be reasonably close to the surface and in hydraulic 
connectivity with the surface watercourses present within the Electrical Connection 
Site and immediate surroundings.   
4.3.8 
The objectives of the WFD have been used to assess the groundwater quality in 
the study area. The Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB41002G200600) and Swansea Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB410002G201000) are two WFD groundwater bodies within the study area (as 
shown on Figure 4.7: Groundwater Bodies). Information on their status regarding 
water quality is available from NRW Rivers and Waterbodies website (accessed 
October 2017). According to the NRW website, the current quantitative water 
quality for both the Carmarthen and Swansea water bodies is good and predicted 
to remain so beyond 2015, based on the most recent available data from 2015.  
4.3.9 
However, the overall 2015 Cycle 2 Status and current chemical quality for both 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures and Swansea Carboniferous Coal 
Measures groundwater bodies are reported to be poor and are expected to remain 
so beyond 2015. There are no identified designated groundwater SPZs or drinking 
water Safeguard Zones with regards to agricultural activities within the study area. 
Furthermore, information on the status of the Carmarthen and Swansea 
Carboniferous WFD groundwater bodies shows that they are not targeted for 
improvement within the Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP). 
4.3.10 The Landmark Envirocheck Report (Appendix 8.1) has identified no groundwater 
abstraction licences associated with the Electrical Connection Site. The Landmark 
report identified only one licence located within 100 m of the wider Project Site 
Boundary, recorded 56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, licence 
number 22/59/4/0027 dated February 1993, for general farming and domestic use. 
Recent date (received on 9 October 2017) on private groundwater and abstraction

17 
 
licences received from CCS and NRW respectively did not identify this licence or 
any other licences within 4 km of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary.  
iii. Contaminated Land 
4.3.11 No intrusive site investigation has been completed to inform this Report. However, 
as the majority of the Electrical Connection Site is undeveloped, it is unlikely to 
have experienced significant potentially contaminative activities. Figure 4.8: 
Potential Pollution Sources shows current or historical potential pollution 
point/aerial sources within the study area. It also includes historic landfill and 
industrial land use activities that have a higher potential for ground contamination 
such as the disused (inert) landfill site located approximately 605 m north of the 
Electrical Connection Boundary, a coal mine north of Abergelli Farm and the 
Substation. 
4.3.12 A mine spoil dump covered approximately three-quarters of the landfill area from 
the former Abergelli Colliery (Figure 4.8: Potential Pollution Sources). This mine 
waste was largely removed leaving a layer of well compacted mine waste over the 
majority of the landfill area. Part of the ground that was covered by mine spoil was 
formerly used for drying out of water treatment sludge (aluminium sulphate) though 
this ceased when the landfill became operational. No further information regarding 
potential impacts to the water environment from this operation is known. 
iv. Surface Water and Groundwater Features 
4.3.13 There are both designated "ordinary" and "main" surface water bodies within the 
study area (Figures B2 and B3, Appendix B of FCA provided in Appendix 4.1). 
Within the Electrical Site, there are springs and spring-drainage rivulets and 
drainage ditches that drain into the Afon Llan River. The Afon Llan River and its 
tributaries are the closest surface water features in the vicinity of the Electrical 
Connection Site. The Afon Llan River catchment includes all of the Electrical 
Connection Site. The Loughor Estuary, alongside other ecological statutory 
designated sites more distant from and downstream of the Electrical Connection 
Site, are also discussed. 
4.3.14 There are three WFD classified surface water bodies (Figure 4.9: Surface Water 
Bodies) within the study area: the Afon Llan (Water body ID GB110058032070 to 
the south of the Electrical Connection Site), the Afon Lliw (Water body ID 
GB110059032100 to the north) and the Loughor Estuary (Burry Inlet Inner) (Water 
body ID GB531005913500 located approximately 7 km south) into which these 
water bodies discharges.  
4.3.15 The Afon Llan River is the closest WFD designated surface watercourse that 
traverses the immediate vicinity of the Electrical Connection Site. It flows in a 
south-westerly direction and is designated as a Main River by NRW.  The Afon Llan 
links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen 
Bay.  The rivers will not be directly altered by the Electrical Connection. 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM

4.3.16 There is one WFD groundwater body (i.e. the Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal 
Measures Water body ID GB41002G200600) in the vicinity of the Electrical 
Connection Site. This WFD water body is not targeted for improvements within the 
Western Wales RBMP. 
4.3.1 
Information about the current and predicted status of the Afon Llan River and the 
other designated WFD water bodies within the study area are available from NRW 
Cycle 2 River and Waterbodies websites (Ref.4.3) and is summarised in Table 4.6. 
Details of groundwater bodies are provided in Table 4.7.

4.3.2 
The Afon Lliw is located approximately 1.3 km north of the Electrical Connection 
Site and has been assessed under the WFD. 
4.3.3 
There are other smaller watercourses in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection 
Site that drain to the Afon Llan, along with some springs and small ponds. These 
have not been individually assessed previously under the WFD due to lack of data 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
19 
 
and because their small size means their overall importance to the river basin 
district is reduced. 
4.3.4 
Both the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw discharge to the Loughor Estuary west of 
Swansea, approximately 7 km from the Electrical Connection Site Boundary. The 
Electrical Connection Site lies outside of the Afon Lliw topographic catchment and 
therefore it is expected that any direct hydraulic connectivity will be limited. The 
Afon Llan does, however, join with the Afon Lliw approximately 9 km downstream of 
the Electrical Connection Site Boundary. There may also be some potential for the 
cross-transfer of shallow groundwater flows between the two catchments. The 
Loughor Estuary has been assessed under the WFD. NRW has identified that the 
Loughor Estuary contains designated Shellfisheries. 
4.3.5 
No surface water abstraction points have been identified within the Electrical 
Connection Site. The closest surface water abstractions, assumed to be from a 
tributary of the Afon Llan, have been identified approximately 1.6 km northeast and 
upstream of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary.  Accordingly, no impact to this 
receptor is envisaged and it is not considered further. 
4.3.6 
There are also a number of small drainage ditches and land drains which output 
into the ordinary watercourses and then the Afon Llan.   
v. Flood Risk 
4.3.7 
There are no flood defence structures in the study area including within the 
Electrical Connection Site. 
4.3.8 
The Lle Geo-Portal Development Advice Map (DAM) (Ref.4.4) determines that the 
Electrical Connection Site is outside of the DAM Zones and considered to be at 
very low risk of flooding i.e. DAM Zone A. Figure D1 in Appendix 4.1 displays the 
flood zones and Project Site Boundary.   
4.3.9 
During a site visit, the area between the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the 
eastern end of the Electrical Connection Site was notably saturated. It is assumed 
that this area and the lower lying area to the south east of the Electrical Connection 
Site Boundary may be susceptible to groundwater or surface water flooding.  This 
is consistent with BGS groundwater flooding susceptibility mapping showing the 
area to the south east of the Electrical Connection Site as potential groundwater 
flooding at surface. 
4.3.10 The literature review has not identified any historic incidents of flooding affecting 
the Electrical Connection Site from any source.   
4.3.11 The CCS Preliminary Flood Risk Assessments (PFRA) (2011) (Ref.4.5), Level 1 
(2010) and Level 2 (2012) Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment (SFCA’s) do 
not report any recorded flood events from groundwater sources within the CCS 
region.  The Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) (2015) indicates that there is a 
low risk of groundwater flooding across the CCS region (Ref.4.6). 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
20 
 
4.3.12 NRW online maps show that reservoir flooding is not predicted to affect the 
Electrical Connection Site.  This is relevant with respect to the upstream Lliw 
Reservoir. 
vi. Drainage 
4.3.13 Most of the Electrical Connection Site is undeveloped and surface water run-off 
flows overland and through field drains discharging into the Afon Llan. These field 
drains and drainage ditches can be seen to cross the Electrical Connection Site 
and flow to the ordinary watercourses. The largest ordinary watercourse flows 
south along the east perimeter of the Electrical Connection Site before discharging 
to the Afon Llan.   
4.3.14 It has been identified that there are no foul sewers within the Electrical Connection 
Site, and therefore assumed that the foul effluent from the nearby farm and 
residential properties discharge to cess pits and septic tanks. 
b) 
Potential Environmental Effects 
4.3.15 For water quality and resources and flooding, no impact is expected to arise from 
the construction and operation of the Electrical Connection.  
4.3.16 Good practice management measures for the reduction and control of water 
pollution including works near water will be set out in the Surface Water 
Management Plan (WQ01) (Appendix 2.4) and Drainage Strategy, WQ08 and 
WQ09 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1). No additional mitigation measures 
have been proposed.   
4.4 
Air Quality 
a) Baseline Conditions 
i. 
CCS Air Quality Monitoring and Reporting 
4.4.1 
A review of existing baseline air quality has been undertaken using information 
presented within the CCS Progress Report 2016 (Ref.4.7), information published 
on an official CCS Air Quality website (Ref.4.8) and Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) website (Ref.4.9). 
4.4.2 
There are a number of Continuous Monitoring Stations (CMS) in the administrative 
area of CCS. A summary of the monitoring stations and last five years of monitoring 
data from each, are presented in Table 4.8 to Table 4.11.

Additionally CCS managed a network of diffusion tube monitoring sites focused on 
roadside locations mainly at busy junctions and along narrow and congested roads. 
The Project Site Boundary is at a rural location and therefore monitoring data from 
the NO2 diffusion tube network are not considered relevant to inform the air quality 
baseline at the Electrical Connection Site. 
ii. Defra Mapped Background Data

Local Air Quality Monitoring (LAQM) reports and Air Quality Assessments where 
local background monitoring is unavailable or inappropriate for use.  The current 
maps are based on a background year of 2015 and provide background pollutant 
concentrations for NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 for each 1 km grid square within the UK for 
all years between 2015 and 2030.  Defra also provides historic mapped estimates 
from 2001 for Carbon Monoxide (CO).  The mapped Defra NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 
concentrations at the Electrical Connection Site are presented in Table 4.12 for 
2016.

b) Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction 
4.4.6 
The dust emission potential for construction of the Electrical Connection is 
assessed as being small during earthworks and construction considering that the 
earthworks are confined to small area and construction emissions will be 
moderated by the largely prefabricated nature of the installation. Emissions from 
trackout have a small dust potential due to the number of vehicles operating and 
the fact there will be minimal amount of excavation/trenching needed. There is no 
demolition associated with this phase of the works. 
4.4.7 
Table 4.14 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition 
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout as a function of the works 
associated with the Electrical Connection.

the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1). 
ii. Operation 
4.4.10 No impacts on air quality are anticipated from the operation of the Electrical 
Connection.

Noise 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.5.1 
Representative background and ambient sound levels are summarised below in 
Table 4.15 for each of the four Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) located in Figure 
4.10: Noise Sensitive Receptor Locations. The baseline sound levels presented 
within this report were measured by AECOM in February 2018 (Appendix 5: Noise 
Survey). NSR 2 and 3 are not listed below as access could not be obtained at 
these locations to measure background levels. However, the lack of monitoring 
data from NSRs 2 and 3 does not impact the comprehensiveness or validity of the 
assessments, and conclusions on the impacts and effects on NSRs 2 and 3 can be 
drawn from application of professional judgement to the results for the other four 
NSRs.

Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction 
4.5.2 
Noise levels experienced by local receptors during construction will depend upon a 
number of variables, the most significant of which are: 
 The noise generated by plant or equipment used on-site, generally expressed 
as Sound Power Levels (Lw) or the vibration generated by the plant; 
 The periods of use of the plant on-site, known as its on-time;  
 The distance between the noise/vibration source and the receptor; 
 The noise attenuation due to ground absorption, air absorption and barrier 
effects;  
 In some instances, the reflection of noise due to the presence of hard surfaces 
such as the sides of buildings; and 
 The time of day or night the works are undertaken. 
4.5.3 
The predicted indicative construction noise levels for the Electrical Connection are 
given in Table 4.16 below.

4.5.4 
The Residential NSR4 and NSR5 are the closest of the identified NSRs to the 
Electrical Connection and have the highest predicted noise levels.  
4.5.5 
The predicted indicative construction noise levels range between 31 and 46 
equivalent continuous level decibels (LAeq, T dB). This is lower than the lowest 
observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) as derived from British Standard (BS) 
5228:2009 of 65 LAeq,T dB for day time, 55 LAeq,T dB for evenings and weekends 
and 45 LAeq,T dB for night time.  
4.5.6 
No additional mitigation is proposed however good practice noise management is 
considered within the N01- N09 Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1), Outline CEMP, 
GEN01 (Appendix 2.2). 
ii. Operation 
4.5.7 
No effects are anticipated during operation due to the nature of development.

4.6 
Landscape 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.6.1 
The study area considered in this section is 5 km from the Project Site Boundary. 
This can be viewed on Figure 4.11: Landscape Designations. 
i. 
Landform 
4.6.2 
The Electrical Connection Site is located within a valley with ground rising to the 
north, east and west which provides visual containment. Ground levels vary across 
the Electrical Connection Site from approximately 93.8 m AOD in the north-west 
corner to 77.12 m AOD along the southern perimeter. Ground levels generally fall in 
a southerly and south easterly direction.  
ii. Movement and Connectivity 
4.6.3 
Junction 46 on the M4 lies approximately 1.5 km to the south of the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary providing immediate access to the strategic road 
network between London and South Wales. To the immediate north of Junction 46 
lies the Felindre Park and Share at Brynwhilhach adjacent to the un-developed 
Felindre Business Park. A network of minor roads dissect the 5 km study area, 
connecting settlements and farmsteads. These are typically surrounded by 
earthbanks with hedgerow and tree planting which contains views along them and 
successfully integrates them into the wider landscape. The study area is well 
served with PRoW although not all are easily accessible nor do they appear to be 
regularly used. A section of the Gower Way, a long distance footpath through the 
Afon Lliw valley passes within approximately 2 km at its closest point to the 
northern boundary of the Electrical Connection Site.  
iii. Land Use and Built Form 
4.6.4 
The Electrical Connection Site is predominantly covered with pasture which is 
currently used for sheep and horse grazing. A soft surface horse training track, 
known as ‘The Gallops’, is immediately adjacent to the eastern Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary and runs diagonally north-west to south-east. Broadleaf 
woodland which is classified in part as Ancient Woodland lies around the Access 
Road to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station. Fields across the 
Electrical Connection Site are subdivided by ditches, post and wire fencing, 
remnant hedgerows and are interspersed with scrub vegetation. 
4.6.5 
Pastoral land and woodland are the predominant land uses within the wider valley, 
including Penllergaer Forest and other smaller broadleaved woodlands that are 
scattered throughout the valley. Combined with the network of hedgerows and 
hedgerow tree planting which define many of the small and irregular shaped fields 
as well as the network of minor roads, the landscape displays a well vegetated 
character. This character of woodland, rolling topography and visual containment 
helps integrate developments in the rural fabric. 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
27 
 
4.6.6 
The western part of the Electrical Connection Site encompasses the existing 
Access Road and the National Grid Car Park, adjacent to the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station. Both the Substation and the Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
comprise large scale power infrastructure facilities characterised by tall industrial 
structures enclosed by security fencing and set within woodland planting. Pylons 
are prominent across the landscape and converge at the Substation. Pylons range 
in height with the closest pylon to the north of the Electrical Connection Site 44 m in 
height and the pylon to the south of the Electrical Connection Site, 51 m tall. 
4.6.7 
To the west of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary lies an Air-Insulated 
Switchgear (AIS) substation at Waun Ffyrdd. The associated overhead 
transmission lines and steel pylons are prominent elements within the valley 
landscape. To the north lies the Felindre Water Treatment Works at Waun y Garn-
wen which is partially screened by planting although apparent in more elevated 
views from the north. 
4.6.8 
A number of solar farms lie around the Electrical Connection Site particularly to the 
north-east and east as well as to the north-west. The Felindre Business Park 
adjacent to the Park and Share at Brynwhilhach has been partially constructed with 
service infrastructure in place along with an outline landscape structure including 
stone walls and planting.   
4.6.9 
The main settlement in the 5 km study area is Swansea, with the northern edges of 
the city forming notable built form in the south and south eastern parts of the study 
area, approximately 2 km from the Electrical Connection Site Boundary. The Driver 
and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) office block forms a prominent tall building 
and local landmark in many views that look south. Morriston hospital complex at 
Pant-lasau lies to the south-east of the Electrical Connection Site with the 
settlement of Clydach extending to the east. Settlement locally is dispersed 
comprising small villages such as Felindre to the north-west or scattered properties 
and farmsteads.  
iv. Landscape Designations 
4.6.10 Landscapes can be given international, national, regional or local designations in 
recognition of their importance, outstanding scenic interest or attractiveness.  The 
Landscape Designation within a 5 and 15 km study area from the Project Site 
Boundary can be viewed on Figure 4.11: Landscape Designations.  
4.6.11 The Brecon Beacons National Park lies 13.5 km to the north of the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary at its closest point. There is no theoretical visibility 
between the Electrical Connection Site and the National Park due to the distance 
and topography.  As such the Brecon Beacons National Park as a landscape 
receptor is not considered further. 
4.6.12 The Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) lies 10 km to the south-
west of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary. The Gower AONB was designated 
in 1956 for its classic limestone coast and the variety of natural habitats. The 
Gower’s scenery ranges from dune and salt marsh in the north to dramatic 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
28 
 
limestone cliffs along the south coast, interspersed by sandy beaches. Inland the 
hills of Cefn Bryn and Rhossili Down dominate the landscape of traditional small 
fields, wooded valleys and open commons. There is limited visibility between the 
Electrical Connection and the AONB. Views of the Electrical Connection Site from 
within the Gower AONB are substantially screened by intervening woodland at 
Penllergaer Forest and Valley Wood, intervening hedgerows, hedgerow trees and 
copses and built form within settlements at Gorseinion, Penllergaer, Gowerton and 
Waunarlwydd, as well as extensive urban development within Swansea.  
4.6.13 SLAs are identified in the CCS draft Local Development Plan (LDP) within Policy 
ER 5: Landscape Protection (Ref.4.10) and are identified on Figure 4.11. The 
Policy states that priority will be given to protecting, managing and enhancing the 
character and quality of the three SLAs: 
 Mawr Uplands; 
 Lower Loughor Valley and Estuary and Southern part of the Burry Inlet; and 
 North East Gower and Cockett Valley. 
4.6.14 Within the SLAs, development will only be permitted where proposals include 
measures to protect, manage and enhance the character and quality of the 
particular landscape features for which the SLA has been designated. The aim of 
the Policy is to ensure that the character and quality of the County’s most valued 
landscapes are protected from inappropriate development and to encourage the 
management, enhancement and creation of key landscape features where 
possible. 
4.6.15 There are four Country Parks within the wider landscape but all lie beyond the 15 
km study area and do not experience any theoretical visibility. 
b) 
Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction 
4.6.16 The Electrical Connection is routed immediately adjacent to the alignment of the 
new section of Access Road. The construction activity and plant associated with the 
Electrical Connection alone will only result in localised and limited effects to the 
landscape character resulting in a small loss of woodland and hedgerow planting. 
This will not affect the integrity or key characteristics of the landscape and is 
therefore not considered significant.   
4.6.17 No additional mitigation is proposed, but good practice landscape and visual 
management measures will be will be included within the Outline CEMP (GEN01) 
(Appendix 2.2) and LEMS (GEN02) (Appendix 2.3) of the Mitigation Register 
(Appendix 2.1). 
ii. Operation 
4.6.18 Once operational there will be no significant visual effects or effects on the 
landscape character as a result of the Electrical Connection.

i. 
Palaeolithic and Mesolithic (1,000,000 – 4000 BC) 
4.7.3 
Evidence for human activity during the Palaeolithic period is extremely sparse 
across Wales as a whole, with the principal find sites being concentrated on the 
Carboniferous Limestone zone of the south-west coast and north-east Wales. The 
known settlement sites in South Wales have been discovered within caves, with no 
open sites yet recognised. The coast of Gower has yielded several very significant 
sites, but there is nothing known closer to the study area, nor have any stray finds 
been recovered locally. Although the Mesolithic period is somewhat better 
represented across Wales as a whole, known sites in South East Wales are once 
again concentrated in coastal areas, with few discoveries made in inland locations. 
No Mesolithic sites or finds are known within the study areas (Ref.4.11). 
ii. Neolithic and Bronze Age (4000 – 700 BC) 
4.7.4 
The Neolithic period in Britain is differentiated from the preceding Mesolithic by the 
onset of a series of profound social, technological, and economic changes. The 
period coincides with the first domestication of animals and of cereal cultivation, 
and is accompanied by changes in material culture, including the development of 
ceramics and new lithic typologies. It was also a time when long-distance 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
30 
 
connections developed across Britain, Ireland and mainland Europe, alongside 
mechanisms of long-distance exchange, principally of lithic artefacts (Ref.4.12 and 
Ref.4.13). From this period the evidence for human activity increases significantly 
across Wales, and it becomes possible to discuss the study areas specifically, as 
opposed to merely the broader regional pattern.  
4.7.5 
Neolithic communities were the first to leave their mark prominently on the 
landscape through the construction of monuments, which have traditionally 
dominated interpretations of the period. The emergence of monumental 
architecture provides evidence for new forms of social organisation and complexity, 
including ritualised mortuary activity involving formal burial deposition, ceremonial 
practices and the construction of social and cultural identities. The range of 
monument types present in South Wales is narrower than in areas such as 
Wessex, but its uplands are characterised by numerous, highly visible Neolithic and 
Bronze Age funerary and ritual monuments – principally but not exclusively in the 
form of cairns Ref.4.14 The majority of cairns were funerary monuments, although 
some may have served as memorials or have marked territorial boundaries. Very 
many appear to have been located for dramatic effect, often on ridge crests or on 
the saddle of hills close to well-travelled paths (Ref.4.15 and Ref.4.16). Others had 
utilitarian origins, having been formed by field clearance for agriculture: however, 
dating these latter features is difficult and some could plausibly relate to more 
recent times. 
4.7.6 
Within the study areas there are five cairns of presumed Neolithic to Bronze Age 
date that are designated as Scheduled Monuments. All are shown on Figure 4.13. 
These comprise a ring cairn on Craig Fawr (SM GM380), Pant-y-Ffa Round Cairn 
(SM GM201), Mynydd Pysgodlyn Round Barrow (SM GM202), Garn Goch Round 
Barrow (SM GM199), and a ring cairn on Tor Clawdd (SM GM353). The visual 
interrelationship of such monuments is a well-established theory as a key to 
understanding their positioning within the landscape. A study of a stone alignment 
at Bancbryn, located approximately 3 km north of Tor Clawdd (8 km from Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary; not illustrated), posits (but cannot prove) that the inter-
visibility between those stones and Hartland Point, on the north Devon Coast, is 
significant. Incorporated into this alignment is Tor Clawdd, which is framed to the 
left side of the Hartland Point (Ref.4.17). 
4.7.7 
There is no evidence for contemporary settlement within the study areas. 
iii. Iron Age (700 BC – AD 43) 
4.7.8 
The society that emerged in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age was markedly 
different from its predecessor. The emergence of the hillfort points to a changing 
emphasis in the settlement pattern and to a radically altered social dynamic.   
4.7.9 
Although hillforts are the dominant monument of the period within the modern 
landscape, they are known to have existed in conjunction with wider undefended 
rural settlement, of which traces are mostly ephemeral and easily destroyed by 
cultivation. As Lynch et al. comment, ‘though overshadowed by the hillforts, the 
lightly enclosed or open farmstead must have shared a close relationship with their 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
31 
 
more impressive counterparts’ (Ref.4.15). Given this situation, it is reasonable to 
assume some level of settlement in the area, although its character and location 
remains unknown. 
4.7.10 A probable Iron Age site is located within the 5 km study areas, located 1.35 km to 
the west of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary, as shown in Figure 4.12 and 
4.13. This is Scheduled Monument (SM GM308), which comprises an oval 
enclosure measuring c. 90 m x 60 m, defined by a wide earthen bank that stands 
up to 1 m high in places. Its date is unproven but its morphology suggests it 
belongs to the Iron Age, with either a defensive and/or settlement function. The 
monument, now standing within woodland, is well preserved and retains 
considerable archaeological potential. 
iv. Roman (AD 43 – AD 410) 
4.7.11 The study areas are removed from the main framework of Roman forts and roads 
in the region, which developed during the conquest of South Wales between 47 
and 77 AD (Ref.4.18and Ref.4.19). Forts were established at Coelbren, Neath, 
Loughor and Carmarthen, connected by a road network that can, in part, still be 
traced in the modern landscape (Ref.4.20). The remains of two Roman practice 
camps are known just outside of the 5 km study area, south of the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary, on Mynydd Carn Goch (SM GM269).  
4.7.12 A re-analysis of the rural evidence may challenge the widely held belief that the 
indigenous population was largely untouched by the Romans (Ref.4.21). However, 
identifiably Roman sites are entirely absent from the 1 km study area, although a 
continuity of native occupation must be assumed throughout this period and into 
the immediate post-Roman era. 
v. Medieval (AD 410 – AD 1540) 
4.7.13 The early medieval period in South Wales is broadly characterised by the 
emergence of distinct regional kingdoms, and of Christianity, with the possibility of 
some level of Viking depredation (Ref.4.18). Archaeologically, the period is very 
poorly evidenced, and no settlement sites of this era are known within the study 
areas – although it is possible that some Anglo-Norman and medieval Welsh sites 
may have earlier origins. One possible monument belonging to this period is the 
base of a stone cross within Llangyfelach churchyard, 1.6 km south of the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary (SM GM299). Though not precisely dated, stylistically it 
would appear to belong to the early medieval period. 
4.7.14 Evidence from the later medieval period in South Wales (i.e. after the Norman 
Conquest of the region) is far more abundant. No certain medieval sites are known 
within the Electrical Connection Site or 1 km study area, but Pen y Fedw (PRN 
01525w) is suggested to have its origins in the 14th century (Ref.4.22), although the 
evidence supporting this assertion is unclear. Assuming some degree of continuity, 
some of the other post-medieval farms in the district could reasonably be assumed 
to have earlier origins.

4.7.15 Within the 5 km study area, the scheduled earthwork known as Cae Castell is 
probably medieval in date and, on the basis of its place-name, quite possibly 
defensive in character (SM GM439). Meanwhile, the tower of the St David’s church, 
Llangyfelach, is the likely standing remains of a former 14th century church that 
stood within the curtilage of the present churchyard (LB 26236). 
4.7.16 The present-day agricultural field pattern was largely established by the beginning 
of the 18th century, as evidenced by the 2”:1 mile map of Glamorgan and 
Monmouthshire (1812-14; Ref.4.23). Of particular interest on this map are the 
hedgerows identified in this Report as AB03 and AB04, both of which are within the 
Project Site Boundary, but outside of the Electrical Connection Site. The date at 
which the field pattern as a whole began to develop is not known, but it is possible 
that some parts may have medieval origins. 
vi. Post-medieval (AD 1540 – AD 1901) 
4.7.17 Within the 1 km study area, the earliest forms of post-medieval remains appear to 
be predominately of domestic and agricultural purpose. One example (albeit 
immediately outside the 1 km study area) is Cynghordy Fawr (PRN 02750w), which 
is located in the north-east of the study area. This building is fairly typical of the 
architectural style of this period, comprising a 17th-century longhouse with a 
courtyard and further ranges including a stable block and granary. 
4.7.18 George Yates’ Map of Glamorgan, dated 1799 (Ref.4.24), shows ‘Abergelly Fach’ 
(AB02) as an isolated farm building, disconnected from a north/south aligned lane 
north of the Electrical Connection Site. A map of Glamorganshire (1812-14; 
Ref.4.23) depicts the same farm as comprising two north-east/south-west aligned 
rectangular buildings set within their own grounds, and connected to the existing 
north/south aligned lane via a short driveway. To the east of AB02 is the farmstead 
of ‘Abergelly-fawr’ (AB01), featuring at least two buildings and an associated 
connecting lane to the north. The remaining land is shown as an enclosed field 
system, which includes boundaries AB03 and AB04, located immediately north of 
Abergelly-fach.  
4.7.19 By the time of the surveying of the Llangyfelach Tithe Map of 1838 (Ref.4.25), new 
field boundaries had been created and the fields made smaller and more irregular 
in shape. Boundaries AB03 and AB04 remained intact, forming the southern 
boundary of three irregular fields to the east of ‘Abergelly fach’ (AB01). The field 
systems depicted on the tithe map can also been seen on Ordnance Survey (OS) 
map of 1883-1884 (Ref.4.26). By this time ‘Abergelli-fach’ (AB02) had expanded, 
comprising a farmstead of at least six buildings. The most significant development 
is the establishment of a large plantation in north of the Electrical Connection Site. 
The subsequent OS edition of 1897 (Ref.4.27) names the plantation as ‘Abergelli-
fach Plantation’. A quarry (PRN 01349w) is depicted for the first time, and is 
labelled as a ‘gravel pit’ immediately west of AB02. 
4.7.20 In the early post-medieval period the population of the larger Swansea area began 
to decline as the administrative centre for the region moved to Cardiff (Ref.4.28). 
This decline reversed in the early 18th century as the transport of materials for use

33 
 
in industry such as coal and metals along the River Tawe became essential. The 
River Tawe was a vital trade route during the 18th and 19th centuries at the time 
when Swansea became renowned as a copper smelting centre with such works as 
the Hafod Copperworks (PRN 05956w) and the Landore Copperworks (PRN 
01586w). Swansea’s copper industry rose to prominence in the 18th century. 
Llangyfelach Copperworks (NPRN 34094), established in 1717, was the first of the 
major Swansea copperworks; its site is located beyond the 5 km study area, at the 
junction of Cwm Level Road and Neath Road to the north of Landore viaduct 
(Ref.4.29). 
4.7.21 No copper-working sites are known within the 1 km study area, but several sites 
attest to the supporting coal-mining industries which grew up in Swansea’s 
hinterland. Collieries established during this period within the study areas include 
Bryn Whilach Colliery (PRN 01340w) and an unnamed colliery at Mawr (PRN 
01345w).  
4.7.22 Industrial transport networks are also evidenced. In 1798, the Swansea Canal was 
opened, serving to increase the industrial capacity of the area, such that at one 
stage in the 19th century, three quarters of the world’s copper ore was being 
transported to Swansea for processing (Ref.4.30). The century following the canal’s 
construction saw the city’s population grow from approximately 10,000 people to 
95,000 people. Transport routes were established over land not only to supply the 
copperworks with raw materials but also to link the mines and collieries with the 
works and ports. Within the 5 km study area these include a tramroad (PRN 
05950.0w) linking Bryn-whilach and Pen-rhiwfelen coal pits to Clydach Road, a 
mineral railway (PRN 03017.0w) situated within the community of Llangyfelach, and 
now a dismantled railway (PRN 02916.0w) serving Felindre Pit on the east side of 
the Lliw Valley. 
vii. Modern (1901-present) 
4.7.23 Due to the availability of cheaper copper and coal from overseas, the industrial 
prosperity of the South Wales region began to decline in the early 20th century 
(Ref.4.29). Throughout this period Swansea still remained a centre of industry 
within South Wales, with a population at the time of the outbreak of World War II of 
167,000 people (Ref.4.31). The Velindre works (PRN 02905w; 1.4 km south of the 
Electrical Connection Site Boundary) was built as part of a post-war development 
programme begun after the Steel Company of Wales was formed in 1947. In 1952 
the company started work on the construction of a cold reduction and electrolytic 
tinning plant at the site near Llangyfelach. The Velindre works began production in 
October 1956. The main building, the Mill Bay, was of very significant size: 1440 
feet (ft) long, 100 ft wide and 66 ft high. It was closed down in September 1989 and 
its buildings were subsequently demolished. 
4.7.24 One historic asset, 0.61 km to the north of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary 
originates in this period: Abergelli Colliery (NPRN 80607). When first shown on the 
OS map of 1931 (Ref.4.32), it comprised a water tank, engine houses, a slant 
(slanted shaft), and a tramway or railway following a course from the slant to a slag

heap at the north end of the colliery site. The colliery worked the Four Feet and 
Graigola (also known as the Brynwhilach) coal seams and was a registered colliery 
from 1926 to 1960 The owner, up to nationalisation, was the Graigola Merthyr Co. 
Ltd and it was worked in association with Clydach Merthyr Colliery located at Craig 
Cefn Parc, approximately 2.75 km north-east of the Electrical Connection Site 
Boundary (Ref.4.33). 
4.7.25 Aerial photographs of the area taken in 1970 (Ref.4.34) show the addition of an 
electrical substation to the south-west of Abergelli Farm. The next significant 
changes to the Electrical Connection Site are shown on aerial photographs taken in 
2008; these reflect the construction of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. The 
photographs show that the works included the installation of the Oil Pipeline from 
the road to the north of Abergelli farm, traversing the fields to the east and south of 
the farm, to the Substation, which extends over much of the Abergelli fach 
Plantation. As a part of this development, a section of historic field boundary AB03 
was removed for the pipeline easement. 
4.7.26 Aerial photographs of 2010 show this complex being extended southwards. By 
2015, much of the land to the east of the farm had been utilised for solar panels 
(Ref.4.34). 
viii. Historic landscape characterisation 
4.7.27 The Electrical Connection Site area lies in Landmap Historic Landscape Aspect 
Area H27 (Gower Supraboscus Agricultural). This is characterised by an irregular 
fieldscape with hedgerows and hedgebanks, reflecting a history of gradual and 
piecemeal enclosure in the valleys and foothills throughout the medieval and post-
medieval periods. There is some evidence for enclosure in the pre-Norman period, 
and the process continued into the second half of the 19th century. Some 
unenclosed land and woodland remains. Limited industrial activity (mainly mining) 
also took place here in the 19th century and has left residual traces in the 
landscape. The settlement pattern is predominantly of dispersed character, but 
ribbon developments occur in areas of former industrial activity. 
ix. Previous Investigations 
4.7.28 A watching brief was undertaken by Cambrian Archaeological Projects (Ref.4.35) 
during groundworks associated with the construction of a high pressure gas 
pipeline between Felindre and Brecon. The watching brief was conducted  through 
the fields to the east of Abergelli Farm, which is outside of the Electrical Connection 
Site, but within part of the Project Site Boundary. A single pit was noted and 
revealed evidence of in situ burning, which was potentially the remains of a hearth 
or furnace. It measured 1.5 m in diameter and was 0.2 m in depth. No date was 
ascertained for this feature. The site of this feature was located to the south of 
Abergelli farm at NGR SN 65136 01433, approximately 295 m outside of the 
Electrical Connection Site Boundary.   
4.7.29 Archaeological watching briefs undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology during the 
construction of the Oil Pipeline  revealed two undated charcoal spreads, north of 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
35 
 
the Electrical Connection Site Boundary, but within the wider Project Site Boundary. 
Elsewhere, two pits with charcoal and burnt stone were exposed, and were 
associated with a spread of burnt material containing two worked, undated, flints. 
An evaluation at Waun y Garnwen outside of the 1 km study area to the north and 
forming part of the same scheme of works, recorded four probable former field 
boundaries (Ref.4.36). 
4.7.30 A geophysical survey in the area immediately to the east of Abergelli Farm was 
undertaken in advance of the installation of a solar energy farm. The works 
identified probable soil-filled features in most of the study areas, and concluded 
that although some of the anomalies were weak or diffuse, most have potential to 
reflect the remains of archaeological features (Ref.4.37). 
4.7.31 On the south-east fringe of the 1 km study area, a watching brief was undertaken 
by Oxford Archaeology within the grounds of Morriston Hospital prior to the 
development of new parking facilities. A linear field boundary and ornamental 
features relating to the garden of the former Maes y Gwernen Hall were recorded 
(Ref.4.38). 
b) 
Potential Environmental Effects 
4.7.32 Construction and operation of the Electrical Connection will not impact on any 
known historic asset. No known historic assets exist within its footprint. 
4.7.33 A WSI will be prepared and a watching brief will be implemented during 
construction. In the event that any archaeology is discovered during construction it 
will be excavated, recorded and reported in line with the WSI as set out in CH02 of 
the Mitigation register (Appendix 2.1).

 Opportunities for sustainable travel. 
 
i. 
Local Highway Network 
4.8.3 
The Electrical Connection Site is served by the existing Access Road from the 
B4489, which is privately maintained and unlit. The width of the existing Access 
Road varies along its length between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered 
by trees and intermittent hedgerows. The existing Access Road connects to the 
B4489 via a simple priority junction. This is characterised by large radii on the 
minor arm (the Access Road) to accommodate Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) 
movements. 
4.8.4 
The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately 2.3 
km from the existing Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south 
(approximately 1.8 km from the existing Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 
40 miles per hour (mph) speed limit at its junction with the existing Access Road. At 
this location, the road has a 5.5 m wide carriageway and is unlit. Approximately 330 
m to the north of the existing Access Road, the B4489 becomes subject to the 
national speed limit. The B4489 continues a further 1.7 km north where it connects 
to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This section of the B4489 is unlit and 
ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places. The 
junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its approaches are subject to a 30 mph 
speed limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east for 1.6 km where it passes the 
northern extent of the Project Site Boundary. This section of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road is 
unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places. 
It is subject to a 30 mph speed limit, increasing to the national speed limit around 
900 m east of its junction with the B4489. It also serves the Felindre Water 
Treatment Works. 
4.8.5 
Approximately 475 m to the south of the existing Access Road, the B4489 is street 
lit. A further 75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm roundabout 
with the access to the Felindre Park and Share. 
4.8.6 
The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The northern 
dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489 and the eastbound 
on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises six 
arms; the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea Road, and the westbound on/off-
slips of the M4. The south-eastern arm of the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction 
with Pant Lasau Road approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell 
roundabout. These junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit. 
4.8.7 
For the purpose of this Report, the Local Highway Network has been segregated 
into the following key links:  
Electrical Connection Environmental Report

AECOM 
37 
 
 Link 1* – Rhyd-y-Pandy Road, between the AGI Access and the B4489; 
 Link 2* – B4489, between Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and the existing Access Road; 
 Link 3 – B4489, between the existing Access Road and the Felindre Park and 
Share; 
 Link 4 – B4489, between the Felindre Park and Share and the M4 Junction 46; 
 Link 5 – M4 eastbound on-slip; 
 Link 6 – A48, between the northern and southern dumbbell roundabouts of the 
M4 Junction 46; 
 Link 7 – M4 westbound off-slip; 
 Link 8 – A48, between the M4 Junction 46 and the A48/Pant Lasau Road mini-
roundabout; 
 Link 9 – Pant Lasau Road; 
 Link 10 – A48, southeast of the A48/Pant Lasau mini-roundabout; 
 Link 11 – B4489, south of the M4 Junction 46; and 
 Link 12 – A48, southwest of the M4 Junction 46. 
*These links are associated with access to the AGI during operation and are therefore not 
relevant to the assessment of the Electrical Connection. However, they have been 
provided in this report to give representative baseline conditions of the local 
highway network.   
4.8.8 
The local highway network is shown on Figure 4.14 and labelled with the links. 
ii. Highway Operational Conditions 
4.8.9 
An Automatic Traffic Count (ATC) survey was undertaken on the B4489 between 
the existing Access Road and the roundabout junction with the Felindre Park and 
Share. The survey was undertaken between Thursday 16th October 2014 and 
Wednesday 22nd October 2014. The traffic flow information for an average 
weekday is summarised in Table 4.19. Growth factors have been applied to the 
2014 data to represent conditions in 2017.

4.8.10 Table 4.19 shows that, on an average weekday, the B4489 carries approximately 
130 vehicles during the AM peak hour, 90 vehicles during the PM peak hour, and 
1,000 vehicles over the 24-hour period. HGVs account for no more than 2% of total 
traffic. 
4.8.11 Junction Turning Count surveys were also undertaken on Thursday 16th October 
2014 at the following junctions in the local highway network: 
 M4 Junction 46 Northern Dumbell Roundabout; 
 M4 Junction 46 Southern Dumbell Roundabout; and 
 A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. 
4.8.12 The traffic survey data is reproduced in Appendix 7.1. The 2014 traffic flows at the 
surveyed locations during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown on 
Figures 4.15 and 4.16 respectively. Growth factors have been applied to represent 
traffic flows in 2017, as shown on Figures 4.17 and 4.18 respectively. 
4.8.13 The surveyed junctions have been modelled using the Transport Research 
Laboratory (TRL) software program ‘Junctions 9’. They have been modelled as a 
linked network in view of their proximity to each other. This has required the use of 
the lane simulation tool, which only provides outputs for queuing and delay. The 
capacity assessment results for 2017 during the weekday AM and PM peak hours 
are summarised in Table 4.20. These are shown for the entry arms to the network 
(listed clockwise from the northern arm of the B4489) and exclude the internal links. 
The capacity assessment output reports are reproduced in Appendix 7.2.

4.8.14 Table 4.20 shows that, during the AM peak hour, the highest levels of queuing and 
delay are experienced on the M4 eastbound and westbound off-slips, followed by 
the A48 (Southwest) and B4489 (South). During the PM peak hour, levels of 
queuing and delay are significantly lower across the junction, with Pant Lasau 
Road and the A48 (Southeast) experiencing the highest levels of queuing and 
delay. 
4.8.15 On-site observations carried out by AECOM during the AM peak hour on Tuesday 
21st November 2017 suggests that the M4 Junction 46 is operating well within 
capacity. At the time of the observational visit, it was apparent that the queues 
reported by the modelling were not present at that time. This is particularly the case 
for the M4 off-slips, which appeared to be free flowing or with minimal queuing. The 
modelling is therefore considered to represent a ‘worst-case’ of existing conditions 
at the junctions. 
4.8.16 The analyses carried out as part of this section is based upon the previously 
observed traffic flows and queues and will therefore be a robust assessment of this 
part of the network. 
iii. Road Safety 
4.8.17 A review of PIC data has been undertaken to determine whether there are any 
locations on the local highway network with poor collision records. 
4.8.18 The data was obtained from CCS for the three-year period from 1st October 2014 to 
30th September 2017 (the most recent three-year period for which data was 
available). The reports for each of the PICs recorded on links 1 - 12 and 
corresponding junctions together with a plan showing the location of each PIC 
(these are not included in this Report for data protection reasons). 
4.8.19 A total of 25 PICs were recorded over the three-year period, of which three were 
‘serious’. The remaining 22 PICs were all ‘slight’. No ‘fatal’ PICs were recorded . 
For ease of analysis the PICs have been separated into those occurring at 
junctions and on links. The following account of the events which led to a PIC was 
taken from the records provided. 
PICs at Junctions 
4.8.20 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded at the M4 Junction 46 Northern Dumbbell 
Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle entering the roundabout 
and a vehicle already on the roundabout. 
4.8.21 Four ‘slight’ PICs were recorded at the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. 
These all involved a collision between a vehicle entering the mini-roundabout and a 
vehicle already on the roundabout. These types of collisions are not uncommon on 
mini-roundabouts, due to the limited separation between entry arms. Further 
analysis has been undertaken of the listed causation factors for the PICs (these 
cannot be explicitly stated here for data protection reasons); this has not identified 
any highway defects contributing to these PICs.

4.8.22 One ‘serious’ PIC was recorded at the M4 Junction 46 Southern Dumbbell 
Roundabout. This involved a vehicle on the M4 westbound off-slip losing control 
and colliding with a tree on the central roundabout island. 
PICs Recorded on Links 
4.8.23 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the B4489, south of its junction with Rhyd-y-
pandy Road. This involved a collision between two vehicles on a bend; one vehicle 
was travelling northbound, and the other vehicle was travelling southbound. 
4.8.24 Three ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound, between the off and on 
slips of the M4 Junction 46. Two of these PICs involved vehicles losing control, and 
the remaining PIC involved a rear-end shunt collision. 
4.8.25 Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound, east of the M4 Junction 46, 
both of which involved rear-end shunt collisions. 
4.8.26 Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 westbound, east of the M4 Junction 46. 
These involved a rear-end shunt collision, and a collision between two vehicles as 
one vehicle was changing lanes. 
4.8.27 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the M4 westbound off-slip. This involved a vehicle 
losing control and leaving the carriageway. 
4.8.28 Three ‘PICs’ were recorded on the M4 westbound, between the off and on slips of 
the M4 Junction 46. The ‘serious’ PIC involved a vehicle losing control after 
entering the drainage system. The ‘slight’ PICs involved a rear-end shunt collision, 
and a vehicle losing control and colliding with the central barrier. 
4.8.29 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the M4 eastbound, west of the M4 Junction 46. 
This involved a rear-end shunt collision. 
4.8.30 Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound off-slip. One of the PICs 
involved a vehicle losing control, colliding with the barrier and overturning. No 
description was provided for the remaining PIC. 
4.8.31 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48 between the M4 Junction 46 Southern 
Dumbbell Roundabout and the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. This 
involved a vehicle travelling southeast-bound entering the opposite side of the 
carriageway and colliding with an oncoming vehicle. 
4.8.32 One ‘serious’ PIC was recorded on Pant Lasau Road, northeast of the A48/Pant 
Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle and a 
pedestrian that had entered the carriageway. 
4.8.33 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48, southeast of the A48/Pant Lasau Road 
Mini-Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle performing a u-turn 
and another vehicle. 
4.8.34 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48, southwest of the M4 Junction 46. This 
involved a collision between a vehicle pulling off from the side of the carriageway 
and a vehicle travelling southwest-bound.

Summary 
4.8.35 Overall, the analysis of the PIC data and listed causation factors has not identified 
any existing highway safety issues in the local highway network. Where PICs have 
been recorded, these have been identified as being as a result of causation factors 
relating to driver/road user error and weather conditions. No causation factors 
relating to highway defects have been reported in the PIC data. 
iv. Walking and Cycling 
4.8.36 The walking and cycling facilities and PRoW are shown on Figure 4.19. 
4.8.37 There are no footways that serve the Electrical Connection Site. The nearest 
footways are on the B4489, approximately 475 m south of the existing Access 
Road (on the approach to the junction with the Felindre Park and Share. This 
footway continues to the M4 Junction 46. The 500 m section of the footway to the 
north of the M4 Junction 46 is separated from the carriageway edge by a barrier. At 
the M4 Junction 46 the footways continues south along the east side of the 
carriageway, serving the southern arms of the southern dumbbell roundabout, with 
dropped kerbs and tactile paving to facilitate crossing movements across entry 
arms. 
4.8.38 There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection Site. 
Part of the B4489 is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle 
map. This covers the section of the B4489 that routes north from the existing 
Access Road to Felindre and to a point approximately 475 m south of the Access 
Road.  
4.8.39 There are numerous PRoW crossing/in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection Site. 
Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the existing Access Road (and the new section 
of Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. 
Footpath LC35B passes close to the Electrical Connection Site Boundary to the 
north. 
v. Public Transport 
4.8.40 The nearest bus stop to the Electrical Connection Site is the ‘Pant Lasau Cross’ 
stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad Road. It is situated approximately 1.1 km to 
the southeast of the Electrical Connection Site and can be accessed via Footpath 
LC117. It provides access to Service 141 which routes between Gorseinon and 
Morriston. 
4.8.41 Service 142, passes to the north of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary, 
routeing between Morriston and Garnswllt. The nearest stop that provides access 
to this service is the ‘Lliw Reservoirs’ stop located on Rhyd-y-pandy Road. This is 
situated to the east of Felindre and approximately 1.4 km to the northwest of the 
Electrical Connection Site Boundary. There is no footway between the Electrical 
Connection Site and this bus stop. This service is operated by Community 
Transport for the Dulais, Afan, Neath, Swansea and Anman Valley areas. There are 
three to four services per day in each direction, although these can generally only 
be pre-booked.

4.8.42 There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection Site. 
Llansamlet railway station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the 
Electrical Connection Site Boundary, accessible by car via the A48 (from M4 
Junction 44 and 46). Swansea railway station is a further 7 km from the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary; this is a key local transport hub and is more easily 
accessible by public transport. Swansea railway station is managed by Arriva 
Trains Wales. There are four services daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly 
service from Swansea to Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and 
a total of two to three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great 
Western Railway also provides services from Swansea to London Paddington, 
calling at Bristol Parkway. 
4.8.43 Overall, the opportunities to access the Electrical Connection Site by public 
transport are limited, and it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this 
Report, no trips by construction, maintenance and permanent staff will be 
undertaken by these modes. 
vi. Parking 
4.8.44 Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m south 
of the existing Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre 
Business Park. It has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for 
employees of the DVLA Headquarters in Clase. A shuttle bus service runs between 
the Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. There are no other parking facilities in 
the local highway network. The Felindre Park and Share is understood to be 
managed by the DVLA and will not be available for use by the Project.

4.8.47 The maximum percentage change in the volume of traffic as a result of the 
Electrical Connection, as reported in Table 4.22 and Table 4.23 is +4%. This is for 
link 3, B4489, between the existing Access Road and the Felindre Park and Share; 
during weekday PM peak hour. This level of increased traffic flows on pedestrian 
experience is not significant.  
4.8.48 Table 4.24 shows the two-way HGV link flows during the weekday 24-hour period in 
2022 both without and with the Electrical Connection construction traffic, the 
difference between the two and the percentage change.

4.8.49 The level of increase in HGV traffic associated with the Electrical Connection on the 
pedestrian experience on these links is not significant. Minimal pedestrian 
movement has been observed at these locations, which is typical given the nature 
of the strategic access junction. It is also likely that any pedestrians at these 
locations will already be accustomed to the levels of general traffic and HGVs. 
4.8.50 No additional mitigation is proposed however traffic management will be covered 
within a CTMP and CSTP, T03 – T05 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1).

4.8.52 Table 4.25 shows that, during the AM peak hour, the entry arms of Pant Lasau 
Road, the B4489 (South) and A48 (Southwest) will experience a change in junction 
delay of up to 7%, which is not considered significant. The M4 eastbound and 
westbound off-slips will experience decreases in delay; this is as a result of 
changes in the balance of traffic flows at the junction, which will result in more gaps 
for traffic exiting from this arm as priorities are changed. The B4489 (North) and 
A48 (Southeast) will experience very little change, which is not significant.  
4.8.53 Table 4.26 shows that, during the PM peak hour, all entry arms will experience a 
little to no change in delay, with the exception of Pant Lasau Road and the A48 
(Southeast), which will experience an increase of up to 5 and 3% respectively, 
which is not considered significant. 
4.8.54 No additional mitigation is proposed, but management measures to minimise driver 
delay will be included within a CTMP and CSTP, T03 – T05 of the Mitigation 
Register (Appendix 2.1).  
ii. Operation 
4.8.55 The traffic generation of the Electrical Connection during the operational phase is 
expected to be negligible. 
4.9 
Geology and Ground Conditions 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.9.1 
The baseline geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology data of the Electrical 
Connection Site has been gathered from the following sources: 
 Landmark Information Group Envirocheck Report (October 2017) (Appendix 
8.1);             
 Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment from the Abergelli Power 
Project (Appendix 8.2);  
 BGS Digital Geological map of Great Britain at 1:50,000 scale (Ref.4.39); 
and  
 A site walkover undertaken in July 2014.                                                                           
i. 
Made Ground 
4.9.2 
There is no Made Ground indicated within the Electrical Connection Site, based on 
published BGS records. Made Ground is only considered to be likely to be present 
an areas associated with previous development such as the landfill and colliery. It 
may also be present if the landowner undertook land levelling. If any Made Ground 
is present within the Electrical Connection Site, its composition and provenance 
would be unknown.   
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
47 
 
ii. Superficial Geology 
4.9.3 
There are two types of superficial deposits identified across the Electrical 
Connection Site comprising: glacial diamicton till and glaciofluvial deposits of sand 
and gravel. The glaciofluvial deposits are located at the western end of the 
Electrical Connection while the rest of the length is till.  
4.9.4 
The BGS indicates that there are no boreholes located in Electrical Connection 
Site, however there are three immediately to the north, within the wider Project Site 
Boundary, one of which is available to view online and presented in Appendix 8.3.  
The borehole log is located east of Abergelli Farm in an area mapped as being 
underlain by Devensian glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel. 
4.9.5 
The borehole log indicates superficial deposits comprising yellow brown sandy 
gravelly clay down to 6.4 metres below ground level (mbgl), overlying grey brown 
clayey gravelly sand, clayey sand and sandy clay down to 15.8 mbgl considered to 
be representative of glaciofluvial deposits. These are underlain by firm yellow clay 
becoming stiff grey gravelly clay described in the log as possible boulder clay which 
is likely to be glacial till; proven to a maximum depth of 16.8 mbgl. Traces of coal 
were identified at 10.7 mbgl within the clayey sand. 
iii. Bedrock Geology 
4.9.6 
The bedrock geology underlying the Electrical Connection Site consists of the 
Grovesend Formation of the South Wales Upper Coal Measures Formation, 
comprising argillaceous mudstones and siltstones, with well-developed coals, and 
minor lithic sandstones. The BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units (Ref.4.40) 
indicates that the Grovesend Formation is the youngest unit found in the South 
Wales coalfield.  
4.9.7 
The north eastern corner of the 1 km search buffer surrounding the Electrical 
Connection Site is underlain by the Swansea Member, comprising green-grey 
Pennant Sandstone, with thin mudstone/siltstone and seatearth interbeds and 
(mainly thin) coals. This geological formation is overlain conformably by the 
Grovesend Formation. 
4.9.8 
The Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment (Appendix 8.2) indicates that 
there was a ‘Slant’ (inclined shaft or level) identified at Abergelli Colliery, which 
provided access to both the Graigola and Swansea Four Feet coal seams. 
iv. Soils and Agriculture 
4.9.9 
The soil and agriculture land classifications are discussed in the Preliminary Geo-
Environmental Risk Assessment (Appendix 8.2) and confirmed by NATMAP 
Soilscapes indicate the following (Ref.4.41):  
 There are two different soil classification areas across the Electrical Connection 
Site. The predominant soil classification is described as “freely draining, slightly 
acid loamy soils”. The soils are of “low fertility”, with “arable and grassland” land 
cover and precipitation “drains to local groundwater and rivers”. There is 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
48 
 
potential for groundwater contamination with these soils, comprising nitrate, 
siltation and nutrient enrichment of streams from soil erosion. 
 The northern most areas of the Electrical connection are within areas where the 
soil classification is described as “slowly permeable, wet, very acidic upland 
soils with a peaty surface”. The soils are described as “low fertility” and land 
cover is described as “moorland rough grazing and forestry”. The precipitation 
“drains to the stream network”. Overgrazing of this soil could lead to 
accelerated run-off and soil erosion. 
 From the LLe Geo-Portal Predictive ALC Map (Ref.4.42) the ALC for the 
land within the Electrical Connection Site is Grade 4  (“poor quality 
agricultural land”).”. 
 The Electrical Connection Site is known to be utilised as improved grazing for 
sheep and horses, with small areas of marshy grassland and woodland copses 
interspersing improved grassland. 
 
v. Ground Workings and Mineral Resources 
4.9.10 The Envirocheck Report (Appendix 8.1) does not indicate the presence of any 
historical ground workings on the Electrical Connection Site (being within the 
Project Site Boundary area investigated). Within the 1 km search buffer there are 
three records of historical ground working features. These have all ceased 
production and are listed in Table 4.27. These comprise two opencast mines 
producing sands and gravel and one underground mine producing coal. 
Immediately outside of the 1 km search area there are a further five opencast 
mines with ceased production of sandstone.

4.9.11 The Coal Authority Mining Report (Appendix 8.4) identified Abergelli Colliery 
located approximately 610 m from the closest point of the Electrical Connection 
Site Boundary, to the north of Abergelli Farm.  
4.9.12 The Coal Authority Mining Report (dated 30 July 2014) indicated that the Electrical 
Connection Site is in the “likely zone of influence from workings in three seams of 
coal, at shallow to a depth of 380 m”. Figure 4.20 presents the mine workings from 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
49 
 
the mine abandonment plan within the Project Site Boundary. This plan shows that 
the entire Project Site Boundary is influenced by mine workings. 
4.9.13 As illustrated within the Coal Authority Mining Report, there is one mine and one 
shaft entry located - close to the Electrical Connection Site. The mine entry is 
located in the vicinity of Abergelli Colliery (north of Abergelli Farm). The mine shaft 
is located south of the Substation at (NGR 264970, 200800) adjacent to the 
Electrical Connection Site Boundary. There is no record of any treatment to the 
mine/shaft entries. These mine/shaft entries are shown on Figure 4.21: Potential 
Sources of Contamination and Locations of Interest. A site visit undertaken on the 
12th March 2018 has confirmed that the shaft has been back filled and no open 
void was visible.  
vi. Ground Stability/Subsidence 
4.9.14 The Coal Authority Mining Report (Appendix 8.4) indicates that no notice of the risk 
of the land being affected by subsidence has been given under Section 46 of the 
Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991. 
4.9.15 Abergelli Farm has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of the Coal 
Authority under its emergency surface hazard call out procedures. No further 
information was provided, however two damage notices or claims for alleged 
subsidence damage were made in June 1995 and November 1996 both of which 
were rejected. 
4.9.16 Geological hazards within the full Project Site Boundary have been identified in the 
Landmark Envirocheck Report (Appendix 8.1); these are detailed in Table 4.28.

4.9.17 The high compressible ground hazard is assumed to be associated with an arear of 
peat located in the north east of the Generating Equipment Site and to the north 
west of Abergelli Farm outside of the Electrical Connection Site Boundary. This 
hazard therefore does not apply to the Electrical Connection.  
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM

vii. Hydrogeology 
4.9.18 The superficial glaciofluvial deposits and the bedrock geology are both classified as 
Secondary A Aquifers. Secondary A Aquifers are defined as ‘permeable layers 
capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in 
some cases forming an important source of base flow to rivers.’ 
4.9.19 The superficial glacial till deposits are classed as Unproductive Strata,  defined as 
‘rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible significance 
for water supply or river base flow’. 
4.9.20 The Landmark Envirocheck Report (Appendix 8.1) has identified no groundwater 
abstraction licences associated with the Electrical Connection Site or wider Project 
Site Boundary. There is only one licence located within 100 m of the Project Site 
Boundary, recorded 56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, licence 
number 22/59/4/0027 dated February 1993, for general farming and domestic use. 
There are a further seven licensed groundwater abstractions within 1 km  of the 
Project Site Boundary all for general farming and domestic use and a further 21 
within 2 km  of the Project Site Boundary. CCS has also identified a number of 
private water supplies located within the same search areas.  
4.9.21 The Electrical Connection Site does not lie within a groundwater Source Protection 
Zone (SPZ). 
4.9.22 The Landmark Envirocheck identifies the groundwater vulnerability classification of 
the soils beneath the Electrical Connection Site and surrounding area. These vary 
between Low (L) to High (H) Leaching Potentials (classifications of L, H1, H3, I1 
and U).  These classifications are described as follows: 
 L: Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to penetrate the soil layer because 
water movement is largely horizontal or they have large ability to attenuate 
diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils contributes to groundwater 
recharge elsewhere in the catchment. 
 H1: Soils which readily transmit liquid discharges because they are either 
shallow or susceptible to rapid by-pass flow directly to rock, gravel or 
groundwater. 
 H3: Coarse textured or moderately shallow soils which readily transmit non-
absorbed pollutants and liquid discharges but which have some ability to 
attenuate absorbed pollutants because of their large clay or organic matter 
contents. 
 I1: Soils which can possibly transmit a wide range of pollutants. 
 U: Soil information for restored mineral workings and urban areas is based 
on fewer observations than elsewhere. A worst case vulnerability 
classification (H) assumed, until proved otherwise. 
4.9.23 The Envirocheck Report indicates the presence of two discharge consents to 
groundwater near the Electrical Connection Site, however these have both been 
surrendered.  Both were held by the Felindre Gas Compressor Station, one for 
discharging sewage to an unnamed land drain, effective between 2007 and 2010; 
Electrical Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
51 
 
and one for trade discharges (site drainage) to the Afon Llan, effective from 2006 
until it was surrendered in 2011.   
4.9.24 There have been no Pollution Incidents to Controlled Waters recorded on the 
Electrical Connection Site by the Envirocheck Report. There have been three 
between 250 m and 500 m of the Project Site Boundary, which were classed as 
Category 3 minor incidents and a further eight incidents between 500 m and 1 km 
of the Project Site Boundary. These were classed between Category 1 major 
incident and Category 3 minor incidents.  
viii. Soil Chemistry 
4.9.25 The Envirocheck Report has identified the estimated background soil chemistry (for 
selected key elements) across the Electrical Connection Site. They are 
summarised as: 
 Arsenic: 25 – 35 mg/kg, 
 Cadmium: <1.8 – 3.0 mg/kg, 
 Chromium: 60 – 90 mg/kg 
 Nickel: 15 – 45 mg/kg; and 
 Lead: <100 mg/kg. 
 
ix. Landfill 
4.9.26 The Envirocheck Report indicates that there are no landfill sites located within the 
Electrical Connection Site.    
4.9.27 The closest landfill site to the Electrical Connection is one registered landfill and an 
adjacent historic “Landfill Extension” located at Abergelli Farm between 605 m and 
870 m north of the Electrical Connection Site.  The current status of the registered 
landfill is ‘closed’ and it was only able to accept non-biodegradable wastes. The 
total void space was calculated at 75,000 m3 with a total tonnage of 142,500 t. 
4.9.28 The Landfill Extension is reported to have accepted inert waste. The planning 
application for this extension was granted in 1997. NRW provided the Working Plan 
and associated drawings for the landfill which were dated March 1994. The total 
void space was calculated at 99,898 m3, with a total tonnage of 179,816 t. The 
Working Plan described the land as low lying, and poorly drained. Approximately 
three quarters of the landfill area was covered by a mine soil dump from Abergelli 
Colliery. This mine waste was removed leaving a layer of well compacted mine 
waste over the majority of the landfill area. The area of ground that was covered by 
the mine spoil was used for drying out of water treatment sludge (aluminium 
sulphate) though ceased when the landfill became operational. No further 
information on this operation is known. 
4.9.29 Swansea City Waste Disposal Company Ltd gained planning permission for 
‘excavation and removal of inert material from landfill site and restoration’ at 
Abergelli Farm in February 2003 (CCS Ref: 2002/0312). This consent was 
subsequently amended, extending the permission to allow the excavation and

removal of inert material until 31st December 2010 (2007/0907). The site has now 
been fully restored. 
4.9.30 There are also an additional three historical landfills within 400 m of the Electrical 
Connection Site. The first is located 285 m south of the closest point on the 
Electrical Connection Site Boundary at Gorswen Farm and accepted unspecified 
waste between 1971 and 1972.  The second landfill was licenced to British Steel 
and located 210 m south. It was active between 1980 and 1994 and received 
deposited waste included industrial and household waste. The third landfill is 
located 325 m south-east and was active been 1955 and 1970 receiving deposited 
waste included inert, industrial and special waste.   
x. Recorded Animal Burial Grounds 
4.9.31 Information obtained from CCS indicates there was no local cull of animals in 
Swansea, Neath Port Talbot or Carmarthenshire during the Foot and Mouth 
outbreak in 2001. No mass burial of animals have been recorded at the Electrical 
Connection Site. 
xi. Historical Land Use 
4.9.32 Historical maps have been provided in the Landmark Envirocheck Report,

xii. Potentially Contaminative Land Uses 
4.9.33 Table 4.30 lists land uses identified which have the potential to cause 
contamination on the Electrical Connection Site and within 250 m of the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary. Land uses further than 250 m from the Electrical 
Connection Site Boundary are not considered as they are unlikely to affect the 
Electrical Connection Site. The table also details contaminant groups potentially 
present as a result of these land uses.

xiii. Sources of Contamination 
4.9.34 It is considered that the most likely sources of contamination for the Electrical Site 
are: 
 Contamination associated with the off-site historic landfill and landfill extension 
including aluminium sulphate sludge; and 
 Contamination from agricultural land use. 
 
xiv. Preliminary Conceptual Site Model (CMS) 
4.9.35 On the basis of the information summarised above, a preliminary CSM has been 
developed for the Project Site Boundary, which includes the Electrical Connection 
Site. The CSM identifies potential contaminants, receptors (both on and off-site) 
and exposure pathways that may be present. The identification of such potential 
“pollutant linkages” is a key aspect of the evaluation of potentially contaminated 
land. Potential “pollutant linkages” associated with the Project Site Boundary are 
detailed within Table 4.31. 
4.9.36 It should be noted that the identification of potential “pollutant linkages” does not 
indicate that they are significant in any way or that the Electrical Connection Site is 
unsuitable for its current/proposed use. It does, however, act as a way of focusing

future data collection at the Electrical Connection Site and identifying any key 
potential risks associated with the Electrical Connection Site. 
4.9.37 The model is based on a desk study and a walkover undertaken in 2014 and will be 
confirmed through intrusive investigation prior to detailed design.

380 m. Ground investigation is required to assess 
the likelihood and level of risk. With current land 
use the risk is considered to be moderate to low 
as there has been minimal ground disturbance.

Potential Environmental Effects
i. 
Construction
Geology and Soils: Sand and Gravel Reserves
4.9.38 The Electrical Connection will be routed adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor
Station and the Substation, and adjacent to the new section of Access Road.
Therefore the land is already sterilised in this area. No significant impact is
anticipated from the construction of the Electrical Connection on sand and gravel
reserves. No additional mitigation is proposed.
Geology and Soils: Coal reserves
4.9.39 The UDP Proposals Map indicates that coal reserves are present underlying the
Electrical Connection (Ref.3.1 and included in Figure 4.22). The Electrical
Connection will be routed adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the
Substation, and adjacent to the Access Road, therefore the majority of the
Electrical Connection route is already sterilised and should ground investigation
works demonstrate that the coal reserves are at the working depth of the Electrical
Connection, only a relatively small area of the coal reserves will be affected
compared to the full extent. Therefore no significant impact is anticipated and no
additional mitigation is proposed.
Agricultural Land
4.9.40 The construction works associated with the Electrical Connection will result in the
direct, local and permanent sterilisation of approximately 0.33 hectares (ha) of
Grade 4 agricultural land of ‘poor quality’. No additional mitigation is proposed.
4.9.41 With the embedded mitigation as set out in G01 - G05 Mitigation Register
(Appendix 2.1) no significant effects during construction are anticipated.
ii. Operation
4.9.42 No significant effects are anticipated during the operation phase.

Notes:
1) The outline LEMP is for illustrative purposes only and identifies the principles of the landscape and ecological
mitigation. The final LEMP will be subject to the detailed design layout and will be completed as part of a planning
condition.
2) This figure should be read in conjunction with Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy, Outline Lighting
Strategy, and Flood Consequence Assessment - Outline Drainage Strategy.
3) All detailed planting design to reflect utility easements.
4) All existing trees and hedgerows within the Project Site Boundary will be retained where reasonably practical.
5) All construction laydown areas to be fully reinstated (save for maintenance compound).
6) All boundary features (fencelines, hedgerows etc) and fields to be reinstated along Pipeline corridor and to the
edge of the new access road corridor, subject to utility easements.
7) The location of existing landscape features, including hedgerows, woodland areas and solar farms shown on
this figure has been informed by a combination of aerial photography and site observation.
8) Final form of attenuation ponds to be developed in parallel with detailed design.
9) Refer to Appendix 3.10. Figure 1.1 for Otter and Water Vole Survey Area and Survey Results.
