Assessing the wood sourcing practices of
the U.S. industrial wood pellet industry
supplying European energy demand
Brian Kittler1*, Inge Stupak2 and C. Tattersall Smith3
Abstract
Background: As the demand for wood pellets has increased in EU member states, so has a multi-pronged
examination of the environmental effects of establishing a transatlantic trade in wood pellets between the U.S. and
Europe. However, the nature of industrial wood pellet supply chains is poorly understood or little known. This work
aimed to understand the feedstock sourcing strategies being used by the wood pellet industry in the southeast
U.S., commonly applied approaches to documenting sustainability of these feedstocks, and drivers operating
behind related developments.
Methods: This study used structured interviews of sustainability managers and procurement staff at pellet mills
comprising 75% of the U.S. industrial pellet sector. The industry was classified into types of supply chains, based on
the role of loggers, wood dealers, sawmills, and other wood product facilities in the supply chains. Additional
classifications examined feedstock types and origins, number and type of suppliers, contractual relationships with
suppliers, applied procurement systems, risk assessment and due-diligence methodologies, risk mitigation
procedures, and supply chain certifications.
Results: Three main types of supply chains were identified within the U.S. industrial pellet sector, differentiated
based on features of feedstock procurement, risk assessment procedures, and risk management. The study
observed a slight shift toward using a higher proportion of wood residuals as feedstock in some of the larger pellet
mills. Policy requirements, customer orders, and external pressures were driving the sector’s adoption of
sustainability programs, with risk assessments and wood procurement procedures aligned to policy requirements.
Conclusions: The strength of a risk-based approach to sustainability documentation depends on the quality of
source data on risks within a sourcing area, scale of analysis, and integration of risk assessments into procurement
practices. Some risk categories are more difficult to assess and control. Challenges increase with increasing number
and diversity of supply chain actors and depend on the nature of agreements between these entities for the
conveyance of feedstocks to pellet mills. Fiber procurement is similar to pulpwood-using industries, but extending
the risk assessment to residuals is complicated and challenging to the sector. The study identified a number of
strategies in use within pellet mill supply chains for dealing with these challenges.

Background
In 2017, half of all renewable energy consumed globally
was modern bioenergy1 and the share of energy coming
from biomass is projected to remain high into the future
[1]. Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) has found significant deployment of
negative net emission technologies, including bioenergy
carbon capture and storage (BECCS), will be necessary
to limit global warming to 2 °C by 2100 [2–4].
Whether or not such increases are realized, forest
bioenergy supply chains are expanding and trade in bio-
mass feedstocks is global. In the last decade, inter-
national trade in wood pellets has developed between
suppliers in the southeast U.S. and European energy
companies and is now the third largest wood product
export from the southeast U.S., behind softwood and
hardwood lumber, albeit still a minor share (3%) of the
total export volume of wood products [5, 6].
At the foundation of this transatlantic trade is a system
of policy targets, such as the European Union (EU) Re-
newable Energy Directive [7] and EU member state sub-
sidies that facilitate demand for renewables, including
biomass displacing coal in thermoelectric power stations
[8, 9]. In 2018, European Union demand for wood pellets
amounted to approximately 23 million metric tonnes, of
which the U.S. supplied 27% [10]. It is highly likely that
wood pellets imported from the southeast U.S. in the next
decade will comprise the largest source of biomass other
than those generated within the EU [8, 9, 11], even if
European demands are currently predicted to stagnate
[12]. In 2018, the most important buyers of U.S. wood pel-
lets among European Union member were the UK
(4.9 million tonnes), Denmark and Belgium (each 0.6 and
0.5 million tonnes), and Italy and the Netherlands (88 and
7 ktonnes, respectively), with the total EU member state
imports from the U.S. being 6.1 million tonnes [10]. How-
ever, Asian markets are emerging and predicted to ac-
count for the largest increase in global bioenergy demand
up to 2025 [8]. Canada is currently the main North
American exporter to these markets, namely Japan, but
the southeast U.S. producers have at least 1.5 million
tonnes under contract, with Japan also requiring docu-
mentation of sustainability [13]. Existing supply chains in
the industrial wood pellet sector of the southeast U.S. offer
a glimpse of what further global deployment may look like
if significant growth of wood bioenergy occurs.
As demand has increased, so has a multi-pronged exam-
ination of the environmental effects of establishing a
transatlantic trade in wood pellets [14]. Some environ-
mental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) argue that
European policies have led to unsustainable wood harvest-
ing outside the EU and question climate change mitigation
benefits, in part due to the life cycle accounting for green-
house gas emissions of biomass feedstocks [6, 15, 16].
Regulatory requirements from individual EU member states
and the United Kingdom (UK) and pressure from NGOs
on both sides of the Atlantic are influencing the complex-
ion of wood pellet plants’ supply chains and biomass sour-
cing strategies [17]. For instance, pressure from local NGOs
led to one company issuing a policy of avoiding biomass
from certain forest types [18]. The UK’s timber procure-
ment policies require that certain standards are met by UK
wood pellet-using industries in order to be eligible for Re-
newables Obligation Certificates [19], and Belgium [20, 21],
Denmark, and the Netherlands also each have their own
national requirements associated with obtainment of sub-
sidies [17, 22]. These two factors were drivers of the cre-
ation of the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP), which is a
certification system that uses a risk-based approach to con-
formance with European national requirements [22]. An-
other certification program, the Green Gold Label (GGL),
specialized particularly in conformance with the Dutch
requirements.
The U.S. industrial wood pellet sector is adopting
feedstock procurement systems and supply chains to
meet customer expectations, while also seeking contin-
ued adoption of national or state-level programs (e.g.,
Master Logger certifications and SFI Fiber Sourcing)
that are designed to help wood-using industries comply
with national and state-level policies in the U.S. Euro-
pean Union member states, such as UK and Denmark,
generally accept risk-based approaches to document
sustainability of bioenergy feedstocks [17]. Italy does
not have specific sustainability requirements for energy
feedstock, probably due to imports mainly being used
to supplement domestic production for residential uses
[9, 23, 24]. The Dutch requirements of the SDE+ re-
newable scheme, adopted in 2017, are more complex,
among other factors, due to an attempt to link all bio-
mass feedstocks back to specific stands with evidence
that a specific forest management unit providing bio-
mass feedstocks was sustainably managed and har-
vested [25, 26]. This is one reason that U.S. imports to
the Netherlands decreased from 22 ktonnes in 2016 to
6 ktonnes in 2018 [10]. Additionally, it is still uncertain
how new EU requirements will be implemented from
2021 onward [27]. Exporting pellet producers must
keep up with these developments as new sustainability
regulations are added in different countries and juris-
dictions, and all of these efforts have yet to create trust
among critical NGOs that these supply chains are en-
vironmentally sustainable.
Market trends and environmental effects of this growing
market have been analyzed at a regional level [14, 28–33],
1Modern bioenergy is the conversion of biomass to heat and electric
power using modern technologies vs. traditional bioenergy which
involves the open combustion of biomass for heating and cooking.

but such high level studies leave several questions as to
how effectively environmental safeguards can be imple-
mented. The challenges to adopting such practices are
also less documented. Such information is only available
directly from pellet mills, which represent the major sup-
ply of wood biomass from the U.S. that is being used for
modern bioenergy in Europe (principally the UK and the
Netherlands).
To date, a comprehensive assessment of the specific
wood sourcing and sustainability strategies used by the
U.S. industrial wood pellet sector at the level of individ-
ual supply chains has not been completed. This study
fills this gap and expands the body of knowledge and re-
search on forest bioenergy sustainability. Thus, the spe-
cific aims of this research were to better understand:
� Feedstock sourcing strategies of the wood pellet
industry in the southeast U.S.;
� Sustainability initiatives used for demonstrating
compliance with sustainability criteria;
� Drivers of companies’ engagement with
sustainability initiatives;
� Significant challenges to documentation of
compliance with sustainability criteria and areas of
potential improvement; and
� Challenges for the industry in communications
about sustainability issues with stakeholders.
This research follows on several examinations (e.g.,
[14, 22, 25, 28, 34–43]) of how the various sustainability
certifications used by the forest bioenergy industry com-
ply with European Union and member state sustainabil-
ity criteria in the stage of development or after adoption
[17, 23], augmenting this literature with an in-depth
examination of feedstock sourcing procedures in actual
supply chains. Our research is relevant to the current policy
discourse about the validity of a risk-based approach to sus-
tainability documentation in the bioenergy sector. We exam-
ine the contention of Sikkema et al. [34] that for the
southeast U.S. reliance on risk-based supply chain, certifica-
tions offer “insufficient coverage of sustainable sourcing
topics,” in light of recent policy decisions by the European
Commission that codify a risk-based approach to supply
chain sustainability as sufficient in meeting policy objectives
of the revised EU Renewable Energy Directive [27].
Based
on
data
gathered
through
interviews
with
personnel from industrial wood pellet companies, we
document which feedstocks and certification systems are
used and how aspects of these systems (i.e., principles,
criteria, indicators) relate to the feedstock procurement
protocols of the U.S. industrial pellet sector. This re-
search is relevant as an input to further the robustness
of the dialogue about the sufficiency of sustainability cri-
teria and the industry implementation of them.
Methods
Using a structured interview questionnaire (see supple-
mentary materials), 15 telephone interviews were con-
ducted in 2017 with sustainability managers and wood
procurement staff from six companies manufacturing in-
dustrial wood pellets in the southeast U.S. Interviews
spanned 17 pellet mills representing over 75% of the
wood pellet export capacity of the southeast U.S. as of
June 2017. A 100% response rate was achieved in our at-
tempt to survey a representative sample of the industry.
Respondents were selected for interview based on their
roles in:
a) Tracking and reporting feedstock sourcing,
b) Procuring feedstock from and maintaining
relationships with suppliers, and/or,
c) Communicating results of sourcing practices and
sustainability policies to customers and regulators.
The interview questionnaire included 28 main ques-
tions with several sub-questions (see supplementary ma-
terials). Questions were designed based on knowledge of
feedstock sourcing within the wood pellet industry, sus-
tainability programs (e.g., certifications for forest man-
agement and chain of custody), and the policies driving
bioenergy supply chains. The interview questionnaire
was designed to elicit responses related to several re-
search questions, including:
1) What drives the engagement of the pellet sector in
sustainability initiatives?
2) What supply chain sustainability governance
structures (e.g., certifications) are used by the U.S.
industrial pellet sector?
3) Are there common feedstock sourcing strategies
and supply chain structures that exist within the
pellet sector?
4) What challenges and opportunities face the
industry in participating in supply chain
certification and sustainable sourcing programs?
A schematic of supply chains and feedstock definitions
were used during interviews to elicit clear responses per-
taining to the identification of feedstocks used and supply
chain structures (see supplementary materials). Defined
feedstock types included primary fiber and both secondary
and tertiary residuals. Primary residuals are harvest resid-
uals, including tops, limbs, bark, foliage, and other non-
merchantable materials made available for collection during
roundwood timber harvests. Secondary residuals are mill
residuals and other by-products of wood product opera-
tions (sawmills, pulp and paper mills, wood manufacturers,
etc.) such as sawdust, wood shavings, and chips. Tertiary re-
siduals are post-consumer wood waste, e.g., construction

and demolition waste. Roundwood is also a feedstock for
industrial pellets; this category can generally be considered
non-sawtimber roundwood, or logs not used in sawmills,
generally including pulpwood size and assortments, other
small-diameter trees from thinning operations, low-priced
chip-n-saw-sized logs, and defect logs. Roundwood can be
produced at several points during a timber rotation and is
the most expensive wood energy feedstock.
Respondents were asked whether they have environ-
mental sustainability policies, and specifically, if they
apply systems by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI),
including forest management certification (SFI FM),
chain of custody certification (SFI COC), or fiber sour-
cing (SFI FS); the American Tree Farm System (ATFS);
Program on Endorsement of Forest Certification Con-
trolled Sourcing (PEFC CS); Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC), including forest management certification (FSC
FM), chain of custody certification (FSC COC), and
Controlled Wood (FSC CW); and the Sustainable Bio-
mass Program (SBP).
The SBP uses a risk-based approach to verification of
low risk that sourced materials are non-compliant with
their sustainable forest management standard, and it in-
cludes a module to collect information for demonstra-
tion of compliance with supply chain greenhouse gas
emission saving criteria, with certification taking place at
the pellet mill level. FSC CW also uses a risk-based ap-
proach to verify low risk that controversial sources are
being used and PEFC CS similarly uses a risk-based
sourcing protocol albeit not as specific to those criteria
identified in FSC CW (e.g., high conservation values, for-
est conversion, etc.). FSC CW, PEFC CS, and SBP are to
some extent overlapping in that all of these systems
focus on assessments of supply chain sourcing risks per-
taining to various criteria. This is also the case for the
EU Timber Regulation [40], which also prescribes a due
diligence system to showing low risk of illegal wood be-
ing placed on the EU markets, including products based
on primary or secondary wood fiber. All respondents
exporting to the EU will comply with the regulation, and
they
were
not
asked
about
this
in
the
interview
questionnaire.
We refer to systems that require certification or verifica-
tion of actors downstream in the supply chain as “supply
chain certifications,” i.e., from mill and downstream to the
energy plants, with no certification of forest management
units upstream from the mill. These include SFI COC, SFI
FS, FSC COC/CW, PEFC COC/CS, and SBP. These sys-
tems are required if mixing of material takes place with ma-
terial that has a forest management certificate, but the
material is also sometimes mixed with material that has no
forest management certificate. Additionally, respondents
were asked to explain any other sourcing or procurement
procedures
used
that
incorporate
environmental
sustainability, e.g., Corporate Social Responsibility programs
(CSR),
agreements
with
local
environmental
non-
governmental organizations about wood sourcing, and/or
public disclosure of souring data.
Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts
were coded, and coded data were organized in an MS
excel database for qualitative analysis of crosscutting
themes and patterns across the pellet mills interviewed.
Categories examined include biomass sourcing practices
(e.g., use of intermediary parties to aggregate supply),
feedstock supply chains (e.g., sourcing of primary and sec-
ondary fiber), and sustainability programs used (e.g., forest
management and supply chain certifications). The data-
base facilitated a comparison of responses from different
respondents within companies and across companies.
As another source of data against which the results of
the structured interviews were considered, site visits
were conducted at three pellet mills in the southeast
U.S. in 2018. Site visits consisted of non-structured in-
terviews (i.e., without inclusion of a standardized inter-
view guide) with pellet mill procurement foresters and
staff responsible for reporting on sourcing practices and
sustainability programs. Loggers and wood dealers sup-
plying these mills were also interviewed. Data gathered
from these site visits were used to confirm and expand
upon the information gathered in the telephone inter-
views conducted in 2017. Based on the initial data gath-
ered in the telephone interviews and in the site visits,
supply chains were classified into three types, each con-
sisting of pellet mills exhibiting similar supply chain
characteristics, in terms of used feedstock sources, pro-
curement systems, and certifications.
Results
We first address what drives participation in supply chain
certifications and other sustainability programs used by
the U.S. industrial pellet sector. Following this is an exam-
ination of sustainability programs used and how these
both influence and are influenced by feedstock sourcing
strategies and the structure of supply chains. Lastly, we re-
port on challenges and opportunities facing pellet mill
participation in sustainability sourcing programs.
What drives engagement of the pellet sector in
sustainability initiatives?
Respondents claimed that local, state, federal, and inter-
national policies all “govern” these supply chains, specific-
ally influencing how wood is grown and harvested, but
that customer requirements dictate supply chain certifica-
tions. Respondents suggested that international policies as
expressed in customer demands strongly influence both
pellet mill sourcing strategy and corporate structure. This
is particularly expressed in the use of risk assessments,
fiber
procurement
and
tracing
technologies,
risk

mitigation tactics, selection of wood dealers, and the
structure and responsibilities of procurement staff.
As cited by respondents, the policy drivers of the sus-
tainability governance in their supply chains include:
� State-level policies (e.g., water quality laws),
� Federal, i.e., Clean Water Act [44] and the
Endangered Species Act [45], and
� International (e.g., biomass procurement policy of
the UK [46] and the Dutch biomass sustainability
criteria under the Stimulation of Sustainable Energy
Production, SDE+) [26].
In addition to customer demands, external pressures
from NGOs influence the shape of the used sustainabil-
ity initiatives and wood procurement strategies. Some
respondents expressed that they are going above and be-
yond customer requirements by entering into agree-
ments with local environmental NGOs that identify
areas off limits to sourcing. Others have made strides to
improve the transparency of their sourcing, citing exter-
nal pressure. Another factor is how companies approach
the concept of sustainability and what they wish their
corporate culture to be. This includes how companies
are structured and staffed, i.e., how many personnel
hours are dedicated to sustainability programs, and also
how the companies choose to engage NGOs, e.g.,
whether they consider their concerns legitimate or not.
Which supply chain sustainability governance structures
are used by the U.S. industrial pellet sector?
Pellet mills reported adopting various forms of non-
governmental sustainability governance, in the form of
supply chain certifications (Table 1). The most widely
used certification programs among mills surveyed are
SBP, PEFC COC/CS, SFI COC, SFI FS, and FSC COC/
CW2. The study also identified the pellet industry using
six overall strategies in association with their supply
chain
certifications
and
wood
sourcing
procedures,
intended for risk assessment and risk management in
their supply chains. These strategies often occurred in
combination with each other.
1) “Auditing” (by pellet mill staff) of 100% of
secondary feedstock suppliers.
2) “Auditing” a portion (e.g., 10–20%) of secondary
suppliers’ supply chains (paper trail audits and/or
field audits).
3) Contractually requiring all suppliers to use the FSC
CW and PEFC CS standards with chain of custody
certifications or that they adhere to the main
elements of these standards.
4) Extending spatial risk assessments3 to encompass
the sourcing area of secondary residual suppliers.
5) Offering to certify the forest management plans of
landowners supplying sawmills providing mill
residuals to a pellet mill (i.e., group certification
managed by the pellet mill). Group certification is
used in both FSC and ATFS.
6) Adopting technology that integrates spatial risk
assessments and primary fiber sourcing and
material tracking procedures.
Accompanying the adoption of these strategies are
written environmental sustainability policies related to
sourcing practices. All but three pellet mills in this study
reported having such documents. Stated reasons for hav-
ing written sourcing policies included that it is an aspect
of workforce training; it helps establish a corporate cul-
ture; it communicates corporate values to suppliers,
stakeholders, and customers; and it helps demonstrate
and ensure regulatory compliance.
Respondents expressed that their adoption of supply
chain certifications and sourcing procedures is largely in
response to the policy drivers linked to the market. Ex-
ternal policies, particularly the policies of countries sour-
cing wood pellets from the southeast U.S., often make
explicit reference to other non-regulatory tools for forest
management unit level certification, chain of custody
with controlled sources/controlled wood certification, or
certification with low risk of non-compliance with forest
management standards at the wood pellet producer
level. As depicted in Table 1, adoption of many of these
systems is common, particularly supply chain certifica-
tions like the SBP.
At present, however, for the majority of the industrial
wood pellet sector of the southeast U.S., the volume of
fiber that can be traced back to a forest certified to a for-
est management certification standard is low, except for
mills that are closely linked with another forest products
facility, i.e., a single local sawmill and industrial owner-
ship certified to the SFI forest management standard.
All of the larger pellet mills (+ 300,000 metric tonnes
year−1 production capacity) using mostly primary fiber
as feedstock reported having asked landowners to certify
their forest. This is usually done indirectly through their
suppliers and/or partner organizations, such as the
ATFS, a program geared for engaging non-industrial pri-
vate
forest
owners
to
obtain
forest
management
2Detailed descriptions of certification systems and how they address
risks are available in Olesen et al. [14].
3Within the context of forestry, a spatial risk assessment is a mapping
analysis that identifies certain risk categories, e.g., risk of damaging an
area rich in biodiversity, within a landscape pertaining to wood
sourcing.
Kittler et al. Energy, Sustainability and Society           (2020) 10:23

certification. Two of these companies reported begin-
ning to work with secondary residual supplying sawmills
and landowners within their supply chains by offering
ATFS group certification services to landowners within
the supply base of the sawmills. The pellet mill and saw-
mill are then able to claim fiber sourced from these
lands as certified content. However, smaller pellet mills
more reliant on a higher proportion of secondary resid-
uals in their feedstock mix have not adopted such an
approach.
A common strategy for dealing with secondary re-
sidual feedstock among the pellet mills using a high pro-
portion
in
their
feedstock
mix
is
to
expand
the
geographic extent of their supply chain certification risk
assessment to be inclusive of the sourcing areas of their
secondary residual suppliers. This is often paired to a
sourcing protocol that limits secondary residual sup-
pliers to only those who themselves participate in many
of the same supply chain certifications, principally PEFC
CS and/or FSC CW.
Are there common feedstock sourcing strategies and
supply chain structures that exist within the pellet sector?
Pellet mills sampled ranged from just over 85,000–750,
000 metric tonnes annual production capacity, with an
average size of 379,500 metric tonnes. Actual annual
production may be more or less than the nameplate cap-
acity for a given pellet mill, i.e., the expected annual

volume of production at full operation based on facility
design. Table 2 includes a range of production capacity
estimates provided by plant managers. Data from inter-
views with pellet plant managers coupled with a review
of certification reports in the SBP database indicates that
in 2017, actual production at two of the three largest
pellet mills was at the lower end of the range of annual
capacity provided by plant managers, whereas 2017 pro-
duction at the last one of the three largest pellet mills
was at the upper end of its nameplate capacity. In 2019,
actual production at one of these three mills had
exceeded its nameplate capacity.
Collectively, the 17 mills surveyed are capable of
exporting over 6 million metric tonnes of wood pellets
annually. Variation existed in terms of the feedstocks
used, strategies for procuring these feedstocks, and the
structures of their supply chains (Table 2). For example,
one pellet mill procured 100% of its fiber from a single
certified industrial forest4 landowner as non-sawtimber
roundwood and what they termed harvest residuals (e.g.,
the fraction of a pine tree top that would not normally
be utilized by other pulpwood size-using industries). An-
other pellet mill sourced a large portion of its feedstock
as mill residuals from a company-owned sawmill inte-
grated with an industrial forest ownership, which also
supplied non-sawtimber roundwood to the pellet mill. In
yet another example, an exporter served as an aggrega-
tor, sourcing from many smaller pellet mills to equal
quantities of the larger exporting pellet mills. The supply
network for this exporter thus involved secondary resid-
uals from over 70 wood product facilities located across
six states that were sold as feedstock to the smaller pellet
mills within its supply network.
As forests in the southeast U.S. are predominantly in
private ownership [47], pellet mills included in this study
source mainly from private industrial and non-industrial
forests (typically family owned), with plantation and nat-
urally regenerated loblolly and slash pine predominating,
but with deciduous (hardwood) tree species being a sig-
nificant feedstock for some mills. Most of the pellet mills
studied did not maintain long-term supply contracts
with landowners. In a few instances, pellet mills used
supply contracts with industrial forest owners during the
first few years of start-up.
Interviewees for a few pellet mills described a shift in
their feedstock sourcing over time to sourcing more pri-
mary fiber from non-industrial forests, and a higher per-
centage of secondary fiber (wood processing residuals).
Respondents described this as a maturation of their
supply chain and sourcing practices. Respondents gener-
ally described a process of “ramping up” production, be-
ginning by producing smaller volumes of pellets and
growing their throughput over the course of 12–24
months. The process necessitated expanding sourcing
strategies from a few suppliers to a larger number of
non-industrial landowners for primary fiber and a larger
number of secondary residual suppliers.
Primary fiber (roundwood and harvest residuals) was
typically procured from thinnings and final harvests up
to 80–120 km (50–75 miles) from a pellet mill. Second-
ary fiber (sawmill residuals and residuals from wood
product facilities using sawn wood) is sourced from
within this same supply base area, but also often from
much greater distances. Primary fiber, principally pulp-
wood size roundwood as tree-length logs, in-woods
chips, and harvest residuals (treetops and limbs), com-
prised the largest portion of industrial pellet feedstock
supply in the southeast U.S. The highest share of this
feedstock type was found in the larger (capacity of +
300,000 tonnes year−1) pellet mills. Many of the larger
pellet mills mixed primary fiber with secondary fiber
(mainly sawmill residuals) in proportions of approxi-
mately 70–100% primary to 0–30% secondary, an obser-
vation confirmed by others [28, 48]. Based on data
gathered in 2017, an approximate percentage ratio of 80:
20 primary to secondary fiber was identified as standard
practice for much of the total capacity of the U.S. indus-
trial pellet sector.
Yet, follow-up site visits completed a year after initial
telephone interviews found that three larger pellet mills
(capacity of + 350,000 tonnes year−1) were in the process
of shifting their procurement models to feature signifi-
cantly more secondary residuals. Respondents reported
doing so principally for economic reasons, due to the
presence of mill residuals at a lower cost. A consequence
of this was that the wood supply base for these three
mills had also changed, expanding to include sawmills
and other wood product facilities in more distant geog-
raphies than prior. Some respondents noted that a shift
to secondary fiber was accompanied by revising their
risk assessments, as the geographic breadth of the
supply-base grew substantially.
Several pellet mills sourced a considerable amount of
their feedstock from independent wood dealers, ranging
from only a few to as many as 80. In some instances,
wood dealers operated on volume-based contracts with
pellet mills. Wood dealers were often foresters and/or
loggers who had operated within the southeast forest in-
dustry for several years; most often, these individuals
were locally networked with landowners and regional
forest product facilities. As main suppliers to several of
the pellet mills, wood dealers maintained relationships
(contractual
or
otherwise)
with
regional
sawmills,
4In the southeast U.S. industrial forest ownerships are characterized by
their large size, corporate ownership structure, e.g., real estate
investment trusts or timber investment management organizations,
intensive plantation forestry practices, and objectives which tend to
favor wood production and profit maximization.

directing wood product residuals to pellet mills and
other customers. This meant that some pellet mill sup-
ply chains feature a large number of other wood product
facilities, principally sawmills, with whom their primary
relationship existed through a second party.
For example, one of the larger pellet mills surveyed
sourced secondary residuals from over 30 sawmills, in-
woods chips from three wood dealers, tree-length pulp-
wood size roundwood under contract with three indus-
trial landowners, and secondary residuals from 45 wood
dealers who themselves had sourced from an estimated
400 landowners. While this pellet mill maintains con-
tracts for tree-length pulpwood size roundwood from
large industrial forest owners, they did not maintain
contracts with wood dealers.
Another pellet mill, relying largely on primary fiber
from their own lands, had chosen not to use wood
dealers reportedly because of the difficulty in establish-
ing a chain of custody back to feedstock origin, i.e., the
forest. Another company suggested that contracts with
wood dealers and sawmills were sufficient to address
risks that may be in these second party suppliers’ supply
chains, even if clear chain of custody back to the parcel
cannot be established.
Analysis of supply chain feedstock sourcing, supply
chains, and sustainability governance formed the basis
for a classification of surveyed pellet mills into three
different supply chain types (Table 3 and Fig. S2 in
supplementary material).
Most supply chains of pellet mills included in this
study are type 1, being mills of + 300,000 metric tonnes
year−1 production capacity and sourcing approximately
70–80% primary fiber as tree length pulpwood size
roundwood or in-woods chips (predominantly southern
yellow pine) procured from within 50–75 miles of the
pellet mill. The remaining 20–30% of feedstock being
predominantly secondary fiber, mostly sawmill residuals,
procured from a larger geography. Type 1 supply chains
generally involve relationships with several wood dealers
(10–80 individual wood dealers) and sawmills, mirroring
supply chains of other pulpwood size roundwood using
facilities in the region, such as panel products and pulp
and paper mills. These relationships are key links in the
supply chain that enable wood dealers to fluidly direct
wood to market outlets, responding to price signals and
the specifications of wood utilization facilities.
While wood dealers typically had some type of agree-
ment with pellet mills, these suppliers may or may not
have contracts with individual landowners and/or saw-
mills from where they procure feedstock. Often, this de-
pends on whether or not the wood dealer purchases the
wood outright or merely conveyed the wood to a pellet
mill on behalf of a landowner or sawmill. Other pellet
mills report not maintaining formal contracts with wood
dealers despite other pellet mills citing such contracts as
important evidence underpinning their risk rating under
their SBP certification. Primary fiber, including harvest
residuals,

landowner via a logger without a wood dealer being in-
volved. Among the 10 pellet mills classified as type 1
supply chains, secondary fiber was identified as being
procured from as few as 15 to as many as 45 sawmills
and other wood product facilities, with most of these
pellet mills sourcing from more than 30 sawmills.
Some type 1 pellet mills maintained volume-based
contracts with the wood dealers supplying them. These
contracts may specify some procurement guidelines re-
lated
to
sustainability,
such
as
targets
for
forest
management-certified fiber, but often, pellet mill wood
procurement staff work out such specifications with
their suppliers on an ongoing basis. For instance, one
company reported using a quota system with their sup-
pliers, whereby a maximum of non-certified fiber could
be sold to the pellet mill in any given month. Note that
both FSC and PEFC require certain procedures for mix-
ing fiber sourced from a certified forest with fiber
sourced from a non-certified forest5.
A second category of industrial pellet mills, type 2, in-
cluded those mills that were closely linked with another
forest products facility, i.e., a single local sawmill. This
type of supply chain is more common for smaller pellet
mills. Among type 2 mills surveyed is a nearly vertically
integrated company, now a rarity in the U.S. forest prod-
ucts sector, with a pellet mill integrated with a sawmill
owned by the same company that also owns certified
forestland supplying both mills. Two pellet mills sur-
veyed featured this type of supply chain. A third pellet
mill, categorized as type 1, likely could be considered a
type 2 supply chain after the construction of a sawmill
adjacent to the pellet mill by a separate company is com-
pleted. The pellet mills classified as supply chain type 2
featured very significant use of feedstock from forest
management-certified forests.
Pellet mills featuring supply chain type 3 are typically
smaller
(e.g.,
50,000–200,000
metric
tonnes
year−1
production capacity) than type 1 and 2. Some of these
mills were in operation prior to the industrial wood pel-
let export market existing and reflect the supply chains
of most pellet mills in the U.S. that service the residen-
tial wood heat market. Type 3 supply chains analyzed
for this study aggregated wood pellets at a central loca-
tion prior to shipment to a port.
What challenges and opportunities face the industry
participating in supply chain certification and
sustainability sourcing programs?
The greatest challenge for pellet mills is to increase sec-
ondary residual feedstock suppliers’ acceptance of, and
active participation in, sustainability programs. Strategies
for dealing with this vary but include:
� Extending spatial risk assessments to encompass the
sourcing area of secondary residual suppliers,
typically expanding the spatial risk assessment well
beyond the region where primary fiber is sourced,
� Auditing secondary residual suppliers,
� Contractually requiring all suppliers be FSC CW
and PEFC CS certified or that suppliers will abide by
these standards, and
� Offering to certify the forest management plans of
landowners supplying the sawmills (i.e., group
certification).
All companies surveyed reported relying on data from
secondary and tertiary residual suppliers coupled with
an extension of geospatial risk assessments to encompass
the supply base of each secondary residual supplier. Risk
assessments (for all fiber types) were typically completed
to the standards of PEFC CS and FSC CW. These assess-
ments routinely use geospatial datasets developed by a
third party for identification of ecological attributes (e.g.,
known occurrences of rare plants, animals, and eco-
logical communities) posing environmental risks within
the potentially available supply area for primary fiber.

Private consultants completed these spatial risk assess-
ments at the regional or state level (i.e., an area larger
than a facility’s supply area) to be inclusive of all regions
from which the pellet mill might source primary and
secondary fiber. Sources of data used in risk assessments
generally include NatureServe [49], state Natural Heri-
tage datasets [50], FSC’s US national risk assessment6
[51], vegetation cover types, and other spatial datasets.
Many (but not all) of the hundreds of sawmills within
southeast U.S. industrial pellet mill supply networks par-
ticipate in supply chain certifications themselves. Re-
spondents reported seeking out such suppliers. The
smaller type 3 pellet mills reported that all of their sup-
pliers of secondary and tertiary feedstock carry PEFC CS
and FSC CW certificates, which helps confirm district of
origin and that risks have been identified and avoided
and/or controlled (i.e., mitigated risk and/or feedstocks
avoided). Yet, procurement staff from some of the very
large type 1 pellet mills reported encountering resistance
when asking their secondary residual suppliers to pro-
vide feedstock origin data and/or upon urging them to
adopt supply chain certification (PEFC CS and FSC CW)
if they had not already done so.
Respondents reported visiting a statistically representa-
tive sample of secondary and tertiary feedstock suppliers
each year (Table 3). This can be a time-consuming activ-
ity given the complexity of supply chains, for example, a
200,000-metric tonnes year−1 production capacity pellet
mill sources from around 60 sawmills and 10 other sec-
ondary manufacturing facilities from across a six-state
region with supplier contracts requiring BMP compli-
ance and auditing, as well as the use of FSC CW and
COC, and PEFC CS and COC.
This involves interviewing suppliers, reviewing sup-
plier data files, and in some instances inspecting a seg-
ment of harvests to verify BMPs were used and that
controversial sources avoided (as required by PEFC CS
and FSC CW). This task is reported to occupy a pellet
mill’s procurement forester up to 4 weeks per year, in an
instance where 100% of secondary residual suppliers are
visited. Across all supply chain types, pellet mills typic-
ally invested 1–4 full-time employees to manage due
diligence in procurement, including the various sourcing
certifications and procedures used.
In addition to first party audits of suppliers, companies
reported adapting or developing a series of data manage-
ment systems to comply with supply chain certifications’
due
diligence
requirements.
These
databases
are
integrated within the broader sourcing programs of pel-
let mills. Some respondents reported using global posi-
tioning systems (GPS) with timber load ticketing to geo-
reference the coordinates of fiber origin and monitor the
flow of fiber at the facility gate. This mechanism is used
to establish and maintain chain of custody (COC) back
to harvest units from which primary fiber is obtained.
Thus, the due diligence system encompasses the initial
risk assessment which is subsequently linked to sourcing
protocols intended to reduce sourcing from undesirable
areas.
Additionally, one company explained that their policy
is to only accept a truckload if the load ticket is present
at time of delivery and if the origin is known. At least
three companies (all type 1 and 2 supply chains) use this
approach in conjunction with geographic information
system (GIS) mapped risk assessments, identifying areas
of potential risk and procurement due diligence proce-
dures7, in an attempt to verify the avoidance of areas of
high conservation value. For instance, when a wood
dealer approaches the procurement forester about a new
harvest, the location of the harvest is cross-referenced to
the pellet mills GIS-based risk analysis. Depending on
the results, a procurement forester may visit the location
of the proposed harvest if a risk is detected. These same
spatial datasets and supply data management systems
are used in monitoring of compliance with water quality
best management practices (BMPs). For facilities using
PEFC CS and FSC CW, it was common for procurement
and/or sustainability personnel to inspect a percentage
of harvests annually to ensure that water quality BMPs
are used, and, in the case of FSC, that conversion to
other land uses has not occurred.
Several of the pellet mills of supply chain type 1 used
both procurement foresters and sustainability managers,
whose jobs are supported by, and revolve around, such
risk assessment and data management systems. Procure-
ment foresters were mainly responsible for working dir-
ectly and regularly with suppliers for acquisition of
feedstock. Sustainability staff monitors this process,
complete risk assessments, coordinate first party and
third party audits, and gather and evaluate sourcing data
for compliance with certification programs. The rela-
tionship
between
procurement
and
sustainability
personnel is described as having a beneficial tension to
improve sourcing practices.
Discussion
This work aimed to document feedstock-sourcing strat-
egies of the wood pellet industry in the southeast U.S. as
6Note that at the time of this study, the FSC Controlled Wood
National Risk Assessment was still in draft form. Pellet mills wishing
to use the FSC Controlled Wood Standard will need to integrate FSC’s
final Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment into their sourcing
and SBP certifications by October 05, 2019. This is likely to be a
substantial data source for SBP risk assessments going forward.
7Due diligence procedures refer to an analysis of wood sourcing
practices and their ability to avoid and/or manage risks identified in a
risk assessment.

these supply chains are poorly understood. Our research
identified commonly applied approaches to documenting
conformance to sustainability requirements and chal-
lenges to assessing risks within supply chains.
Sikkema et al. [34] concluded that for the southeast
U.S., reliance on risk-based supply chain certifications
(e.g., PEFC CS/COC and FSC CW/COC) offers “insuffi-
cient coverage of sustainable sourcing topics.” However,
risk-based approaches are accepted by larger wood pellet
importing countries in the EU, such as the UK and
Denmark [17], and recent policy decisions by the European
Commission have also determined such systems to be suffi-
cient in meeting policy objectives of the revised Renewable
Energy Directive [27] and, earlier, the EU Timber Regula-
tion [52]. This research has detected variation in the struc-
ture of supply chains and the risk assessment and
mitigation techniques employed by the U.S. industrial wood
pellet sector. In some instances, practices to control risks
are more extensive than for other segments of the southeast
U.S. wood products industry.
Still, based on the structure of their supply chains and
their wood sourcing strategies, some pellet mills face
challenges to effectively implementing a risk-based ap-
proach. Due to the complexities inherent in sourcing
secondary fiber, the pellet sector is challenged by the
need for a relatively high degree of due diligence on
sourcing a low-value product. Significant time is re-
quired to ensure data quality and educate wood dealers
and suppliers about the importance of using risk-based
systems in landscapes harboring significant biodiversity
values and associated risks from forestry activities.
Recognizing that risks are manifested differently in the
various supply chain structures, it follows that another
important factor influencing the strength of the risk as-
sessment is the type of risk being considered. Some risk
categories are more difficult to assess and mitigate than
others. For instance, one company using FSC Controlled
Wood and its prohibitions on sourcing “conversion
wood” acknowledged that upon inspecting for conver-
sion, they did identify that the wood they had sourced
came from a forest that had been converted to non-
forest land use. A risk assessment consultant interviewed
also indicated knowledge of this happening in other in-
stances and that this risk category is particularly challen-
ging to assess and mitigate in the southeast U.S. given
market effects, urban development (the largest driver of
land-use conversion), cultural influences, and regional
land use regulatory context.
At the industrial scale, wood sourcing for pellet mills
in the southeast U.S. has generally revolved largely
around non-sawtimber roundwood. This study confirms
the findings of others [14, 28, 53–58], that primary fiber,
principally pulpwood-sized roundwood as tree-length
logs, in-woods chips, and harvest residuals (treetops and
limbs), comprises the largest portion of industrial wood
pellet feedstock supply in the southeast U.S. This cat-
egory is more accurately described as fuelwood due to
its end use, rather than pulpwood as colloquially used
within the southeast forestry sector. The forest economy
in the Coastal Plain, the region where most of these pel-
let mills are located, revolves around markets for pine
pulpwood-sized roundwood and pine sawtimber.
Forest management, logging systems, and procurement
networks are well established for pulpwood-sized round-
wood and have been extended to industrial-scale wood
pellets for the export market. While not a rule, we found
that the 80:20 ratio between pulpwood-sized roundwood
and secondary residuals is fairly common across the in-
dustrial pellet sector. This is particularly evident in type
1 and 2 supply chains which comprise most of the
southeast U.S. industrial wood pellet capacity.
Procurement systems from the pulp and paper indus-
try have been adapted to wood pellets, and for primary
fiber, this generally includes an ability to trace material
back to its origin using systems developed by other seg-
ments of the wood products industry, and wide use of
FSC CW/COC, PEFC CS/COC, and SFI FM with SFI
COC. Similar to pellet procurement supply chains, pri-
mary
fiber
procurement
for
other
pulpwood
size
roundwood-using industries is generally limited to actors
(landowners, wood dealers) within the immediate 50–
75-mile haul distance. The sourcing distance may ex-
pand considerably for secondary residuals.
As the industry has grown, feedstock sourcing in the
southeast U.S. and the U.S. generally appears to prefer mill
residuals (see supplementary materials, Fig. S1), for feed-
stock quality and economic purposes. Wood residuals
have become less expensive for a variety of reasons, such
as tightening non-sawtimber pulpwood markets in some
locations, and more residues being available due to a re-
covery of the U.S. housing market and high sawtimber
prices. While wood product residuals offer improvements
in the greenhouse gas lifecycle performance of forest bioe-
nergy [32, 53], these supply chains are more complex, in-
volving more actors across a wider geography, and thus
potentially more risk exposure with regards to areas of
high conservation value and forest type conversion. This
study provides important insights into how the industry is
assessing and managing risk (Table 3). It should also be
noted that demand for sawmill residuals by pellet mills is
in itself not the driver of forest harvesting decisions.
Forest management certification plays a relatively
small role and only in type 1 and 2 pellet mills, with ef-
forts to increase certification only having had marginal
success. Seven type 1 pellet mills are attempting to help
smaller landowners get certified through independently
managed group certifications via ATFS and FSC. One
company uses a quota system to encourage additional
Kittler et al. Energy, Sustainability and Society           (2020) 10:23 
Page 13 of 17
suppliers to certify their forestland or the lands from
which they source. This approach has reportedly in-
creased the amount of acres certified. It was deemed by
respondents to be impractical for the smaller pellet mills
of type 3 with supply chains built around mill residuals
to push forest management certification as these pellet
mills do not maintain a direct connection to the land.
In general, low-value wood feedstock-dependent in-
dustries in the southeast U.S. usually maintain 10–20%
of their supply under long-term contracts with wood
dealers or large landowners [53]. This is also the case for
industrial wood pellets. Few pellet mills have long-term
contracts with residual suppliers and instead look to
source from sawmills that have completed analysis of
feedstock origin via PEFC and/or FSC, while others do
not. This study revealed several examples of pellet mill
procurement staff and sustainability personnel citing in-
stances where contracts with suppliers (wood dealers
and residual suppliers) allow them to insert language on
sustainability requirements which include provisions to
allow auditing of secondary residual suppliers. Some pel-
let mills reported auditing the district of origin for their
secondary residual suppliers according to the policies of
PEFC and FSC. This process can be quite complex or
relatively simple.
Conclusion
International policies and voluntary certification pro-
grams are supporting the use of spatial risk assessment
and risk management tools, such as supply chain audits,
as the preeminent means of addressing the sustainability
of feedstocks in the industrial wood pellet sector of the
southeast U.S. This study revealed that there is consider-
able variation in the supply chains and feedstock pro-
curement strategies within this industry. As such, the
adoption of risk assessment and risk management has
taken numerous forms.
Assessing the sourcing practices of more than 75% of the
industrial wood pellet production capacity of the southeast
U.S., we identified three types of supply chains operating
within the wood pellet industry. Each type has nuanced dif-
ferences in feedstocks used and how they are procured, risk
assessment features, and risk mitigation procedures.
While the structure of supply chains themselves may
alleviate or elevate risks associated based on the nature
of supply linkages in the chain, we found the strength of
risk assessments as a mechanism for controlling supply
chain
risks
across
all
supply
chain
classifications
depended on the following:
1) The quality of sourcing data (do they adequately
represent the known and unknown risks?),
2) Appropriateness of the scale and scope of analysis
when sourcing areas change (when do new
suppliers’ risk-based assessment and procurement
processes adequately adjust?), and
3) The successful integration of risk assessments and
especially mitigation measures into procurement
practices.
Another important factor influencing the strength of
the risk assessment is the type of risk being considered,
such as risk of non-compliance with regulations, risks of
sourcing from areas of high biodiversity, or risk of sour-
cing “conversion wood” from parcels undergoing direct
land-use change. Some of these risk categories are more
difficult to assess and mitigate than others.
The strength of the risk-based approach is also af-
fected by the scope of risk assessment and management,
which in turn depends largely on the type of supply
chain. For example, assessing the risk of a supply chain
built around a small number of landowners practicing
plantation management is relatively straight forward,
while risk assessments of supply chains with large num-
bers of secondary residual suppliers are more complex.
The number and diversity of supply chain actors (wood
dealers, sawmills, landowners) and the nature of agree-
ments (ranging from handshake deals to legally enforce-
able contracts) between these actors and pellet mills are
all important factors in determining the riskiness of a
supply chain. Existing certification systems attempt, in
part, to address this through chain of custody certifica-
tions, but challenges remain.
Comprising the majority of the export pellet capacity of
the southeast U.S., pellet mills of supply chain type 1 are
typically very large and source mainly tree-length pulpwood
size roundwood and mill residuals. Among the 10 pellet
mills in this study classified as type 1, most sourced sawmill
residuals from over 30 different sawmills and a majority of
primary feedstock came from private non-industrial forests
not certified to a forest management certification standard.
Type 1 mills rely heavily on intermediary wood dealers for
supplying the large volumes of primary and secondary fiber
sourced by these very large facilities. In these instances, the
primary relationship with landowners and residual suppliers
may be several steps removed from feedstock procurement
staff working at the pellet mill. Reliance on wood dealers,
while widespread, is also recognized as presenting chal-
lenges. In fact, respondents from all pellet mills identified
their greatest challenge with regard to sourcing as being
documenting chain of custody and/or risks from secondary
residual suppliers. Respondents suggested that it is time-
consuming and technically complex, if not impossible, to
trace feedstock origin back to the forest.
The few pellet mills in this study classified as type 2
rely significantly less on wood dealers than type 1 mills
because a majority of feedstock is sourced from a dir-
ectly linked sawmill. Type 2 pellet mills had a higher use
Kittler et al. Energy, Sustainability and Society           (2020) 10:23 
Page 14 of 17
of feedstock certified to a forest management certifica-
tion standard originating from a certified forest. Certified
generally because of the influence of other forest prod-
uct markets, these lands also provide pellet mills with
tree-length non-sawtimber roundwood. Type 2 pellet
mills in this study used wood dealers sparingly because
it was not necessary to meet supply needs and because
of challenges establishing chain of custody. A few pellet
mills classified as type 3 resemble the operations of pel-
let mills that existed prior to the export market, and as
such, they are significantly smaller. Type 3 mills are also
100% reliant on mill residuals from a large number of
sawmills across a wide geography.
Extending the risk assessment to suppliers of second-
ary residuals has proven more problematic than extend-
ing risk management and mitigation tools used for
primary fiber. This is especially critical for pellet mills
choosing to increase the proportion of secondary resid-
uals for economic or other reasons. Consultants working
with these pellet mills also identify the integration of
secondary residual suppliers into risk assessments as
presenting unique challenges. This issue is unlikely to be
resolved any time soon as the forest economy of the
southeast U.S. is free flowing and the value of forest bio-
mass is low. Thus, investments in solving this problem
are unlikely to occur without policy drivers.
Still, companies are instituting risk mitigation strat-
egies for their sourcing challenges. Strategies we ob-
served in this study include first party auditing (by pellet
mill staff) of secondary residual suppliers’ supply chains,
requiring all suppliers to use the FSC CW and PEFC CS
standards, and offering to enroll in group certification
the landowners supplying sawmills within a pellet mill’s
sourcing network.
Lastly, technology is also recognized as offering pos-
sible solutions toward improving the approach to risk
assessment and mitigation of all supply chain types. For
instance, some pellet mills have integrated spatial data-
sets used in risk assessment with due diligence proce-
dures
performed
to
verify
risks
associated
with
individual loads of primary fiber. Likewise, such datasets
could be integrated with remote sensing data for moni-
toring purposes. While technology for tracking flows of
primary fiber has evolved and is being used for pellets,
such solutions have yet to be applied across the diversity
of supply chain actors and feedstocks presently involved
in the industrial wood pellet economy.
