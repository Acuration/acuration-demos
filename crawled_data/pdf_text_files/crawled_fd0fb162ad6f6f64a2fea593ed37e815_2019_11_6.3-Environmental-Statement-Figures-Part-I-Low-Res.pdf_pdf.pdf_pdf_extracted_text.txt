This drawing has been prepared for the use of AECOM’s client. It may not be used, modified, reproduced or relied upon by third parties, except as agreed by AECOM or as required by law. AECO M accepts no responsibility, and denies any liability whatsoever, to any party that uses or relies on this drawing w ithout A ECOM’s express written consent. Do not scale this document. All measurements must be obtained from the stated dimensions.
Notes:
1) The outline LEMP is for illustrative purposes only and identifies the principles of the landscape and ecological 
mitigation. The final LEMP will be subject to the detailed design layout and will be completed as part of a DCO 
Requirement.
2) This figure should be read in conjunction with Appendix 3.4, Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy, 
Appendix 3.5, Outline Lighting Strategy and Appendix 9.1, Flood Consequence Assessment - Outline Drainage 
Strategy.
3) All detailed planting design to reflect utility easements.
4) All existing trees and hedgerows within the Project Site Boundary will be retained where reasonably practical.
5) All construction laydown areas to be fully reinstated (save for maintenance compound).
6) All boundary features (fencelines, hedgerows etc) and fields to be reinstated along Pipeline corridor and to the 
edge of the new access road corridor, subject to utility easements.
7) The location of existing landscape features, including hedgerows, woodland areas and solar farms shown on 
this figure has been informed by a combination of aerial photography and site observation. 
8) Final form of attenuation ponds to be developed in parallel with detailed design.
9) Refer to Appendix 8.10. Figure 1.1 for Otter and Water Vole Survey Area and Survey Results.
