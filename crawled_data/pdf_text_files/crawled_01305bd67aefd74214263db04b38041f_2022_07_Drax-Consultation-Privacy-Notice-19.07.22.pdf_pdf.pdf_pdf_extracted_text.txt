Consultation Privacy Notice
WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT? 
This privacy notice is intended to provide information 
regarding how any personal information we collect from 
you or from third parties about you before during and after 
your relationship with us will be processed within the Drax 
group of companies. It relates to personal data/information 
(defined under data protection laws) about you that we 
refer to as ‘personal information’ in this notice. Privacy 
laws require that we provide this notice to you when 
your personal information is processed by a Drax group 
company operating in Canada, Japan or the UK. 
WHO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION? 
Companies operating under Drax Group plc are the 
joint data controllers of personal information provided 
by you or collected about you. This means that we are 
responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal 
information about you and we are required to notify you 
of the information contained in this notice. It is important 
that you read this notice so that you are aware of how and 
why we are using your personal information and how we 
will treat it. Depending on the circumstances, we may on 
occasion provide you with a shorter privacy notice to cover 
specific types of processing that will be supplemented by 
this notice. 
This notice applies to individuals from who we will obtain 
information from relating to any consultation activity we 
undertake. This notice does not form part of any contract 
of employment or other contract to provide services. We 
may update this notice at any time, so you are advised to 
review this notice at regular intervals. 
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting 
your personal information. Our Group Data Protection 
Officer is responsible for overseeing questions in relation 
to this notice. If you have any questions about this notice, 
please use the contact details set out at the end of this 
notice in the “Contacting Us” section.
DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES 
We will comply with data protection laws in Canada, Japan 
and the UK ensuring the personal information we hold 
about you is: 
1. Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way. 
2. Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly 
explained to you and not used in any way that is 
incompatible with those purposes. 
3. Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and 
limited only to those purposes. 
4. Accurate and kept up to date. 
5. Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we 
have told you about. 
6. Kept securely
How we use your information
When we collect information from you through your submission 
of a response to the consultation or other consultation activity 
this notice will apply.
We may collect your name, contact details, your views on any 
proposals and any other personal information that you provide 
to us. We will also keep copies of any correspondence we have 
with you in relation to your response to any consultation.
We will only use this personal information in order to (1) collate 
and analyse responses and (2) to comply with any publication 
requirements that we may have in relation to the relevant 
consultation process.
It is in our legitimate interests to process your personal 
information in this way, as it is necessary to consider third 
party views, and these interests are not overridden by any 
detriment to your rights or freedoms.  Sometimes we may be 
under a legal obligation to consult with interested parties and 
on some occasions, we may need your consent to process your         
personal data.
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for 
which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we 
need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible 
with the original purpose. 
Please note that we may process your personal information 
without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the 
above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. 
Disclosure of your information
We may have to share your personal information with third 
parties, including service providers and other companies in the 
Drax group. We require third parties to respect the security of 
your personal information and to treat it in accordance with 
the law. We have a Third-Party Onboarding Privacy Policy 
that governs our appointment of third-party service providers 
where we may share, or they may be able to access, personal 
information that we control. It requires us to carry out due 
diligence on them and to ensure appropriate data protection 
terms are in our agreement with them. 
In addition, we may share your personal information for the 
following reasons:
• 
stakeholder management and management reporting;
• 
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal 
information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or 
in order to enforce or apply any contractual terms;
• 
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in 
which case we may disclose your personal information to 
the prospective seller or buyer; or
• 
if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third 
party, in which case personal information held by us will be 
one of the transferred assets.

Storage of your personal information
How long will we use your information for? 
We will only retain your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for 
the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting 
requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period 
for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, 
and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk 
of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal 
information, the purposes for which we process your personal 
information and whether we can achieve those purposes 
through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. 
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your 
personal information can be obtained by contacting us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of                
this notice.
For example, in the UK we have to keep basic information 
about consultation zone stakeholders of our power generation 
development projects for a period of two years, while the 
application is being considered by the Planning Inspectorate 
and UK government. This period can vary if the application 
process takes longer than expected.
In some circumstances:
• 
you can ask us to delete your personal information, see 
Your Rights below for further details;
• 
and we may anonymise your personal information (so 
that it can no-longer be associated with you) for research, 
planning application or statistical purposes in which case, 
we may use this information indefinitely without further 
notice to you.
DATA SECURITY 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed such as 
corporate firewalls protecting multilayer server configuration 
and penetration testing. If you would like to know more, contact 
us using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this notice. 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to 
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
who have a business need to know. They will only process your 
personal information on our instructions and they are subject 
to a duty of confidentiality and an obligation to comply with 
data protection law. See the Data Sharing section above for            
further information. 
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
data security breach and will notify you and the regulator of a 
suspected breach where we are legally required to do so. 
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND 
RESTRICTION 
Your duty to inform us of changes 
It is important that the personal information we hold about 
you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your 
personal information changes during your working relationship 
with us. 
Your rights in connection with personal information 
Data protection laws provide you with rights when your data 
is processed in the UK, Canada and Japan. Where you are not 
entitled to exercise a right, we will consider your request and 
feedback accordingly. 
• 
Request information about how and with who your 
personal information is being used or shared (UK, British 
Columbia and Japan) 
• 
Request access to your personal information. This 
enables you to receive a copy of the personal information 
we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully 
processing it (UK, Canada and Japan); 
• 
Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete 
or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected 
(UK, Canada and Japan); 
• 
Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good 
reason for us continuing to process it. You also have 
the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal 
information where you have exercised your right to 
object to processing (see below). However, this is not an 
absolute right and there will be circumstances where 
we are required to retain your personal information                 
(UK and Japan); 
• 
Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to 
ask us to suspend the processing of personal information 
about you, for example if you want us to establish its 
accuracy or the reason for processing (UK only); 
• 
Request the transfer of your personal information to 
yourself or another party (UK only). 
You also have a right to object to the processing of your 
personal information (UK and Japan). 
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this notice. 
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any 
time to the regulator for data protection issues as follows: 
UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) 
Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada 
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for British 
Columbia 
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for Alberta 
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with 
your concerns before you approach the regulator, so please 
contact us in the first instance using the contact details set 
out below. 
You also have a right to request a file review by the regulator 
(Canada only).

Consultation Privacy Notice
No fee usually required 
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we 
may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly 
unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply 
with the request in such circumstances. 
What we may need from you 
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it. 
Timing of our response 
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 
days. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your 
request is particularly complex or you have made a number of 
requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT 
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided 
your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your 
personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right 
to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any 
time (UK and Canada). 
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details 
in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this notice. Once 
we have received notification that you have withdrawn your 
consent, we will no longer process your information for the 
purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have 
another legitimate basis for doing so in law. 
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE 
We reserve the right to update this notice at any time, and we 
will provide you with a new notice when we make any material 
updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time 
about the processing of your personal information.
