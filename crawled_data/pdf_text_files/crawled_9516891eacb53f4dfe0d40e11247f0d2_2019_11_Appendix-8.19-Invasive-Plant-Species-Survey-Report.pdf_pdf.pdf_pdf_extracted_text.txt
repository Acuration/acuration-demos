Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified that invasive species of plants, as listed under Part 
II of Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA), 1981 (as amended) (specifically 
Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera), are present 
on the Survey Site in a number of areas. The report recommended that a detailed survey to map 
the distribution of any invasive species should be carried out to inform any management measures 
that would need to be implemented to remove or control the spread of these species during the 
construction and operation of the Project.  
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive survey of streams and wet ditches 
within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 within the Survey 
Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.4 
The Survey Site was surveyed in July 2014 by an ecologist from BSG Ecology.  All accessible 
areas of the Survey Site were walked with areas of dense scrub assessed from the perimeter of the 
scrub, and the presence of five species included under Part II were recorded within the Survey 
Site: Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam, rhododendron Rhododendron ponticum, floating 
pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and montbretia Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora. 
1.5 
Of the five species Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed were the most widespread within 
the Survey Site.

Introduction 
2.1 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive species survey in May 2014 to inform 
and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which incorporates a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of 
Phase 2 surveys, including a survey for invasive species.  The methods and results of baseline 
surveys will be provided as appendices to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, 
which is intended for submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Background to Survey 
2.6 
For the purposes of this survey, invasive plant species are defined as those species of non-native 
plants included in part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 (as amended).   
2.7 
Since its creation in 1981, part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981, pertaining to 
invasive plants, has undergone many revisions, to the extent that the original four species has now 
been expanded to include over 30 invasive plant species. 
2.8 
The Phase 1 survey of the Survey Site was carried out in three phases, in February 2014 and 
updated in April 2014, and July 2014.  The timing of the first two surveys during the winter and 
early spring meant that the presence of some of the Schedule 9 species was missed as the 
vegetative parts of the plants (growing above ground) can be absent during the colder months of 
the year, with the plant persisting, over winter, below ground as rhizomes or lying dormant in the 
seed bank.  Because of this it was recommended in the Phase 1 survey report that a dedicated 
invasive species survey should be undertaken within the main botanical survey season (May to 
September) to attempt to map the distribution and extent of Schedule 9 species within the Survey 
Site.

Aims of Study 
2.9 
The aim of the survey is to confirm the presence and identify the locations of species of plant 
included under Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981.

Methods 
3.1 
No standard method exists for invasive plant species survey; and the survey was based on an 
ecological walkover survey approach, whereby all accessible areas of the Survey Site were walked 
by the surveyor in daylight hours, with a visual search for the target species undertaken.  
3.2 
Particular focus was also given to areas where the target species were most likely to be found, for 
example water courses, areas of disturbed ground and tracks where imported material may have 
been used or where fly-tipping or movements of vehicles or machinery could have led to the spread 
of these species.  
3.3 
Where found to be present, the species and location were recorded using a handheld GPS. The 
locations of individual plants, small clusters and large clusters of plants found during the walkover 
survey are provided in Figure 1. The locations are representative and do not necessarily provide 
mapping of the exact extent of each species or the precise location of each individual plant.  
Limitations of Study 
3.4 
The scale of the Survey Site and the presence of dense areas of scrub or woodland understorey in 
some areas mean that it is possible that small stands or individual plants of invasive species could 
have been missed during the walkover survey.  In addition, the presence of horses in some fields 
restricted access to some areas of the Survey Site although these areas were assessed using 
binoculars and it is likely, given the heavily grazed nature of these fields, that most invasive plant 
species would have been visible using binoculars. It is considered that the majority of the Survey 
Site was surveyed adequately and that overall the distribution of invasive species across the 
Survey Site has been mapped accurately.  
3.5 
The mapping produced in support of the report is based on point locations taken using a handheld 
GPS device which is subject to varying degrees of accuracy depending on satellite coverage and 
other factors.  Further to this the GPS locations recorded were for the main aggregation of each 
plant species at each location.   Each point therefore does not represent full coverage of the 
species at each point.  Any invasive plant management plan should take account of this with up to 
date, detailed surveying by a qualified land surveyor undertaken to provide accurate extents of 
species coverage. The distribution of each invasive plant species will, inevitably, change from year 
to year to a greater or lesser extent and these locations should be re-checked as necessary.

Results 
4.1 
Five species of plant included on Part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 were recorded during the 
survey: Japanese knotweed; Himalayan balsam; rhododendron; floating pennywort; and 
montbretia.  The locations and extents of these species are shown on Figure 1. 
4.2 
The most frequently recorded species were Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.   
4.3 
Japanese knotweed was found to be strongly associated with roads and trackways on the Survey 
Site as well as the area of inert landfill in the north-west half of the Survey Site.  This perennial 
species is typically spread through the movement of contaminated soils or through spreading of 
vegetative parts through flailing of hedges or movement of other machinery. 
4.4 
Himalayan balsam is an annual plant that is typically found in wetter habitats, although it will 
tolerate drier conditions.  It is strongly associated with woodland, stream corridors and ditches 
across the Survey Site. 
4.5 
Rhododendron is restricted to woodlands with a small patch occurring in the marshy grassland 
area in the north-west of the Survey Site.  Montbretia was recorded in two locations alongside 
roads, which is a typical location for this species to be found in given that it is often spread from the 
fly tipping of garden waste. 
4.6 
Floating pennywort was found in one of the Survey Site ponds in the south-east of the Survey 
Site2.

APPENDIX 8.12 - SPECIES SPECIFIC LEGISLATION
1.1
Badgers
1.1.1
Badgers are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act (1992) on
animal welfare grounds rather than nature conservation value.  It is an
offence to wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, or possess a
dead badger or any part of a badger.  Under the Act their setts are also
protected against obstruction, destruction or damage.
1.2
Otters
1.2.1
Otters are fully protected under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations
which define “European protected species of animals” and also receive
partial protection under the WCA.
1.2.2
Taken together the Act and Regulations make it illegal to: deliberately
kill, injure, capture, disturb otters (whether in a resting place or not);
damage, destroy or obstruct access to a resting place used by an otter;
possess or transport an otter or any part of an otter, unless acquired
legally; sell, barter or exchange or advertise for such purposes an otter
1.2.3
Activities that could result in impacts on otters should be modified to
avoid/minimise the likelihood of an impact occurring in the first
instance.  If impacts are unavoidable then the works may need to be
carried out under a European Protected Species development licence,
granted under the Habitats Regulations.
1.2.4
Otters are also a Species of Principal Importance in Wales as identified
under Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006.
1.3
Water voles
1.3.1
Water voles are fully protected under the WCA.  It is an offence to
possess, control or sell water voles or to intentionally or recklessly kill,
injure or take water voles.  It is also an offence to intentionally or
recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to a place that water
voles use for shelter or protection or disturb water voles whilst using
such a place.  No licensing regime exists for development activities that
may result in an infringement of the legislation.
1.3.2
Current guidance from NRW states that where development activities
may result in unavoidable impacts on water voles, developers will need
to be confident that their activities are “the incidental result of an
otherwise lawful operation”, and that all steps that could reasonably be
taken to avoid, minimise, mitigate and (if necessary) compensate for
impacts have been taken.
- 2 -
1.4
Dormice
1.4.1
Dormice are protected under the WCA (in respect of section 9(4)(b)
and (c) and (5) only) and are listed in Schedule 2 of the Habitats
Regulations.  Under the current legislation it is illegal to intentionally or
deliberately kill, injure or capture dormice, deliberately disturb dormice
(whether in a nest or not); or to damage, or destroy dormouse breeding
sites or resting places.
1.4.2
Any activity that would result in a contravention of the above legislation
would likely require a European Protected Species (EPS) licence from
the relevant statutory body (NRW).
1.5
Bats
1.5.1
All native UK bat species are protected by UK law under Schedule 5
and 6 of the WCA, and under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations.
It is illegal to deliberately capture, injure or kill a bat or to intentionally or
recklessly disturb bats.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a breeding or resting place
used by a bat.  Under Part 2 of the Habitats Regulations, SACs can be
designated to further protect barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus),
Bechstein’s (Myotis bechsteinii), lesser horseshoe (Rhinolophus
hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum).
1.5.2
Several species of bats are listed under Section 42 of the NERC Act
2006 as Species of Principal Importance.  Species include the greater
horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, barbastelle, common pipistrelle
(Pipistrellus pipistrellus), soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus),
noctule (Nyctalus noctula), Bechstein’s bat and brown long-eared bat
(Plecotus auritus).  Furthermore, five bat species (common pipistrelle,
barbastelle, Bechstein’s bat, greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe
bat) are listed as priority species in the Swansea BAP.
1.6
Breeding birds
1.6.1
All birds, their nests and eggs are protected by the WCA.  It is an
offence to intentionally kill, injure, or take any wild bird, or take or
destroy an egg of any wild bird.  It is also an offence to damage or
destroy the nest of any wild bird (whilst being built, or in use).
1.6.2
Birds listed under Schedule 1 of the WCA are afforded additional
protection with regard to intentional or reckless disturbance while nest
building, or at a nest containing eggs or young, and disturbance of the
dependent young of such a bird is also an offence away from the nest.
- 3 -
1.7
Great crested newts
1.7.1
GCN are fully protected under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations,
and receive partial protection under the WCA Schedule 5.  It is illegal to
deliberately capture, injure or kill GCN, to intentionally disturb GCN or
to otherwise disturb them in their place of shelter, or to deliberately take
or destroy the eggs of GCN.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a breeding site or resting
place used by GCN.  All life stages of GCN are afforded the same level
of protection.  The legislation also makes it an offence to possess,
transport, sell or exchange, or offer to sell or exchange GCN.
1.8
Reptiles
1.8.1
The four common reptile species, adder, grass snake (Natrix natrix),
common lizard and slow worm, are protected under Schedule 5 of the
Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended) against intentional
killing, injuring and trade.  All species of reptile are listed as Species of
Principal Importance in Wales.
1.8.2
The natural range of the rarer species (smooth snake (Coronella
austriaca) and sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) does not include this part of
South Wales, and thus they are not considered further in this
assessment.  Sand lizard is listed as priority species under the
Swansea BAP (coastal areas).
1.9
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates
1.9.1
The WCA lists around 70 invertebrate species on Schedule 5 with
various levels of protection according to the rarity of the species.
Species with full protection under the Act include the marsh fritillary
butterfly, southern damselfly, mole cricket, fairy shrimp, medicinal leech
and freshwater pearl mussel, amongst many others.  Three
invertebrate species are protected under the Conservation of Habitats
and Species Regulations (2010, as amended) large blue butterflies,
Fisher's estuarine moths and little whirlpool ramshorn snails.  Section
42 of the NERC Act (2006) also lists several invertebrate species as
species of principal importance in Wales.
