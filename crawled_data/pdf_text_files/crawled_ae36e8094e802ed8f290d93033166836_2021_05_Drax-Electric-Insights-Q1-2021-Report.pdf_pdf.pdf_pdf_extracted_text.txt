Summary of Britain’s electricity generation mix over the first quarter of 2021
1.  Headlines
The start of 2021 saw unusually cold weather coupled with plant outages, 
which created very tight supply margins throughout January. Despite Britain 
still being under lockdown, insufficient capacity was expected to be available to 
meet demand, leading to some of the highest power prices in two decades. We 
compare Britain’s situation to the blackouts which swept through Texas at the 
start of the year due to extreme weather.
A new interconnector to France came online in January, increasing Britain’s 
capacity for trading power with neighbours by 20%. Imports hit an all-time 
record high, even though the Dutch interconnector was unavailable for much of 
the quarter due to prolonged outages. 
Commercial power generation ended one of Britain’s remaining coal power 
stations, leaving only two stations now in regular operation. At the same time, 
biomass output hit a record high, peaking at over 3.8 GW for the first time as 
plants ran flat out when capacity was scarce. We look at the history of Britain’s 
transition from coal to biomass, and the future of moving towards negative-
emissions biomass with carbon capture and storage.
Wind power contributed heavily to Scotland achieving 97% renewable electricity 
generation in 2020, and Britain’s wind farms produced record power output this 
quarter, reaching over 18 GW for the first time. However, March saw the longest 
‘cold calm spell’ in over a decade: for 11 days straight wind farms operated at just 
11% of their rated capacity. Dealing with extended wind lulls could be biggest 
challenge we face in fully decarbonising Britain’s electricity system.
Gas power stations picked up the slack, which contributed to gas generation 
being up 20% on this quarter last year. This highlights the need for flexible 
backup in the power system. While burning gas without capturing the CO2 is a 
viable solution for now, it will not be possible to rely on unabated fossil fuels for 
balancing in future if the UK is to hit its net zero targets. We explore the options 
Britain has for balancing wind variability in future.

2.  Cold weather and tight margins
The Texas blackout dominated the newspaper headlines in 
February. An ‘arctic outbreak’ plunged south from Canada, 
sending temperatures down to as low as –22°C, more 
than forty degrees below typical February temperatures. 
Electricity demand surged as people tried to stay warm, but 
at the same time as gas and wind power stations shut down 
because of the extreme conditions. Blackouts affected  
4.3 million Texans, with some lasting for 3 days, and at least  
31 lives were lost. Power prices spiked to $8,800 per MWh 
on February 17th in Dallas and Fort Worth – almost 200 times 
their normal level. Some households on variable rate tariffs 
were hit with bills over ten thousand dollars, and three 
utility companies have already declared bankruptcy.
Closer to home, Europe was hit by its own polar vortex, 
creatively dubbed ‘The Beast from the East 2’. After seeing 
the coldest January since 2010, temperatures in February 
fell to a low of –23°C in Braemar (Aberdeenshire). This 
pushed electricity demand up by 15% compared to the 
surrounding weeks due to increased heating load. Demand 
pushed above 48 GW for the first time since 2019, despite 
the country still being under full lockdown.
This increased demand came at an inconvenient time, as 
nuclear outages were prolonged through winter, and the 
Dutch interconnector (which normally supplies a steady  
1 GW to Britain) was also offline. This left the market ‘tight’, 
meaning short of capacity. National Grid ESO (electricity 
system operator) issued three Electricity Margin Notices 
(EMN) in January alone, making six in total for this winter. 
The last such notice was issued back in 2016, highlighting 
the extended stress the system was under.
These EMNs communicate to the market that electricity is 
in short supply and the grid running into its security buffers. 
On the 6th January there was a predicted shortfall of 0.6 GW 
capacity, rising to 1.2 GW on both the 8th and 13th of January. 
This is the largest ever shortfall in supply – equivalent 
to one of Britain’s largest power stations going missing. 
The ESO also issued an Electricity Capacity Market Notice 
(ECMN) on the 8th for only the third time in its history. In 
the end, these notices achieved their aim of bringing more 
capacity online or persuading flexible consumers (such as 
industry) to reduce their demand.

The shortfalls did not lead to any blackouts, but did cause 
the highest power prices of this century. Day-ahead market 
prices rose to £1,063 per MWh on January 13th, their highest 
since 1995 (when they were driven up by capacity payments 
that were abolished in 2001). While this is 25 times higher 
than the average price over the past year, extreme prices are 
not passed on to households directly as they are in Texas. 
Britain’s power system did not suffer the same catastrophic 
failure as in Texas for many reasons. While they share some 
similarities (high shares of wind power, limited connection 
to neighbouring power systems), the UK suffered much less 
severe weather, and is more accustomed to winter storms 
and so is better prepared for them.  
Wind turbines are weatherised so they can continue 
operation when temperatures fall below freezing, and gas 
supplies come from the North Sea pipelines and via ships 
which are unaffected by cold weather, compared to on-land 
gas rigs in Texas which froze over. 
However, the Texan experience helps to remind us about 
the interdependency of energy services. Going forward with 
our decarbonisation we must ensure that the resilience of 
the energy system to extreme weather events is designed 
into the transition to net zero. This might provide an 
argument for decarbonising household heating systems 
with a mix of hydrogen and electric heat pumps, as the ‘all 
electric’ future provides a single point of failure.

Britain moved one step closer to its 2024/25 target of phasing out coal power 
completely, while biomass generation hit new record highs. On the 5th of March Drax 
announced that it had ceased commercial power generation from coal1 after 47 years 
at the UK’s largest power station. This leaves just two coal power stations operating 
in Britain, as 85% of the country’s coal fleet have retired over the last ten years.
Meanwhile, biomass power stations reached new records, generating 3.81 GW on the 
27th of March. Biomass output is likely to grow further as a new biomass-powered 
combined heat and power unit at Teesside is expected to come online later this year.
Global leadership
Currently, biomass supplies 2% of the world’s electricity, 
though this share is higher in Europe, having grown five-
fold since 2000 to hit 6% in 2020.2 One explanation for this 
comes from countries such as Denmark and Sweden, which 
have extensive municipal electricity and combined heat and 
power production.
Another reason is the UK. Our share of electricity generation 
from biomass has tripled over the past decade, hitting an all-
time high of 11% in 2020.2 This means the UK has the highest 
share of electricity production from biomass of any large 
country (ones with over 100 TWh/year electricity demand).
The UK pioneered large-scale use of biomass for electricity 
generation, contributing to its world-leading success 
in decarbonising electricity over the last decade. This 
position means the UK has also played a major part in 
developing the science-led sustainability criteria that 
govern the use of biomass.
The transition from coal to biomass to BECCS (bioenergy 
with carbon capture and storage) outlines the versatility 
of biomass for electricity generation to contribute at each 
stage of the decarbonisation journey. In a high-coal system 
(the UK’s past), biomass conversions allow for rapid carbon 
reductions whilst utilising existing infrastructure and 
preserving the reliable functionality of firm, dispatchable 
power. In a high-renewables system (increasingly the UK’s 
present), biomass offers flexibility services, including inertia 
and grid balancing. This helps the overall system to integrate 
variable renewables and lowers grid management costs. 
Finally, looking to the future, BECCS offers the possibility of 
negative emissions, which the Climate Change Committee 
describe as “a necessity” for net zero and beyond.

Looking to the past 
Coal dominated Britain’s electricity generation until just a 
decade ago. However, since 2018, Britain has produced more 
electricity from biomass than it has from coal. There are 
three main reasons why Britain’s coal plants closed down.
Clean air legislation forced older plants to close if they 
did not fit equipment to capture harmful sulphur and 
nitrous oxide emissions. Secondly, many plants closed on 
economic grounds, either because they were reaching the 
end of their design life and the cost of maintaining them 
outweighed the revenue they could bring in, or they could 
simply no longer compete in the market. A key factor in 
this was government policy raising the cost of emitting 
carbon so coal plants became more expensive than gas. 
With demand falling and renewables taking a larger share, 
there was simply no room left for them to make a profit.
When these units retired they needed to be replaced by 
a clean electricity source that could provide baseload 
generation, producing electricity when it is needed. 
However, research shows that in addition, these coal 
retirements also led to a 30% increase in output from 
natural gas plants (37 TWh extra in 2019).3
The third source of coal plant closures was conversion 
to biomass. Although they represent the smallest share 
of capacity (with 3.2 GW converted), they have delivered 
greater carbon savings because not only did they reduce 
the amount of coal burnt, they replaced it with a low-
carbon source of electricity. Coal to biomass conversions 
therefore limited – rather than increased – gas generation. 
Comparing 2012 to 2019, they reduced carbon emissions 
by 10 MtCO2 per year, slightly more than achieved by the  
8 GW of onshore wind farms installed in that time.3

Annual electricity generation from solid fuels in Britain and the average carbon intensity of electricity, shown over the past three 
decades and the next three decades according to National Grid’s “Leading the Way” future energy scenario
Looking to the future
National Grid ESO’s Future Energy Scenarios see biomass 
playing an increased role in coming decades. Current 
unabated biomass (where emissions from generating 
electricity are offset by regrowing it) plays a key step 
towards the deployment of BECCS (bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage) from the late 2020s. 
Bioenergy (the ‘BE’ in ‘BECCS’) operates by growing and 
continuously regrowing plants that are then used for 
energy. The carbon emitted during energy generation is 
reabsorbed by the regrowth of the plants, meaning net-zero 
emissions. Supply chain emissions are then counted on top 
of this in accordance with a strict sustainability governance 
regime, hence Electric Insights considers biomass as 
producing 121 grams of CO2 per kWh of electricity. 
If emissions from the power station are instead captured 
and locked away underground (the ‘CCS’ in ‘BECCS’), the 
plants being grown and regrown actually remove carbon 
from the atmosphere, over and above simply offsetting 
the bioenergy emissions. Therefore BECCS as a whole can 
deliver negative emissions as part of a major energy source.
The deployment of BECCS means annual carbon emissions 
from electricity generation could fall negative as early 
as 2030 in National Grid’s scenarios. My the mid-2030s, 
BECCS could be removing 40 MtCO2 per year from the 
atmosphere, comparable to total annual emissions in 2020.
The IEA remarked in 2018 that “modern bioenergy is the 
overlooked giant of the renewable energy field”. With the 
potential for sustainable expansion and the use of carbon 
capture to deliver negative emissions, this could take a 
more visible role in the UK’s future.

4.  IFA2 goes online
A new power link between the UK and France went online 
in January, meaning Britain’s interconnector capacity  
has doubled over the last decade to 6 GW. IFA2 is one  
of Britain’s two undersea connection to France, coming 
some 60 years after the first link was built, and 35 years 
after that was replaced by IFA (which still operates today). 
The £700m IFA2 project, jointly owned by National Grid  
and RTE (their French equivalent), spans 130 miles under 
the English Channel to connect Portsmouth with Caen  
in Normandy.
After some early teething troubles, the new link has 
imported 20 times more power than it exported since it 
went into operation on January 22nd. Imports of electricity 
to Britain rose to new record levels, although they could 
have been higher still.
Despite very good historical reliability, the BritNed cable 
between Britain and the Netherlands was out of action for 
most of the quarter: from mid-December through to mid-
February, and again since mid-March. As a result, Dutch 
imports were down 60% and exports down 90% compared 
to the first quarter last year. Cable faults are responsible 
for both outages, being found on December 8th last year 
(and taking three months to repair) and again on March 9th 
this year (with an estimated two months to repair).
There were initial reports that the end of the Brexit 
transition period led to reduced trade over the 
interconnectors to Ireland at the start of this year, sending 
power prices rocketing. The UK left Europe’s Internal 
Energy Market on the 31st December 2020, which increased 
friction for trading. However, it appears this was only a 
short-term blip  — trade fell by 40% between December 
2020 and January 2021, but then recovered completely in 
February. Over the first quarter of this year, trade with the 
Irish power market was 1% higher than the average during 
2019-20. 
Work on a third interconnector to France will begin later 
this year, and links to Norway and Denmark are currently 
under construction. These will begin to be shown on the 
Electric Insights webpage in the coming months. With 
these and the return of the Dutch interconnector to 
service, Britain is set to source an increasing share of its 
power from abroad in the coming years.

At the start of March Britain experienced its longest spell of low wind output 
in more than a decade. For more than a week calm weather covered the country. 
Wind farm output fell to as low as 0.6 GW on the 3rd of March, in sharp contrast 
to the 18.1 GW delivered later on that month. Power prices were typical for the 
time of year, suggesting that the system wasn’t particularly stressed though.
A prolonged period of low wind and low solar power output has been coined in 
German as a ‘Dunkelflaute’ (dunk-el-flout-eh) — a dark wind lull. The event at the 
start of March was the longest Dunkelflaute that Britain has experienced in the 
last decade. Between the 26th of February and the 8th of March the capacity 
factor1 of the national wind fleet did not go above 20%. Its average over these  
11 days was just 11%, less than a quarter of their average in the month either side.
Both the frequency and duration of these events matters. Looking back over 
the Electric Insights archives, this was the longest cold-calm spell that Britain 
has experienced in over a decade. February 2010 also saw 11 days with wind 
capacity factors never going above 20%. However, back in 2010 most of Britain’s 
wind farms were onshore and so average capacity factors were lower. Also, the 
impact of low wind speeds was barely noticeable back in 2010, as Britain’s wind 
capacity then was one-sixth of current levels. 
Based on longer records of historical wind speed data from Renewables.ninja, the 
March Dunkelflaute could be expected roughly once every 20 years, statistically 
speaking. Prolonged low-wind periods should be accounted for when designing 
Britain’s energy system security, and they should not be seen as a ‘black swan 
event’ which cannot be anticipated.
The power system coped in March because the shortfall in wind was made up 
by fossil fuels, particularly the 28 GW of gas power stations. Fossil fuels peaked 
at a 73% share of all electricity generation on the 6th of March. While coal and 
biomass stations ran at close to full output to help, Britain’s nuclear output 
actually fell to its lowest this year during the low-wind period. Nuclear output 
dropped to just 3.6 GW, 30% below its average for the quarter, as maintenance 
outages continued to affect the fleet.

The UK’s ambition to reach net zero would prohibit the use of (unabated) gas 
power plants for such long periods. While a variety of clean flexibility options could 
replace gas, the scale and duration of wind droughts may rule many of them out.
The lull in March saw a deficit of over 10 GW of wind capacity compared to the 
surrounding weeks, and some 2,300 GWh of energy. In comparison, the UK’s 
largest storage facility – the Dinorwig pumped hydro plant in North Wales – 
stores just 9 GWh. Battery storage systems are ideal for providing peak power, 
but their duration (and total energy storage) is limited. Over 10,000 of the 
world’s largest battery storage systems would be needed to cover the shortfall, 
occupying a space the size of Liverpool city.2
Interconnectors can help, but these weather patterns tend to affect the entire 
north-west of Europe, meaning our neighbouring countries would also be short of 
capacity. Flexible demand may be insufficient for a different reason – households 
and industries may be willing to turn down their consumption for a few hours 
at a time, but doing so for over a week straight is another matter. This restricts 
the options for dealing with large-scale weather variability to longer-duration 
storage or low- and zero-carbon fuels such as biomass and potentially hydrogen 
in the future. The four biomass domes at Drax Power Station hold enough fuel to 
generate 600 GWh of electricity, showing the scale that storable fuels can attain.
Weather variability will play an important part in the planning and operation of 
Britain’s future energy system. The recent power outage in Texas highlights the 
cost of overlooking extreme weather risks (noting that it was gas generation 
rather than wind which drove this crisis). Securely managing wind variability will 
likely require policy and market innovations, not just technical fixes.
The output from Britain’s wind farms is almost exclusively balanced by gas 
power stations. Throughout the quarter their outputs were the mirror image of 
one another, performing an elaborate dance to keep the system balanced. For 
every GW that wind output falls, gas output rises by 0.84 GW. When all other 
generation sources are combined, their output only varies by 10% around their 
average of 13 GW across the quarter.

6.  Capacity and production statistics
Electricity production from gas rose 20% from this time last year, driven by lower 
wind output and continued nuclear outages. It was by no means a bad quarter 
for wind farms – their productivity was typical for winter at 37% – but this was 
much lower than during the unusually stormy start to 2020.
Britain’s nuclear reactors on the other hand ran at just 53% capacity factor 
during the quarter, when ideally they should be running 24/7. Their utilisation 
was only slightly higher than that of gas power stations. 
Demand was almost the same as Q1 last year, as the demand reductions from the 
country being under lockdown were offset by it being on average 1 degree colder. 
Both biomass and coal power stations hit a peak of 100% capacity factor during 
the quarter, meaning every station was running at full power at the same time. 
This is highly unusual for coal, which was called on extensively during periods 
of tight margins in January.
Britain’s remaining coal capacity fell by one quarter as Drax announced the end 
of commercial operation for its two remaining coal units in Yorkshire. This leaves 
two coal power stations remaining – West Burton A and Ratcliffe on Soar, both 
in Nottinghamshire, due to close in 2022 and 2024.

Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of waste-to-energy plants.  
These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market operator. Britain’s storage capacity is made up of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage, 0.6 GW of 
lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of flywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.

7.  Power system records
March the 28th was a record-breaking day for Britain’s power system. Wind farms 
produced more than 18 GW for the first time. Over the whole day renewables 
produced two-thirds of the country’s electricity demand, pushing fossil fuels to 
their lowest ever share of electricity generation, under one-eighth of the  
day’s electricity.
January also saw the highest power prices in over a decade, averaging £71/MWh 
for the month. On the 8th real-time prices hit a record £4,000/MWh, and on 
the 13th day-ahead prices (which are normally much smoother) peaked at over

The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2021) and report the record

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants. 
The operation of battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not publicly available.
