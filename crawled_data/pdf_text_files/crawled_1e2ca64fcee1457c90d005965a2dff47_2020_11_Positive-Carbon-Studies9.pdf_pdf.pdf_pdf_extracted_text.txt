1.  Abt, Karen Lee et al.  Effect of Policies on Pellet Production and Forests in the U.S. 
South, United States Department of Agriculture, US Forest Service Southern Research 
Station, December 2014.
Conclusion/Findings:  The authors assess forests in the US South and project future forest 
supply trends that show that increased bioenergy production will lead to increased forest 
inventory and forest cover in the US South.  
Considerations:
o
Market Effects:  Considers the impact of increased markets on forest inventory and 
landowner decisions. 
o
Assumptions:  
o
Acknowledges the use of lower-value fiber as feedstock for bioenergy.  
o
Recognizes the positive impact of increased markets on forest inventory.
Summary:  By acknowledging the positive role that markets play in forest health, this study 
finds that increased markets for forest products will lead to increased forest inventory. 
Though this study does not directly assess forest carbon, an increase in forest inventory will 
positively impact forest carbon stock.

2.  Dale, Virginia et al.  Ecological objectives can be achieved with wood-derived 
bioenergy, The Ecological Society of America, 2015.
Conclusions/Findings: This analysis finds that as demand for wood increases, so does 
wooded area in the US.  
Considerations:
o
Market Effects: Reflects an understanding of the positive impact of increased market 
opportunities on forest cover. 
o
Time Scale: Acknowledges that, based upon the prevailing science, long-term, 
cumulative emissions are harmful to our environment and are correlated to increased 
atmospheric temperatures.1
Summary:  By considering the role that markets play in forest landowner management and 
harvesting decisions, this paper finds that increased demand for wood leads to increased 
forested area.  This has been true in the US since the 1950s.  Additionally, forest carbon 
stocks have remained relatively stable in the US despite increased development and 
population growth.  This report states that carbon assessments should be carried out on a 
long-term basis and should consider the complexities of the US forest market.

3.  Dale, V., K. Kline et al.  Status and prospects for renewable energy using wood pellet from 
the southeastern United States.  GCB Bioenergy, 2017.
Conclusion/Findings:  The authors research how the production of wood pellets in the US South 
is affecting forest systems and find, by reviewing current forest conditions and sustainability 
systems in place, that wood pellets are a small fraction of overall forestry operations in the US 
and can be produced while maintaining or improving forest ecosystems.
Considerations:
o
Market Effects: 
o
Recognizes the strong history of working forests and private landownership in the 
US South and that strong demand for forest products makes forested land more 
valuable and encourage landowners to replant and maintain their forests.
o
Notes that overall forest stocks in the US South have increased for the last 50 
years and will continue increasing if conversion to non-forest uses is low.
o
States that the presence of forest markets, including bioenergy, increase the 
economic attractiveness of forestry, which supports maintenance and expansion of 
forested lands and their carbon sink capacity.
o
Spatial Scale:  Uses a regional scale for assessing carbon and greenhouse gases, 
providing a more complete assessment than a tract-level scale.
o
Time Scale: Acknowledges that, based upon the prevailing science, long-term, 
cumulative emissions are harmful to our environment and are correlated to increased 
atmospheric temperatures.2
o
Assumptions:
o
Recognizes that wood removals for pellet production is a tiny fraction of overall 
harvest removals in the US South.
o
Recognizes that the biggest threat to loss of forested land and carbon stocks is 
population growth, income-driven urbanization, and a greater projected economic 
attractiveness of agricultural products as compared to timber products – NOT 
from production of biomass or any other forest product.
o
Notes that any remaining old-growth forests in the US South are almost 
exclusively located in protected areas where logging is prohibited.
Summary:  Through a thorough understanding of the history of forest resources and the current 
forest landscape in the US South, the study finds that current levels of wood pellet production in 
the US South have the potential to improve forest conditions and ecosystems and that forest 
products will need to remain strong to prevent further conversion of forest land to non-forest 
uses.

in the southeastern United States?  Journal of Forest Ecology and Management 396, pp 143-
149.  March 2017.
Conclusions/Findings:  The authors analyzed US Forest Service Forest and Inventory Analysis 
data from 2002-2014 to examine the effects of the pellet industry on forest conditions near 
Cheasapeake, Virginia and Savannah, Georgia.  The authors find through this analysis that 
timberland volume and carbon pools have seen increases in recent years in both areas.
Considerations:
o
Assumptions:
o
Recognizes that wood removals for pellet production is a tiny fraction of overall 
harvest removals in the US South.
o
Recognizes that the biggest threat to loss of forested land and carbon stocks is 
urbanization – NOT production of biomass or any other forest product.
o
Recognizes the use of thinnings and residues for bioenergy production, not 
sawtimber.  
o
Recognizes that there are limited alternative markets for lower-value fiber and 
that often this wood fiber is burned or left on the forest floor after a sawtimber 
harvest. 
o
Acknowledges that bioenergy markets are not driving harvesting decisions.
Summary: By analyzing the data routinely collected by the US Forest Service, this study 
found that both areas show increasing timberland area, timberland volume, and carbon 
stocks over the past 6 years.  Neither area shows a decrease in timberland volume or area.

5.  Galik, Christopher S. & Abt, Robert C., Sustainability guidelines and forest market 
response: an assessment of European Union pellet demand in the southeastern United 
States, GCB Bioenergy, May 27, 2015. 
Conclusions/Findings:  This research finds that, regardless of sustainability policies, an 
increase in forest area and annual gains in carbon is seen from increased bioenergy demand.  
Considerations:
o
Market Effects: 
o
Uses a sub-regional timber supply model, an econometric model using FIA 
(U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis) data and acknowledging 
fiber prices and market demands.  
o
Considers how forest markets respond to new market entrants in the short-
term and mid-term.
o
Spatial Scale:  Acknowledges that a harvest or tract-level analysis of carbon is 
incomplete and a regional view is necessary to fully assess carbon stock.
o
Assumptions:  
o
Recognizes the use of lower-value fiber as feedstock for bioenergy. 
o
Accurately assesses pellet demand as having incremental, not exponential, 
growth post-2014.  
Summary:  By analyzing market responses to changes in supply and demand and 
considering historical and projected wood fiber prices in the US South, this study recognizes 
the positive impact that new markets for lower-value wood fiber can have on forest growth 
and carbon storage.

gas parity times of European electricity from wood pellets produced in the south-eastern 
United States using different softwood feedstocks.  GCB Bioenergy, December 2016,
Conclusion/Findings:  The authors analyze the carbon impact of various feedstocks for 
bioenergy production in the US South and find a carbon parity of 0-6 years when bioenergy is 
produced from commercial thinnings, harvest residues, or mill residues.
Considerations: 
o
Time Scale: Acknowledges that, based upon the prevailing science, long-term, 
cumulative emissions are harmful to our environment and are correlated to increased 
atmospheric temperatures.3
o
Assumptions:  Considers alternative market fates of various feedstocks, recognizing that 
in most cases, wood used for bioenergy production is harvested as part of a sawtimber 
harvest or as part of a sustainable forest management practices for sawtimber production.
Summary:  By calculating carbon benefits using realistic counterfactual scenarios where 
bioenergy feedstocks are sold into another market or are left to decay in the forest, this study 
finds that greenhouse gas benefits from using biomass to produce electricity are seen very 
quickly.

7.  Miner, Reid et al.  Forest Carbon Accounting Considerations in US Bioenergy Policy,  
Journal of Forestry, 112 (6): 591-606, November 2014.  
Conclusions/Findings: This study analyzes previous peer-reviewed research on biogenic 
carbon and considers bioenergy policies that will promote forest growth and increased 
carbon stocks.
Considerations:
o
Market Effects:  
o
Considers investments made in forestland as a result of increased markets for 
forest products.  
o
Considers market incentives for replanting and keeping land in forest 
production.
o
Time Scale:  Recommends a 100-year time horizon for assessing biogenic carbon.  
This time horizon is used to assess other greenhouse gas sources and reflects the 
prevailing science that shows long-term, cumulative emissions are harmful to our 
environment and are correlated to increased atmospheric temperatures.4
o
Assumptions:  
o
Recognizes the use of thinnings and residues for bioenergy production, not 
sawtimber.  
o
Recognizes that there are limited alternative markets for lower-value fiber and 
that often this wood fiber is burned or left on the forest floor after a sawtimber 
harvest. 
o
Acknowledges that bioenergy markets are not driving harvesting decisions.
Summary: This analysis finds four research insights which are important to assessing forest 
carbon.  If these insights are used, a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is seen from 
the use of bioenergy in place of fossil fuels:
1) As long as wood-producing land remains forested, wood products and bioenergy 
reduce fossil fuel use and its long-term carbon emission impacts. 
2) Increased demand for wood can trigger investments and increase forest area and 
forest productivity. 
3) Long-term, cumulative CO2 emissions are correlated with negative environmental 
effects.
4) A 100 year time-frame should be used to assess biogenic carbon.

8.  Wang, Weiwei et al., Carbon savings with transatlantic trade in pellets: accounting 
for market-driven effects. Environ. Res. Letters, November, 2015.
Conclusion/Findings:  Across different scenarios of high and low pellet demand, the 
authors found that the greenhouse gas intensity of pellet-based electricity is 74-85% lower 
than that of coal-based electricity. 
Considerations: 
o
Market Effects: Considers the market effects with a multi-market equilibrium model 
for assessing greenhouse gases.
o
Spatial Scale:  Uses a regional scale for assessing carbon and greenhouse gases, 
providing a more complete assessment than a tract-level scale.
o
Time Scale: Acknowledges that, based upon the prevailing science, long-term, 
cumulative emissions are harmful to our environment and are correlated to increased 
atmospheric temperatures.5
o
Assumptions: Recognizes the use of pulpwood or residues as feedstock for 
bioenergy. 
Summary: By recognizing the use of lower-value pulpwood and residues as feedstocks for 
bioenergy production, this study finds real carbon savings when using biomass from the US 
in place of coal to produce electricity.

9.  Woodall, C.W.  An Assessment of the Downturn of the Forest Products Industry in 
the Northern Region of the United States, US Forest Service Northern Research Station, 
2012.
Conclusions/Findings: This study assesses the forest products industry in the US as a 
whole and finds that new markets for forest products can assist in filling the gaps created by 
the Great Recession and the global decline of paper demand.  
Considerations:
o
Market Effects:  
o
Discusses how important a market for lower-value fiber, such as small 
roundwood is for the health of the forest.  These removals allow remaining 
trees to grow stronger and healthier, making them more attractive for the 
sawtimber market.  
o
Recognizes how a change in one market can impact the entire forest value 
chain.
o
Assumptions:  Recognizes that sawtimber-quality wood cannot be used for bioenergy 
because of its high cost.
Summary: By analyzing the entire forest products market, this study sees that new markets 
for forest products are needed to continue incentivizing forest landowners to keep their lands 
forested.  While this paper does not directly address carbon, it does address how markets can 
increase forest cover, thereby impacting carbon storage.
