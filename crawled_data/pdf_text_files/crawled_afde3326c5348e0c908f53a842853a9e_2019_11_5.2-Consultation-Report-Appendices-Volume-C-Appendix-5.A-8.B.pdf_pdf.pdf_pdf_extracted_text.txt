Dear James 
 
This email contains important information about the Design Review for your scheme. Please note the details it 
provides, and ensure that all members of your team have this information, by forwarding this email. 
 
 
Design review for                   Abergelli Power Station 
Date and Time                        Tuesday 9th December 2014 at 4.15pm 
Location of Review Meeting  DCfW Office, address below 
 
Thank you for registering this scheme with DCFW’s Design Review service.  
 
A place has been reserved for you to present the above named scheme to the Design Review Panel on the date and 
time above. Please confirm that you wish to accept this place, by replying to this email as soon as possible and within 
a maximum of 5 working days.  
 
Ahead of the review meeting we will require three hard copies and one electronic copy of all pre-review material, if 
possible two weeks in advance of the meeting, sent for my attention at the office address below.  For this review I 
would like to receive all pre-review material no later than Tuesday 25th November 2014. 
 
If the scheme is pre-application, we will treat the material in confidence and the Design Review report will be 
confidential. This is on the condition that DCFW is kept informed of the progress of the project and that we are 
informed when it becomes the subject of a planning application. Please let us know if you do not want us to observe 
confidentiality for your project, or if you have promoted it publicly through the media or internet. 
 
One of our Panel members will visit the site before review. Please tell us if there are any special arrangements that 
need to be made for a site visit and if so, who we should contact to arrange this. If you or your representative do 
arrange to meet our panellist on site, please note that any discussion should be restricted to clarifying the pre-review 
material, and NOT to making a case for the scheme which is properly the business of the Design Review meeting. 
 
We need a list of all those who will be attending, along with details of their respective organisations, one week in 
advance of review. Ideally, we would encourage all the key parties involved – designer, developer/client, local 
authority representatives, consultants – to attend, up to a maximum of six people. We will contact the Local Authority 
with an invitation to attend and a request for background information and the planning context. 
 
Please be aware that Design Review is a rigorous process and in the short time available our comments and evaluation 
are likely to be direct, robust and incisive, but we also aim to be constructive and courteous. If you would like any 
more information to enable you to make best use of the time available for review, or to discuss the process further, 
please do not hesitate to contact us for a pre-review discussion  
 
Following the review you will receive a written report within 2 weeks  
 
Please confirm receipt of this email in writing, and your acceptance of this invitation, within the next 5 working 
days. Your confirmation signals a commitment to attend on this day. It is important that we know you have received 
all the information contained here and that you will meet the necessary deadlines. Please note that due to 
administration costs, if a cancellation is made within two weeks of the review date, we will levy a cancellation fee of 
£300.  
 
We look forward to hearing from you and to meeting you on the day.  In the meantime if you have any queries please 
don’t hesitate to contact me.

Proposal for Gas Fired Power Station 
Design for Wales | December 2014 
Watt  Power  is  an  asset  development  company  established  by  Noble  Clean  Fuels  and  Stag  Energy  to 
create the foundations for a UK power generation portfolio. 
•
Noble Group manages global commodity supply chains utilizing a portfolio of strategic assets in 140 
countries worldwide. Group turnover in 2012 exceeded $96bn with “Energy Products” accounting for 
more than 60% of turnover. Noble established a UK based European trading presence in 2010 and is 
building an asset based portfolio to participate in the energy market. 
•
Stag  Energy  brings  an  experienced  group  of  energy  industry  executives  with  a  track  record  of 
project  origination,  development  and  execution  in  the  gas  value  chain.  Over  the  past  20  years  the 
group has contributed to the development of over 10,000MW  of power generation, gas storage and 
related infrastructure projects, raising in excess of £6bn in commercial debt. 
 
 
Watt  Power  is  a  new entrant  to  the UK  electricity sector  and  has  targeted  the  development  of  at  least 
1,500MW of flexible new electricity generation capacity. Watt Power’s first two power station projects, one 
being Hirwaun Power Station which was presented to DCfW in January 2014, are undergoing examination 
under the Planning Act 2008

Consultations to Date 
Satautory consultation took place during October and November 2014.  Non-statutory 
consultation was carried out in June 2014. 
The Proposals 
 
The proposal is for the development of a gas fired ‘peaking’ power station at Abergelli 
Farm near Swansea, South Wales.  The project is classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) requiring a Development Consent Order (DCO) from the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change based on a recommendation of the 
Planning Inspectorate (PINS). 
Abergelli Farm is to the north of the M4, outside Swansea.  The farm is on rather poor 
marshy land used for horse breeding and some sheep grazing, and some of the land has 
been used for inert landfill.  The landscape generally is of poor quality farmland with 
large numbers of electricity pylons, substations etc. and a post industrial, urban edge 
feel.  A major strategic electricity substation is immediately adjacent to the farm.  A 
large-scale gas compression plant has already been constructed at the farm and is 
operational. It links into the main south Wales gas line that passes through the farm.  
The gas and substation plant are effectively screened by mature hedgerow and tree 
plantations. 
The proximity of the substation and ready availability of the large scale gas supply is the 
driving logic for the selection of this location for the power project.  The plant will 
provide support to the grid during periods of very high demand or when supplies from 
elsewhere are reduced.  It is likely to run for 1500 hours per year, complementary to the 
use of wind power and other alternative power sources in bridging the gaps in 
intermittent power supply.  A large-scale solar power generation plant is under 
3 | P a g e  
 
construction at Abergelli Farm also feeding into the adjacent substation.  A number of 
similar projects are in operation on adjacent land. 
 
Main Points in Detail 
 
Location 
There is a clear logic behind the selection of this site for the intended project, in terms of 
existing energy infrastructure and demand.  The Design Commission supports this well 
considered and well justified scheme, and believes that the design processes that the 
team are undertaking are guiding the project in the right direction.  A clear case was 
made for the need for the facility, and it is good to see a new economic use of the 
farmland. 
 
Visual Impact 
The impact of the scheme on long distance views will largely be defined by the type of 
engineering plant selected.  As the Rochdale Approach is being taken, defining maximum 
development envelopes, the precise impact will not be known at DCO stage.  Although 
the Commission understands that the choice of generation plant size and numbers will 
be determined by financial decisions, we would prefer to see five smaller units rather 
than two or three much larger ones. 
 
The Commission does not necessarily subscribe to the view that infrastructure should be 
‘camouflaged’ in the landscape, especially when that landscape is already industrial in 
nature, as is this. However, we are aware that this is a widely accepted approach and 
that the team will use colour and other treatments/approaches to address matters of 
visual impact. 
 
The Commission commends the colour experiments that the team has been undertaking 
on this, and other power projects.  We agree that, on this site, a simple colour scheme 
with a darker colour for the base and a lighter colour for the flues, would work well. 
 
Landscape Opportunities 
The treatment of the landscape within the site, especially at the edges, should reflect the 
open countryside nature of the site.  Minimising grey, hard landscaping and maximising 
green landscaping and planting around supporting structures would help to do this.  The 
wooded back edge of the site could also be reinforced with new planting. 
 
It would be beneficial to fence the scheme so that the route through the middle of the 
site remained accessible to public for recreational use. 
 
Site Management 
Developing a wider site management plan would be a positive step towards making this 
scheme an exemplar ‘farm of the future’.  The plan should coordinate the various energy 
and farming projects and associated infrastructure works at Abergelli.  The management 
plan could also cover issues such as landscape patterns, boundaries and fencing, 
planting strategies, recreation uses, landscape maintenance and eventual 
decommissioning and landscape reinstatement.

EN010069-Outreach-PINS-presentation.pdf 
 
Following the introductions from all attendees the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) gave a 
presentation outlining the PA 2008 process for Development Consent Order (DCO) 
applications, and explained its own impartial role within the PA 2008 regime. PINS can 
advise all parties, and strongly encourages communication during the pre-application 
stage to request information and raise issues with the applicant. PINS also informed of 
the specific roles of the applicant, local authorities and statutory parties within the 
DCO process, emphasising that the pre-application is the time for all parties to deal 
with issues arising before the application is formally submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate and the strict statutory deadlines are in place. Once the application is 
submitted during the acceptance stage of the process, the key area explored would be 
consideration by local authorities of the adequacy of the application’s consultation, 
and whether the applicant had regard to the comments received from both statutory 
and non-statutory consultees.  
 
The early work on Statements of Common Ground (SoCG) is encouraged as it 
provides an opportunity to narrow down the issues that the applicant and the 
stakeholders agree or disagree, and provides a clearer picture for the Examining 
Authority. In response to the Natural Resources Wales’ (NRW) query about an 
example of a good SoCG, PINS said that they are currently working on choice of 
sample documents to be published on the Planning Portal website.  
 
PINS also explained the importance of the Local Impact Report (LIR) prepared by the 
Local Authorities during the examination of the DCO application. LIR is a report on the 
‘likely impact of the proposed development’ in the area, across all the Council’s 
functions, and the Secretary of State (SoS) must have regard to it when coming to a 
decision.  
 
City and County of Swansea Council (CCSC) advised that dealing with Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) in the area has a significant impact on the 
Council’s resources, stating for example their experience with Tidal Lagoon Swansea. 
PINS emphasised how joint working and helping Examining Inspectors to focus on 
which issues to examine can help manage resources for all stakeholders.  
 
Project update

slides-PINS-outreach.pdf 
 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) provided an update on the project, since the close of 
the statutory consultation period. The red line boundary is drawn to allow for the 
degree of flexibility of the design and the worst case scenario assessed in the 
Environmental Statement for the purpose of the Rochdale Envelope.  
 
 
 
The applicant advised that they are still considering two access options. The preferred 
Access Option 2 depends on the use of the road owned by National Grid (NG). The 
applicant confirmed that since August 2014 they had been engaging with NG 
regarding the use of the road. However, until the formal agreement is in place, APL 
will continue to consider both access options in their red line boundary for the 
proposal.  
 
The statutory consultation was held between 13 October and 16 November 2014, 
during which the applicant had sent over 13000 letters to inform local community, and 
held four events in different locations, attended by over 100 people. A range of issues 
were raised in the feedback received, in particular relating (but not limited) to: 
 
Two access options, particularly potential impacts of construction traffic arising 
in case of Option 1 
 
Noise and air quality during construction and operation phases, and  
 
Visual impacts. 
 
The applicant also advised of the updated project timeline, confirming the main dates, 
including the publication of the Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) in 
October 2014, before commencement of the statutory consultation under s42 of the 
PA 2008. Currently APL are analysing and considering consultation responses which 
will be reviewed and included in the final Consultation Report and the Environmental 
Statement, and will influence the final project design. Development Consent Order is 
being drafted as well. The anticipated application submission date is Q1 of 2015.  
 
Specific issues raised by the stakeholders 
 
Top level design 
 
The attendees discussed top level design of the Generating Equipment and any 
alternative possibilities. 
 
One of the issues was the choice of location and the strategic need for the proposed 
development of that type in the region, in relation to the current Policy aspects in 
Wales (Cllr Richard). PINS advised that National Policy Statements (NPSs) are in place 
therefore the proposed development will be considered in accordance with relevant 
NPSs that apply here. Additionally, the Technical Advice Notes (TANs) and the adopted 
Welsh Policy can be important and relevant considerations – similar to ‘material 
considerations’ for planning purposes.  
 
CCSC stated that the emerging Local Development Plan is currently being progressed 
and its status might change during the examination of the DCO application. The 
applicant confirmed that they are aware of it and will include Policy considerations in 
the Environmental Statement when assessing cumulative impacts, taking into account 
other proposed developments in the vicinity.  
 
PINS advised that if new legislation comes into place, the Examining Authority (ExA) 
will have an opportunity to ask written questions during the examination. It might 
assist parties to look at the questions posed by the ExA for the other schemes, 
currently at the examination stage, such as Hirwaun Power Station and Progress 
Power Station. Please see the links to the relevant pages:  
 
Progress Power Station: ExA’s first questions: 
Hirwaun Power Station: ExA’s first questions: 
Hirwaun Power Station: ExA’s second questions:  
  
 
 
In response to query why Swansea area had been chosen for the proposed 
development, APL explained the process of identifying and selecting a suitable location 
for any proposed project. The process includes taking a number of steps such as 
geographical search, capacity to connect to available gas and electricity system; 
engaging with the local authority regarding the Development Plans and availability of 
electricity networks. Furthermore, the applicant must communicate with people who 
have interest in land, and in this case APL approached owners of Abergelli Farm.  
 
Cllr Jenkins advised that the PEIR had no photomontages of photographs taken from 
higher ground points. The applicant confirmed that they were aware of this issue; 
therefore additional photographs will be included in the final Environmental 
Statement. Regarding issues such as external appearance of the plant and use of 
trees and hedges for screening the applicant advised that they were meeting with the 
Design Commission for Wales for the review of the design. PINS also advised that 
such matters can be put forward by the interested parties during the examination to 
be considered by the Examining Authority in the Recommendation Report and the 
Secretary of State when making a final decision.   
 
NRW stated that they try to encourage developers to consider the Environmental 
Permit under Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 early in 
the process. The applicant considers that the choice of simple cycle gas turbine 
technology for a peaking power plant operating up to 1500 hours per year represents 
the most suitable technology choice in respect of relevant planning considerations and 
represents "best available techniques" in terms of the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010. The applicant advised that they intend to 
reach agreement in principle with NRW regarding the application for Environmental 
Permit. The applicant also advised that it would be following the approaches taken on 
its other current DCO applications. PINS advised that where the proposal required an 
Environmental Permit that affected development consent considerations, it advised 
‘twin tracking’ DCO and Permit applications. It advised that it would like to follow this 
issue up jointly with NRW and the applicant 
 
NRW had a query about the maximum height of the stacks between 35 and 40 
metres, which is also one of the local authority’s considerations. The applicant 
confirmed that they are considering the worst case scenario and assessing both 
configurations (thicker and higher stacks, and five shorter thinner stacks) in relation 
to each topic such as noise, air quality etc. PINS advised that flexibility and 
considering options are important during the pre-application stage as once the 
application has been submitted it’s not easy to make changes to the proposal. 
However, the final design is agreed following the grant of consent.  
 
Dr Doherty raised queries regarding the choice of technology, advising that he 
believed Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) to be more efficient, especially with use 
of the waste heat for Combined Heat and Power. APL advised that the choice of 
technology for the proposal is in response to government policy and in particular the 
Capacity Mechanism requirement for highly flexible power plants to provide electricity 
at short notice during periods of high demand. The applicant considers that the Simple 
Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant is the best approach to provide capacity at short 
notice during periods of high demand as, among other factors, the Combined Cycle 
Gas Turbine (CCGT) would potentially involve a range of other environmental impacts. 
 
Combined Heat and Power 
 
In response to the query about re-use of waste heat and the provision for Combined 
Heat and Power (CHP) technology, the applicant advised that since simple cycle gas 
 
 
turbine (SCGT) plants do not have a heat recovery steam generator to generate 
steam, the provision of heat from an SCGT plant for CHP is not possible. This will be 
explained in the application documents. Stakeholders advised the applicant of the 
possibility of waste heat to supply potential future developments nearby including for 
up to one thousand homes to be built on the old Felindre steelworks site nearby. 
 
PINS advised that whether the proposed power station would be capable of providing 
heat might be an issue for the examination. It advised that the applicant should 
prepare information to address the requirements of the National Policy Statements in 
respect of CHP. 
  
Noise 
 
One of the stakeholders’ questions referred to the working hours at the proposed 
power station, including night working which would entail illuminating of the site at 
night. The applicant said that 24 hour working will be only during the operation, and 
that they are planning to present indicative night time visualisations as part of the 
application. Additionally, they are proposing the implementation of noise abatement 
measures, particularly during the turbine spin-up to mitigate the noise level; however, 
this will also depend on the number of turbines.  
 
As the average noise level has been discussed, APL advised that they are taking into 
account the cumulative impact of the DVLA’s park & ride site nearby and the proposal 
for new houses and new business park at Felindre to make assumptions based on all 
these projects. These will be reviewed by the CCSC to ensure that they are 
reasonable.  
 
Access 
 
Two assessed access options to the proposed site have been discussed earlier during 
the meeting, and the applicant confirmed their intention to include a single access 
option in the application if possible.  
 
Natural Resources Wales 
 
In addition to the discussion on Environmental Permitting, NRW advised that it had set 
out issues in response to the applicant’s formal consultation and previously in 
response to consultation for the applicant’s EIA scoping. NRW agreed to circulate its 
response to attendees.  
 
NRW advised that it encourages submission of draft ES chapters which refer to issues 
such as considering ancient woodland, proximity of a Dwr Cymru Welsh Water water 
main and the Habitats Regulations. 
 
Potential habitat implications of the proposed access routes include: 
 
Option 1: Potential impacts on a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC); and  
 
Option 2: Potential impacts on Ancient Woodland.     
 
PINS advised that during the pre-application stage it is beneficial for the particular 
stakeholders to see draft DCO requirements proposed by the applicant, and to 
continue discussions. 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific decisions / follow up required? 
 
NRW will circulate their comments on the applicant’s Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) to all attendees.  
 
APL will provide examples of the US peaking plants, widely used in California, to 
CCSC.  
 
Information added after the meeting:  
 
APL cited examples of similar peaking plants in operation in California and Australia. 
The applicant advised that, for instance, Mortlake Power Station in south Western 
Victoria, Australia is a peaking power plant with a similar purpose to the Abergelli 
Power Project (although this example has a larger rated electrical output of 550 MW 
compared with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW for Abergelli Power). APL 
advised that further information could be found at the following website: 
http://www.originenergy.com.au/1376/Mortlake-Power-Station.

Dear  
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas-fired power plant on land adjacent to the National Grid 
compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
I write to update you on our proposal to construct and operate a gas-fired power station on a site at 
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas connection and electrical 
connection (together "the Project"). 
 
We undertook statutory consultation, pursuant to section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 
Planning Act”), between 13 October and 16 November 2014 and would like to thank all those who 
provided comments.  We will take all responses into account as we refine our proposals in 
anticipation of the submission of our application for a Development Consent Order in the first 
quarter of 2015. 
 
As part of the statutory consultation, we proposed two alternative options for the purpose-built 
Access Road to our site, these were: 
 
Option 1: Access from Rhyd-y-pandy Road following the route of an existing farm road to 
the north of Abergelli Farm; or 
 
Option 2: Access from the B4489 using National Grid’s existing road to the Swansea 
North electrical substation and Felindre gas compressor station. This option would require 
the extension of the existing road. 
 
We indicated during the consultation period that Option 2 was our preferred access option and that 
we were working with National Grid to reach an agreement about the use of their road. We have 
reached a point in our negotiations with the National Grid companies where Option 1 can be 
removed and Option 2 proposed as the Access Road in our application for a Development 
Consent Order.  We have therefore taken this opportunity to update the application boundary for 
the Project, a copy of which is enclosed with this letter.  
 
Taking this change into account, we would be pleased to receive any further comments on the 
Project that you may have within 21 days of the date of this letter. Please include your name and 
an address where correspondence about the comment can be sent. Comments may be made 
public, subject to data protection laws.

Dear  
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas-fired power plant on land adjacent to the National Grid 
compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
Change to application boundary 
 
I write to further update you on our proposal to construct and operate a gas-fired power station on 
a site at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea together with an integral gas connection and electrical 
connection (together "the Project"). This follows statutory consultation with you in October 2014 
and an update letter, relating to our access proposals, sent to you in January 2015. 
 
We are now in the final stages of our design and related environmental impact assessment 
process for the Project. In order to ensure that we can accommodate and deliver all necessary 
ecological mitigation, the application boundary has been refined to include approximately 4ha of 
additional land.  A plan showing the refined application boundary, with the additional land 
highlighted, is enclosed with this letter. 
 
If you have any comments, or require further information on this change or any other element of 
the Project, please do not hesitate to contact me.  
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Adam Heffill

Indication about your view on adequacy of consultation - forthcoming application 
to PINS for Abergelli Power Project DCO
Attn: West Team Leader, Planning Division, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council 
 
Dear Mr Davies 
 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is currently preparing to submit its application to the Planning Inspectorate for a 
Development Consent Order in respect of a gas fired power station and integral gas and electrical connections at 
Abergelli Farm, north of Swansea. 
  
 Following the statutory consultation period held from 13 October to 16 November 2014 under sections 42, 47 & 48 
of the Planning Act 2008 we have further developed the proposals and completed the environmental impact 
assessment and shall be submitting an application in a few weeks’ time.  
  
The application is categorised as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) and therefore is made to the 
Planning Inspectorate who will appoint an Examining Authority to examine and make a recommendation to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, who will make the final decision on the application. The Planning 
Inspectorate will contact your authority on receipt of the application to request your authority’s view as to whether 
the consultation undertaken by APL was adequate. 
 
Adequacy relates to the satisfactory discharging of the following legal duties: 
  
 
Duty to consult (Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008) 
 
Duty to consult the local community (Section 47 of the Planning Act 2008) 
 
Duty to publicise the draft application (Section 48 of the Planning Act) 
  
We note that in your letter of 23 June 2014 in response to PINS’ EIA scoping consultation you confirmed your wish 
not to be consulted in future unless the proposals alter significantly, and as they have not done so, we have sought 
to respect this whilst also discharging the applicant’s legal duties.  
 
As PINS will consult your authority as to adequacy of the applicant’s consultation, on behalf of the applicant I would 
welcome, in advance, an informal indication from you as to your likely view (if any) to PINS on whether or not the 
consultation was adequate so that we may have the opportunity to discuss with you any matters requiring it. 
 
I should be grateful if you could provide your response by reply to this e‐mail, by close of business on 13 March 
2015. 
  
For reference, APL’s Statement of Community Consultation setting out how it intended to satisfy the s47 legal duty 
is available at: 
http://www.abergellipower.co.uk/wp‐content/uploads/2014/09/Abergelli‐Power‐Project‐%E2%80%93‐Statement‐
of‐Community‐Consultation.pdf. Regarding section 42, the letter dated 8 October 2014 sent to your authority and 
other statutory consultees explained the format of the section 42 strand of consultation, such as the publication of 
the Preliminary Environmental Information Report. As to section 48, the required notices were published in local 
and national media in October.  
  
Should you have any queries on the above, or the scheme or application process, please do not hesitate to contact 
me on the contact details below.

Colin, 
 
Abergelli Power Ltd – Adequacy of Consultation 
 
In my informal opinion, the consultation exercise carried out by APL was in accordance with the 
proposals set out in the statement of community consultation and was therefore adequate in this 
respect. APL have engaged in consultation with both the Local Planning Authority, the local 
community and other interested parties and provided adequate supporting information to explain 
the proposals as they have developed.  
 
Further consultation with the Local Planning Authority has provided an opportunity for further 
comment on the proposals.  
 
I trust this information is of use to you. Please note that this is an Officer’s informal opinion and is 
given without prejudice.

A SoCC was prepared prior to subsequent Phase 1 and Phase 2 
statutory consultation and both were subject to consultation with 
CCS.  Both the 2014 and 2018 SoCC explained how APL 
intended to consult with the local community and local interest 
groups regarding the Project, and thus how APL would satisfy 
legislative requirements (see Appendix 4.A and 9.A of the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.2)). 
APL held the non-statutory exhibitions early in the design and 
development process in order to raise awareness of the Project 
and provide opportunity for local feedback to shape the Project 
from an early stage.  Members of the APL project team attended 
the exhibitions during both Phase 1 and Phase 2 statutory 
consultation periods and were available to receive feedback from 
attendees and to discuss and answer questions regarding the 
Project.  Members of the APL project team also attended various 
community council meetings during both Phase 1 and Phase 2 
consultation. Further details are in Section 6.2 and 8.2 of the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0).

There is growing acknowledgement within Government policy 
and industry that established renewable technologies cannot

currently forecast a need for ~42 GW of new Gas and Nuclear 
generation between 2012 and 2030. The type of gas generation 
required post-2020 must be more flexible to support intermittent 
wind and solar generation.   
A full cumulative impact assessment was undertaken as part of 
the EIA following the non-statutory consultation period in order to 
consider the combined impacts of the Project with other nearby 
developments. Details are evident in each topic chapter and 
further as a standalone chapter (see ES Chapter 17 Cumulative 
Effects, Document Reference 6.1).

As explained in the ES (Document Reference 6.1), APL 
undertook a detailed site assessment in the initial phase of the 
Project from 2010-2013, during which period a range of sites 
around the UK were studied as to their suitability for a flexible 
gas-fired power station.  A number of key factors were considered 
in the site selection process: technical (e.g. the size of the site 
and the proximity to appropriate gas and electrical connection 
points), environmental, economic, and whether the proposals 
would be in line with local planning policy.  On such basis a 
suitably sized site within Abergelli Farm was identified in 2013 
and found likely to be suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station. 
An assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the 
Project (including with regards to landscape and visual impact 
and noise and vibration) has been undertaken, and, where 
appropriate mitigation measures have been considered.  The

and found likely to be suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station. 
Need for new energy infrastructure, and fossil fuel infrastructure, 
is established in NPS EN-1 and NPS EN-2. 
 
There is growing acknowledgement within Government policy 
and industry that established renewable technologies cannot 
provide the security of supply that consumers require. DECC 
currently forecast a need for ~42 GW of new Gas and Nuclear 
generation between 2012 and 2030. The type of gas generation

required post-2020 must be more flexible to support intermittent 
wind. 
A full cumulative impact assessment was undertaken as part of 
the EIA following the non-statutory consultation period in order to 
consider the combined impacts of the Project with other nearby 
developments. Details are evident in each topic chapter and 
further as a standalone chapter (see ES Chapter 17 Cumulative 
Effects, Document Reference 6.1). 
Concerned about 
height of stacks and 
pollution 
For the purposes of the non-statutory consultation and modelling 
the worst case maximum stack height of 60 m was assumed.    
However, following non-statutory consultation and further 
detailed assessment work, the height of the stacks within the final 
Application documentation was refined to between 35 and 40 m 
stacks for 1 or 2 Gas Turbine Generators and between 25 and 30 
m* for the commencement of statutory consultation.  
The air quality assessment (chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)) has shown that the Project will not result in any 
likely significant environmental effects in relation to air quality 
either as a standalone project or cumulatively with other projects. 
* The Power 
Generation Plant is 
now made up of 
only one Gas 
Turbine Generator 
with one exhaust 
gas flue stack, 
rather than up to 
five. The stack 
height is now a 
maximum of 45 m, 
instead of 40 m. 
It seems a foregone 
conclusion 
 
APL has undertaken extensive consultation with the local 
community and key stakeholders in order to inform the 
development of the Project and to shape the final Application. 
The Power Generation Plant is classified as a Nationally 
Significant 
Infrastructure 
Project 
(NSIP) 
and 
as 
such 
Development Consent is required.  Development Consent for a 
 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation Feedback and APL Response 
 
11 
 
NSIP may only be granted by a DCO through an application to 
the Secretary of State (SoS). 
Why won’t the local 
planning 
department be 
involved initially and 
taken up to “Bristol” 
not even Cardiff for 
the plans to be 
passed 
 
APL has undertaken pre-application consultation with the local 
planning authority (City and County of Swansea (CCS)) from the 
outset of the Project via a series of meetings throughout 2014, as 
recorded within the Consultation Report (Document Reference 
5.1.0). 
The Power Generation Plant is classified as a Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) and therefore an 
application for Development Consent is required.  Development 
Consent for a NSIP may only be granted by a DCO through an 
application to the SoS, rather than to the local planning authority. 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise 
development 
associated 
with 
the 
NSIP 
(“associated 
development”).   
The PA 2008 restricts associated development for which consent 
can be sought under a DCO in Wales to development that is 
associated with a generating station with a capacity in excess of 
350MW.  As the Power Generation Plant would have rated 
electrical output of up to 299 MW, associated development to the 
Power Generation Plant cannot be included in any application for 
DCO under the PA 2008.  The application for a DCO therefore 
only includes the Power Generation Plant and related mitigation 
as "authorised development" and does not seek development 
consent for the Gas Connection or the Electrical Connection. 
Instead, APL will seek planning permission for the Gas 
Connection under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 
 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation Feedback and APL Response 
 
12 
 
("TCPA 1990"). The Electrical Connection could either be 
consented through the TCPA 1990  or as permitted development 
under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted 
Development) Order 1995 ("GPDO"). Therefore, CCS will be the 
determining authority for one or both of these elements of the 
Project.

Needs more detail 
 
APL sought to provide more detailed information on the Project 
during the subsequent Phase 1 and Phase 2 statutory 
consultation periods.  The subsequent statutory exhibitions 
included a range of consultation materials (including exhibition 
display boards, leaflets, photomontages, maps, plans, SoCC, 
PEIR, and PEIR NTS) providing information on: the Project, the 
Project Site, APL, the need for new gas-fired electricity 
generation, and the potential environmental impacts (see 
Appendices 4.A, 4.C, 4.E, 9.B, 9.E, and 9.H) of the Consultation 
Report (Document Reference 5.2)). 
The ES can be found at Document Reference 6.1 within the 
Application materials. 
 
15 permanent jobs

An initial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of the 
Project was undertaken and the findings presented in the 2014 
and 2018 PEIR (Appendix 4.C and 9.H of the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.2)) (available during subsequent Phase

1 and Phase 2 statutory consultation respectively).  The 2014 
PEIR (Appendix 4.C of the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.2)) states that the number of temporary construction 
workers on the site would vary from 25 to 150 over a 25 month 
period*, with 15 full-time employees* during the operational 
phase of the Project and maintenance contracts available for 
local businesses.   
The Project is expected to provide approximately £4.6m GVA to 
local economy during construction and is estimated to provide 
approximately £1.1m GVA and £1m per annum to the local and 
national economy respectively.  
*The 2018 PEIR 
clarified that the 
number of 
construction 
workers per month 
will range from 25 
to 122 during the 
peak construction 
period. The 
number of full time 
equivalent (FTE) 
direct jobs has 
changed from 15 to 
10.  
 
Emissions and 
safety risk needs to 
be clear 
An assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the 
Project (including with regards to air quality) was undertaken, 
and, where appropriate mitigation measures were considered.  
The findings of the preliminary environmental assessment were 
presented in the 2014 and 2018 PEIR, and 2014 and 2018 PEIR 
NTS (Appendix 4.C and 9.H of the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.2)) (available during Phase 1 and Phase 
2 subsequent statutory consultation periods, respectively).  The 
final findings of the environmental assessment undertaken are 
contained within the ES (Document Reference 6.1) which 
accompanies the Application. 
The air quality assessment (chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)) has shown that the Project will not result in any

either as a standalone project or cumulatively with other projects.  
Gas-fired power stations have been operating safely in the UK for 
the last 30 years. 
Given the planning

A full cumulative impact assessment was undertaken as part of 
the EIA following the non-statutory consultation period in order to 
consider the combined impacts of the Project with other nearby 
developments. Details are evident in each topic chapter and 
further as a standalone chapter (see ES Chapter 17 Cumulative

Decision regarding 
the access route in 
advance of any 
planning application 
Following 2014 non-statutory consultation, APL undertook an 
initial assessment of the impact of the Project on traffic and 
transport in the 2014 PEIR (the 2014 PEIR NTS can be found at 
Appendix 4.C of the Consultation Report (Document Reference 
5.2)) (available during statutory consultation), and proposed two 
possible access routes for consideration during Phase 1 statutory 
consultation.  Further to Phase 1 statutory consultation with the 
local community and key stakeholders, including the Highways 
Agency, the two access route options were refined and Access 
Route Option 2 was chosen as the proposed access to be 
included within the DCO.  Access Route Option 2 proposed an 
Access Road from the B4489 to the west of the Generating 
Equipment Site, including an existing road from the B4489 as well 
as a new purpose built extension to the Generating Equipment 
Site. 
 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation Feedback and APL Response

Following the selection of the proposed Access Route  for the 
Application, APL wrote to relevant Section 42 consultees on 26th 
January 2015, inviting any further comments on the Project to be 
submitted within 21 days, by 16th February 2015 (see 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) and Appendix 
5.D of the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.2)). 
More detail

final findings of the environmental assessment undertaken are 
contained within the ES (Document Reference 6.1) which 
accompanies the Application. 
A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) can be found 
at Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). The air

significant environmental effects in relation to air quality either as 
a standalone project or cumulatively with other projects.

A preliminary assessment of the potential environmental impacts 
of the Project was undertaken and presented in the 2014 PEIR 
and 2014 PEIR NTS (Appendix 4.C of the Consultation Report 
 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation Feedback and APL Response 
 
17 
 
(Document Reference 5.2)) (available during Phase 1 statutory 
consultation). The preliminary assessment was updated and the 
potential environmental impacts of the Project presented again in 
the 2018 PEIR and the 2018 PEIR NTS (Appendix XX of the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.2)) (available during 
Phase 2 statutory consultation).  
What could be the 
side effects of this 
project i.e health 
emissions, 
problems with road 
usage 
The potential environmental impacts of the Project have been 
assessed in the EIA, in respect of: air quality; noise and vibration; 
ecology; water quality and resources; geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology; landscape and visual impacts; traffic, 
transport and access; archaeology and cultural heritage; and 
socio-economics.  Where appropriate, mitigation measures are 
proposed in order to address any potential adverse impacts.  The 
final findings of the environmental assessment are contained 
within the ES (Document Reference 6.1) which accompanies the 
Application.  
 
In future, how big, 
any other 
expansion on the 
site itself. Worried 
about the hot air 
given off – and with 
the prevailing wind 
– how will the fall

The potential environmental impacts of the Project have been 
assessed in the EIA, including in respect of air quality and waste, 
and where appropriate, mitigation measures are proposed in 
order to address any potential adverse impacts.  The final 
findings of the environmental assessment are contained within 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1) which accompanies the 
Application. 
The air quality assessment (chapter 6 of the ES (Document

likely significant environmental effects in relation to air quality 
either as a standalone project or cumulatively with other projects. 
The evolution of

Six 
comments

oppose the site selection. 
Reasons include that the area 
is supposed to be a no build 
area, 
and 
therefore 
the 
location is not suitable; that 
they are disappointed that this 
is for a largely rural area; that 
the location of this site is not 
positive for the environment 
and; that the application is not 
in keeping with the aesthetics 
of the area. 
As explained in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), APL undertook a 
detailed site assessment in the initial 
phase of the Project from 2010-2013, 
during which period a range of sites 
around the UK were studied as to 
their suitability for a flexible gas-fired 
power station. 
This process identified that the site 
had the following key advantages: 
 
 It is in close proximity to a 
suitable electrical connection 
point; 
 It is in close proximity to a 
suitable gas connection point;

Velindre site has already been 
cleared and the WDA had 
improved direct road access to 
the M4 to encourage new 
industry into the area and there 
are also good rail links. This 
site is also adjacent to an 
existing electrical substation. It 
would require a slightly longer 
spur from the gas feeder 
station 
which 
would 
be 
underground. 
Tree 
planting/screening

This would appear to be an 
improved 
environmental 
solution.

considered, including in respect of 
site selection.  The ex-British Steel 
Works site was considered by APL, 
but the local authority indicated that 
there are already plans for this site 
(see UDP Policy designation EC1(1).   
The Project is located away from UDP 
Policy designation EC1(1) which 
allocates 190ha of employment land 
at Felindre Strategic Business Park*, 
located approximately 1.5km to the 
south-west of the Project Site, in order 
to meet the growth needs of the local 
economy. This is a brownfield site but 
which 
possesses 
excellent 
accessibility and other features that 
will enable it to provide a valuable 
economic role in the locality and 
region, and is both designated for, 
and likely to be very attractive to, 
employment uses at this stage of its 
development. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
considered by the Applicant and CCS 
to be a less appropriate site for the 
Project than the site selected. 
 
 
 
 
 
* CCS is currently in 
the process of 
preparing a new

Note that the 
allocations are

One comment states that they 
were unaware of the project 
proposals until they received 
this booklet. 
Prior 
to 
Phase 
1 
statutory 
consultation, APL held non-statutory 
exhibitions in Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed on 19th – 21st June 2014, in 
order to raise awareness of the 
Project and provide opportunity for 
local feedback to shape the Project 
from an early stage.  
The exhibitions were advertised to the 
local community via a number of 
different means prior to the first 
exhibition.  A letter of introduction 
about the Project and an invitation to 
attend the public exhibitions was sent 
to approximately 5,500 households 
and businesses in the immediate 
vicinity of the Project Site.  At the 
same time, APL launched a Project 
website to provide technical and 
environmental information on the 
Project.  Posters advertising the 
consultation events were displayed at

Project team attended the exhibitions 
and were available to discuss the 
Project with attendees and answer 
questions (see Appendix 4.D of the

their support would be very 
slim and negative. 
APL provided a range of consultation 
materials during Phase 1 statutory

Phase 2 
Consultation 
(2018) 
One comment states that there 
will be little benefit to the 
community in the longer term. 
The 
Project 
would 
contribute 
materially to the immediate and 
medium term needs for flexible, 
reliable, peak load power generation 
and facilitate the transition to a low 
carbon economy, which is identified 
as an urgent need in national 
government policy, as explained in 
the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1.0).   
The construction and operation of the 
Project would benefit both the local 
and Welsh economy, as explained in 
the 
socio-economic 
assessment 
(Chapter 14 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)).  It is estimated that 
the 
construction 
period, 
lasting 
approximately 25 months*, would 
support 78** temporary construction 
job 
years, 
equivalent 
to 
eight 
permanent FTE construction jobs.

APL has assessed the impacts of the 
Project and has had regard to these 
when deciding on the application 
boundary of the Project. Where land 
may be injuriously affected by the 
Project during construction and / or 
operation, the PA 2008 provides that 
compensation may be payable.

Chapter 8 of the ES (Document

has 
identified 
ecological designated sites, habitats, 
species or ecosystems which may be 
affected by the Project and assessed 
the likelihood of significant effects.  
No residual significant effects have 
been identified for each component of 
the Project, or the Project as whole 
due to the embedded mitigation 
inherent within the design but also the 
application of additional mitigation 
where required. 
At least 10 species of bat were 
recorded foraging and/or commuting

One 
comment 
asks 
with 
regards to the wider UK 
economy: who makes the gas 
turbines, 
alternator 
sets,

There are a number of different 
manufacturers 
who 
make 
these 
pieces of equipment. APL has not 
selected the manufacturers for the 
construction of the Project and will 
hold a tender process prior to 
construction. 
 
One comment states the use of 
an OCGT  is not best available 
technique, particularly on a 
plant of this scale. Since the 
plant 
proposal 
is 
more 
indicative of a mid-merit plant 
than a peaking plant, CCGT 
should be the preferred option 
in my opinion. In view of 
proposed nearby sustainable 
village plans, the use of CHP 
should not be disregarded. 
Chapter 5 of the ES (Document 
Reference 
6.1) 
explains 
the 
alternatives 
that 
have 
been 
considered as part of the Project, 
including consideration of CHP and 
the following alternative technology 
options: OCGT  plant; Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; and 
Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) 
plant. 
 
The ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
explains that OCGT  is considered to 
be the most suitable technology 
choice for generating up to 299 MW 
as a peaking plant at the Project Site 
based on the following environmental,

considerations: visual impact; water 
resources; noise and available space; 
financial considerations; and start-up 
times. 
CHP has been considered alongside 
other Project alternatives from the 
outset of the Project; however it has 
been 
concluded 
that 
there 
are 
prohibitive barriers to the application 
of CHP at the Project Site, as there is 
no existing regional heat market, and 
the intermittent and unpredictable 
peaking modes of operation of OCGT  
are incompatible with the likely 
continuous demands of heat users. A 
CHP Technical Note has been 
prepared 
and 
is 
contained 
in 
Appendix 5.1 of the ES (Document

site requires both accesses (a 
front and a back door) capable 
of supporting the weight of the

Proposed Gas Fired Power Plant at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea - Statutory 
Consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act - Network Rail Consultation 
Response
Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
I refer to your letter dated 8th October 2014 in respect of the statutory consultation being undertaken in relation to the 
proposed construction and operation of a gas fired power plant on land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea. 
 
The following outlines Network Rail’s comments: 
 
Network Rail is the statutory undertaker responsible for maintaining and operating the country’s railway infrastructure 
and associated estate.  It owns, operates, maintains and develops the main rail network.   
 
Network Rail’s physical railway infrastructure must be protected and new development must ensure that it does not 
have an adverse affect upon the safety of the railway line.  Network Rail would have strong concerns if, during the 
construction or operation of the power generation plant, abnormal loads would use routes that include Network Rail 
assets (e.g. level crossings, bridges, tunnels etc).  Should any Network Rail infrastructure be affected a strategy must 
be agreed to protect our assets from potential damage caused by any abnormal loads in association with the 
implementation and operation of the Abergelli Power Project.  I would also advise that where damage, injury or delay 
to the rail network is caused by abnormal load (related to the development), Abergelli Power Limited or relevant 
contractors would incur full liability.  
 
In this respect I note that Figure 2.1 Revision A within the ‘Abergelli Power Project - Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report – Figures’ (September 2014) and Figure 5.1 of the ‘Non-Technical Summary of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report’ (Sept 2014) show two access route options to the proposed power station, both of 
which pass over Llangyfelach Rail Tunnel via either the B4489 or Pant-Iasau Road, to the north of 
Llangyfelach.  Mindful of this careful consideration should be given to whether the number and loading of vehicles 
(both construction and operational) accessing the power plant via either of these routes will have any detrimental 
impact upon the structural integrity of the Llangyfelach Tunnel.  Clarification is also sought with regard to whether 
either of the identified access roads to the power plant will require any alteration or reinforcement where they pass 
over the tunnel.  Accordingly, to mitigate any risk to Network Rail’s structures, Abergelli Power Limited must contact 
Network Rail’s Asset Protection Team (assetprotectionwales@networkrail.co.uk) well in advance of commencing any 
works. 
 
Any installation of cables under or over the railway, any methods of electricity transmissions across Network Rail’s 
land, or any access rights, temporary or otherwise will require the necessary property agreements to be entered into 
with our Easements and Wayleaves Team who can be contacted on easements&wayleaves@networkrail.co.uk . 
Please note that Network Rail will seek protection from the exercise of compulsory purchase powers over operational 
land whether for permanent or temporary purposes. 
 
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you require any further information in relation to the above.  
 
I would be grateful if you could confirm receipt of this email.

Mr Norman Campbell – Project Director 
Abergelli Power Limited 
 
[By Email: info@abergellipower.co.uk] 
 
6 November 2014 
  
Dear Mr Campbell 
 
Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent to 
the National Grid compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN 
 
Consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended 
 
Thank you for your consultation letter of 8 October 2014 seeking the views of The Coal 
Authority on the above proposal. 
 
The Coal Authority is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change.  As a statutory consultee, The Coal Authority has a duty to 
respond to planning applications and development plans in order to protect the public and 
the environment in mining areas. 
 
The Coal Authority Response:  
 
I have reviewed the proposals and Preliminary Environmental Information Report and 
confirm that the site of this proposed Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project falls within 
the defined Development High Risk Area and area of surface coal resource; therefore 
within the application site and surrounding area there are coal mining features and 
hazards which need to be considered in relation to the determination of this project.  Given 
the presence of surface coal resources, we would also expect due consideration to be 
afforded to the potential for prior extraction of the mineral resource in line with the 
requirements of Minerals Planning Policy Wales, paragraph 13. 
 
The Coal Authority records indicate that parts of the proposed application site have been 
subject to both recorded and likely historic unrecorded underground coal mining at shallow 
depth.  There are also two recorded mine entries either within or immediately adjacent to 
the proposed red line boundary. 
 
 
Protecting the public and the environment in coal mining areas 
 
2
 
The Coal Authority is therefore pleased to note that Chapter 10 of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report on Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology has 
been informed by a desk based review of coal mining and geological information.  This 
review is informed by a Coal Authority Mining Report and identifies the presence of the 
recorded mine entries, together with past underground coal mining activity at shallow 
depth.  The assessment of effects undertaken throughout Chapter 10 and summarised in 
Table 10.11 correctly identify the potential sterilisation of mineral resources (which would 
include surface coal resources) and risk of ground instability resulting from past mining 
activity as two issues for further consideration and assessment. 
 
The Preliminary Environmental Information Report includes appropriate recommendations 
for intrusive site investigation works prior to commencement of development in order to 
assess the viability of prior extraction of mineral resources and to confirm ground 
conditions and to identify any necessary remedial measures to ensure the safety and 
stability of the proposed development.  The report confirms that these investigations 
and/or remedial measures would be made a Requirement of the Development Consent 
Order. 
 
The Coal Authority would be satisfied with the desk based review work and conclusions of 
the PEIR with respect to coal mining legacy and ground conditions being carried forward 
into the Environmental Statement that accompanies the future Development Consent 
Order application. 
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to discuss this matter further. 
 
Yours sincerely

General Information for the Applicant 
 
Where development is proposed over areas of coal and past coal workings at shallow 
depth, The Coal Authority is of the opinion that applicants should consider wherever 
possible removing the remnant shallow coal.  This will enable the land to be stabilised and 
treated by a more sustainable method; rather than by attempting to grout fill any voids and 
consequently unnecessarily sterilising the nation’s asset.  Prior extraction of surface coal 
requires an Incidental Coal Agreement from The Coal Authority.  Further information can 
be found at: https://www.gov.uk/get-a-licence-for-coal-mining  
 
Under the Coal Industry Act 1994 any intrusive activities, including initial site investigation 
boreholes, and/or any subsequent treatment of coal mine workings/coal mine entries for 
ground stability purposes require the prior written permission of The Coal Authority, since 
 
 
Protecting the public and the environment in coal mining areas

such activities can have serious public health and safety implications.  Failure to obtain 
permission will result in trespass, with the potential for court action.  In the event that you 
are proposing to undertake such work in the Forest of Dean local authority area our 
permission may not be required; it is recommended that you check with us prior to 
commencing any works.  Application forms for Coal Authority permission and further 
guidance can be obtained from The Coal Authority’s website at: 
https://www.gov.uk/get-a-permit-to-deal-with-a-coal-mine-on-your-property   
 
Disclaimer 
 
The above consultation response is provided by The Coal Authority as a Statutory 
Consultee and is based upon the latest available coal mining data on the date of the 
response, and electronic consultation records held by The Coal Authority since 1 April 
2013.  The comments made are also based upon only the information provided to The 
Coal Authority by the Local Planning Authority and/or has been published on the Council's 
website for consultation purposes in relation to this specific planning application.  The 
views and conclusions contained in this response may be subject to review and 
amendment by The Coal Authority if additional or new data/information (such as a revised 
Coal Mining Risk Assessment) is provided by the Local Planning Authority or the Applicant 
for consultation purposes.

Thank you for your letter of 8 October 2014 regarding the proposed 50-299 MW 
Gas Fired Power Plant project at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  
 
It is noted that this letter and accompanying documentation (namely the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report dated September 2014 (PEIR)), 
comprises consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. We are a 
prescribed consultee under the Act.  
 
Our purpose is to ensure that the environment and natural resources of Wales are 
sustainably maintained, enhanced and used, now and in the future. Our functions 
are set out in the Natural Resources Body for Wales (Functions) Order 2012. Our 
advice and comments are therefore provided in the context of this remit.  
 
We note the information may be subject to further update and revision and the full 
results of the various technical studies undertaken will be provided in the 
Environmental Statement (ES), which will be submitted alongside the 
Development Consent Order (DCO) application. On this basis, we reserve the 
right to make further comments and representations during the course of the 
proposed application, as may be required. The comments herein are therefore 
without prejudice to any future comments which may be provided by us in relation 
to future submissions. 
 
The operation of this development gives rise to Combustion Activities under Part 
A1 (a) of Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Environmental Permit Regulations 2010 and we 
are the determining authority for an Environmental Permit for such activity. The 
Environmental Permit is determined under distinct and separate legislation and our 
comments in relation to the PEIR are independent and without prejudice to any

ANNEX 1 
Natural Resources Wales’ Comments 
Section 42 consultation by Abergelli Power Limited 
 
Abergelli Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report  
(PB Reference: 287521A; PINS Reference: EN010069)  
 
A. Chapter 2 Project and Site Description 
 
A.1. Waste Arisings 
 
A.1.1. Section 2.9 of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) 
states that there is good provision for all types of waste arising from the project 
(with Neath Port Talbot being the coordinating authority). We would highlight that 
contaminated excavation material and hazardous wastes outlets, should they be 
required, are likely to be outside of the County Borough. Therefore, it would be 
prudent to ensure that appropriate measures and outlets exist should they be 
necessary as part of the project and following further testing and investigation as 
part of the Environmental Statement (ES). 
 
B. Chapter 6 Air Quality 
 
B. 1. Environmental Permitting Requirements - early dialogue with NRW and 
submission of EPR application 
 
B. 1.1. Whilst the Secretary of State (SoS) and ourselves have recommended that 
you submit an application or an EPR1 permit prior to submission of the DCO 
application, you have stated that this is not your intention. In fact you have stated 
‘The Environmental Permit application will be submitted 12 months prior to the 
commencement of commercial operations.’ Whilst we respect this decision, we will 
not be in a position to fully assess many aspects of the proposal until the EPR 
permit application has been submitted and assessed. This does add complexities 
to the process which could be avoided with parallel applications. 
 
B.1.2. We refer you to The Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note Eleven: Working 
with public bodies in the infrastructure planning process – Annex D: Environment 
Agency, which under the Environmental Permitting section states that  ‘Applicants 
are encouraged to “twin track” environmental permit applications to the 
Environment Agency with their DCO applications to the Planning Inspectorate in 
order to facilitate timely decision-making.’ Please note that the ‘Environment 
Agency’ should be read as ‘Natural Resources Wales’. 
 
B.1.3. In the light of your intention to submit an EPR application at some future 
date we must advise you that we cannot rule out the possibility that further 
information (such as additional monitoring or assessments) may be required 
during the EPR permit determination process.  
 
                                            
1 Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 
 
 
4 
B.1.4. We would highlight that an EPR permit cannot be predetermined and that 
many aspects of the plant’s design and operation will be assessed as part of the 
EPR permitting process.   
 
B. 2. Technology selection - Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
 
B.2.1. As stated previously we believe that an open (simple) cycle gas turbine 
(GT) operation would not usually be considered to represent Best Available 
Technique (BAT). You state that you will endeavour to address this concern as 
part of the ES submission. However this issue may only be resolved at the EPR 
permit application determination stage where a full BAT assessment will be 
undertaken.  
 
B.3. Technology Selection – Combined Heat & Power (CHP) Utilisation 
 
B.3.1. You have stated that the proposal would not be suitable for CHP utilisation 
a robust justification to support this statement should be included in future 
submissions. In the event that justifications were accepted, then the facility will still 
need to be designed as a CHP- ready unit. 
 
B.4. Air Quality 
 
B.4.1. You state that you have followed Environment Agency document Horizontal 
Guidance Note H1 – Annex F: Air Emissions2. Annex F sets distances for 
consideration of conservation sites, criteria for screening out insignificant 
emissions and in Appendix C a suggested structure for a detailed air quality 
modelling assessment for EPR application. We note that you have also used the 
Air Pollution Information System (APIS) in your habitats impact assessment (this is 
further discussed below). 
 
B.4.2. Section 6.2.14 of the PEIR states that ‘as a peaking plant, the operation of 
the Generating Equipment will be limited through the permitting regime to 1,500 
hours per annum. The assessment is, therefore, based on the operation of the 
Generating Equipment, at full load, for 1,500 hours per annum. For the purposes 
of the air quality assessment this intermittent operation is assessed by assuming 
full load, continuous operation (to ensure worst case meteorological impacts are 
included in the model) and scaling the outputs for periods longer than one hour by 
likely operating hours i.e. 1500 out of a possible 8760 hours for annual mean 
impacts. No scaling is applied to hourly impacts to ensure a conservative 
approach, since it is possible that the operation of the Generating Equipment will 
coincide with poor dispersion conditions.’ 
 
B.4.3. Factoring the long-term predictions by operating hours is a methodology 
that is generally acceptable when there is sufficient headroom such that the 
uncertainties involved are unlikely to make a significant difference to predictions. 
In this case you acknowledge that critical loads at nearby habitats are already 
exceeded, therefore there is little headroom. Without further work we cannot 
                                            
2 H1 Annex F – Air Emissions, v2.2 December 2011 (Environment Agency) 
 
 
5 
comment on whether this methodology is a “worst case” approach. We would 
expect you to justify that your assessment is representative of a worst case 
scenario. 
 
B.4.4. Section 6.10.13 refers to a slight adverse effect on air quality during 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power station with mitigation 
stated as monitoring of emissions. Monitoring is not considered to be mitigation, as 
the pollutant may still be released. What additional mitigation can be employed to 
prevent the adverse effects in the first place? 
 
B.4.5. Generally speaking, the PEIR has followed an assessment methodology 
that is appropriate in regards to air quality impact assessment. We have not 
completed a detailed assessment and therefore cannot comment on the predicted 
impact. It should also be noted that we cannot rule out the possibility that further 
information may be required during a detailed risk impact assessment audit at the 
application stage for an EPR permit.  
 
B.5. Air Quality - Nature Conservation Interests 
 
B.5.1. For all Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within at least 2 km, and all 
Special Area of Conservation (SAC)/Special Protection Areas (SPA)/Ramsar sites 
within 10km of the proposed plant, information should be included in the ES as 
follows; 
 
B.5.2. Concentrations of NOx (and SO2 if present in emissions) emitted by the 
proposed plant compared to the critical levels for sensitive habitats at the above 
sites.   
 
B.5.3. Critical Levels are to be found on APIS  
(http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/issues/overview_Cloadslevels.htm#_Toc2797880
54 ).  
 
B.5.4. Proposed plant emissions (Process Contribution/PC) should be compared 
as a percentage of the relevant critical level as well being compared to the PC 
added to the background (PEC), to give percentage figures. 
 
B.5.5. Levels of nutrient Nitrogen deposition and Acid deposition derived from the 
proposed plant (PC) should also be compared to site relevant critical loads for the 
above sites.  These are available on APIS (http://www.apis.ac.uk/srcl) and should 
be similarly compared to the PC and PEC for each feature's most sensitive critical 
load value, to give percentage values. 
 
B.5.6. Instructions on how to carry out these calculations for acid deposition are 
available 
on 
APIS 
(http://www.apis.ac.uk/critical-load-function-tool) 
and 
in 
Environment Agency AQ TAG Paper 06 for nutrient Nitrogen deposition.  Please 
note that in relation to a Peaking Power facility which operates sporadically, the 
assessment must be done as a worst case scenario i.e. the maximum number of 
hours that the plant will be able to operate, over a year.     
 
 
 
6 
B.6. Habitats Regulations Assessment 
 
B.6.1. We advise that a Shadow Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) should 
be recorded by yourselves (as per PINS guidance Note 10).  The HRA should test 
the likely significant effects of the development for all relevant receptor SAC, SPA 
and Ramsar sites, in light of impact pathways from the development itself (for 
example aerial emissions).  These effects should be tested alone and if no likely 
significant effects concluded for a particular impact pathway on a site(s) alone, in-
combination effects should then be tested for those parameters, according to any 
residual effects from this development and other relevant plans/projects.  
Guidance is available for competent authorities in recording HRAs (Assessing 
Projects Under The Habitats Directive - Guidance For Competent Authorities, 
CCW, 2011) and this may aid in recording a shadow HRA, in terms of main 
guiding principles of the HRA process.  The guidance sets out the principles of the 
in-combination test as described above, including which plans/projects to consider 
within the in-combination test.  Any likely significant effects identified should lead 
to the recording of a shadow Appropriate Assessment (or Report to Inform an 
Appropriate Assessment, or similar) to assess such effects further.  The above 
guidance is available at the following URL (please note that this guidance has not 
been updated since 2011);

assessment/habitats-regulations-assessmen.aspx 
 
C. Chapter 7 Noise and Vibration 
 
C.1. Noise- General Comments 
 
C.1.1. Whilst the PEIR submission states that the noise monitoring locations were 
agreed with us and the Local Authority, we note that we do not appear to have 
been in dialogue with the consultants in regards to this matter. 
 
 
C.1.2. The ambient noise survey was conducted in accordance with the relevant 
standards but key frequency data is omitted from the report which was requested 
by the SoS and confirmed to be captured by the contractor. The PEIR outlines that 
at each identified Nearest Sensitive Receptor location the sound level is predicted 
to range between 40 dB to 47 dB LAeq which would result in a major noise impact 
at the receptor locations. These figures have been produced without factoring in 
any mitigation. What mitigation is planned to attenuate this increase in noise 
against the current background? Will each of the measures being proposed 
reduce the noise levels to an acceptable level? We have not had access to the 
modelling files to agree the figures suggested in the PEIR. 
 
C.1.3. Increased noise levels are likely to be perceived during start-up. What 
levels are likely above background and how will this be mitigated? 
 
 
 
7 
C.2. Noise- Ambient Noise Survey Report 
 
C.2.1. Section 2.1.1 states that the survey was undertaken to quantify existing 
noise levels at nearest sensitive receptors. We were expecting a tonal assessment 
to be carried out in tandem with the noise survey. This was specified in our letter 
dated 22 July 2014 sent by us (ref SH/2014/116929/01) and confirmed by you. 
 
C.2.2. Slight and minor adverse effects are predicted at sensitive receptors during 
the construction phase of the project. The LAeq seems to be significantly higher 
than the LA90 at each of the sensitive receptors. The proposed mitigation to this is 
site hoarding to mask the activities. Will this afford any real mitigation against the 
increased noise levels other than removing direct line of sight? 
 
C.2.3. Section 2.1.2 states that ‘short-term sampling measurements were 
conducted...in order to capture the existing ambient noise level representative of 
that particular period’. You should explain why you feel a 30 minute sample which 
covered a 24 hour period would be representative to suggest that the sound was 
stable and not fluctuating.  
 
C.2.4. Additionally in section 2.1.2 it states that 3 day; 1 evening and 2 night 
samples will be taken. We would question this statement, it would appear the 
actual sampling undertaken was 2 day; 1 evening and 1 night for each nearest 
sensitive receptor. 
 
C.3. Noise- Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
C.3.1. Section 7.2.2 of the PEIR states that “The assessment methodologies used 
in the PEIR are the same as those that will be adopted for the EIA. However, the 
level of detail available at the PEIR stage is only sufficient to form preliminary 
conclusions and more detailed information will be required for the EIA.” You state 
that you have followed the BS 4142 methodology. BS 4142 assesses the 
likelihood of complaints by subtracting the measured background noise level from 
the rating level predictions at sensitive receptors. In order to conduct a robust BS 
4142 assessment, representative background LA90 noise levels are required at 
sensitive receptors. The noise monitoring survey should therefore be conducted 
over a sufficient time period to determine typical background levels under all 
operational scenarios (days, nights, weekdays and weekends). Additionally 
measurements should be taken over relevant reference time intervals. Please note 
that BS 4142 is currently being revised and the new version is likely to be 
published soon. When conducting the noise survey and noise impact assessment 
it is appropriate to follow the most recently published British Standards. 
 
C.3.2. In section 7.2.1 there is no reference to Environment Agency’s horizontal 
guidance note for noise. 
 
C.3.3. It is recommended that an overview of ‘A Noise Action Plan for Wales 2013-
2018’ is provided in the relevant policy and guidance section with particular 
emphasis on the importance of ‘sustainable development principles’ and ‘creeping 
background’. 
 
 
8 
 
C.3.4. Section 7.3.3 of the PEIR states that ‘discussions were held with CCS and 
NRW in August 2014 to agree a study area, a noise survey methodology, and 
suitable locations for the survey measurement positions’. We would question 
whether we were consulted on this.  
 
C.3.5. In section 7.3.4 there is an exclusion of a tonal assessment (please see our 
earlier comment on this matter). 
 
C.3.6. In Table 7.5, there are references to “Bergelli farm” and these continue 
throughout the report. We presume this should be Abergelli . 
 
C.3.7. In section 7.3.6 there is a reference to weather data and this was raised in 
the review of the ‘Ambient Noise Survey Report’. We would like confirmation of 
how weather data was collected. 
 
C.3.8. Please note that will not comment on construction/decommissioning or off 
site traffic noise - this is a role for the Local Authority. 
 
C.3.9. In Table 7.9 there is reference to ‘slight adverse’ effects but it is unclear 
whether you are referring to ‘minor adverse’ effects specified in Table 7.4 above. 
There is no justification as to why the sound levels from the gas and electrical 
connections are thought to be negligible.  
 
C.3.10. When submitting a noise impact assessment, as part of the permit 
application for an EPR permit, you should refer to Environment Agency document 
Noise Impact Assessment - Information Requirements 3 to inform yourselves of 
the expected requirements for a noise impact assessment submission. 
 
C.4. Preliminary Stack Sensitivity Analysis (PSSA) 
 
C.4.1. We have not assessed the PSSA submitted as part of the PEIR. A detailed 
assessment will be undertaken as part of the EPR permit application process 
which will determine the appropriate stack height required for appropriate 
environmental control. We note that section 4.9.4 states that ‘Air quality sensitivity 
tests have indicated that a minimum stack height of 35m will be required for 
adequate dispersion of exhaust gases and to meet legislative air quality targets 
(i.e. IED)’. We also note that ‘a maximum height of 40m has been assumed for the 
purpose of the Landscape and Visual Impact and Cultural Heritage Assessments 
as a ‘realistic worst-case scenario’.  
 
C.4.2. However we do note that in the PEIR the consultant has used significance 
criteria set out in H1 Annex F. The consultant considered the impact of NOx and 
nitrogen deposition, and reference was made to acidification, but it is unclear if this 
was taken into account. This will need to be addressed when the permit 
application is submitted. 
 
 
 
9 
D. Chapter 8 Ecology 
 
D.1. Habitats 
 
D.1.1. We note that the final design of the project is still to be decided and habitat 
losses and impacts on protected species will be fully assessed when the design is 
finalised in the ES.  
 
D.1.2. We reiterate our comments made previously that we would welcome further 
justification if the final location for the Generating Equipment Site and Temporary 
Laydown Area is decided to be on an area of marshy grassland (also known as 
Purple moorgrass and rush pasture), and why it cannot be located on areas of 
improved grassland, which would be less ecologically damaging. Marshy 
grassland is a habitat listed under section 42 of the Natural Environmental and 
Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006 and under the City and County of Swansea’s 
(CCS) Local Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. CCS have a duty under section 
40 of the NERC Act, to have regard to conserving biodiversity; and therefore we 
advise that CCS’s Ecologist is consulted regarding section 42 habitats and species 
in order to take account of possible adverse effects on such interests.  
 
D.1.3. We advise that the predicted habitat losses should be quantified in the ES.  
This is particularly important when working with CCS’s Ecologist to agree a 
mitigation/compensation scheme. 
 
D.1.4. We note the references to section 2.13 of the PEIR and embedded 
mitigation throughout section 8 Ecology; however there is not sufficient reference 
to ecological mitigation and monitoring in Section 2.13.   
 
D.1.5. In section 2.11.1 Table 2.1 Access Road Comparison table, we would 
suggest the ecological impact considerations are also included in this table. 
 
D.1.6. We also refer to our previous comments in our scoping response letter in 
relation to the watercourses and wetland habitats and their associated species and 
advise that further consultation with ourselves is carried out before detailed site 
layout plans are drawn up and submitted at draft ES stage.  
 
D.2. Access 
 
D.2.1. We note the project is looking at two access options.  Option one would 
result in some habitat losses to Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC) through road widening.  Option two would also result in habitat losses, but 
to a greater extent.  The losses resulting from option two would result in 
permanent loss of ancient woodland which cannot be mitigated.   
 
D.2.2. We note that there has already been a significant loss of woodland in this 
area as a result of industrial development and that the remaining woodland on and 
around the site was reclassified as Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites 
(PAWS) under the Ancient Woodland Inventory (AWI) dataset in 2011. Section 
5.2.9 of Planning Policy Wales Chapter 5: Conserving and Improving Natural 
 
 
10 
Heritage and the Coast states that ‘Trees, woodlands and hedgerows are of great 
importance, both as wildlife habitats and in terms of their contribution to landscape 
character and beauty. They also play a role in tackling climate change by trapping 
carbon and can provide a sustainable energy source. Local planning authorities 
should seek to protect trees, groups of trees and areas of woodland where they 
have natural heritage value or contribute to the character or amenity of a particular 
locality. Ancient and semi-natural woodlands are irreplaceable habitats of high 
biodiversity value which should be protected from development that would result in 
significant damage.’ We advise that any proposed loss of woodland should be 
avoided.  
 
D.2.3. Once the final access route has been selected, should the route require any 
road widening/improvements, we advise that further survey work is carried out on 
the external access roads which have not been included in the Phase 1 habitat 
survey and possible subsequent protected species survey work.   
 
D.3. Peat 
 
D.3.1. We are pleased to see a reference to a Peat Management Plan and further 
ground investigations to determine the potential loss of peat, which will be a 
requirement of the DCO. 
 
D.4. Invasive Species 
 
D.4.1. With reference to invasive species found on the site, we note that five 
invasive species have been found.  Section 8.3.22 describes invasive species 
identified during the site surveys. We advise that appropriate measures must be 
implemented for the removal or long-term management of the identified invasive 
species on site. Japanese Knotweed is classed as controlled waste under the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 and as such must be disposed of in a suitable 
manner. 
 
D.5. Species 
 
D.5.1. We note that all the standard ecological surveys have been carried out; 
however analysis of some of the surveys is still being carried out and the final 
design is yet to be decided therefore we will not be providing detailed comments 
on the impacts at this stage.  We would be happy to provide comments on the 
survey work and results prior to the draft ES stage should you wish to consult us. 
 
D.6. Otters 
 
D.6.1. Ecological conditions can change over the short term, we would 
recommend regularly re-surveying for otters in the watercourse where an otter 
spraint was found and the watercourses identified as having potential to support 
otters. 
 
 
 
11 
D.7. Watervoles 
 
D.7.1. The details of the watervole survey in the PEIR Appendix appear to be 
inconclusive as to whether there are water voles on site. The surveys found no 
signs of recent activity but there was suitable habitat and holes. At the time of 
writing the report there were only historic watervole records from 1996 available 
for the River Llan but an active population of watervoles has recently been found 
downstream at Penllergaer. We would recommend that further watervole surveys 
are carried out in May when the voles are very active. 
 
D.7.2. Protection and enhancement of suitable watervole habitat on site will be an 
important mitigation measure which we would like to discuss further in the future 
when detailed plans for the development are being considered.  
 
E. Chapter 9 Water Quality and Resources 
 
E.1.1. A number of ordinary watercourses cross the site and a small section runs 
adjacent to the Main River Llan. 
 
E.1.2. We note that a flood consequences assessment (FCA) will be produced for 
the development and we advise that this should assess the impact of the 
development upon the flood risk associated with both the ordinary watercourses 
which cross the site, and the main River Llan, to ensure that it is compliant with 
TAN15. Any FCA should consider both risk to the development itself and 
demonstrate any consequences to third parties.  
 
E.1.3. We advise that you consults with the City and County of Swansea Council’s 
Drainage Engineers with regards to flood risk associated with the ordinary 
watercourses crossing the site. 
 
E.1.4. Section 9 of the PEIR indicates that a site drainage plan will be discussed at 
a high level in the Environmental Statement and may incorporate sustainable 
drainage systems (SUDS). We would advise that SUDS should be implemented 
where possible, subject to ground conditions, in accordance with Section 8 of 
TAN15.  
 
E.1.5. If any proposed route crossings or any works on site are likely to affect the 
main river, then relevant Flood Defence Consents may be required, along with 
detailed method statements that incorporate pollution prevention and mitigation 
e.g. to prevent the accidental introduction of solid matter to the water course via 
excavation; diversion of the watercourse; dewatering; run-off etc. Any works in, 
under, over or within 7m from the main River Llan will require prior consent from 
us. For ordinary watercourses, you should consult the Lead Local Flood Authority 
(LLFA) which in this instance is the City and County of Swansea Council, though 
we would expect the same level of protection to be applied with regard to pollution 
prevention and mitigation.  
 
E.1.6. Section 9.2.10 of the PEIR points out the limitations of this report given the 
current absence of a hydrogeological survey. It is not possible therefore, to make 
 
 
12 
an informed assessment of likely impact and whether any proposed mitigation is 
appropriate to protect ground and surface waters at this stage.  
 
E.1.7. We note that detail relating to discharge from the power generation plant 
has not been provided. If any cooling waters/process waters are proposed to be 
discharged to the receiving waters (River Llan and its tributaries/River 
Lliw/Loughor), this will require a Water Discharge Activity Permit as part of the 
EPR. We advise that further detail is provided in the ES in relation to the discharge 
characteristics (with particular regards to temperature and chemical composition) 
of any cooling/process waters upon the above watercourses in order to assess 
any offsite environmental impact. 
 
E.2. WFD Compliance Assessment 
 
E.2.1. Section 9.2.6 of the PEIR states that a WFD report is unlikely to be 
required. We advise that a screening assessment should be undertaken as part of 
the ES.   New or changed river crossings should also be included in any screening 
assessment. If potential impact on WFD compliance is concluded, then a formal 
WFD assessment should be undertaken.  
 
E.3. Construction Activities 
 
E.3.1. The applicant should fully assess any ground instability and should be 
satisfied that piling operations and any vibration associated with the construction 
process will not disturb or cause any fracturing of the Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water 
main that traverses the proposed site. This water main augments the drinking 
water supply as far east as Cardiff and so it is of strategic importance in South 
Wales. The same consideration is needed in relation to disturbance of any historic 
mine workings, adits, or groundwater. 
 
E.3.2. Dust/debris is to be controlled by wheel washing facilities and damping 
down. EPR permits are likely to be required for both of these activities if you 
generate effluent that will be discharged to surface or ground waters.   If water for 
these activities is be sourced via abstraction rather than potable supply then an 
EPR permit maybe required. 
  
E.3.3. Any dewatering as part of construction activities is likely to require an EPR 
permit. 
 
E.3.4. Section 5.6.3 refers to the assumed connection to the Swansea North 
Substation. If this is not permissible, we advise that the alternatives are submitted 
and discussed. 
 
F. Chapter 10 Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology 
 
F.1. We note that there have previously been two landfills within the planning 
development boundary and that both sites now fall outside our regulation. 
 
 
 
13 
F.2. A contaminated land risk assessment should be undertaken as part of the ES. 
You are advised to contact the local authority to agree the scope of the 
assessment as they are the lead authority for land quality. 
 
G. Chapter 11 Landscape and Visual Impacts 
 
G.1. Scope of the assessment  
 
G.1.1. There does not appear to be any evidence presented on the consideration 
of alternative sites for the power generation plant. We advise that this should be 
included in the EIA. 
 
G.1.2. A 15km study area is considered acceptable for the Zone of Theoretical 
Visibility (ZTV) based on a maximum 40m stack height.  
 
G.1.3. In order to ‘scope out’ impacts on the Gower AONB and Brecon Beacons 
National Park, it would be helpful to provide single frame photographs at A3 size 
from viewpoints within these designations and within the 15km study area. This 
would help to demonstrate whether there are likely to be significant effects on 
these designations.    
 
G.2. Photomontages  
 
G.2.1. We would recommend that the photomontages (when selected) include 
single frame extracts from the panoramas (40 degree angle of view), reproduced 
at A3 size. These can be held up in the field and can reasonably demonstrate the 
level of detail seen with the eye. The panoramas help to provide context.  
 
G.3. LANDMAP & Landscape Sensitivity  
 
G.3.1. Table 11.2 and 11.3 descriptions should recognise that these are typical 
features of the various category of sensitivity and not definitive e.g. landscapes not 
recognised by designations are not necessarily of low sensitivity. The level of 
sensitivity depends on the character of the landscape and the nature of the 
proposal. This is set out in Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (GLVIA3) 2013.   
 
G.4. Landscape Character Assessment  
 
G.4.1. The landscape character areas illustrated on figure 11.3 appear to be the 
visual and sensory aspect areas taken from LANDMAP. This should be clarified.  
The assessment of landscape character sensitivity appears to only consider the 
visual and sensory aspect and not all five aspects. The overall evaluation used in 
the Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) only relates to the visual and 
sensory aspect. The overall evaluation for the geological, historical, cultural and 
habitats aspects vary within the site from high to outstanding.  
 
G.4.2. The assessment of landscape character and sensitivity should consider 
information from all five aspect areas, not only the visual and sensory aspect 
 
 
14 
areas. As well as the overall evaluation for each aspect, the rarity/uniqueness 
evaluation for  Geological Landscape, the connectivity/cohesion evaluation for 
Landscape Habitats, the scenic quality and character evaluation for Visual and 
Sensory and the rarity and group value for Historic Landscape and Cultural 
Landscape should be taken account of. Landscape character derives from all five 
aspects within LANDMAP. If the character assessment does not consider all 5 
aspects it is likely to be flawed.   
 
G.5. Selection of viewpoints and visual receptors  
 
G.5.1. It is unclear why houses in Llangefelach are not considered in the 
residential visual receptors when the information states that there are views of the 
site from the village.  
 
G.6. Lighting  
 
G.6.1.The LVIA should include an assessment of the visual effects of lighting e.g. 
the potential need for airport hazard lights.  
 
G.7. Construction Environmental Management Plan  
 
G.7.1. This should include proposals for the protection and storage of soils and the 
restoration of compounds and disturbed areas. Restoration should be appropriate 
to the surrounding landscape.  
 
G.8. Mitigation  
 
G.8.1. There is currently very little information on the opportunities for mitigation. 
The area of land owned or available to you will influence the amount and 
effectiveness of mitigation and needs to be considered at the outset. There may 
be opportunities for advance planting. If insufficient land is available for mitigation 
the significance of effects is likely to be higher, therefore this has a direct effect on 
the potential acceptability of the proposals.  
 
G.9. Cumulative assessment  
 
G.9.1. A number of other wind farm and solar energy proposals have been 
approved and should be taken into account in the cumulative assessment, along 
with the other existing and planned development in the locality (e.g. Proposed 
Felindre Business Park and Sustainable Urban Village).  
 
G.9.2. Wind farms/turbines within the 15km study area include: Mynydd y Betws 
(operational), Mynydd y Gwair, Mynydd y Gwrhyd, Tyle Coch Mawr and Gilfach 
Renewable Energy Project (approved), Mynydd Marchywel (in planning).  
 
G.9.3. Solar farms within the 15km study area and in close proximity to the site 
include: Brynwhilach Farm (operational), Abergelli and Cefn Betingau/Rhyd-y-
Pandy (approved).  
 
 
 
15 
G.9.4. Depending on the timescale of the project, other developments may need to 
be considered and contact with the local authority is recommended in this regard.

14th November 2014 
 
 
Dear Mr Campbell, 
 
Re: Abergelli Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant project on land adjacent 
to the National Grid compressor station at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea, 
SA5 7NN 
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008, as amended 
 
As a statutory consultee, Public Health England (PHE) welcomes the opportunity to 
comment on your proposals and preliminary environmental information report (PEIR) at this 
stage of the project.  Our response focuses on health protection issues relating to chemicals 
and radiation.  Advice offered by PHE is impartial and independent. 
 
PHE, including PHE’s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (Wales), 
has evaluated the submitted PEIR (September 2014).  We note that the electric fields 
produced by the proposed new underground cables have been considered within the Report 
(Section 2.10).  However, such cables will also produce magnetic fields, which will not be 
shielded in the same way; therefore an assessment of the health impact of the magnetic 
fields should be included in the Environmental Statement (ES).  The PHE scoping response 
sent previously sets out the framework for carrying out the assessment, and a copy is 
appended to this letter. 
 
It is noted that the PEIR states that the Environmental Statement (ES) will consider the 
potential impacts on human receptors from emissions to air, noise, water quality, ground and 
soil including potential for contamination.  In addition, PHE welcomes that the forthcoming 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will cumulatively assess i.e. more than one effect 
on the same receptor, the likely significant environmental effects of the Project identified in 
the PEIR.  
 
 
 
Our Ref: 141013 366 
 
PHE will provide further comments when the ES becomes available. Should the promoter or 
their agents wish to discuss our recommendations or to seek any specific advice prior to the 
submission of the ES, PHE would of course be pleased to assist. 
 
Yours sincerely

Appendix: PHE recommendations regarding the scoping document 
General approach  
The EIA should give consideration to best practice guidance such as the Government’s 
Good Practice Guide for EIA1. It is important that the EIA identifies and assesses the 
potential public health impacts of the activities at, and emissions from, the installation. 
Assessment should consider the development, operational, and decommissioning phases. 
It is not PHE’s role to undertake these assessments on behalf of promoters as this would 
conflict with PHE’s role as an impartial and independent body. 
We note that the information provided states that there will be three associated development 
projects, but that these will be the subject of separate planning consent applications. We 
recommend that the EIA includes consideration of the impacts of associated development 
and that cumulative impacts are fully accounted for. 
Consideration of alternatives (including alternative sites, choice of process, and the phasing 
of construction) is widely regarded as good practice. Ideally, EIA should start at the stage of 
site and process selection, so that the environmental merits of practicable alternatives can 
be properly considered. Where this is undertaken, the main alternatives considered should 
be outlined in the ES2. 
The following text covers a range of issues that PHE would expect to be addressed by the 
promoter. However this list is not exhaustive and the onus is on the promoter to ensure that 
the relevant public health issues are identified and addressed. PHE’s advice and 
recommendations carry no statutory weight and constitute non-binding guidance. 
Receptors 
The ES should clearly identify the development’s location and the location and distance from 
the development of off-site human receptors that may be affected by emissions from, or 
activities at, the development. Off-site human receptors may include people living in 
residential premises; people working in commercial, and industrial premises and people 
using transport infrastructure (such as roads and railways), recreational areas, and publicly-
accessible land. Consideration should also be given to environmental receptors such as the 
surrounding land, watercourses, surface and groundwater, and drinking water supplies such 
as wells, boreholes and water abstraction points. 
Impacts arising from construction and decommissioning 
Any assessment of impacts arising from emissions due to construction and 
decommissioning should consider potential impacts on all receptors and describe monitoring 
and mitigation during these phases. Construction and decommissioning will be associated 
with vehicle movements and cumulative impacts should be accounted for. 
                                            
1 Environmental Impact Assessment: A guide to good practice and procedures - A consultation paper; 2006; Department for 
Communities and Local Government. Available from: 
http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/planningandbuilding/environmentalimpactassessment  
2 DCLG guidance, 1999 http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/155958.pdf  
We would expect the promoter to follow best practice guidance during all phases from 
construction to decommissioning to ensure appropriate measures are in place to mitigate 
any potential impact on health from emissions (point source, fugitive and traffic-related). An 
effective Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) (and Decommissioning 
Environmental Management Plan (DEMP)) will help provide reassurance that activities are 
well managed. The promoter should ensure that there are robust mechanisms in place to 
respond to any complaints of traffic-related pollution, during construction, operation, and 
decommissioning of the facility. 
Emissions to air and water 
Significant impacts are unlikely to arise from installations which employ Best Available 
Techniques (BAT) and which meet regulatory requirements concerning emission limits and 
design parameters. However, PHE has a number of comments regarding emissions in order 
that the EIA provides a comprehensive assessment of potential impacts. 
When considering a baseline (of existing environmental quality) and in the assessment and 
future monitoring of impacts these: 
 
should include appropriate screening assessments and detailed dispersion modelling 
where this is screened as necessary  
 
should encompass all pollutants which may be emitted by the installation in combination 
with all pollutants arising from associated development and transport, ideally these 
should be considered in a single holistic assessment 
 
should consider the construction, operational, and decommissioning phases 
 
should consider the typical operational emissions and emissions from start-up, shut-
down, abnormal operation and accidents when assessing potential impacts and include 
an assessment of worst-case impacts 
 
should fully account for fugitive emissions 
 
should include appropriate estimates of background levels 
 
should identify cumulative and incremental impacts (i.e. assess cumulative impacts from 
multiple sources), including those arising from associated development, other existing 
and proposed development in the local area, and new vehicle movements associated 
with the proposed development; associated transport emissions should include 
consideration of non-road impacts (i.e. rail, sea, and air) 
 
should include consideration of local authority, Environment Agency / Natural Resources 
Wales, Defra national network, and any other local site-specific sources of monitoring 
data 
 
should compare predicted environmental concentrations to the applicable standard or 
guideline value for the affected medium (such as UK Air Quality Standards and 
Objectives and Environmental Assessment Levels) 
 If no standard or guideline value exists, the predicted exposure to humans should 
be estimated and compared to an appropriate health-based value (a Tolerable 
Daily Intake or equivalent). Further guidance is provided in Annex 1 
 This should consider all applicable routes of exposure e.g. include consideration 
of aspects such as the deposition of chemicals emitted to air and their uptake via 
ingestion 
 
should identify and consider impacts on residential areas and sensitive receptors (such 
as schools, nursing homes and healthcare facilities) in the area(s) which may be affected 
by emissions, this should include consideration of any new receptors arising from future 
development 
Whilst screening of impacts using qualitative methodologies is common practice (e.g. for 
impacts arising from fugitive emissions such as dust), where it is possible to undertake a 
quantitative assessment of impacts then this should be undertaken. 
PHE’s view is that the EIA should appraise and describe the measures that will be used to 
control both point source and fugitive emissions and demonstrate that standards, guideline 
values or health-based values will not be exceeded due to emissions from the installation, as 
described above. This should include consideration of any emitted pollutants for which there 
are no set emission limits. When assessing the potential impact of a proposed installation on 
environmental quality, predicted environmental concentrations should be compared to the 
permitted concentrations in the affected media; this should include both standards for short 
and long-term exposure.  
Additional points specific to emissions to air 
When considering a baseline (of existing air quality) and in the assessment and future 
monitoring of impacts these: 
 
should include consideration of impacts on existing areas of poor air quality e.g. existing 
or proposed local authority Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) 
 
should include modelling using appropriate meteorological data (i.e. come from the 
nearest suitable meteorological station and include a range of years and worst case 
conditions) 
 
should include modelling taking into account local topography 
Additional points specific to emissions to water 
When considering a baseline (of existing water quality) and in the assessment and future 
monitoring of impacts these: 
 
should include assessment of potential impacts on human health and not focus solely on 
ecological impacts 
 
should identify and consider all routes by which emissions may lead to population 
exposure (e.g. surface watercourses; recreational waters; sewers; geological routes etc.)  
 
should assess the potential off-site effects of emissions to groundwater (e.g. on aquifers 
used for drinking water) and surface water (used for drinking water abstraction) in terms 
of the potential for population exposure 
 
should include consideration of potential impacts on recreational users (e.g. from fishing, 
canoeing etc) alongside assessment of potential exposure via drinking water 
Land quality 
We would expect the promoter to provide details of any hazardous contamination present on 
site (including ground gas) as part of the site condition report. 
Emissions to and from the ground should be considered in terms of the previous history of 
the site and the potential of the site, once operational, to give rise to issues. Public health 
impacts associated with ground contamination and/or the migration of material off-site 
should be assessed3 and the potential impact on nearby receptors and control and mitigation 
measures should be outlined.  
Relevant areas outlined in the Government’s Good Practice Guide for EIA include: 
 
effects associated with ground contamination that may already exist 
 
effects associated with the potential for polluting substances that are used (during 
construction / operation) to cause new ground contamination issues on a site, for 
example introducing / changing the source of contamination  
 
impacts associated with re-use of soils and waste soils, for example, re-use of site-
sourced materials on-site or offsite, disposal of site-sourced materials offsite, importation 
of materials to the site, etc. 
Waste 
The EIA should demonstrate compliance with the waste hierarchy (e.g. with respect to re-
use, recycling or recovery and disposal). 
For wastes arising from the installation the EIA should consider: 
 
the implications and wider environmental and public health impacts of different waste 
disposal options  
 
disposal route(s) and transport method(s) and how potential impacts on public health will 
be mitigated 
Other aspects 
Within the EIA PHE would expect to see information about how the promoter would respond 
to accidents with potential off-site emissions e.g. flooding or fires, spills, leaks or releases 
                                            
3 Following the approach outlined in the section above dealing with emissions to air and water i.e. comparing predicted 
environmental concentrations to the applicable standard or guideline value for the affected medium  (such as Soil Guideline 
Values) 
off-site. Assessment of accidents should: identify all potential hazards in relation to 
construction, operation and decommissioning; include an assessment of the risks posed; 
and identify risk management measures and contingency actions that will be employed in 
the event of an accident in order to mitigate off-site effects. 
The EIA should include consideration of the COMAH Regulations (Control of Major Accident 
Hazards) and the Major Accident Off-Site Emergency Plan (Management of Waste from 
Extractive Industries) (England and Wales) Regulations 2009: both in terms of their 
applicability to the installation itself, and the installation’s potential to impact on, or be 
impacted by, any nearby installations themselves subject to the these Regulations. 
There is evidence that, in some cases, perception of risk may have a greater impact on 
health than the hazard itself. A 2009 report4, jointly published by Liverpool John Moores 
University and the HPA, examined health risk perception and environmental problems using 
a number of case studies. As a point to consider, the report suggested: “Estimation of 
community anxiety and stress should be included as part of every risk or impact assessment 
of proposed plans that involve a potential environmental hazard. This is true even when the 
physical health risks may be negligible.” PHE supports the inclusion of this information within 
EIAs as good practice. 
Electromagnetic fields (EMF) [include for installations with associated substations 
and/or power lines] 
There is a potential health impact associated with the electric and magnetic fields around 
substations and the connecting cables or lines. The following information provides a 
framework for considering the potential health impact. 
In March 2004, the National Radiological Protection Board, NRPB (now part of PHE), 
published advice on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields. The advice was 
based on an extensive review of the science and a public consultation on its website, and 
recommended the adoption in the UK of the EMF exposure guidelines published by the 
International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP):- 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140629102627/http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publicatio
ns/Radiation/NPRBArchive/DocumentsOfTheNRPB/Absd1502/ 
The ICNIRP guidelines are based on the avoidance of known adverse effects of exposure to 
electromagnetic fields (EMF) at frequencies up to 300 GHz (gigahertz), which includes static 
magnetic fields and 50 Hz electric and magnetic fields associated with electricity 
transmission.  
PHE notes the current Government policy is that the ICNIRP guidelines are implemented in 
line with the terms of the EU Council Recommendation on limiting exposure of the general 
public (1999/519/EC): 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthprotection
/DH_4089500 
                                            
4 Available from: http://www.cph.org.uk/showPublication.aspx?pubid=538  
For static magnetic fields, the latest ICNIRP guidelines (2009) recommend that acute 
exposure of the general public should not exceed 400 mT (millitesla), for any part of the 
body, although the previously recommended value of 40 mT is the value used in the Council 
Recommendation.  However, because of potential indirect adverse effects, ICNIRP 
recognises that practical policies need to be implemented to prevent inadvertent harmful 
exposure of people with implanted electronic medical devices and implants containing 
ferromagnetic materials, and injuries due to flying ferromagnetic objects, and these 
considerations can lead to much lower restrictions, such as 0.5 mT as advised by the 
International Electrotechnical Commission.  
At 50 Hz, the known direct effects include those of induced currents in the body on the 
central nervous system (CNS) and indirect effects include the risk of painful spark discharge 
on contact with metal objects exposed to the field. The ICNIRP guidelines give reference 
levels for public exposure to 50 Hz electric and magnetic fields, and these are respectively 5 
kV m−1 (kilovolts per metre) and 100 μT (microtesla). If people are not exposed to field 
strengths above these levels, direct effects on the CNS should be avoided and indirect 
effects such as the risk of painful spark discharge will be small. The reference levels are not 
in themselves limits but provide guidance for assessing compliance with the basic 
restrictions and reducing the risk of indirect effects. Further clarification on advice on 
exposure guidelines for 50 Hz electric and magnetic fields is provided in the following note 
on the HPA website: 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/R
adiation/UnderstandingRadiation/InformationSheets/info_IcnirpExpGuidelines/ 
The Department of Energy and Climate Change has also published voluntary code of 
practices which set out key principles for complying with the ICNIRP guidelines for the 
industry. 
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/37447/1256-
code-practice-emf-public-exp-guidelines.pdf 
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48309/1255-
code-practice-optimum-phasing-power-lines.pdf 
There is concern about the possible effects of long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields, 
including possible carcinogenic effects at levels much lower than those given in the ICNIRP 
guidelines. In the NRPB advice issued in 2004, it was concluded that the studies that 
suggest health effects, including those concerning childhood leukaemia, could not be used 
to derive quantitative guidance on restricting exposure. However, the results of these studies 
represented uncertainty in the underlying evidence base, and taken together with people’s 
concerns, provided a basis for providing an additional recommendation for Government to 
consider the need for further precautionary measures, particularly with respect to the 
exposure of children to power frequency magnetic fields.   
The Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs (SAGE) was then set up to take this 
recommendation forward, explore the implications for a precautionary approach to extremely 
low frequency electric and magnetic fields (ELF EMFs), and to make practical 
recommendations to Government. In the First Interim Assessment of the Group, 
consideration was given to mitigation options such as the 'corridor option' near power lines, 
and optimal phasing to reduce electric and magnetic fields. A Second Interim Assessment 
addresses electricity distribution systems up to 66 kV. The SAGE reports can be found at the 
following link: 
http://sagedialogue.org.uk/ (go to “Document Index” and Scroll to SAGE/Formal reports with 
recommendations) 
The Agency has given advice to Health Ministers on the First Interim Assessment of SAGE 
regarding precautionary approaches to ELF EMFs and specifically regarding power lines and 
property, wiring and electrical equipment in homes: 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140629102627/http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publicatio
ns/Radiation/HPAResponseStatementsOnRadiationTopics/rpdadvice_sage/ 
The evidence to date suggests that in general there are no adverse effects on the health of 
the population of the UK caused by exposure to ELF EMFs below the guideline levels. The 
scientific evidence, as reviewed by PHE, supports the view that precautionary measures 
should address solely the possible association with childhood leukaemia and not other more 
speculative health effects. The measures should be proportionate in that overall benefits 
outweigh the fiscal and social costs, have a convincing evidence base to show that they will 
be successful in reducing exposure, and be effective in providing reassurance to the public.  
The Government response to the First SAGE Interim Assessment is given in the written 
Ministerial Statement by Gillian Merron, then Minister of State, Department of Health, 
published on 16th October 2009: 
http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091016/wmstext/91016m0

The above information provides a framework for considering the health impact associated 
with the proposed development, including the direct and indirect effects of the electric and 
magnetic fields as indicated above.  
Liaison with other stakeholders, comments should be sought from: 
 
the local authority for matters relating to noise, odour, vermin and dust nuisance 
 
the local authority regarding any site investigation and subsequent construction (and 
remediation) proposals to ensure that the site could not be determined as ‘contaminated 
land’ under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 
 
the local authority regarding any impacts on existing or proposed Air Quality 
Management Areas 
 
the Food Standards Agency / Food Standards Agency (Wales) for matters relating to the 
impact on human health of pollutants deposited on land used for growing food/ crops 
 
the Environment Agency / Natural Resources Wales for matters relating to flood risk and 
releases with the potential to impact on surface and groundwaters 
 
the Environment Agency / Natural Resources Wales for matters relating to waste 
characterisation and acceptance 
 
the Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS commissioning  Boards, Health Boards (in 
Wales)  and Local Planning Authority for matters relating to wider public health 
Environmental Permitting  
Amongst other permits and consents, the development will require an environmental permit 
from the Environment Agency / Natural Resources Wales to operate (under the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010). Therefore the installation 
will need to comply with the requirements of best available techniques (BAT). PHE is a 
consultee for bespoke environmental permit applications and will respond separately to any 
such consultation. 
Annex 1 
Human health risk assessment (chemical pollutants) 
The points below are cross-cutting and should be considered when undertaking a human 
health risk assessment: 
 
The promoter should consider including Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers 
alongside chemical names, where referenced in the ES 
 
Where available, the most recent United Kingdom standards for the appropriate 
media (e.g. air, water, and/or soil) and health-based guideline values should be used 
when quantifying the risk to human health from chemical pollutants. Where UK 
standards or guideline values are not available, those recommended by the 
European Union or World Health Organisation can be used  
 
When assessing the human health risk of a chemical emitted from a facility or 
operation, the background exposure to the chemical from other sources should be 
taken into account 
 
When quantitatively assessing the health risk of genotoxic and carcinogenic chemical 
pollutants PHE does not favour the use of mathematical models to extrapolate from 
high dose levels used in animal carcinogenicity studies to well below the observed 
region of a dose-response relationship.  When only animal data are available, we 
recommend that the ‘Margin of Exposure’ (MOE) approach5 is used

Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
Planning Act 2008 – Section 42 Consultation  
 
Application by Abergelli Power Limited for an Order Granting Development Consent for the Abergelli 
Power Project 
 
I refer to your consultation documents received in accordance with Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
process, which precedes your application for a Development Consent Order for a power station at 
Abergelli, Swansea.  
  
I am pleased to confirm that we have actively engaged with you on the project and will continue to do so 
in respect to the development and possible impact upon our assets. We have also responded to the Scoping 
Opinion consultation and provided comments to the Planning Inspectorate in July of this year.  
 
We acknowledge that the details of the proposal are in a preliminary stage and accordingly we are keen to 
work with you to develop the proposal where there are possible impacts upon Welsh Water assets. We 
therefore trust that our comments and discussions on matters relating to the project following the close of 
this formal consultation stage will be taken into account in your submission of the Development Consent 
Order.  
 
However, at this stage I must reiterate that the application site lies in close proximity to the Lower Lliw 
Reservoir which supplies Felindre Water Treatment Works. Your documentation refers to this reservoir as 
an emergency supply, however it should be noted that the Lower Lliw is the source to the largest Water 
Treatment Works in Wales, permanently supplying in the region of 700,000 customers. 
 
The proposed development has the potential to impact upon the water quality within the reservoir, which 
is approximately 1km from the site. It is therefore recommended that you explore these issues and 
undertake an appropriate air quality assessment to consider possible effects to the water in the reservoir 
from both deposition and affected rainfall. We would encourage the reservoir to be considered as a main 
receptor in their air quality change modeling. 
 
Further to the above, and where relevant, we recommend that the developer considers the impact upon 
any DCWW assets and apparatus and our ability to fulfil statutory obligations. In particular we draw 
attention to the 36” and 66” strategic water mains that cross the application site. Proactive discussions 
have since taken place in regard to these mains and we encourage this dialogue to be maintained.

Notwithstanding the above, we respectfully reserve the right to comment further on any matters and issues 
arising from ongoing and future consultation. However, we trust the above information is helpful at this 
stage and we look forward to continuing our engagement on the project prior and during the submission 
of an application to the Planning Inspectorate.  
 
Finally, I would be grateful if all future correspondence relating to the project is directed to me at the above 
address. For any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Abergelli Power Limited: Proposed Gas Fired Power Plant  
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
 
This is a joint response by National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET) and National Grid Gas plc 
(NGG) 
 
I refer to your letter dated 8th October 2014 regarding the above proposed application. Having 
reviewed the Section 42 consultation documents, I would like to make the following comments: 
 
National Grid Infrastructure within or in close proximity to the Proposed Order Limits 
 
National Grid Electricity Transmission 
National Grid Electricity Transmission has a number of high voltage electricity overhead 
transmission lines which lie within or in close proximity to the proposed order limits. These lines 
form an essential part of the electricity transmission network in England and Wales and include the 
following: 
 
 
4YV-400kV Overhead Transmission Line – Pembroke- Walham 
    Pembroke- Swansea 
 
4YW- 400kV Overhead Transmission Line- Pembroke-Swansea 
    Clifynydd- Swansea 
 
4YU – 400kV Overhead Transmission Line- Pembroke- Walham 
     Clifynydd- Swansea 
 
The following substation is also located within or in close proximity to the proposed order limits:  
 
 
Swansea North Substation 
 
I enclose plans showing the routes of our overhead lines and the location of our substation within 
the area shown in the consultation documents.

Registered Office: 1-3 Strand, London WC2N 5EH 
Registered in England and Wales, No 2366977 
Registered in England and Wales, No 2006000 
 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid’s Overhead Line/s is protected by a Deed of Easement/Wayleave Agreement 
which provides full right of access to retain, maintain, repair and inspect our asset 
 
 
Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed 
buildings must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends 
that no permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are 
set out in EN 43 – 8 Technical Specification for “overhead line clearances Issue 3 (2004) 
available at: 
http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/LandandDevelopment/DDC/devnearohl_final/appendixIII/ap
pIII-part2 
 
 
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our 
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such 
overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all 
circumstances. 
 
 
Further guidance on development near electricity transmission overhead lines is available 
here: http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/1E990EE5-D068-4DD6-8C9A-
4D0B06A1BA79/31436/Developmentnearoverheadlines1.pdf 
 
 
The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is 
contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS 
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should 
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse 
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and 
“swing”) drawings should be obtained using the contact details above. 
 
 
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and 
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing 
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety 
clearances. 
 
 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb 
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation 
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above 
 
National Grid Gas Transmission  
 
National Grid has a high pressure gas transmission pipeline located within or in close proximity to 
the proposed order limits. The high pressure gas pipeline located within this area is:

Specific Comments – Gas Infrastructure 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the 
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline 
at previously agreed locations.  
 
 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.  
 
 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be 
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National 
Grid.  
 
 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of 
the proposed protective measure.  
 
 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the 
pipeline to comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22. 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement 
 
Cables Crossing: 
 
 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline.

 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is 
above the pipeline. 
 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres 
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If 
this cannot be achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance 
distance of 0.6 metres. 
 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and 
after construction.  
 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased. 
 
 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established 
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed 
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final 
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the 
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power 
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with 
NG supervision and guidance.

Proposed Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(PEIR) Comment
Dear Sirs, 
  
Proposed Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) 
Comment 
  
Thank you for your recent correspondence that sought Civil Aviation Authority comment 
associated with the proposed Abergelli Power Project.  I trust the following, which draws from 
information contained within the PEIR Non-Technical Summary (NTS) and is fundamentally in line 
with related comment provided for the Planning Inspectorate at the scoping stage, is useful. 
  
We note from the PEIR NTS that the tallest related structures are expected to be between a 
maximum of 5x40m high stacks.  It is assumed that these heights are measured above ground 
level.  On that basis we belief the following (potential) issues are worthy of consideration: 
• 
Aerodromes.  In respect of any potential aerodrome related issue, we note the relatively close 
proximity of Swansea Airport to the development site.  Given that aerodrome safeguarding 
responsibility rests in all cases with the relevant aerodrome operator / licensee, not the CAA, we 
believe it important that Swansea Airport’s  related viewpoints is established and any concerns 
expressed appropriately taken into account.   
• 
Aviation Warning Lighting:   
• 
In the UK, the need for aviation obstruction lighting on 'tall' structures depends in the first instance 
upon any particular structure's location in relationship to an aerodrome. If the structure constitutes 
an 'aerodrome obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that with review the lighting requirement. 
For civil aerodromes, they will, in general terms, follow the requirements of CAP 168 - Licensing of 
Aerodromes. This document can be downloaded from the Civil Aviation CAA website at 
www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP168.PDF - Chapter 4 (12.8) refers to obstacle lighting.  
• 
Away from aerodromes Article 219 of the UK Air Navigation Order applies. This Article requires 
that for en-route obstructions (ie away from aerodromes) lighting only becomes legally mandated 
for structures of a height of 150m or more. However, structures of lesser high might need aviation 
obstruction lighting if, by virtue of their location and nature, they are considered a significant 
navigational hazard.  
• 
Cranes, whether in situ temporarily or long term are captured by the points heighted above.  Note 
that if a crane is located on top of another structure, it is the overall height (structure + crane) than 
is relevant. 
• 
In this case, given the assumed maximum height of 40m, Article 219 would not apply.  In the 
event that there is no aerodrome issue we can advise that the CAA would not in isolation make 
any case for lighting. 
• 
Gas Venting and/or Flaring.  It is assumed that the facility is not intended to vent or flare gas 
either routinely or as an emergency procedure such as to cause a danger to overlying aircraft.  If 
that is not the case parties are invited to use myself as an appropriate point of contact for any 
further related discussion. 
2
• 
Aviation Promulgation.  There is a civil aviation requirement in the UK for all structures over 300ft 
(91.4m) high to be charted on aviation maps.  It follows that, at a maximum of 40m, aside of any 
aerodrome requirement, there is no en-route (ie non-aerodrome specific) civil aviation charting 
requirement.  However, if crane usage in the construction phase involves heights of 300ft or more, 
the temporary structure will need to be appropriately notified.  For temporary structures this 
notification can be achieved through the publication of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).  If needed by 
virtue of temporary use of cranes such that the 300ft threshold is breached a NOTAM can be 
arranged through the developer providing related details to the CAA’s Airspace Utilisation Section 
(ausops@caa.co.uk / 0207 453 6599).   
• 
Military Aviation.  For completeness, the Ministry of Defence position in regards to the proposed 
development and military aviation activity should be established. 
• 
I should also add that that due to the unique nature of associated operations in respect of 
operating altitudes and potentially unusual landing sites, it would also be sensible to establish the 
related viewpoint of local emergency services air support units.      
   
I believe that any associated Development Consent Order (or equivalent / similar) would be 
expected to acknowledge and where applicable address the issues highlighted above. 
  
Whilst none of the above negates any aforementioned need to consult in line with Government 
requirements associated with the safeguarding of aerodromes and other technical sites 
(Government Circular 1/2003 refers), we hope this information matches your 
requirements.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you require any further comment or needs 
clarification of any point.

Abergelli Gas Power Station 
 
Dear Sir or madam, 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to object to a planning application for a gas fired power station 
at Abergelli Farm Felindre proposed by Stag Energy.  The grounds for our objections are: 
 
a. Location for the power station 
b. The loss of agricultural land, approximately 70% of the site 
c. The loss of endangered habitat, approximately 20% of the site 
d. The destruction of an established wild life pond, approximately 10% of the site 
e. The disturbance of protected species 
f. An industrial development in open countryside 
 
Explanations to the points above. 
 
A. The location of this development is of great concern as it is only 500meters away from our 
property at Cefn Betingau Farm.  As the development is in a south westwordly direction and 
the prevailing wind and weather comes from the south west and we are approximately 50 
meters higher than the development.  The noise and exhaust gas emissions will have a 
detrimental effect on our health and wellbeing. We are also attempting to sell houses on the 
farm; this development will have a serious effect on our ability to find a buyer and the value 
of the property. The positioning of this development will also have serious health issues for 
the surrounding properties due to the co2 emissions. The main problem will be under 
certain weather conditions I.E. high pressure system centres over South Wales especially in 
winter this will not allow the co2 emissions to escape the valley and be disbursed into the 
surrounding area.  The valley is best described as being shaped like a huge soup bowl with 
the lowest point being approximately 1 km to the south, which is the village of Bryntywod. If 
the power station is operating under these weather conditions and the co2 being heavier 
than air the entire valley could be filled with co2. I have witnessed this happening many 
times by the emissions from the old Felindre Tin Plate Works, this closed approximately 15 
years ago. If you were to move the proposed site 800metres to the North West, this would 
not happen, as the site is positioned on a small platitude surrounded by trees and very 
limited visibility from surrounding countryside. I enclose a mist settling photograph in the 
said valley. 
 
 
B. The loss of agricultural land that has been in production for hundreds of years should not be 
allowed unless food production and the development can be managed alongside each other. 
Such as land based solar panels and sheep production this development will mean that the 
total loss of production permanently. 
C. Fen habitats support a large amount of plants and animals some can contain over 500 
different species of plants and more than half the U.K.  Species of dragon flies, and several 
thousands of other insect’s species such as aquatic species.  These would be lost if this 
development was to go ahead. 
D. The easterly edge of the proposed development there is an established wild life pond. 50 
years ago there were twice as many ponds in the countryside than there are today. There 
destruction has meant a huge decline in wild life in plants.  I have been involved in 
conservation for the past 30 years on the neighbouring land creating wildlife pond, habits 
and setting aside land for wild life. 
E. The northern edge for the proposed development, there is a long established badger set.  
This set has been there a minimum of 120 years to my knowledge. As you will be aware it is 
illegal, to disturb or destroy a badger set, under the badger act 1992.  The proposed site is 
crossed over with runs to their feeding grounds. 
F. This development is contrary to the Swansea unitary development plan. Specifically SP1 SP2 
and SP3 and many other planning policies. We are not in principally objecting to this 
development as we will always need an electrical generation.  It is the location we are 
objection too.  When there is a far more suitable site approximately 800meters to the North 
West which could be classed as a brown field site because of it industrial passed. IE coal 
mining and recent land fill.  The alternative site is closer to the gas pipe line and the 
electrical connections are still accessible and closer to the main entrance to Abergelli Farm. 
 
 
Yours faithfully 
 
 
 
PJ & EM Rasbridge

Abergelli Power. - proposed gas fired power plant
Dear Mr Campbell 
 
Thank you for your letter of 14 October with enclosures about the above.  
 
We strongly oppose the location of the proposed gas fired power plant Abergelli Farm for the following reasons:- 
 
We live approximately 500 metres from the proposed site and are concerned about the emissions  and also the 
noise levels.  
 
We purchased the property a year ago and if the power station is approved, this will definitely devalue it.  
 
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Abergelli Power Limited: Proposed Gas Fired Power Plant  
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
 
This is a joint response by National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET) and National Grid Gas plc 
(NGG) 
 
I refer to your letter dated 8th October 2014 regarding the above proposed application. Having 
reviewed the Section 42 consultation documents, I would like to make the following comments: 
 
National Grid Infrastructure within or in close proximity to the Proposed Order Limits 
 
National Grid Electricity Transmission 
National Grid Electricity Transmission has a number of high voltage electricity overhead 
transmission lines which lie within or in close proximity to the proposed order limits. These lines 
form an essential part of the electricity transmission network in England and Wales and include the 
following: 
 
 
4YV-400kV Overhead Transmission Line – Pembroke- Walham 
    Pembroke- Swansea 
 
4YW- 400kV Overhead Transmission Line- Pembroke-Swansea 
    Clifynydd- Swansea 
 
4YU – 400kV Overhead Transmission Line- Pembroke- Walham 
     Clifynydd- Swansea 
 
The following substation is also located within or in close proximity to the proposed order limits:  
 
 
Swansea North Substation 
 
I enclose plans showing the routes of our overhead lines and the location of our substation within 
the area shown in the consultation documents.

Registered in England and Wales, No 2366977 
Registered in England and Wales, No 2006000 
 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid’s Overhead Line/s is protected by a Deed of Easement/Wayleave Agreement 
which provides full right of access to retain, maintain, repair and inspect our asset 
 
 
Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed 
buildings must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends 
that no permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are 
set out in EN 43 – 8 Technical Specification for “overhead line clearances Issue 3 (2004) 
available at: 
http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/LandandDevelopment/DDC/devnearohl_final/appendixIII/ap
pIII-part2 
 
 
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our 
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such 
overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all 
circumstances. 
 
 
Further guidance on development near electricity transmission overhead lines is available 
here: http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/1E990EE5-D068-4DD6-8C9A-
4D0B06A1BA79/31436/Developmentnearoverheadlines1.pdf 
 
 
The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is 
contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS 
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should 
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse 
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and 
“swing”) drawings should be obtained using the contact details above. 
 
 
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and 
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing 
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety 
clearances. 
 
 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb 
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation 
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above 
 
National Grid Gas Transmission  
 
National Grid has a high pressure gas transmission pipeline located within or in close proximity to 
the proposed order limits. The high pressure gas pipeline located within this area is:

Specific Comments – Gas Infrastructure 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the 
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline 
at previously agreed locations.  
 
 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.  
 
 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be 
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National 
Grid.  
 
 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of 
the proposed protective measure.  
 
 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the 
pipeline to comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22. 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement 
 
Cables Crossing: 
 
 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline.

 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is 
above the pipeline. 
 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres 
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If 
this cannot be achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance 
distance of 0.6 metres. 
 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and 
after construction.  
 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased. 
 
 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established 
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed 
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final 
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the 
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power 
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with 
NG supervision and guidance.

contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS 
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should 
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse 
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and 
“swing”) drawings should be obtained using the contact details above. 
 
 
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and 
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing 
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety 
clearances. 
 
 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb 
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation 
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above 
 
National Grid Gas Transmission  
 
National Grid has a high pressure gas transmission pipeline located within or in close proximity to 
the proposed order limits. The high pressure gas pipeline located within this area is:

Specific Comments – Gas Infrastructure 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the 
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline 
at previously agreed locations.  
 
 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.  
 
 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be 
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National 
Grid.  
 
 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of 
the proposed protective measure.  
 
 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the 
pipeline to comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22. 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement 
 
Cables Crossing: 
 
 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline.

 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is 
above the pipeline. 
 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres 
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If 
this cannot be achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance 
distance of 0.6 metres. 
 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and 
after construction.  
 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased. 
 
 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established 
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed 
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final 
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the 
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power 
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with 
NG supervision and guidance.

ABERGELLI POWER LIMITED: PROPOSED GAS FIRED POWER PLANT 
PROJECT ON LAND ADJACENT TO THE NATIONAL GRID COMPRESSOR 
STATION AT ABERGELLI FARM, FELINDRE, SWANSEA, SA5 7NN 
 
Thank you for your letter of 8 October 2014 regarding the proposed 50-299 MW 
Gas Fired Power Plant project at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea.  
 
It is noted that this letter and accompanying documentation (namely the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report dated September 2014 (PEIR)), 
comprises consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. We are a 
prescribed consultee under the Act.  
 
Our purpose is to ensure that the environment and natural resources of Wales are 
sustainably maintained, enhanced and used, now and in the future. Our functions 
are set out in the Natural Resources Body for Wales (Functions) Order 2012. Our 
advice and comments are therefore provided in the context of this remit.  
 
We note the information may be subject to further update and revision and the full 
results of the various technical studies undertaken will be provided in the 
Environmental Statement (ES), which will be submitted alongside the 
Development Consent Order (DCO) application. On this basis, we reserve the 
right to make further comments and representations during the course of the 
proposed application, as may be required. The comments herein are therefore 
without prejudice to any future comments which may be provided by us in relation 
to future submissions. 
 
The operation of this development gives rise to Combustion Activities under Part 
A1 (a) of Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Environmental Permit Regulations 2010 and we 
are the determining authority for an Environmental Permit for such activity. The 
Environmental Permit is determined under distinct and separate legislation and our 
comments in relation to the PEIR are independent and without prejudice to any

ANNEX 1 
Natural Resources Wales’ Comments 
Section 42 consultation by Abergelli Power Limited 
 
Abergelli Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report  
(PB Reference: 287521A; PINS Reference: EN010069)  
 
A. Chapter 2 Project and Site Description 
 
A.1. Waste Arisings 
 
A.1.1. Section 2.9 of the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) 
states that there is good provision for all types of waste arising from the project 
(with Neath Port Talbot being the coordinating authority). We would highlight that 
contaminated excavation material and hazardous wastes outlets, should they be 
required, are likely to be outside of the County Borough. Therefore, it would be 
prudent to ensure that appropriate measures and outlets exist should they be 
necessary as part of the project and following further testing and investigation as 
part of the Environmental Statement (ES). 
 
B. Chapter 6 Air Quality 
 
B. 1. Environmental Permitting Requirements - early dialogue with NRW and 
submission of EPR application 
 
B. 1.1. Whilst the Secretary of State (SoS) and ourselves have recommended that 
you submit an application or an EPR1 permit prior to submission of the DCO 
application, you have stated that this is not your intention. In fact you have stated 
‘The Environmental Permit application will be submitted 12 months prior to the 
commencement of commercial operations.’ Whilst we respect this decision, we will 
not be in a position to fully assess many aspects of the proposal until the EPR 
permit application has been submitted and assessed. This does add complexities 
to the process which could be avoided with parallel applications. 
 
B.1.2. We refer you to The Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note Eleven: Working 
with public bodies in the infrastructure planning process – Annex D: Environment 
Agency, which under the Environmental Permitting section states that  ‘Applicants 
are encouraged to “twin track” environmental permit applications to the 
Environment Agency with their DCO applications to the Planning Inspectorate in 
order to facilitate timely decision-making.’ Please note that the ‘Environment 
Agency’ should be read as ‘Natural Resources Wales’. 
 
B.1.3. In the light of your intention to submit an EPR application at some future 
date we must advise you that we cannot rule out the possibility that further 
information (such as additional monitoring or assessments) may be required 
during the EPR permit determination process.  
 
                                            
1 Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 
 
 
4 
B.1.4. We would highlight that an EPR permit cannot be predetermined and that 
many aspects of the plant’s design and operation will be assessed as part of the 
EPR permitting process.   
 
B. 2. Technology selection - Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
 
B.2.1. As stated previously we believe that an open (simple) cycle gas turbine 
(GT) operation would not usually be considered to represent Best Available 
Technique (BAT). You state that you will endeavour to address this concern as 
part of the ES submission. However this issue may only be resolved at the EPR 
permit application determination stage where a full BAT assessment will be 
undertaken.  
 
B.3. Technology Selection – Combined Heat & Power (CHP) Utilisation 
 
B.3.1. You have stated that the proposal would not be suitable for CHP utilisation 
a robust justification to support this statement should be included in future 
submissions. In the event that justifications were accepted, then the facility will still 
need to be designed as a CHP- ready unit. 
 
B.4. Air Quality 
 
B.4.1. You state that you have followed Environment Agency document Horizontal 
Guidance Note H1 – Annex F: Air Emissions2. Annex F sets distances for 
consideration of conservation sites, criteria for screening out insignificant 
emissions and in Appendix C a suggested structure for a detailed air quality 
modelling assessment for EPR application. We note that you have also used the 
Air Pollution Information System (APIS) in your habitats impact assessment (this is 
further discussed below). 
 
B.4.2. Section 6.2.14 of the PEIR states that ‘as a peaking plant, the operation of 
the Generating Equipment will be limited through the permitting regime to 1,500 
hours per annum. The assessment is, therefore, based on the operation of the 
Generating Equipment, at full load, for 1,500 hours per annum. For the purposes 
of the air quality assessment this intermittent operation is assessed by assuming 
full load, continuous operation (to ensure worst case meteorological impacts are 
included in the model) and scaling the outputs for periods longer than one hour by 
likely operating hours i.e. 1500 out of a possible 8760 hours for annual mean 
impacts. No scaling is applied to hourly impacts to ensure a conservative 
approach, since it is possible that the operation of the Generating Equipment will 
coincide with poor dispersion conditions.’ 
 
B.4.3. Factoring the long-term predictions by operating hours is a methodology 
that is generally acceptable when there is sufficient headroom such that the 
uncertainties involved are unlikely to make a significant difference to predictions. 
In this case you acknowledge that critical loads at nearby habitats are already 
exceeded, therefore there is little headroom. Without further work we cannot 
                                            
2 H1 Annex F – Air Emissions, v2.2 December 2011 (Environment Agency) 
 
 
5 
comment on whether this methodology is a “worst case” approach. We would 
expect you to justify that your assessment is representative of a worst case 
scenario. 
 
B.4.4. Section 6.10.13 refers to a slight adverse effect on air quality during 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power station with mitigation 
stated as monitoring of emissions. Monitoring is not considered to be mitigation, as 
the pollutant may still be released. What additional mitigation can be employed to 
prevent the adverse effects in the first place? 
 
B.4.5. Generally speaking, the PEIR has followed an assessment methodology 
that is appropriate in regards to air quality impact assessment. We have not 
completed a detailed assessment and therefore cannot comment on the predicted 
impact. It should also be noted that we cannot rule out the possibility that further 
information may be required during a detailed risk impact assessment audit at the 
application stage for an EPR permit.  
 
B.5. Air Quality - Nature Conservation Interests 
 
B.5.1. For all Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within at least 2 km, and all 
Special Area of Conservation (SAC)/Special Protection Areas (SPA)/Ramsar sites 
within 10km of the proposed plant, information should be included in the ES as 
follows; 
 
B.5.2. Concentrations of NOx (and SO2 if present in emissions) emitted by the 
proposed plant compared to the critical levels for sensitive habitats at the above 
sites.   
 
B.5.3. Critical Levels are to be found on APIS  
(http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/issues/overview_Cloadslevels.htm#_Toc2797880
54 ).  
 
B.5.4. Proposed plant emissions (Process Contribution/PC) should be compared 
as a percentage of the relevant critical level as well being compared to the PC 
added to the background (PEC), to give percentage figures. 
 
B.5.5. Levels of nutrient Nitrogen deposition and Acid deposition derived from the 
proposed plant (PC) should also be compared to site relevant critical loads for the 
above sites.  These are available on APIS (http://www.apis.ac.uk/srcl) and should 
be similarly compared to the PC and PEC for each feature's most sensitive critical 
load value, to give percentage values. 
 
B.5.6. Instructions on how to carry out these calculations for acid deposition are 
available 
on 
APIS 
(http://www.apis.ac.uk/critical-load-function-tool) 
and 
in 
Environment Agency AQ TAG Paper 06 for nutrient Nitrogen deposition.  Please 
note that in relation to a Peaking Power facility which operates sporadically, the 
assessment must be done as a worst case scenario i.e. the maximum number of 
hours that the plant will be able to operate, over a year.     
 
 
 
6 
B.6. Habitats Regulations Assessment 
 
B.6.1. We advise that a Shadow Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) should 
be recorded by yourselves (as per PINS guidance Note 10).  The HRA should test 
the likely significant effects of the development for all relevant receptor SAC, SPA 
and Ramsar sites, in light of impact pathways from the development itself (for 
example aerial emissions).  These effects should be tested alone and if no likely 
significant effects concluded for a particular impact pathway on a site(s) alone, in-
combination effects should then be tested for those parameters, according to any 
residual effects from this development and other relevant plans/projects.  
Guidance is available for competent authorities in recording HRAs (Assessing 
Projects Under The Habitats Directive - Guidance For Competent Authorities, 
CCW, 2011) and this may aid in recording a shadow HRA, in terms of main 
guiding principles of the HRA process.  The guidance sets out the principles of the 
in-combination test as described above, including which plans/projects to consider 
within the in-combination test.  Any likely significant effects identified should lead 
to the recording of a shadow Appropriate Assessment (or Report to Inform an 
Appropriate Assessment, or similar) to assess such effects further.  The above 
guidance is available at the following URL (please note that this guidance has not 
been updated since 2011);

assessment/habitats-regulations-assessmen.aspx 
 
C. Chapter 7 Noise and Vibration 
 
C.1. Noise- General Comments 
 
C.1.1. Whilst the PEIR submission states that the noise monitoring locations were 
agreed with us and the Local Authority, we note that we do not appear to have 
been in dialogue with the consultants in regards to this matter. 
 
 
C.1.2. The ambient noise survey was conducted in accordance with the relevant 
standards but key frequency data is omitted from the report which was requested 
by the SoS and confirmed to be captured by the contractor. The PEIR outlines that 
at each identified Nearest Sensitive Receptor location the sound level is predicted 
to range between 40 dB to 47 dB LAeq which would result in a major noise impact 
at the receptor locations. These figures have been produced without factoring in 
any mitigation. What mitigation is planned to attenuate this increase in noise 
against the current background? Will each of the measures being proposed 
reduce the noise levels to an acceptable level? We have not had access to the 
modelling files to agree the figures suggested in the PEIR. 
 
C.1.3. Increased noise levels are likely to be perceived during start-up. What 
levels are likely above background and how will this be mitigated? 
 
 
 
7 
C.2. Noise- Ambient Noise Survey Report 
 
C.2.1. Section 2.1.1 states that the survey was undertaken to quantify existing 
noise levels at nearest sensitive receptors. We were expecting a tonal assessment 
to be carried out in tandem with the noise survey. This was specified in our letter 
dated 22 July 2014 sent by us (ref SH/2014/116929/01) and confirmed by you. 
 
C.2.2. Slight and minor adverse effects are predicted at sensitive receptors during 
the construction phase of the project. The LAeq seems to be significantly higher 
than the LA90 at each of the sensitive receptors. The proposed mitigation to this is 
site hoarding to mask the activities. Will this afford any real mitigation against the 
increased noise levels other than removing direct line of sight? 
 
C.2.3. Section 2.1.2 states that ‘short-term sampling measurements were 
conducted...in order to capture the existing ambient noise level representative of 
that particular period’. You should explain why you feel a 30 minute sample which 
covered a 24 hour period would be representative to suggest that the sound was 
stable and not fluctuating.  
 
C.2.4. Additionally in section 2.1.2 it states that 3 day; 1 evening and 2 night 
samples will be taken. We would question this statement, it would appear the 
actual sampling undertaken was 2 day; 1 evening and 1 night for each nearest 
sensitive receptor. 
 
C.3. Noise- Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
C.3.1. Section 7.2.2 of the PEIR states that “The assessment methodologies used 
in the PEIR are the same as those that will be adopted for the EIA. However, the 
level of detail available at the PEIR stage is only sufficient to form preliminary 
conclusions and more detailed information will be required for the EIA.” You state 
that you have followed the BS 4142 methodology. BS 4142 assesses the 
likelihood of complaints by subtracting the measured background noise level from 
the rating level predictions at sensitive receptors. In order to conduct a robust BS 
4142 assessment, representative background LA90 noise levels are required at 
sensitive receptors. The noise monitoring survey should therefore be conducted 
over a sufficient time period to determine typical background levels under all 
operational scenarios (days, nights, weekdays and weekends). Additionally 
measurements should be taken over relevant reference time intervals. Please note 
that BS 4142 is currently being revised and the new version is likely to be 
published soon. When conducting the noise survey and noise impact assessment 
it is appropriate to follow the most recently published British Standards. 
 
C.3.2. In section 7.2.1 there is no reference to Environment Agency’s horizontal 
guidance note for noise. 
 
C.3.3. It is recommended that an overview of ‘A Noise Action Plan for Wales 2013-
2018’ is provided in the relevant policy and guidance section with particular 
emphasis on the importance of ‘sustainable development principles’ and ‘creeping 
background’. 
 
 
8 
 
C.3.4. Section 7.3.3 of the PEIR states that ‘discussions were held with CCS and 
NRW in August 2014 to agree a study area, a noise survey methodology, and 
suitable locations for the survey measurement positions’. We would question 
whether we were consulted on this.  
 
C.3.5. In section 7.3.4 there is an exclusion of a tonal assessment (please see our 
earlier comment on this matter). 
 
C.3.6. In Table 7.5, there are references to “Bergelli farm” and these continue 
throughout the report. We presume this should be Abergelli . 
 
C.3.7. In section 7.3.6 there is a reference to weather data and this was raised in 
the review of the ‘Ambient Noise Survey Report’. We would like confirmation of 
how weather data was collected. 
 
C.3.8. Please note that will not comment on construction/decommissioning or off 
site traffic noise - this is a role for the Local Authority. 
 
C.3.9. In Table 7.9 there is reference to ‘slight adverse’ effects but it is unclear 
whether you are referring to ‘minor adverse’ effects specified in Table 7.4 above. 
There is no justification as to why the sound levels from the gas and electrical 
connections are thought to be negligible.  
 
C.3.10. When submitting a noise impact assessment, as part of the permit 
application for an EPR permit, you should refer to Environment Agency document 
Noise Impact Assessment - Information Requirements 3 to inform yourselves of 
the expected requirements for a noise impact assessment submission. 
 
C.4. Preliminary Stack Sensitivity Analysis (PSSA) 
 
C.4.1. We have not assessed the PSSA submitted as part of the PEIR. A detailed 
assessment will be undertaken as part of the EPR permit application process 
which will determine the appropriate stack height required for appropriate 
environmental control. We note that section 4.9.4 states that ‘Air quality sensitivity 
tests have indicated that a minimum stack height of 35m will be required for 
adequate dispersion of exhaust gases and to meet legislative air quality targets 
(i.e. IED)’. We also note that ‘a maximum height of 40m has been assumed for the 
purpose of the Landscape and Visual Impact and Cultural Heritage Assessments 
as a ‘realistic worst-case scenario’.  
 
C.4.2. However we do note that in the PEIR the consultant has used significance 
criteria set out in H1 Annex F. The consultant considered the impact of NOx and 
nitrogen deposition, and reference was made to acidification, but it is unclear if this 
was taken into account. This will need to be addressed when the permit 
application is submitted.

D. Chapter 8 Ecology 
 
D.1. Habitats 
 
D.1.1. We note that the final design of the project is still to be decided and habitat 
losses and impacts on protected species will be fully assessed when the design is 
finalised in the ES.  
 
D.1.2. We reiterate our comments made previously that we would welcome further 
justification if the final location for the Generating Equipment Site and Temporary 
Laydown Area is decided to be on an area of marshy grassland (also known as 
Purple moorgrass and rush pasture), and why it cannot be located on areas of 
improved grassland, which would be less ecologically damaging. Marshy 
grassland is a habitat listed under section 42 of the Natural Environmental and 
Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006 and under the City and County of Swansea’s 
(CCS) Local Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. CCS have a duty under section 
40 of the NERC Act, to have regard to conserving biodiversity; and therefore we 
advise that CCS’s Ecologist is consulted regarding section 42 habitats and species 
in order to take account of possible adverse effects on such interests.  
 
D.1.3. We advise that the predicted habitat losses should be quantified in the ES.  
This is particularly important when working with CCS’s Ecologist to agree a 
mitigation/compensation scheme. 
 
D.1.4. We note the references to section 2.13 of the PEIR and embedded 
mitigation throughout section 8 Ecology; however there is not sufficient reference 
to ecological mitigation and monitoring in Section 2.13.   
 
D.1.5. In section 2.11.1 Table 2.1 Access Road Comparison table, we would 
suggest the ecological impact considerations are also included in this table. 
 
D.1.6. We also refer to our previous comments in our scoping response letter in 
relation to the watercourses and wetland habitats and their associated species and 
advise that further consultation with ourselves is carried out before detailed site 
layout plans are drawn up and submitted at draft ES stage.  
 
D.2. Access 
 
D.2.1. We note the project is looking at two access options.  Option one would 
result in some habitat losses to Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC) through road widening.  Option two would also result in habitat losses, but 
to a greater extent.  The losses resulting from option two would result in 
permanent loss of ancient woodland which cannot be mitigated.   
 
D.2.2. We note that there has already been a significant loss of woodland in this 
area as a result of industrial development and that the remaining woodland on and 
around the site was reclassified as Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites 
(PAWS) under the Ancient Woodland Inventory (AWI) dataset in 2011. Section 
5.2.9 of Planning Policy Wales Chapter 5: Conserving and Improving Natural 
 
 
10 
Heritage and the Coast states that ‘Trees, woodlands and hedgerows are of great 
importance, both as wildlife habitats and in terms of their contribution to landscape 
character and beauty. They also play a role in tackling climate change by trapping 
carbon and can provide a sustainable energy source. Local planning authorities 
should seek to protect trees, groups of trees and areas of woodland where they 
have natural heritage value or contribute to the character or amenity of a particular 
locality. Ancient and semi-natural woodlands are irreplaceable habitats of high 
biodiversity value which should be protected from development that would result in 
significant damage.’ We advise that any proposed loss of woodland should be 
avoided.  
 
D.2.3. Once the final access route has been selected, should the route require any 
road widening/improvements, we advise that further survey work is carried out on 
the external access roads which have not been included in the Phase 1 habitat 
survey and possible subsequent protected species survey work.   
 
D.3. Peat 
 
D.3.1. We are pleased to see a reference to a Peat Management Plan and further 
ground investigations to determine the potential loss of peat, which will be a 
requirement of the DCO. 
 
D.4. Invasive Species 
 
D.4.1. With reference to invasive species found on the site, we note that five 
invasive species have been found.  Section 8.3.22 describes invasive species 
identified during the site surveys. We advise that appropriate measures must be 
implemented for the removal or long-term management of the identified invasive 
species on site. Japanese Knotweed is classed as controlled waste under the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 and as such must be disposed of in a suitable 
manner. 
 
D.5. Species 
 
D.5.1. We note that all the standard ecological surveys have been carried out; 
however analysis of some of the surveys is still being carried out and the final 
design is yet to be decided therefore we will not be providing detailed comments 
on the impacts at this stage.  We would be happy to provide comments on the 
survey work and results prior to the draft ES stage should you wish to consult us. 
 
D.6. Otters 
 
D.6.1. Ecological conditions can change over the short term, we would 
recommend regularly re-surveying for otters in the watercourse where an otter 
spraint was found and the watercourses identified as having potential to support 
otters. 
 
 
 
11 
D.7. Watervoles 
 
D.7.1. The details of the watervole survey in the PEIR Appendix appear to be 
inconclusive as to whether there are water voles on site. The surveys found no 
signs of recent activity but there was suitable habitat and holes. At the time of 
writing the report there were only historic watervole records from 1996 available 
for the River Llan but an active population of watervoles has recently been found 
downstream at Penllergaer. We would recommend that further watervole surveys 
are carried out in May when the voles are very active. 
 
D.7.2. Protection and enhancement of suitable watervole habitat on site will be an 
important mitigation measure which we would like to discuss further in the future 
when detailed plans for the development are being considered.  
 
E. Chapter 9 Water Quality and Resources 
 
E.1.1. A number of ordinary watercourses cross the site and a small section runs 
adjacent to the Main River Llan. 
 
E.1.2. We note that a flood consequences assessment (FCA) will be produced for 
the development and we advise that this should assess the impact of the 
development upon the flood risk associated with both the ordinary watercourses 
which cross the site, and the main River Llan, to ensure that it is compliant with 
TAN15. Any FCA should consider both risk to the development itself and 
demonstrate any consequences to third parties.  
 
E.1.3. We advise that you consults with the City and County of Swansea Council’s 
Drainage Engineers with regards to flood risk associated with the ordinary 
watercourses crossing the site. 
 
E.1.4. Section 9 of the PEIR indicates that a site drainage plan will be discussed at 
a high level in the Environmental Statement and may incorporate sustainable 
drainage systems (SUDS). We would advise that SUDS should be implemented 
where possible, subject to ground conditions, in accordance with Section 8 of 
TAN15.  
 
E.1.5. If any proposed route crossings or any works on site are likely to affect the 
main river, then relevant Flood Defence Consents may be required, along with 
detailed method statements that incorporate pollution prevention and mitigation 
e.g. to prevent the accidental introduction of solid matter to the water course via 
excavation; diversion of the watercourse; dewatering; run-off etc. Any works in, 
under, over or within 7m from the main River Llan will require prior consent from 
us. For ordinary watercourses, you should consult the Lead Local Flood Authority 
(LLFA) which in this instance is the City and County of Swansea Council, though 
we would expect the same level of protection to be applied with regard to pollution 
prevention and mitigation.  
 
E.1.6. Section 9.2.10 of the PEIR points out the limitations of this report given the 
current absence of a hydrogeological survey. It is not possible therefore, to make 
 
 
12 
an informed assessment of likely impact and whether any proposed mitigation is 
appropriate to protect ground and surface waters at this stage.  
 
E.1.7. We note that detail relating to discharge from the power generation plant 
has not been provided. If any cooling waters/process waters are proposed to be 
discharged to the receiving waters (River Llan and its tributaries/River 
Lliw/Loughor), this will require a Water Discharge Activity Permit as part of the 
EPR. We advise that further detail is provided in the ES in relation to the discharge 
characteristics (with particular regards to temperature and chemical composition) 
of any cooling/process waters upon the above watercourses in order to assess 
any offsite environmental impact. 
 
E.2. WFD Compliance Assessment 
 
E.2.1. Section 9.2.6 of the PEIR states that a WFD report is unlikely to be 
required. We advise that a screening assessment should be undertaken as part of 
the ES.   New or changed river crossings should also be included in any screening 
assessment. If potential impact on WFD compliance is concluded, then a formal 
WFD assessment should be undertaken.  
 
E.3. Construction Activities 
 
E.3.1. The applicant should fully assess any ground instability and should be 
satisfied that piling operations and any vibration associated with the construction 
process will not disturb or cause any fracturing of the Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water 
main that traverses the proposed site. This water main augments the drinking 
water supply as far east as Cardiff and so it is of strategic importance in South 
Wales. The same consideration is needed in relation to disturbance of any historic 
mine workings, adits, or groundwater. 
 
E.3.2. Dust/debris is to be controlled by wheel washing facilities and damping 
down. EPR permits are likely to be required for both of these activities if you 
generate effluent that will be discharged to surface or ground waters.   If water for 
these activities is be sourced via abstraction rather than potable supply then an 
EPR permit maybe required. 
  
E.3.3. Any dewatering as part of construction activities is likely to require an EPR 
permit. 
 
E.3.4. Section 5.6.3 refers to the assumed connection to the Swansea North 
Substation. If this is not permissible, we advise that the alternatives are submitted 
and discussed. 
 
F. Chapter 10 Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology 
 
F.1. We note that there have previously been two landfills within the planning 
development boundary and that both sites now fall outside our regulation. 
 
 
 
13 
F.2. A contaminated land risk assessment should be undertaken as part of the ES. 
You are advised to contact the local authority to agree the scope of the 
assessment as they are the lead authority for land quality. 
 
G. Chapter 11 Landscape and Visual Impacts 
 
G.1. Scope of the assessment  
 
G.1.1. There does not appear to be any evidence presented on the consideration 
of alternative sites for the power generation plant. We advise that this should be 
included in the EIA. 
 
G.1.2. A 15km study area is considered acceptable for the Zone of Theoretical 
Visibility (ZTV) based on a maximum 40m stack height.  
 
G.1.3. In order to ‘scope out’ impacts on the Gower AONB and Brecon Beacons 
National Park, it would be helpful to provide single frame photographs at A3 size 
from viewpoints within these designations and within the 15km study area. This 
would help to demonstrate whether there are likely to be significant effects on 
these designations.    
 
G.2. Photomontages  
 
G.2.1. We would recommend that the photomontages (when selected) include 
single frame extracts from the panoramas (40 degree angle of view), reproduced 
at A3 size. These can be held up in the field and can reasonably demonstrate the 
level of detail seen with the eye. The panoramas help to provide context.  
 
G.3. LANDMAP & Landscape Sensitivity  
 
G.3.1. Table 11.2 and 11.3 descriptions should recognise that these are typical 
features of the various category of sensitivity and not definitive e.g. landscapes not 
recognised by designations are not necessarily of low sensitivity. The level of 
sensitivity depends on the character of the landscape and the nature of the 
proposal. This is set out in Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (GLVIA3) 2013.   
 
G.4. Landscape Character Assessment  
 
G.4.1. The landscape character areas illustrated on figure 11.3 appear to be the 
visual and sensory aspect areas taken from LANDMAP. This should be clarified.  
The assessment of landscape character sensitivity appears to only consider the 
visual and sensory aspect and not all five aspects. The overall evaluation used in 
the Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) only relates to the visual and 
sensory aspect. The overall evaluation for the geological, historical, cultural and 
habitats aspects vary within the site from high to outstanding.  
 
G.4.2. The assessment of landscape character and sensitivity should consider 
information from all five aspect areas, not only the visual and sensory aspect 
 
 
14 
areas. As well as the overall evaluation for each aspect, the rarity/uniqueness 
evaluation for  Geological Landscape, the connectivity/cohesion evaluation for 
Landscape Habitats, the scenic quality and character evaluation for Visual and 
Sensory and the rarity and group value for Historic Landscape and Cultural 
Landscape should be taken account of. Landscape character derives from all five 
aspects within LANDMAP. If the character assessment does not consider all 5 
aspects it is likely to be flawed.   
 
G.5. Selection of viewpoints and visual receptors  
 
G.5.1. It is unclear why houses in Llangefelach are not considered in the 
residential visual receptors when the information states that there are views of the 
site from the village.  
 
G.6. Lighting  
 
G.6.1.The LVIA should include an assessment of the visual effects of lighting e.g. 
the potential need for airport hazard lights.  
 
G.7. Construction Environmental Management Plan  
 
G.7.1. This should include proposals for the protection and storage of soils and the 
restoration of compounds and disturbed areas. Restoration should be appropriate 
to the surrounding landscape.  
 
G.8. Mitigation  
 
G.8.1. There is currently very little information on the opportunities for mitigation. 
The area of land owned or available to you will influence the amount and 
effectiveness of mitigation and needs to be considered at the outset. There may 
be opportunities for advance planting. If insufficient land is available for mitigation 
the significance of effects is likely to be higher, therefore this has a direct effect on 
the potential acceptability of the proposals.  
 
G.9. Cumulative assessment  
 
G.9.1. A number of other wind farm and solar energy proposals have been 
approved and should be taken into account in the cumulative assessment, along 
with the other existing and planned development in the locality (e.g. Proposed 
Felindre Business Park and Sustainable Urban Village).  
 
G.9.2. Wind farms/turbines within the 15km study area include: Mynydd y Betws 
(operational), Mynydd y Gwair, Mynydd y Gwrhyd, Tyle Coch Mawr and Gilfach 
Renewable Energy Project (approved), Mynydd Marchywel (in planning).  
 
G.9.3. Solar farms within the 15km study area and in close proximity to the site 
include: Brynwhilach Farm (operational), Abergelli and Cefn Betingau/Rhyd-y-
Pandy (approved).  
 
 
 
15 
G.9.4. Depending on the timescale of the project, other developments may need to 
be considered and contact with the local authority is recommended in this regard.

Dear Sir/Madam 
ABERGELLI POWER NSIP CONSULTATION 
I write in respect of the above Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project and have been instructed on 
behalf of Western Power Distribution (WPD) to make the following consultation response. 
WPD often has strategic electricity distribution circuits (which can operate at 132,000 Volts, 66,000 Volts, 
33,000 Volts and 11,000 Volts) within proposed development areas.  These circuits may run both 
underground and as overhead lines (on either towers/pylons or wood poles).  WPD may also have 
electricity substations in these areas. 
WPD would normally seek to retain the position of electricity circuits operating at 132,000 Volts (132kV) 
and 66,000 Volts (66kV) and in some cases 33,000 Volts (33kV), particularly if the diversion of such 
circuits placed a financial obligation on WPD to either divert or underground them.  WPD would not be 
party to any planning or development consent application and any financial obligation would also go 
against the statutory and regulatory requirement on WPD to operate an economic and efficient electricity 
distribution system. 
During and following any development, WPD will require access to its substations, overhead lines and 
underground cables.  Development over or in close proximity to underground cables or substations will 
require further analysis and confirmation from WPD as to suitability before it proceeds.  Assuming access 
is available and the required minimum statutory clearances can be maintained to its overhead lines, WPD 
does not generally have any restriction on development in proximity to its strategic overhead lines but it 
would be sensible for the layout of the development to take WPD's requirements into account.  WPD also 
need to be consulted prior to construction to ensure safety requirements in relation to working in close 
proximity to electricity lines/plant are met.   
With regard to the current consultation for Abergelli Power, WPD submitted a response to Terraquest on 
28 August 2014.  The letter is appended to this response.  WPD has 11kV overhead lines and some 1v 
underground mains within the redline boundary for the development.  Should these be affected by the 
development, WPD would seek an agreement with the developers to either modify the development plans 
or agree to protect or divert these assets.  WPD would normally enter into such an agreement ahead of 
the DCO application submission. 
 
2 
I trust the information provided is satisfactory and I look forward to receiving your confirmation of receipt of 
this representation in due course along with the appropriate consultation number for future reference.  
Should you require any additional information or want to discuss or clarify any matter with a representative 
from WPD, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Yours faithfully

Phase 1 S42 Consultation Feedback and APL Response 
 
1 
 
 Between March 2015 when the Project was ‘put on hold’ and the submission of the DCO in May 2018 the Project was subject to 
further design refinements as a result of updated environmental assessments and in response to consultation feedback.  
 
Notes provided in the column titled “Notes following Phase 2 Consultation (2018)” are given where the Project response to 
comments and feedback should be differentiated from or updated from the 2014 response due to the evolution of the Project, or 
updates in Policy and Guidance.

One comment strongly opposes 
the location of the proposed gas 
fired power plant, stating they 
live approximately 500 metres 
from the proposed site and are 
concerned about the emissions 
and also the noise levels 
(s42d). 
Another 
comment 
further 
states 
that 
this 
development is of great concern 
as it is located 500m from their 
property 
at 
Cefn 
Betingau 
(s42d). 
As explained in the ES, APL undertook a 
detailed site assessment in the initial 
phase of the Project from 2010-2013, 
during which period a range of sites 
around the UK were studied as to their 
suitability for a flexible gas-fired power 
station. 
This process identified that the site had 
the following key advantages: 
 
 It is in close proximity to a suitable 
electrical connection point; 
 It is in close proximity to a suitable 
gas connection point; 
 The Project Site does not include any 
nationally important environmental 
designations; 
 The land available is of an adequate 
size to accommodate the Power

A noise assessment has been carried out 
as part of the EIA and the findings are 
presented in chapter 7 of the ES.  The 
noise assessment predicts that there will 
be no significant residual effects from the 
operation of the Project.  Embedded 
mitigation measures will ensure that 
potential adverse impacts resulting from 
the Project are negligible and therefore 
not significant.

Two comments refer to the 
health and safety concerns 
regarding the selection of this 
site.  One of these comments 
states that the positioning of the 
development will have serious 
health 
issues 
for 
the 
surrounding properties due to 
the co2 emissions, particularly 
during high pressure weather 
conditions (s42d).  The other 
comment 
states 
that 
the 
proximity of a gas installation 
within close proximity of a 
hospital, schools, and houses 
will cause major health and 
safety concerns (s42d).

Gas fired power stations have been 
operating safely in the UK for the last 30 
years. Some of these plants have 
operated in very close proximity to 
hospitals and residential populations. 
One comment states that the 
loss of agricultural land that 
has been in production for 
hundreds of years should not 
be allowed unless food 
production and the 
development can be managed 
alongside each other (s42d). 
An assessment of the likely impacts of the 
Project on geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology has been carried out 
as part of the EIA and the findings are 
presented in chapter 10 of the ES 
(Document 
Reference 
6.1). 
 
The 
assessment states that whilst there will be 
a 
negligible 
adverse 
impact 
on 
agricultural land, the agricultural land 
within and surrounding the Project Site is 
of a poor quality and therefore the 
importance 
of 
this 
receptor 
for 
assessment purposes is low. 
Furthermore, APL undertook a detailed 
site assessment in the initial phase of the 
Project from 2010-2013, during which

were studied as to their suitability for a 
flexible gas-fired power station.  A 
number of key factors were considered in 
the site selection process including 
environmental factors and the need to 
avoid sterilisation of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land.  The Project 
Site is on poor quality agricultural land; 
based on this and other environmental, 
technical and economic considerations, a 
suitably sized site within Abergelli Farm 
was identified in 2013 and found likely to 
be suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station. 
Abergelli 
Farm 
has 
a 
history 
of 
commercial and industrial uses, including 
Abergelli Colliery and a landfill site.  The 
area surrounding the Project Site will 
continue to change over the next few 
years as demonstrated by the list of 
Projects with planning permission listed in 
Chapter 4 of the ES.  These include a 
number of renewable energy projects.  
The agricultural land is of poor quality 
(grades 4 and 5) and is not currently used

for food production (grazing of sheep

Three comments refer to the 
consideration of other 
alternatives. One of such 
comments states that 
consideration of alternatives 
(including alternative sites, 
choice of process, and the 
phasing of construction) is 
widely regarded as good 
practice. Ideally, EIA should 
start at the stage of site and 
process selection, so that the 
environmental merits of 
practicable alternatives can be 
properly considered. Where 
this is undertaken, the main 
alternatives considered should 
be outlined in the ES (s42a).  
APL has considered alternatives in the 
selection of the Project Site, Generating 
Equipment 
technology 
options, 
Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection.  
Consideration of alternatives is set out in 
chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1). 
In respect of site alternatives, the ex-
British Steel Works site was considered 
by APL, but the local authority have plans 
for this site and suggested that APL look 
at alternative sites in the area.  Allocated 
employment land at Felindre Strategic 
Business Park, located approximately 1.5 
km to the south-west of the Project Site, 
is a brownfield site which possesses 
excellent accessibility and other features 
that will enable it to provide a valuable 
economic role in the locality and region, 
and is both designated for, and likely to 
be very attractive to, employment uses at 
this stage of its development. Therefore it 
is considered by the Applicant and CCS

to be a less appropriate site for the 
Project than the site selected. 
 
One comment states that there 
does not appear to be any 
evidence presented on the 
consideration of alternative 
sites for the power generation 
plant - this should be included 
in the EIA.   
 
One comment states that there 
is a far more suitable 
brownfield site approximately 
800 m to the north-west. This 
alternative site is closer to the 
gas pipeline and the electrical 
connections are still accessible 
and closer to the main 
entrance to Abergelli Farm 
(s42d). 
 
 
 
 
APL has fully considered alternatives in 
the selection of the Project Site, as set out 
in chapter 5 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).   
APL 
undertook 
a 
detailed 
site 
assessment in the initial phase of the 
Project from 2010-2013, during which 
period a range of sites around the UK 
were studied as to their suitability for a 
flexible gas-fired power station.  A 
number of key factors were considered in 
the site selection process: technical (e.g. 
the size of the site and the proximity to 
appropriate gas and electrical connection 
points), environmental, economic, and 
whether the proposals would be in line 
with local planning policy.  On such basis 
a suitably sized site within Abergelli Farm 
was identified in 2013 and found likely to 
be suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station.

A 15 km study area is 
considered acceptable for the 
Zone of Theoretical Visibility 
(ZTV) based on a maximum 
40m stack height (a&d).  
 
APL has noted this comment.  As 
explained in chapter 11 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), a study area 
of up to 15 km has been used for the 
landscape and visual impact assessment 
of the Project, based on a maximum stack 
height of 40 m*. 
*The Power 
Generation Plant is 
now made up of only 
one Gas Turbine 
Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue 
stack, rather than up 
to five. The stack 
height is now a 
maximum of 45 m, 
instead of 40 m. The 
15 km ZTV has been 
updated accordingly. 
One comment states that the 
proximity of a gas installation 
within close proximity of a 
hospital, schools, and houses 
will be an economic cost to 
people living in its immediate 
vicinity, due to the impact on 
property values (s42d). 
 
APL has assessed the impacts of the 
Project and had regard to these when 
deciding on the red line boundary of the 
Project. 
See 
the 
ES 
(Document   
Reference 6.1). Where land may be 
injuriously affected by the Project during 
construction and / or operation, the PA 
2008 provides that compensation may be 
payable.

One comment states that the 
application is not in keeping 
with the aesthetics of the area, 
namely it is proposed to build a 
power station in what is 
effectively Green Belt land.  
You are proposing to further 
decimate the few green spaces 
left (s42d). 
The Project Site is not defined as Green 
Belt land. 
 
The Project Site was selected following a 
detailed site assessment in the initial 
phase of the Project from 2010-2013, 
during which period a range of sites 
around the UK were studied.  A number 
of key factors were considered in the site 
selection process, including technical, 
environmental, economic and planning 
policy matters, and accordingly, a suitably 
sized site within Abergelli Farm was 
identified in 2013 and found likely to be 
suitable for development of a gas fired 
electricity generating station. 
 
A full assessment of the landscape and 
visual impact of the Project can be found 
in chapter 11 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). A series of mitigation 
measures 
will 
be 
implemented

likelihood of the Project affecting aviation 
assets and infrastructure. In particular, 
their views were sought on the effect of 
construction of stacks of up to 40 metres* 
at the Project Site.  All of these consultees 
confirmed that the Project would not 
impact on aviation and it is therefore 
considered 
that 
the 
construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the 
Project will result in no change, with a 
neutral effect, which is not significant. 
 
In 
addition, 
CCS 
safeguard 
zone 
mapping was examined in relation 
potential impacts on Swansea Airport. It 
was confirmed that the Project is located 
outside of the relevant safeguarding zone 
for Swansea Airport. Nevertheless, as a 
courtesy, details about the Project were 
shared 
with 
Swansea

 Clinical Commissioning 
Groups, NHS 
commissioning Boards and 
Local Planning Authority for

public health (s42a). 
As explained in chapter 15 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), the likely 
significant effects on human health 
regarding air quality from construction 
and decommissioning of the Project 
relate 
to 
dust/particulate 
matter 
generated from construction activities. 
With the implementation of dust control 
measures 
through 
the 
Outline 
Construction 
Environmental 
Management Plan the effects of the 
Project are predicted to be negligible or 
low and not significant.  The main likely 
significant effects on human health in 
relation to air quality arising from 
operation of the Project are associated 
with the stack emissions. However, 
modern gas-fired power plants are 
inherently clean and produce far fewer 
emissions than other fossil fuel power 
plants (e.g. coal) when compared on an 
energy output basis.  The stack height 
has been designed to ensure that there 
are no significant effects on human 
health.

location and distance from the 
development of off-site human 
receptors that may be affected 
by emissions from, or activities 
at, the development. Off-site

Consideration should also be 
given to environmental 
receptors such as the 
surrounding land, 
watercourses, surface and 
groundwater, and drinking 
water supplies such as wells, 
boreholes and water 
abstraction points (s42a). 
 
One comment states that whilst 
screening of impacts using 
qualitative methodologies is 
common practice (e.g. for 
impacts arising from fugitive 
emissions such as dust), where 
it is possible to undertake a 
quantitative assessment of 
impacts then this should be 
undertaken (s42a). 
 
A quantitative assessment of the impacts 
of the Project has been undertaken as

consideration of the COMAH 
Regulations (Control of Major 
Accident Hazards) and the 
Major Accident Off-Site 
Neither the Project nor other nearby 
developments constitute a COMAH or 
Major Accident Off-Site Emergency Plan

One comment states that 
factoring the long-term 
predictions by operating hours 
is a methodology that is 
generally acceptable when 
there is sufficient headroom 
such that the uncertainties 
involved are unlikely to make a 
significant difference to 
predictions. In this case you 
acknowledge that critical loads 
at nearby habitats are already 
exceeded, therefore there is 
little headroom. Without further 
work NRW cannot comment on 
whether this methodology is a 
“worst case” approach. NRW 
would expect you to justify that 
your assessment is 
 The 
air 
quality 
assessment 
has 
assessed long term impacts by scaling 
the outputs for periods longer than one 
hour by the worst-case operating hours, 
2,250 per year*. This in turn meant that 
annual mean impacts were based on 
2,250 hours out of 8760 hours.  This 
approach is considered to represent a 
likely 
worst 
case, 
although 
it 
is 
acknowledged that this not the absolute 
“worst case” which would see the plant 
modeled as operating during the absolute 
worst 2,250 hours each year however this 
has such a low probability of occurring 
that it is not relevant to the assessment of 
chronic or long term ecological effects.

the scaling of long term predictions, we 
make 
reference 
to 
a 
previous 
assessment of a peaking plant, operating 
at 1500 hours per year, in Wales. As part 
of that assessment potential impacts of 
different combinations of operating hours 
over the 5 years of meteorological data 
were tested to address NRW concerns 
over the scaling of long term impacts. The 
overall conclusions of the statistical test 
was that the scaling of long term impacts 
can result in +/- 10% difference in 
concentrations at the 99th Percentile 
level. Applying this conclusions to the 
predicted results presented in the air 
quality assessment for the Abergelli 
Power Project and particularly on the 
most affected receptor (ie Rhyd-Y-Pandy 
Valley and Grasslands SINC) will mean 
that the Process Contribution from the

conclusions of the assessment are 
robust. 
One comment states that the 
PEIR refers to monitoring of 
emissions as mitigation for the 
slight adverse effects on air 
quality during construction, 
operation and 
decommissioning.  Monitoring 
is not considered to be 
mitigation, therefore what 
additional mitigation measures 
are proposed? (a&d) 
The project has a number of embedded 
mitigations measures including a site 
specific Dust Management Plan (DMP) 
that forms part of the Construction 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(CEMP). The monitoring of construction 
emissions will form part of the DMP to 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures included in the DMP are 
applied proportionally and at a timely 
manner including damping down of dusty 
surfaces, imposing speed limits for 
vehicles, covering stock piles etc. etc. 
Furthermore 
ambient 
air 
monitoring 
during 
construction 
is 
a 
mitigation 
measure as an operator can set alarm 
levels to prevent emissions exceeding 
potentially significant levels.  During 
operation, real time stack monitoring can 
also be considered mitigation as any 
increases in emissions concentrations 
can be identified.  Furthermore the stack 
sensitivity assessment, included in the 
assessment

One comment states that for all 
SSSIs within at least 2 km, and 
all SACs/SPAs/Ramsar sites 
within 10km of the proposed 
plant, the following information 
should be included within the 
ES - concentrations of NOx 
(and SO2 if present in 
emissions) emitted by the 
proposed plant compared to 
the critical levels for sensitive 
habitats at the above sites; 
proposed plant emissions 
(Process Contribution/PC) 
should be compared as a 
percentage of the relevant 
critical level as well being 
compared to the PC added to 
the background (PEC); levels 
of nutrient Nitrogen deposition

from the proposed plant (PC) 
should also be compared to 
A

chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference

One comment states that the 
ambient noise survey was 
conducted in accordance with 
the relevant standards but key 
frequency data is omitted 
which was requested by the 
SoS and confirmed to be 
captured by the contractor.  
The PEIR outlines that at each 
identified Nearest Sensitive 
Receptor location the sound 
level is predicted to range 
between 40 dB to 47 dB LAeq 
which would result in a major 
noise impact at the receptor 
locations - however no 
mitigation has been factored in.  
What mitigation is planned to

background, and will each of

reduce the noise levels to an 
acceptable level? (a&d).  
 
 
One comment states that slight 
and minor adverse effects are 
predicted at sensitive receptors 
during the construction phase 
of the project, and the 
proposed mitigation is site 
hoarding to mask the activities 
- will this afford any real 
mitigation against the 
increased noise levels? 
 
 
Construction noise mitigation measures 
are set out in the Outline CEMP. The 
results of the ES construction noise 
predictions are set out in ES Chapter 7.  
The site hoarding will provide a moderate 
level of noise reduction to low level 
receptors (Document References 6.1 and 
6.2). 
 
One comment which states 
that increased noise levels are 
likely to be perceived during 
start-up, and asks what levels 
are likely above background 
and how will this be mitigated? 
 
The noise assessment is presented in 
Chapter 7 of the ES. A +3 decibel (dB) 
correction factor is incorporated into the 
assessment to account for potentially 
distinctive character (see Section 7.7 of 
Chapter 7). 
 
The assessment demonstrates that noise 
effects as a result of the operation of the 
Project are not significant, and therefore

no further mitigation or monitoring is

One comment stated that the 
predicted habitat losses should 
be quantified in the ES - this is 
particularly important when 
agreeing a 
mitigation/compensation (a&d) 
Habitat losses for all Valued Ecological 
Receptors have been quantified in 
chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference

One comment advises that 
further detail is provided in the

characteristics (with particular 
regards to temperature and 
chemical composition) of any 
cooling/process waters upon 
the above watercourses in 
order to assess any offsite 
environmental impact (a&d). 
 
As explained in Chapter 3 and 9 of the 
ES, no process waters will be discharged 
at the site. Wastewater to be generated 
from the Project Site has been considered 
in the embedded mitigation (Section 3.11 
in ES Chapter 3, Document Reference 
6.1). No discharge of process water to 
nearby water receptors is planned as all 
process wastewater will be taken off-site 
via a tanker to an appropriate wastewater 
treatment 
facility 
by 
specialist 
contractors.

should be undertaken (a&d). 
The assessment of water quality and

opportunities for mitigation (in 
relation to landscape and 
visual impact) (s42a). 
Landscape and visual impact mitigation 
measures are set out in the LVIA (ES

out above is considered in any 
subsequent reports, including 
in the ES, and as part of any 
subsequent application (s42d). 
An assessment of the impact of the

One comment notes that the 
electric fields produced by the 
proposed new underground 
cables have been considered 
within the Report; however, 
such cables will also produce 
magnetic fields, which will not 
be shielded in the same way; 
therefore an assessment of the 
health impact of the magnetic 
fields should be included in the

A noise assessment has been carried out

(Document Reference 6.1).  The noise 
assessment predicts that there will be no 
significant residual effects from the

the value of their properties. 
One of these comments states 
that the proximity of a gas

proximity of a hospital, schools, 
and houses will be an 
economic cost to people living 
in its immediate vicinity, due to 
the impact on property values. 
 
APL has assessed the impacts of the

One comment states that any 
gain from construction would 
be short-lived - in practice 
there is very limited scope for 
job creation because skilled

One comment states that a 
tonal assessment was 
expected to be carried out in 
tandem with the noise survey 
(a&d). 
The noise assessment is presented in

monitoring was undertaken between 15

considered conservative in the context of 
the prevailing noise environment, which 
includes road traffic, the existing 
electrical infrastructure and agricultural 
equipment. 
One comment states that slight 
and minor adverse effects are 
predicted at sensitive receptors 
during the construction phase 
of the project, and the 
proposed mitigation is site 
hoarding to mask the activities 
- will this afford any real 
mitigation against the 
increased noise levels? 
 
Construction noise mitigation measures 
are set out in the noise CEMP. The 
results 
of 
the 
construction 
noise 
predictions are set out in Tables 7.16 to 
7.19 of ES Chapter 7 (Document 
Reference 6.1).  The site hoarding will 
provide a moderate level of noise 
reduction to low level receptors. 
 
One comment states that it 
should be explained why a 30 
minute sample which covered 
a 24 hour period is believed to 
be representative to suggest 
that the sound was stable and 
not fluctuating. 
The ambient noise survey methodology 
was discussed and agreed with the 
Environmental Protection officer at CCS 
prior to commencing the works. Short 
term sampling coupled with long term 
measurements are a standard method

One comment identifies that in 
addition to the consideration of 
the potential impacts on human

One comment states that the 
PEIR refers to monitoring of 
emissions as mitigation for the 
slight adverse effects on air 
quality during construction, 
operation and 
decommissioning.  Monitoring 
is not considered to be 
mitigation, therefore what 
additional mitigation measures 
are proposed? (a&d).  
 
One comment states that the

One comment states that any

from emissions due to 
construction and 
decommissioning should 
consider potential impacts on 
all receptors and describe 
monitoring and mitigation 
during these phases. 
Construction and 
decommissioning will be

The ES includes detailed measures to be

construction is assessed qualitatively 
using the IAQM Guidance.   
One comment states that the 
application site lies in close 
proximity to the Lower Lliw 
Reservoir which supplies 
Felindre Water Treatment 
Works. The documentation 
refers to this reservoir as an 
emergency supply.  The 
proposed development has the 
potential to impact upon the 
water quality within the 
reservoir - therefore 
recommended that an 
appropriate air quality 
assessment is undertaken to 
consider possible effects to the 
water in the reservoir from both 
deposition and affected rainfall.  
The reservoir should be 
considered as a main receptor 
in the air quality change 
modelling (a&d). 
An assessment of the likely significant 
effects of the Project in respect of air 
quality has been undertaken as part of the 
EIA and the findings are recorded in the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
As explained in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the Lower Lliw Reservoir 
is an emergency reservoir. It is not 
possible to assess deposition on water 
and therefore assessing deposition on 
the reservoir could not be undertaken. 
However as the Project is a gas power 
station the only relevant pollutant is NOX 
and no metal deposition is expected.

predictions by operating hours 
is a methodology that is 
generally acceptable when 
there is sufficient headroom 
such that the uncertainties 
involved are unlikely to make a 
significant difference to 
predictions. In this case you 
acknowledge that critical loads 
at nearby habitats are already 
exceeded, therefore there is 
little headroom. Without further 
work NRW cannot comment on 
whether this methodology is a 
“worst case” approach. NRW 
would expect you to justify that

scenario (a&d). 
for periods longer than one hour by the 
worst-case operating hours, 2,250 per 
year*. This in turn meant that annual 
mean impacts were based on 2,250 hours 
out of 8760 hours.  This approach is 
considered to represent a likely worst 
case, although it is acknowledged that 
this not the absolute “worst case” which 
would see the plant modeled as operating 
during the absolute worst 2,250 hours 
each year however this has such a low 
probability of occurring that it is not 
relevant to the assessment of chronic or 
long term ecological effects. NRW 
acknowledges that factoring long term 
prediction by operating hours is a 
methodology that is generally acceptable. 
In order to address NRW concerns over 
the scaling of long term predictions, we 
make 
reference 
to 
a 
previous 
assessment of a peaking plant, operating 
at 1500 hours per year, in Wales. As part 
of that assessment potential impacts of 
different combinations of operating hours 
over the 5 years of meteorological data 
were tested to address NRW concerns 
over the scaling of long term impacts. The 
overall conclusions of the statistical test

was that the scaling of long term impacts 
can result  in +/- 10% difference in 
concentrations at the 99th Percentile 
level. Applying this conclusions to the 
predicted results presented in the air 
quality assessment for the Abergelli 
Power Project  and particularly on the 
most affected receptor (ie Rhyd-Y-Pandy 
Valley and Grasslands SINC) will mean 
that the Process Contribution from the 
proposed stack will change from 0.0071 
to 0.0078 kg N/ha/yr which when 
compared to the minimum critical load for 
nitrogen deposition is a change from 
0.071% of the minimum critical load to 
0.078% of the minimum critical load.  This 
difference is not significant and the 
conclusions of the assessment are 
robust.

One comment states that in 
order to ‘scope out’ impacts on 
the Gower AONB and Brecon 
Beacons National Park, it 
would be helpful to provide 
photographs from viewpoints 
within these designations and 
within the 15km study area 
(a&d). 
The 15 km ZTV (ES Figure 11.8, 
Document Reference 6.3) shows that 
there will be no theoretical visibility from 
any part of the National Park. NRW 
confirmed by email on the 4th December 
2017 that a viewpoint in the Brecon 
Beacons National Park would not be 
necessary 
(see 
ES 
Chapter 
11, 
Document Reference 6.1). The ZTV also 
demonstrates limited to no theoretical 
visibility from the Gower AONB. ES 
Chapter 11 confirms that the Gower 
AONB would not experience significant 
effects due to the intervening distance, 
vegetation and built form.  
 
 
One comment states that the

One comment states that if a 
landscaping scheme is 
proposed as part of the 
proposal, we request that only 
slow and low growing species 
of trees and shrubs are planted

reduce the risk of growth to a

work should not be undertaken if it has 
the potential to disturb or adversely affect 
the foundations of an existing tower.

access option one would result 
in some habitat losses to Sites

road widening. Option two 
would also result in habitat 
losses, but to a greater extent. 
The losses resulting from 
option two would result in 
permanent loss of ancient 
woodland which cannot be 
mitigated (a&d). 
Following statutory consultation, APL 
continued to engage in discussions with 
National Grid about the use of its road, 
and subsequently reached an agreement 
to propose Option 2 (access from the 
B4489) as the Access Road.   
Only one option has been taken forward

and that the remaining 
woodland on and around the 
site was reclassified as 
Plantations on Ancient

classed as controlled waste 
under the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 and as

One comment states that the 
details of the watervole survey 
in the PEIR Appendix appear 
to be inconclusive as to 
whether there are water voles 
on site. The surveys found no 
signs of recent activity but 
there was suitable habitat and 
hole.  We would recommend 
that further watervole surveys 
are carried out in May when 
the voles are very active (a&d). 
Furthermore, one comment 
states that protection and 
enhancement of suitable 
watervole habitat on site will be 
an important mitigation 
measure which we would like 
to discuss further in the future 
when detailed plans for the 
development are being

The Generating Equipment would not 
have a flare stack, as used in industrial 
plants such as chemical or natural gas 
processing plants. In such plants, flare 
stacks are used for burning off gas during 
unplanned 
over-pressuring 
of 
plant 
equipment. Gas is used to power turbines 
and generate electricity in a controlled 
environment. No venting or flaring of gas 
is therefore required either routinely or as 
an emergency procedure.

consideration should be given

which there are no set 
emission limits. When 
assessing the potential impact 
of a proposed installation on 
environmental quality, 
predicted environmental

standards for short and long-

proximity to the Lower Lliw 
Reservoir which supplies 
Felindre Water Treatment 
Works - source to the largest 
Water Treatment Works in 
Wales, permanently supplying 
approximately 700,000 
customers.  The 
documentation refers to this 
reservoir as an emergency 
supply.  The proposed 
development has the potential 
to impact upon the water 
quality within the reservoir - 
therefore recommended that 
an appropriate air quality 
assessment is undertaken to

water in the reservoir from both 
deposition and affected rainfall.  
The reservoir should be

ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
The 
Lower 
Lliw 
Reservoir 
is 
an 
emergency reservoir. It is not possible to 
assess deposition on water and therefore 
assessing deposition on the reservoir 
could not be undertaken. However as the 
Project is a gas power station the only 
relevant pollutant is NOX and no metal 
deposition is expected.

One comment recommends 
that the developer considers 
the impact upon any DCWW 
assets and apparatus and our 
ability to fulfil statutory 
obligations, in particular the 36” 
and 66” strategic water mains 
that cross the application site.  
Proactive discussions have 
taken place and we encourage 
this dialogue to be maintained 
(s42a). 
 
The impact of the Project on the Welsh 
Water main has been considered as part 
of the EIA and is referenced in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1).  APL has

One comment states that The 
EIA should demonstrate 
compliance with the waste 
hierarchy (e.g. with respect to 
re-use, recycling or recovery 
and disposal) (s42a). 
 
As stated in Chapter 15 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) APL, at all 
phases of the Project, will seek to apply 
the waste hierarchy as part of their waste 
prevention and management policy. More 
details are in Section 6.6 of the Outline 
CEMP 
(Appendix 
3.1, 
Document

One comment states that for 
wastes arising from the 
installation, the EIA should 
consider the implications and 
wider environmental and public 
health impacts of different 
waste disposal options (s42a).

How APL has taken the response into account 
 
One comment stated that they do not have any plant within the 
area(s) specified in APL’s request.  
 
APL has noted this comment.  
 
One comment states that they do not have any apparatus 
within the immediate proximity of the proposed works.  
 
APL has noted this comment.  
 
One comment acknowledges the receipt of correspondence 
and enclosures that they received. 
 
APL has noted this comment.  
 
One comment reiterates comments made during statutory 
consultation, that careful consideration should be given as to 
whether the number and loading of vehicles (both construction 
and operational) accessing the power plant via the selected 
route will have any detrimental impact upon the structural 
integrity of the Llangyfelach Tunnel, and consequently whether 
any alteration or reinforcement will be required over the tunnel. 
 
 
APL has noted this comment and a full transport assessment 
has been undertaken in the ES to consider the effects of the 
vehicles during the construction phase of the Project. 
 
One comment advises APL to contact Network Rail’s Asset 
Protection Team in advance of commencing any works in 
order to mitigate any risk to Network Rail’s structures. 
 
APL has noted this comment.  APL will continue to maintain 
ongoing engagement with key stakeholders prior to the 
commencement of construction of the Project. 
 
 
One comment notes that the proposed application boundary 
appears to now fall outside of a high risk area for coal 
resources.  There are two recorded mine entries in relatively 
close proximity to the application site boundary, and therefore 
coal mining legacy should still be considered as part of a 
section in ground conditions within the Environmental 
Statement, although would appear unlikely to require intrusive 
site investigation works and/or specialist remedial measures, 
assuming that the current site boundary is maintained. 
 
 
APL has noted this comment. A full ground conditions 
assessment has been undertaken in the ES to consider the 
effects of the historical mining and known mine entries in the 
vicinity of the site during the construction phase of the Project. 
 
 
 
One comment states that the proposed site boundary is still 
within an area of surface coal resources.  Accordingly, in line 
with the requirements of Minerals Planning Policy Wales, 
paragraph 13, the Environmental Statement should afford due 
consideration to the potential for prior extraction of the mineral 
resource as part of this development proposal. 
 
 
Impacts of sterilisation of potential minerals resources are 
minimised through the siting of the Project near to other major 
infrastructure and at the edge of the sand/aggregates resource, 
and mitigated partially on the cessation of the use pursuant to 
the decommissioning strategy secured by a requirement. 
 
Four comments confirmed that they do not have any 
comments to make. 
APL acknowledges these remarks.

Summary of key points discussed and advice given 
 
Introduction 
 
The Applicant and the Planning Inspectorate (the Inspectorate) team introduced 
themselves and their respective roles. The Inspectorate continued by outlining its 
openness policy and ensured those present understood that any issues discussed and 
advice given would be recorded and placed on the Inspectorate’s website under 
section 51 of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (PA2008). Further to this, it was 
made clear that any advice given did not constitute legal advice upon which the 
Applicant (or others) can rely. 
  
Project overview and update 
 
The Applicant gave a brief update about the project and the changes to the project 
since the last meeting on 23 April 2015. The Applicant stated that the project has 
 
 
been bought by Drax Power together with Millbrook Power and the consented Hirwaun 
Power and Progress Power developments, but will still be managed by Stag Energy. 
 
The project is located close to Swansea and will connect to the Swansea substation. 
The project will have only one turbine and stack instead of the previous option of up 
to five turbines and stacks. The Applicant informed the Inspectorate that the redline 
boundary might change, and the land rights sought reduce, as the project becomes 
more defined. As the project hasn’t substantially changed since 2015, the Applicant 
will not be submitting another scoping request. It was clarified that the Inspectorate 
would not produce a Regulation 9 consultee list unless it was notified under Regulation 
6 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 
(as amended), which must be done prior to s42 consultation, and that it was for the 
Applicant to ensure they had consulted all relevant statutory consultees. It was 
explained that the Regulation 9 list was prepared only for the purposes of scoping and 
the Applicant’s consultation may have to go wider.     
 
At present the Applicant intends to bring the project forward as a Development 
Consent Order (DCO) application, and to progress the related gas and electricity 
connections under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA). The Applicant 
intends to submit its TCPA applications in late 2017, and twin-track them with the 
DCO application. The Applicant clarified that the project Environmental Statement 
(ES) would include the connections in its assessment. 
 
The Applicant was advised to include a section in the Planning Statement which 
clarified how the Wales Act 2017 interacts with PA2008. The Applicant was further 
advised to include a similar section in its consultation material to ensure consultees 
were aware of the planning framework within which the different elements of the 
scheme fell. 
 
Outreach 
 
The need for an outreach event was discussed. The Inspectorate stated that if the 
Applicant could produce a robust case justifying how an outreach event would benefit 
the process, the Inspectorate would consider the request. The Applicant was also 
advised to ask Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and City and Council of Swansea 
(CCS) if they felt that they would benefit from an outreach event or meeting between 
all parties. 
 
Project site 
 
The Applicant explained that the site will be split into two sections due to a water 
pipeline owned by Welsh Water crossing the proposed site. Both parties are working 
on protective provisions for Welsh Water’s assets. The Applicant clarified that the 
redline boundary may be modified to accommodate new build solar developments in 
the vicinity of the proposed application site.  
 
Compulsory acquisition 
 
The DCO will contain compulsory acquisition powers. The Applicant confirmed that it 
has signed an options agreement for the land. The Applicant was advised to prepare a 
schedule showing how the negotiations have progressed and to submit this as a 
freestanding document so it could be updated during the examination. 
 
 
 
Consultation programme 
 
The Applicant intends to re-consult in the autumn of 2017. The Applicant will also 
conduct some additional survey work which will be included in the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR). The PEIR will be based on the previously 
drafted ES. 
 
The validity of previous consultation was discussed. The Inspectorate advised the 
Applicant to re-consult with all relevant parties given the time period since the 
previous statutory consultation. The Applicant confirmed they will update the 
Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) after they have carried out consultation 
on the draft SoCC with the host authority. The Applicant also intends to work closely 
with CCS to ensure they adhere to the Welsh Language Scheme’s requirements. 
 
The Applicant intends to submit draft documents in December 2017/January 2018. 
The previous Consultation Report produced will be updated with the new consultation 
material. 
 
Draft documents review 
  
The Inspectorate clarified that it does not usually review technical chapters of the ES 
at the draft documents stage of the pre-application, but could review the chapters 
that set out the approach to the EIA, and the draft Habitats Regulation Assessment 
Report (HRAR). The Inspectorate informed the Applicant that it may be beneficial to 
the Applicant to include the draft DCO and Explanatory Memorandum and the updated 
Consultation Report. It was agreed that the Applicant would produce a list of draft 
documents they may wish the Inspectorate to review. It was agreed that the Applicant 
would also produce a draft s55 checklist prior to submitting the draft documents. 
 
The timescale for draft documents review is normally 4 weeks, followed by a meeting 
at Temple Quay House to discuss the comments. 
 
Any Other Business 
  
 
The Environmental Permit application is likely to be submitted to NRW in Q3 2017. 
 
The Applicant confirmed that HRA issues were still outstanding.  
 
Specific decisions / follow up required? 
 
 
The Inspectorate will investigate if there are any comments from the previous 
draft document review that have not been sent to the Applicant. Post-meeting 
note – All draft documents advice has been published on the Abergelli project 
webpage. 
 
The project submission date to be updated on the Inspectorate’s project

Welcome and Introductions 
 
The Applicant and the Planning Inspectorate (the Inspectorate) team introduced 
themselves and their respective roles. The Inspectorate outlined its openness policy 
and ensured that those present understood that any issues discussed and advice 
given would be recorded and placed on the Inspectorate’s website under section 51 of 
the Planning Act 2008 (PA2008). Further to this, it was made clear that any advice 
given did not constitute legal advice upon which the Applicant (or others) can rely.  
 
Project update 
 
The Applicant provided an update in relation to the project and programme timelines, 
and confirmed that statutory consultation will be conducted in Q1 of 2018, followed by 
submission of the DCO application in Q2 of 2018. The Applicant explained that the 
programme and the submission date are dependent on the next available capacity 
market auction and therefore they will be reviewing ‘lessons learned’ from the pre-
application stage and review of the draft application documents for the Millbrook 
Power project which is due to be submitted several months earlier, ahead of Abergelli. 
 
 
The Applicant intends to be as consistent as possible with the approach taken for the 
Millbrook Power project when preparing for the Abergelli DCO submission. 
 
Regarding the post-submission programme, the Inspectorate confirmed that although 
timescales are fixed (apart from the pre-examination stage), the pre-application stage 
of the project development is essential in the smooth running of the process. It will be 
essential for the Applicant to undertake effective consultation and for the application 
to be fit for purpose.  
 
The Applicant advised that landowner negotiations are on-going, with the project’s 
exact redline boundary yet to be confirmed. Environmental surveys are also on-going, 
with the resulting information to be fed into the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR). The Applicant is also preparing a draft Habitats Regulation 
Assessment (HRA), which it intends to submit to the Inspectorate for review in early 
2018. 
 
In terms of engagement with statutory consultees, the Inspectorate suggested that 
the Applicant should keep a log of all correspondence. The Inspectorate also advised 
the Applicant to create a framework of key issues and focus on reaching agreement 
on these, working with statutory consultees to draft Statements of Common Ground 
(SoCG), identifying areas of un-common ground too. 
 
The Inspectorate requested to be kept up to date on any consultation events, 
including feedback and issues raised at these events.  
 
The Inspectorate advised the Applicant to build time into their programme to allow for 
a full review of the draft documents. A full review of a suite of draft documents by the 
Inspectorate normally takes about 4 weeks, followed by a formal meeting. However, 
this depends on the number of documents and the particular issues raised. The 
Applicant confirmed their intention to use this service at the beginning of Q2 in 2018.  
 
Welsh Language Scheme  
 
The Inspectorate advised that it has a duty under the Welsh language Scheme with 
regard to publishing of documents in Welsh. They noted that the bilingual websites for 
the proposed the Wylfa Newydd Nuclear Power Station and North Wales Connection 
projects have now been launched.  
 
The Inspectorate advised the Applicant to consider which documents they may 
provide in Welsh. The Applicant may wish to consider translating supporting 
documents such as the Non-Technical Summary, Explanatory Memorandum, 
Statement of Reasons and Funding Statement, and others as necessary and 
proportionate to the project.  
 
Additionally, it would be beneficial if any information about the provision of translated 
documentation could be included in the Consultation Report to demonstrate how the 
issues regarding the Welsh language are being addressed during statutory 
consultation. The Applicant was also advised to inform the Inspectorate about what 
documents they have or plan to translate into Welsh.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
AOB 
 
The Applicant will provide a detailed programme to the Inspectorate for the 
submission of the application.  
 
The next teleconference will be arranged in December 2017 before the Applicant’s 
statutory consultation begins.

Formal Agreement Required with Natural Resources of Wales (NRW) for the Abergelli Power Station
Development Consent Order (DCO) Application.  
 
AECOM have been appointed as the EIA consultants for the Abergelli Power Station Project. This letter provides 
an outline of scope and methods that are to be agreed with Natural Resources of Wales (NRW) before we can 
progress the EIA.  As you can understand we are now working to a very tight program and would need agreement 
as soon as possible to meet submission deadlines.  
 
The table below outlines each of the environmental topics with outstanding comments requiring further 
information and direction. AECOM would be grateful if you could distribute these to the relevant departments and 
provide a response on each matter.

N/A 
18th and 19th May 2017 
Work followed JNCC (2010).  
 
All habitats within Site Boundary surveyed. Some 
areas access was constrained due to presence of 
horses.  
The Site supports woodland, rows of trees, 
standalone trees, dense and scattered 
scrub, improved, semi-improved and 
marshy grassland, tall ruderal vegetation, 
running water, fences and bare ground 
(hard standing).   
 
The development will require the partial 
removal of hedgerows, semi-natural 
broadleaved woodland, rows of trees, 
scrub, running water, ponds, hardstanding, 
marshy semi-improved and improved 
grassland and trees with potential for 
roosting bats.   
Site conditions not significantly 
different to those in 2014. No further 
Phase 1 survey required.

TPOs 
PB, 2014 
The presence of trees on the Project Site is not 
considered to be an obstruction to the Project. Careful 
consideration of trees at all stages of the development 
process will ensure that existing trees of high retention 
value are retained and protected throughout the 
Project. Suitable mitigation for any tree loss should be 
designed into the Project from the outset.

Invertebrates 
BSG, 2014

Site. One species is Red Data Book, two are 
nationally scarce and fourteen are S42 species. No 
protected species.

GCN 
BSG, 2014  
Smooth and palmate newts. 
May - June 2017 
A total of 26 ponds were identified within proximity 
of the Abergelli Site.   
 
An HSI Assessment was undertaken on all ponds 
within 500m of the Site and ponds outside of the 
500m but clustered with ponds within the 500m of 
the Site boundary.  
 
Following the HSI Assessment, off the 26 ponds 
identified, two were classed as poor (a further 
survey was undertaken on one of these) nine 
No great crested newts were identified 
during the manual surveys and the eDNA 
surveys undertaken were all returned with 
a negative result.  
 
Of the seven ponds that were not 
accessible. These are considered unlikely 
to support great crested newts given the 
lack of GCN records from the local records 
centre and the absence of GCN identified 
in other ponds during the surveys.  
 
The development proposals will 
require the removal of three ponds 
(Ponds 16, 22 and 23).  
 
Pond 22 currently supports palmate 
newts and is likely to support other 
amphibians including frogs and 
toads as well as a range of 
generalist aquatic invertebrates.

were dry and seven were not accessible and 
therefore could not be surveyed.  
 
Manual surveys were based on English Nature 
‘Great Crested Newt Mitigation Guidelines’ (2001) 
using three methods where possible.  
Pond 16 was dry.  
 
Pond 23 could not be assessed but 
if it contains water has the potential 
to support generalist aquatic 
invertebrates and common 
amphibians.  
Reptiles 
BSG, 2014 
A peak count of 50 common lizard. A peak count of 
five grass snake. Both breeding 
September 2017 
A survey will be undertaken in accordance with 
the guidelines provided in Froglife (Froglife 1999. 
Advice Sheet 10 – Reptile Survey. An Introduction 
to planning, conducting and interpreting surveys 
for snake and lizard conservation) and also the 
Herpetofauna Workers’ Manual (Gent, T and 
Gibson, S 1998. Herpetofauna Workers’ Manual. 
JNCC, Peterborough).  
 
Mats will be deployed in suitable habitat at a 
density of at least 10 per hectare on the 21st 
August and leave to 'bed in' for 7 - 10 days; 
conduct seven survey visits with at least 1 day 
between visits. Survey visits commence on 1st 
September 2017.

Breeding 
Birds 
BSG, 2014. Breeding birds incl. 
barn owl 
 
AECOM, 2017. Breeding birds 
June 2017, continue to 2018 
Nine S42 bird species considered likely to breed on 
site. Eight red list & eight amber list breeding.  
 
No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 were 
recorded. Two Schedule 1 species were recorded 
during the surveys, red kite and peregrine falcon. No 
evidence was found to suggest breeding of either 
species occurred within the Survey Site during 2014.  
There was no evidence of breeding barn owl breed. 
No signs of barn owl presence were found during 
building inspections and no birds were recorded 
during the 
breeding bird surveys. 
June 2018, 1 visit each in 
February and March 2018.  
Surveys follow BTO Common Bird Census 
methodology.  
 
Two visits in June 2017; two visits early in 2018, 
primarily for goshawks.  
Two visits in June 2017 identified the 
same assemblages as in 2014, most 
notable species were tree pipit, redpoll, 
cuckoo, song thrush, lapwings. No 
Schedule 1 species were recorded 
breeding. Habitat good for goshawks and 
records suggest that they may be present 
locally.  
Recommend two early morning 
surveys for goshawks in February 
and March 2018.  
Dormouse 
BSG 2014 
 
AECOM, 2017 
The dormouse survey was undertaken between June 
and November 2014. 
The survey did not record any dormouse in the areas 
surveyed. 
June - November 2017. May 
2018 if dormice confirmed as 
present and population 
estimate is required.  
The survey is following the guidelines set out in 
the Dormouse Conservation Handbook Second 
Edition (Bright, et al., 2006).  
Ninety seven tubes deployed May 2017 within 
areas of scrub woodland and along hedgerows 
suitable to support dormouse, set out at intervals 
of 15 – 20m. The tubes are being checked 
monthly using by a surveyor possessing a Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW) dormouse handling 
licence for the presence of dormice and also for 
signs of recently constructed dormouse nests. 
Tubes will be left in situ until end November 2017. 
A check in May 2018 will be reuqired if dormice 
are found to be present on Site.  
No evidence of dormice so far - checks so 
far in June and July.  
Habitats have not changed 
significantly since 2014. 
Recommend that surveys are 
ceased.  
Badger 
BSG, 2014. 
The targeted badger surveys identified five setts within 
the Survey Site with one main active sett, three 
subsidiary setts of which two showed signs of activity 
and one active outlier sett. Badger paths, dung pits, 
scrapes, footprints and feeding signs were found 
throughout the Survey Site. 
October 2017 
A badger survey will be undertaken within the Site 
boundary and a 100m buffer surrounding the Site 
(where access allows). The survey method will be 
based on the standard approach detailed in the 
Mammal Society publication Surveying Badgers 
(Harris et al., 1991). 
N/A 
Pre-construction checks to be 
undertaken.  
Otter & Water 
Vole 
BSG Otter & WV, 2014 
 
AECOM, 2017 
Suitable habitat on site. A single fresh spraint was 
recorded during the survey.  
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were 
observed. The holes have the right dimensions to 
allow use by water voles, but did not show signs of 
current occupation. No latrines, footprints or grazing 
lawns were observed during the survey. 
First visit: 28th June 2017  
Second visit: end of 
September 2017.  
All watercourses within the Site boundary and 
extending to 100m upstream/downstream of the 
Site boundary (where access allows) will be 
surveyed. Survey work will follow that 
recommended in Monitoring the Otter (Chanin, 
2003) and the Water Vole Conservation 
Handbook 3rd Edition (Strachan, Moorhouse and 
Gelling, 2011).  
No otter or WV signs along watercourses. 
Mainly unsuitable or sub-optimal habitat 
on Site, one watercourse to the south is 
suitable.

Bats 
BSG 2014.Walked transects, 
static detector, internal and 
external inspections of trees and 
buildings including 
emergence/re-entry surveys. 
 
AECOM 2017 & 2018 
At least seven species of bats were recorded during 
transect surveys; common pipistrelle, soprano 
pipistrelle, Myotis sp., long-eared bat., noctule, 
Leisler’s bat, and lesser horseshoe bat. All of these 
species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated bat detector surveys; Nathusius’ pipistrelle, 
serotine, and greater horseshoe bat. 
 
Roost surveys of buildings within the Survey Site 
confirmed that at least three buildings contained bat 
droppings and were used as bat roosts. Droppings 
from at least three species of bats (pipistrelle sp., 
long-eared bat sp. and lesser horseshoe bat) were 
found. Thirty three trees were located within the 
Survey Site that are thought to have potential to 
support roosting bats. 
 
Emergence and / or re-entry surveys were carried out 
on eight trees all of which would potentially 
be directly affected by the Project. No bats were 
recorded emerging from or entering these 
potential tree roosts. 
Walked transects and static 
loggers data collection 
commenced June 2017 for 
High value site; 
 
Roost assessment 
completed July and August 
2017, including climbed 
survey where safe and 
access allowed; 
 
Roost dusk-dawn surveys 
commenced on two buildings 
(Mod) and five trees (Mod) 
August 2017, due to 
complete September 2017.  
All bat work has been informed by the BCT 
guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
 
Site valued as having High potential for supporting 
forgaing and commuting bats.  
 
Static detectors: deployed and collected once per 
month April - October. Visits will be required in 
April and May 2018. 
 
Walked transects: two transects walked twice per 
month April - October. Visits will be required in 
April and May 2018.  
 
Zone of Influence (ZoI): for the main power station 
area in consideration of construction noise and 
vibration, and operational lighting the ZoI has 
been set to a 50m radius from the Site boundary, 
and for the rest of the site set to potential roosts 
within and adjacent to the Site boundary. 
Static loggers: Common and Soprano Pips 
most dominant species; Myotis - fairly 
abundant; big bats (noctule/ Leisler’s and 
serotine) - occasional; possible brown 
long-ear; lesser horseshoe - rare.  
 
Walked transects: Pip45, Pip55, Noctule, 
Myo x2 inc Daub, BLE, LHS 
 
No roosts confirmed, as of yet.  
Any confirmed roosts will require an 
additional survey (totalling three 
surveys). Unlikely to be able to 
conduct these in 2017 due to survey 
time remaining. As such will need to 
be undertaken in May 2018.  
 
Roost Assessment Building B4 first 
two surveys in August are 10 days 
apart, as opposed to 2 weeks, as 
recommended by guidelines. This 
was due to weather conditions. 
NRW & LPA to confirm no issue with 
this. 
 
Two small groups of trees (totalling 
~10) have not been assessed due to 
access issues. Survey due 22nd / 
23rd August 2017. Any Moderate or 
high risk trees will need to be 
surveyed in May and June 2018.  
 
Could not gain access to assessing 
Abergelli Farm (barn or houses) 
near to the Site boundary. Barn 
previously confirmed as a roost.

Project Overview 
 
1.1 
The meeting was held to brief local members on the 
revised Abergelli Power Limited (APL) project and 
forthcoming consultation process. 
 
1.2 
Chris McKerrow (CM) provided a summary of the 
project, DCO process, and PEIR, as well as the SoCC 
and consultation programme. 
 
1.3 
It was agreed that Clare Jones (CJ) would circulate 
the key consultation dates to the councillors to 
enable them to share information with local 
residents at the appropriate time (when full 
information is available). 
CJ 
 
Questions and Issues Raised 
 
2.1 
Key queries and issues raised included: 
 
2.2 
New Development: Concern about the impact on 
the new development proposed on neighbouring 
land 
 
2.3 
Connections: Questions about the gas and grid 
connections 
 
2.4 
Access: Queries about the access route and 
potential local impacts (particularly during 
construction) 
 
2.5 
Construction: Queries about the construction 
process and potential local impacts.  It was 
CJ 
 
 
 
 
G R A S S H O P P E R - C O M M S . C O . U K  
 
confirmed this would be addressed in the 
application (CJ to circulate further detail on this). 
2.6 
Supply Chain: Question about whether there will be 
local supplier opportunities – it was confirmed that 
Drax would be referencing the Council’s Beyond 
Bricks and Mortar initiative in relation to supply 
chain 
 
2.7 
Noise and Emissions: Questions about the potential 
impacts of the power plant in terms of noise and 
emissions.  It was confirmed that the power plant 
proposals will need to demonstrate that there is 
not a significant impact, and it was also highlighted 
that the plant would only operate 2,250 hours a 
year during times of peak demand for electricity. 
 
2.8 
Jobs: The issue of jobs was discussed, and it was 
explained that there would be significant local job 
opportunities during construction, with a limited 
number of jobs available during operation 
(maximum of 15).  
 
2.9 
Community Benefit Fund: It was queried whether 
there will be a community benefit fund associated 
with the scheme – and confirmed that one is 
currently not proposed but it was suggested that 
further conversation will need to be had about 
community benefit associated with the scheme. One 
issue highlighted is that other funds – such as the 
Mynydd y Gwair Wind Farm fund (£240K per year) 
are distributed using the Council’s Voluntary 
Services and can be used by communities across the 
whole Local Authority area.  The local preference 
would be for funds to be focused on local impacted 
communities. It was pointed out that the £240k per 
year is a significant sum and that the economics of 
this power station would be different owing to the 
absence of a renewable support contract. 
 
2.10 
Business rates: It was highlighted that the power 
station would attract significant business rates. It’s 
 
 
 
 
 
G R A S S H O P P E R - C O M M S . C O . U K  
 
not clear if these rates are paid to the local 
authority or direct to the Welsh Government 
2.11 
Health and Safety: The issue was raised about what 
would happen if there was a catastrophic incident 
at the power station. It was confirmed that this will 
be covered off in in the DCO application and CM 
highlighted that gas fired power stations have been 
operating in the UK since the early 1990s and have 
an excellent safety record– but further information 
about this can be provided to the members.

Summary of key points discussed and advice given: 
 
Welcome and introductions 
 
The Applicant and the Planning Inspectorate (the Inspectorate) team introduced 
themselves and their respective roles. Hefin Jones was introduced as the new Case 
Manager for the project, who would be taking over from Tracey Williams. The 
Inspectorate outlined its openness policy and ensured that those present understood 
that any issues discussed and advice given would be recorded and placed on the 
Inspectorate’s website under section 51 of the Planning Act 2008 (PA2008). Further to 
this, it was made clear that any advice given did not constitute legal advice upon 
which the Applicant (or others) can rely.  
 
Project update 
 
The Applicant provided an update regarding the preparation ahead of its statutory s42 
consultation, which is due to commence on 16 January 2018 and close on 19 February 
2018. The Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) under s47 of the PA2008 has 
been completed, following the consultation with Swansea Council whose comments 
 
 
have been considered and incorporated within the document. The finalised SoCC will 
be available in both English and Welsh. The Applicant intends to submit s46 
notification and all consultation material to the Inspectorate in the week commencing 
8 January 2018. The Inspectorate advised the Applicant to ensure that the 
consultation information provided on the Applicant’s website and sent to the 
consultees is consistent throughout and there are no differences between copies of 
the documents.   
 
The Applicant advised that in terms of the compulsory acquisition a settlement has 
been negotiated for the main site of the Proposed Development; and they have 
conducted further surveys of the gas connection route to refine the final red line 
boundary, which will form the basis for further discussions with the potentially 
affected landowners. The Applicant’s intention is to finalise details and resolve any 
issues relating to the routes ahead of submission of the Development Consent Order 
(DCO) application. The Applicant also confirmed its intention to submit the 
Environmental Permit application to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) at around the 
same time as the DCO application. NRW are aware of the proposed programme for 
submission.  
 
The Applicant is advised that if the DCO application is accepted for Examination, the 
Examining Authority will be seeking assurance that the necessary environmental 
permit is capable of being granted. 
 
The Inspectorate advised that a full review of a suite of draft application documents 
takes about 6 to 8 weeks, and the Applicant may wish to consider submitting only 
those documents that raise new or novel issues. The Applicant is keen to submit the 
same suite of draft application documents for a review to the Inspectorate as on the 
Millbrook Power project. These are: the DCO; Explanatory Memorandum; Statement 
of Reasons; Funding Statement; Book of Reference; Habitats Regulations Assessment 
(HRA) No Significant Effects Report; and some Land and Works Plans. The Applicant 
indicated that these documents would be submitted to the Inspectorate for review in 
March 2018. 
 
The Applicant noted that the draft HRA will be included in the suite of documents 
published during the s42 consultation period for review and comment. This will allow 
the Applicant to address NRW’s comments prior to submission of the draft HRA report 
to the Inspectorate as part of the draft documents review. 
 
The project is on track to be submitted in Q2 of 2018.  
 
Welsh Language Standards   
 
The Applicant stated that it has reached agreement with Swansea Council regarding 
the consistent approach to providing project documents bilingually, during the 
consultation period, and would provide relevant information in leaflets, and on the 
information boards for the public consultation events.  
 
The Welsh Language Standards require a public body to ensure that translation 
facilities are present for any event they hold in Wales, regardless of whether anyone 
has indicated that they wish to speak in Welsh in advance.  
 
Although the Inspectorate is a public body, and is responsible for the running of the 
events, it is the Applicant’s responsibility to arrange venues for Preliminary Meeting 
 
 
and any hearings and to ensure that the necessary facilities are available. As such the 
Applicant must provide the translation facilities for all sessions. 
 
AOB 
 
The Applicant will provide a detailed programme to the Inspectorate for the 
submission of the DCO application.  
 
A telecon project update meeting will be arranged after the statutory consultation 
period has ended. The next face-to-face meeting will be arranged after the 
Inspectorate’s review of the draft application documents.

Summary of key points discussed and advice given: 
 
Welcome and Introductions 
 
The Applicant and the Planning Inspectorate (the Inspectorate) team introduced 
themselves and their respective roles. The Inspectorate outlined its openness policy 
and ensured that those present understood that any issues discussed and advice 
given would be recorded and placed on the Inspectorate’s website under section 51 of 
the Planning Act 2008 (PA2008). Further to this, it was made clear that any advice 
given did not constitute legal advice upon which the Applicant (or others) can rely.  
 
Project update 
 
The Applicant provided an update in relation to the project and programme timelines, 
and confirmed that statutory consultation will be conducted in January and February 
2018, followed by submission of the DCO application in Q2 of 2018. The Applicant 
explained that the programme and the submission date are dependent on the next 
available capacity market auction and therefore they will be reviewing ‘lessons 
learned’ from the pre-application stage and review of the draft application documents 
for the Millbrook Power project which is due to be submitted several months earlier, 
ahead of Abergelli. The Applicant intends to be as consistent as possible with the 
approach taken for the Millbrook Power project when preparing for the Abergelli DCO 
submission. 
 
Regarding the post-submission programme, the Inspectorate confirmed that although 
timescales are fixed (apart from the pre-examination stage), the pre-application stage 
of the project development is essential in the smooth running of the process. It will be 
essential for the Applicant to undertake effective consultation and for the application 
to be fit for purpose.  
 
The Applicant advised that compulsory acquisition negotiations with the landowners 
are on-going, with the project’s exact redline boundary yet to be confirmed. 
Environmental surveys are also on-going, with the resulting information to be fed into 
the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR). The Applicant is also 
preparing a draft Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA), which it intends to submit to 
the Inspectorate for review in early 2018. 
 
In terms of engagement with statutory consultees, the Inspectorate suggested that 
the Applicant should keep a log of all correspondence. The Inspectorate also advised 
the Applicant to create a framework of key issues and focus on reaching agreement 
on these, working with statutory consultees to draft Statements of Common Ground 
(SoCG), identifying areas of un-common ground too. 
 
The Inspectorate requested to be kept up to date on any consultation events, 
including feedback and issues raised at these events.  
 
The Inspectorate advised the Applicant to build time into their programme to allow for 
a full review of the draft documents. A full review of a suite of draft documents by the 
Inspectorate normally takes about 4 weeks, followed by a formal meeting. However, 
this depends on the number of documents and the particular issues raised. The 
Applicant confirmed their intention to use this service at the beginning of Q2 in 2018.  
 
Welsh Language Scheme  
 
The Inspectorate advised that it has a duty under the Welsh language Scheme with 
regard to publishing of documents in Welsh. They noted that the bilingual websites for 
the proposed the Wylfa Newydd Nuclear Power Station and North Wales Connection 
projects have now been launched.  
 
The Inspectorate advised the Applicant to consider which documents they may 
provide in Welsh. The Applicant may wish to consider translating supporting 
documents such as the Non-Technical Summary, Explanatory Memorandum, 
Statement of Reasons and Funding Statement, and others as necessary and 
proportionate to the project.  
 
Additionally, it would be beneficial if any information about the provision of translated 
documentation could be included in the Consultation Report to demonstrate how the 
issues regarding the Welsh language are being addressed during statutory 
consultation. The Applicant was also advised to inform the Inspectorate about what 
documents they have or plan to translate into Welsh.   
 
 
 
AOB 
 
The Applicant will provide a detailed programme to the Inspectorate for the 
submission of the application.  
 
The next teleconference will be arranged in December 2017 before the Applicant’s 
statutory consultation begins.
