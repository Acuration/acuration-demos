Manifesto for Clean Growth Summary – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Clean Growth Leadership Group
SCDI’s Clean Growth Leadership Group brings together partners from across the public, private and third 
sectors to lead the way to Net Zero.
We published an interim report in June, Building Scotland’s Green Recovery. Our plan for Scotland’s Green 
Recovery from the COVID-19 crisis featured 12 big ideas to respond to the climate emergency with the same 
urgency as the public health emergency.
This new report builds on that work and looks beyond the immediate crisis towards the horizon of 2045 and 
asks: 
What are the Clean Growth opportunities for Scotland of the transition to Net Zero – 
and how can we maximise them?
We have engaged with businesses, organisations, experts and stakeholders across all sectors and all geographies 
of the Scottish economy. Interviews, roundtables and surveys throughout 2020 have helped to inform this 
report and its recommendations. Our ideas are backed by business and have been shaped by SCDI’s diverse 
membership.
We all have our part to play in Scotland’s Clean Growth future and this report sets out how we can work 
together to accelerate the pace of change.
Our Vision
We believe Scotland’s social, economic and natural resources – from our skilled workforce and unrivalled 
landscape, to our innovative businesses and world-class colleges and universities – give us unique advantages 
which we can leverage to capture the economic value of the global transition to Net Zero.
Our vision is for Scotland to be a world leader in Clean Growth which delivers for people, for our economy and 
for our planet:

Scotland’s Clean Growth opportunities
This report identifies 7 Clean Growth opportunities and 21 priority actions for Scotland. It makes 
recommendations to government, business and industry, academia and education, regulators, investors, 
communities and citizens about how we can each contribute, and how we can collaborate with each other, to 
maximise them.
Together, they represent our Manifesto for Clean Growth:
1 
INDUSTRY 
Transform Industry
We can establish world-leading 
circular and bio economies 
in Scotland to transform and 
decarbonise industry to boost 
innovation, protect jobs and 
create green jobs in the new green 
sectors of the Net Zero economy
A Scottish Government and 
Zero Waste Scotland should 
bring forward plans for repair, 
durability and sustainability 
ratings for all electronic 
and household appliances 
supported by a national repair 
network
B Industry should build 
sectoral and cross-sectoral 
partnerships which develop 
circular expertise, innovations, 
strategies and new supply 
chains for reuse materials and 
repairs with support from 
Zero Waste Scotland, SEPA 
and Innovation Centres
C UK Government and Scottish 
Government should back 
biotechnological innovation 
which supports industry 
to decarbonise, transform 
Grangemouth into a 
biorefinery and protect jobs 
through public investment, 
innovation, incentives and 
innovation support
2
ENERGY 
Clean Energy Innovation 
World Leader
We can build on our existing 
world-class energy expertise 
to maximise renewable energy 
generation and flexible storage, 
pioneer CCUS and build a 
hydrogen economy to create green 
jobs, strengthen domestic supply 
chains and lead in the Clean 
Growth technologies of the future
A Industry should work with 
Scottish Government to 
build an internationally 
competitive domestic supply 
chain for renewable energy 
manufacturing and related 
services and increase local 
content in equipment and 
people
B UK Government should 
bring forward the necessary 
funding to accelerate the 
Acorn CCS Project and 
establish a CCS Hub at St 
Fergus as one of the UK’s four 
clusters
C Scottish Government and UK 
Government should invest in 
innovation, infrastructure and 
incentives to scale-up green 
and blue hydrogen production 
and use
3 
CONNECTIVITY 
Net Zero Domestic 
Connectivity
We can accelerate modal shift to 
active travel and public transport, 
invest in transport technology, 
innovation and infrastructure, 
transform supply chains and 
deepen digital connectivity to 
deliver world-leading Net Zero 
domestic connectivity by 2030
A UK Government and 
Scottish Government should 
work together to revisit 
the potential for a national 
model of road user pricing 
or similar measures to 
address congestion and fund 
future low- and zero-carbon 
infrastructure
B Industry should work with 
Scottish Government and 
local authorities to accelerate 
the building of a national 
network of EV and Ultra-
Fast charging and hydrogen 
refuelling points as an urgent 
priority
C UK Government, Scottish 
Government, industry and 
communities should work 
together to reduce demand 
for travel and level the digital 
playing field by connecting all 
of Scotland with future-proof 
5G infrastructure, prioritising 
rollout in hardest-to-reach 
communities
4
PLACE 
Sustainable 
Communities
We can lock-in local value, 
increase planning ambition 
and resources, accelerate 
retrofit, decarbonise heat and 
raise building standards to 
build and nurture sustainable, 
resilient and thriving 
communities 
A Public sector should 
mobilise total public 
spending of £81 billion 
in Scotland for Clean 
Growth through 
Community Wealth 
Building to create local, 
green jobs, build local, 
resilient supply chains and 
back inclusive, sustainable 
business models
B National Planning 
Framework 4 should 
recognise a presumption 
in favour for Net Zero 
developments within 
the context of plan-led 
development
C Scottish Government 
should provide strategic 
ambition, regulatory 
certainty, support 
businesses to adapt and 
innovate and implement 
an ambitious Net Zero 
Standard for all new 
buildings by 2023
5
PEOPLE 
Green Skills Revolution
We can drive a Green Skills 
Revolution which builds 
green skills across society 
and invests in the reskilling, 
upskilling and lifelong learning 
of our people to prepare them 
for the green industries of the 
future to create new green 
jobs, boost productivity, raise 
wages and attract inward 
investment
A All schools, colleges, 
universities, training 
providers and employers 
should embed core 
green skills and carbon 
literacy across curricula, 
professional learning and 
work-based learning
B Scottish Government 
should coordinate a 
voluntary, inclusive 
and accessible 
National Service for 
Net Zero programme 
of employment 
and volunteering 
opportunities across 
the public, private and 
third sectors backed by a 
Green Skills Passport
C Scottish Government 
should create a Reskilling 
and Upskilling Fund which 
empowers every Scottish 
adult to fund reskilling or 
upskilling opportunities at 
any stage of their life or 
career
6
FINANCE 
Close the 
Investment Gap
We can deliver a green 
stimulus, unlock green finance 
and recognise climate risks 
to fund the transition to Net 
Zero, deliver co-benefits 
for society, economy and 
environment and establish 
Scotland as a world leader 
in ethical, responsible and 
sustainable investment
A UK Government and 
Scottish Government 
should scale-up public 
investment funded 
through additional 
affordable borrowing 
and taxation of carbon 
emissions to deliver a 
large-scale green stimulus
B Scottish Government 
should develop the Inward 
Investment Plan into a Net 
Zero inward investment 
proposition which 
positions Scotland as 
the home of sustainable 
business
C UK Government should 
work with industry and 
devolved administrations 
to agree a new carbon 
pricing mechanism 
which aligns with Net 
Zero, fully accounts for 
carbon emissions and 
helps to funds Clean 
Growth innovation and 
infrastructure, including 
supporting a viable 
business model for CCUS
7
NATURE
Nature-Rich Future
We can reverse biodiversity 
loss, transform agriculture, 
support sustainable forestry, 
restore our peatlands and 
grow the Blue Economy to 
ensure a nature-rich future for 
all of Scotland
A Scottish Government 
should recognise the 
nature emergency and set 
ambitious nature targets 
to reverse biodiversity 
loss which are aligned 
with Scotland’s climate 
targets
B Scottish Government 
should propose a new 
system of farm support 
payments which protects 
and restores biodiversity, 
support innovative 
and sustainable food 
production and is aligned 
with expanded and 
strengthened advisory 
services for farmers and 
crofters
C Scottish Government, its 
agencies, industry and 
academia should work 
together to shape and 
deliver the Blue Economy 
Action Plan, doubling the 
size of the sector by 2030 
and positioning Scotland 
as a global leader in 
marine innovation and 
sustainability

The Way Forward
We know that this report is just the beginning. We know that the costs and challenges of delivery and the 
transition to Net Zero will be high – but the costs of failing to act for people, our economy and our planet will be 
even higher.
We must act and invest now to maximise Scotland’s Clean Growth opportunities and to achieve Net Zero by 
2045, giving real confidence and fresh hope to our young people and to future generations. The returns will also 
be high and we can all reap the rewards in the years and decades ahead.
We therefore propose 7 fundamental principles for the way forward to inform the implementation of our ideas:
1. Ambition
 
We all need to act with ambition to make Scotland a world leader in Clean Growth, because of the scale of 
the opportunity to strengthen social, economic and environmental prosperity.
 
2. Collaboration
 
We all need to work together to achieve Net Zero by 2045, because of the complexity and scale of the 
challenge. This should be the starting point of any action.
3. Integration
 
We need to think holistically and develop cross-sectoral partnerships and plans, because silos will create 
unintended consequences. We should provide certainty and foresight to allow businesses and individuals to 
prepare and adapt.
4. Fairness
 
We need to deliver a Just Transition which leaves no one and no community behind, because we cannot 
accept or afford inequality.
5. Governance
 
We need robust national governance and oversight to coordinate delivery, because there are many different 
actors across Scotland’s economy and society which need to play their part to achieve Net Zero by 2045.
6. Pace
 
We all need to act with urgency to respond to the climate and nature emergencies and to maximise Clean 
Growth in Scotland, because time is short to save the planet and build our competitive advantage. We should 
be happy to test and learn what works, be comfortable with incomplete knowledge and accept that failure is a 
risk worth taking.
7. Strategy
 
We need to think strategically and develop long-term partnerships and plans, because systemic change can 
be difficult and will take time. We should take this opportunity to start and continue a national dialogue about 
how we meet any funding gaps, realising that our investments will also bring economic opportunities.
