Symbol:DRX
Interim Management Statement
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 July 2008 to date.
Since publishing our Half Year Results on 5 August, trading conditions in the commodity markets in
which we operate have continued to improve. We now anticipate that our full year results will be
modestly higher than current market EBITDA consensus. This is primarily a consequence of low
reserve margins in the UK electricity market for the last quarter of 2008 leading to improvements in
dark green spreads. Our expectations for the year are based on our current contracted position as
well as prevailing conditions in the commodity markets.
We are also pleased to report that we have successfully completed on schedule the turbine retrofit
on the second of Drax’s six units and that the unit is operating in line with expectations.
We have made a separate announcement today regarding the expansion of our biomass strategy.
Other than the above, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any material change
in the underlying financial position of the Group during the period.
We will issue a pre close statement on 16 December 2008 in which we will update the market on
the Group’s contracted positions for 2008, 2009 and 2010.
