one new tower (which will 
replace an existing tower 
and be located in the 
existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, 
thereby resulting in no net 
additional towers). This 
option would require two 
SECs, one located on each 
side of the existing 
transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be 
connected via underground 
cables approximately 500
