FSC Values Declaration 
Acknowledged by Drax in Appendix 2 of the FSC Licensing Agreement 
 
Self-Declaration 
regarding FSC-POL-01-004 (Policy for the Association of Organizations with FSC) 
 
The signing Organization (Drax) is associated with the Forest Stewardship Council A.C., Oaxaca, Mexico, or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates 
(hereinafter: FSC) by being either a member of or having a contractual relationship with FSC. Hereby the signing Organization explicitly states that it 
has read and understood the "Policy for the Association of Organizations with FSC" as published under www.fsc.org. This policy stipulates FSC's position 
with regards to unacceptable activities by organizations and individuals, which already are or would like to be associated with FSC, as well as the 
mechanism for disassociation. 
 
In light of the above, the Organization explicitly agrees now and in the future, as long as the 
relationship with FSC exists, not to be directly or indirectly involved in the following unacceptable 
activities: 
 
a) Illegal logging or the trade in illegal wood or forest products; 
b) Violation of traditional and human rights in forestry operations; 
c) Destruction of high conservation values in forestry operations; 
d) Significant conversion of forests to plantations or non-forest use; 
e) Introduction of genetically modified organisms in forestry operations; 
 
Drax subscribes to the FSC core labor requirements.  Drax will strive to implement the FSC core labor requirements, giving due consideration to the 
rights and obligations established by national law, while seeking to meet the objectives of these requirements.  The core labor requirements followed are: 
•    The organization shall not use child labor 
•    The organization shall avoid all forms of forced and compulsory labor 
•    The organization shall ensure that there is no discrimination in employment and occupation, and 
•    The organization shall respect freedom of association and the effective right to collective bargaining.
