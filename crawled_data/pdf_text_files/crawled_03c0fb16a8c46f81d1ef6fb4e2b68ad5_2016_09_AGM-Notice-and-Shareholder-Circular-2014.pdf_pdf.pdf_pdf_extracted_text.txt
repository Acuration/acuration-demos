SIP participants
You are unable to attend the meeting unless you hold shares registered in your own name.
You are requested to:
 
k Complete and sign the enclosed Form of Direction in order to instruct Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited how you would like 
them to vote on your behalf. Completed Forms of Direction should be returned to Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, 
Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA as soon as possible and in any event so as to be received by Equiniti Limited no later than

on 16 April 2014.
If you are a SIP participant and you also own shares in your own right, then you will need to complete both the Form of Direction 
and the Form of Proxy and submit them both, either online or by post.
Voting arrangements
Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM will be by poll, rather than on a show of hands, so that all votes are 
included, whether or not the shareholder is able to attend the meeting. The Board believes this to be the most democratic 
procedure for voting on resolutions as member votes will be counted according to the number of shares held. 
The results of the voting at the meeting and the number of proxy votes cast for and against and the number of  votes actively 
withheld in respect of each of the resolutions proposed at the meeting will be announced to the London Stock Exchange as soon 
as practicable following the meeting and will also be published on the Company’s website www.drax.com.
The Company has included on the Form of Proxy and the Form of Direction a “Vote withheld” option in order for shareholders to 
abstain from voting on any particular resolution. However, an abstention is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the 
calculation of the proportion of votes “For” or “Against” the relevant resolution.
Recommendation
The directors of the Company consider that the resolutions to be put to the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its 
members as a whole.
Accordingly, the directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of all the proposed resolutions as they intend to do in 
respect of their own beneficial interests.
Yours sincerely
Charles Berry  
Chairman

Resolution 1
To receive and adopt the Company’s Annual report and accounts
The directors are required to present to the meeting the Annual report and accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 
2013. This includes (i) the audited accounts (ii) the directors’ report; (iii) the directors’ remuneration report; (iv) the strategic report; 
and (v) the report of the auditor of the Company on the audited accounts and the auditable part of the directors’ 
remuneration report.
Resolutions 2 and 3
Directors’ remuneration report 
These resolutions seek shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Annual report on remuneration  and the 
Annual statement to shareholders by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, which together form the directors’ 
remuneration report. The directors’ remuneration report can be found on pages 78 to 98 of the Annual report and accounts. 
New regulations came into force on 1 October 2013 which require the Company to offer shareholders:
(i)  a binding vote on the Company’s forward‑looking remuneration policy (i.e. the Directors’ Remuneration Policy) at least every 
three years; and 
(ii)  a separate annual advisory vote on the implementation of the Company’s existing remuneration policy in terms of the 
payments and share awards made to directors during the year (i.e. the Annual report on remuneration).
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which can be found on pages 80 to 88 of the 
Annual report and accounts. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy sets out the Company’s future policy on directors’ remuneration, 
including the setting of the directors’ pay and the granting of share awards. Details on how the policy will be applied in practice 
following the 2014 AGM are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 88 to 98 of the Annual report and accounts. 
If Resolution 2 is approved, the effective date of the Remuneration Policy will be 24 April 2014, i.e. immediately following the 2014 
AGM. Payments will continue to be made to directors and former directors (in their capacity as directors) in line with existing 
contractual arrangements until that date. The policy remains consistent with that which operated during the 2013 financial year 
and was approved at the 2013 AGM under the previous reporting framework. 
If the Directors’ Remuneration Policy is approved (and once it commences), all payments by the Company to directors and any 
former directors (in their capacity as directors) will be made in accordance with the policy (unless a payment has separately been 
approved by a shareholder resolution). Additionally, if the Directors’ Remuneration Policy is approved and remains unchanged, it 
will be valid for up to three financial years without new shareholder approval being required. If the Company wished to change the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, it would need to put the revised policy to a vote again, before it could implement that new policy.
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval for the Annual statement to shareholders by the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Annual report on remuneration which can be found on pages 78 to 80 of the Annual report and accounts. 
The Annual report on remuneration gives details of the implementation of the Company’s current Remuneration Policy in terms of 
the payments and share awards made to the directors in connection with their performance and that of the Company during the 
year ended 31 December 2013. This vote is advisory and will not affect the way in which the Remuneration Policy has 
been implemented. 
The Company’s auditor during the year, Deloitte LLP, has audited those parts of the directors’ remuneration report that are 
required to be audited and their report may be found on pages 99 to 101 of the Annual report and accounts.
Resolution 4
To approve the final dividend
To declare the final dividend of 8.9 pence per ordinary share, which is recommended by the directors for payment to shareholders 
on the register of members of the Company at 4.30pm on 25 April 2014. If approved by shareholders at the AGM, the final dividend 
will be paid on 16 May 2014.
Resolutions 5 to 13
To elect the directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all directors retire at least every three years. However, in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors have resolved that they will all retire and that those 
wishing to serve again shall submit themselves for re‑election by the shareholders. Accordingly each of the directors will retire at 
the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, each will offer themselves for re‑election through separate Resolutions numbered 5 to 
13. Each of the director’s biographical notes are set out on pages 59 to 61 of the Annual report and accounts.
The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non‑executive directors being proposed for election or re‑election meet 
the independence criteria prescribed in the UK Corporate Governance Code as all are independent in character and judgement 
and there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.
PART C
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM
7
Drax Group plc
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2014
During the year, the Board completed an annual performance evaluation of its performance and that of its Committees and 
individual directors. Following that evaluation, the Chairman is satisfied that the performance of each director standing for 
re‑election continues to be effective and that each director continues to demonstrate commitment to the role. More information 
about these matters can be found on page 66 of the Annual report and accounts.
Resolutions 14 and 15
Reappointment of auditor and determination of their remuneration
The Company must appoint or reappoint the auditor at every general meeting at which accounts are presented and it is normal 
practice for a company’s directors, acting through the Audit Committee, to be authorised to determine the auditor’s remuneration. 
Deloitte LLP has advised of its willingness to continue in office as the auditor of the Company.
Resolution 16
To give authority to make certain expenditure in accordance with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums  
Act 2000
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 imposed restrictions on companies making donations to EU political 
organisations or incurring EU political expenditure without shareholders’ consent. It is not the policy of the Company to make 
donations to political parties and the directors have no intention of changing that policy.
However, it is possible that normal business activities, which might not be thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, 
could be caught. For example, activities such as communicating with government and political parties at local, national and 
European level, expenditure on organisations concerned with policy review, law reform and representation of the business 
community and making provisions for employees to take time off work to campaign for and hold public office could fall within the 
definition of EU political expenditure. In view of the broad wording and the Board’s wish to avoid any inadvertent infringement of 
the Act, it is seeking the authority for the Company and any wholly‑owned subsidiary company to incur total annual expenditure 
for such purposes of not more than £200,000 until the earlier of the conclusion of the 2015 AGM and 22 April 2015. This authority 
will not be used to make political donations as they are normally understood, including contributions towards any general political 
party expenses or in connection with general election campaigns.
It is the intention that the Company will seek to renew this authority, if appropriate, at each subsequent AGM.
Resolution 17
Authority of directors to allot shares
The authority given to the directors to allot further shares in the capital of the Company requires the prior authorisation of the 
shareholders in general meeting under Section 551 Companies Act 2006. Upon the passing of Resolution 17, the directors will 
have authority (pursuant to paragraph (a) of the Resolution) to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £15,583,151, 
which is approximately one‑third of the current issued ordinary share capital as at 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice. This authority will expire immediately following the AGM in 2015 or on 30 June 2015, 
whichever is the earlier.
In addition, in accordance with the guidance from the Association of British Insurers on the expectations of institutional investors 
in relation to the authority of directors to allot shares, upon the passing of Resolution 17, the directors will have authority (pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of the Resolution) to allot ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders up 
to a maximum nominal value of £31,166,301, as reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph (a) of 
Resolution 17. This amount (before any reduction) represents approximately two‑thirds of the Company’s current issued ordinary 
share capital as at 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice.
This authority will also expire immediately following the next AGM or on 30 June 2015, whichever is the earlier. As a result, if 
Resolution 17 is passed, the directors could allot shares representing up to two‑thirds of its current issued share capital pursuant 
to a rights issue.
The directors will continue to seek to renew these authorities at each AGM, in accordance with current best practice from time 
to time.
The directors have no current plans to exercise this authority except in connection with employee share plans.
As at 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice, the Company held no equity securities 
in treasury.

Resolution 18
Disapplication of pre‑emption rights
If the directors wish to exercise the authority under Resolution 17 and offer shares (or sell any shares which the Company may 
purchase and elect to hold as treasury shares) for cash, the Companies Act 2006 requires that unless shareholders have given 
specific authority for the waiver of their statutory pre‑emption rights, the new shares must be offered first to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. In certain circumstances, it may be in the best interests of the Company 
to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to 
their holdings.
Resolution 18 would authorise the directors to do this by allowing the directors to allot shares for cash (i) by way of a rights issue 
(subject to certain exclusions), (ii) by way of an open offer or other offer of securities (not being a rights issue) in favour of existing 
shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings (subject to certain exclusions) and (iii) otherwise than under (i) or (ii), up to an 
aggregate nominal value of £2,337,473  which is equivalent to approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company on 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice. The Resolution also applies to 
the sale and re‑issue of ordinary shares held as treasury shares by the Company.
If given, the authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM in 2015 or on 30 June 2015, if earlier. The directors intend to 
renew such power at successive AGMs in accordance with current best practice.
The directors have no current plans to exercise this authority, except in connection with employee share plans and any scrip 
dividend plan (but they consider its grant to be appropriate in order to preserve maximum flexibility for the future).  
In addition and in line with best practice, the Company has not issued more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a non‑
pre‑emptive basis over the last three years. In accordance with the Pre‑Emption Group’s Statement of Principles regarding 
cumulative usage of authorities, the directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company (excluding treasury shares) for cash on a non pre‑emptive basis in any rolling three‑year period without prior 
consultation with shareholders.
As at 12 March 2014 being the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice, the Company held no equity securities 
in treasury.
Resolution 19
To authorise the Company to purchase its own shares
This Resolution is to authorise the Company to buy back up to 40,469,759 ordinary shares. The authority would expire at the 
conclusion of the 2015 AGM or, if earlier, on 22 October 2015. The directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent 
AGMs in accordance with current best practice.
The Resolution specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased (representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 12 March 2014) and the maximum and minimum prices at which they may be bought, exclusive 
of expenses, reflecting the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules.
The directors have no present intention of exercising this power other than with a view for use in relation to the Company’s share 
plans and the granting of this authority should not be taken to imply that any ordinary shares will be purchased, other than in 
relation to share plans. Except in relation to share plans, no purchase of ordinary shares will be made unless it is expected that the 
effect will be to increase earnings per share and the directors considers it to be in the best interests of all shareholders.
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company is allowed to hold its own shares in treasury following a buy back, instead of having 
to cancel them. This gives the Company the ability to re‑issue treasury shares quickly and cost‑effectively (including pursuant to 
the authority under Resolution 17 above) and provides the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its 
capital base.
Such shares may be re‑sold for cash but all rights attaching to them, including voting rights and any right to receive dividends are 
suspended whilst they are held in treasury. If the directors exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 19, the Company will 
have the option of either holding in treasury or of cancelling any of its own shares purchased pursuant to this authority and will 
decide at the time of purchase which option to pursue.
The total number of options to subscribe for, and awards over, shares outstanding at 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice, was 5,927,074. This represents approximately 1.46% of the issued share capital at that 
date. If the Company was to buy back the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted pursuant to this Resolution, then the 
total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding at 12 March 2014 would represent approximately 1.63% of 
the reduced issued share capital.

Drax Group plc
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2014
Resolution 20
To allow general meetings to be held on 14 clear days’ notice in certain circumstances
Resolution 20 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice. The 
Shareholders’ Rights Regulations state that the notice period required for general meetings of the Company is 21 days, unless 
shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot, however, be less than 14 clear days. AGMs will continue to be held on 
at least 21 clear days’ notice.
In order to preserve the Company’s ability to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice,  
Resolution 20 seeks such approval. The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only 
where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Note that changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ 
notice, the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting. The Company provides 
this facility (see paragraph 11 of Part D on page 11 of this document for the Company’s arrangements for electronic 
proxy appointments).

Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2014

Entitlement to attend and vote
1.  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended) and for the purposes of Section 
360B Companies Act 2006, the Company specifies that only those shareholders registered on the Register of Members at 
6.00pm on the day, two business days before the date of the meeting (the “Specified Time”) (or if the meeting is adjourned to a 
time more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, by 6.00pm on the day which is two business days prior to the time of the 
adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote thereat in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at 
that time. If the meeting is adjourned to a time not more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, that time will also apply for 
the purposes of determining the entitlement of members to attend and vote (and for the purposes of determining the number 
of votes they may cast) at the adjourned meeting. Changes to the Register after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in 
determining rights to attend and vote.
2.  If you have sold or transferred all your shares, this booklet and any accompanying documents (but not the personalised Form 
of Proxy or Form of Direction) should be passed to the person through whom the sale or transfer was made for transmission to 
the purchaser or transferee.
Appointment of proxies
3.  If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 1 above you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to 
exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. Completion and return of a Form of Proxy will not 
prevent a member from attending in person and voting at the meeting. If a member appoints more than one proxy to attend 
the meeting, each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member.
 
 If a member wishes to appoint more than one proxy and so requires additional proxy forms, the member should contact the 
Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using their 
telephone helpline service on 0871 384 2030 from within the UK (calls to this number cost 8 pence per minute plus network 
charges). Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday – excluding Bank Holidays; or +44 121 415 7047 from 
outside the UK.
4.  A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the meeting for the member’s vote to be counted. 
Your proxy could be the Chairman, another director of the Company or another person who has agreed to attend to represent 
you. Details of how to appoint the Chairman or another person (or persons) as your proxy using the Form of Proxy are set out in 
the notes to the Form of Proxy. Appointing a proxy does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person.
5.  You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes on the Form of Proxy. A Form of Proxy 
is enclosed. To be effective, the Form of Proxy must be completed and signed and, together with the power of attorney or 
authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a duly certified copy of any such power or authority) or any adjournment thereof 
must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours, excluding non‑business days, before the time of the 
meeting or must be lodged using the CREST proxy voting services – see note 7 below. Return of a completed Form of Proxy 
will not preclude a member from attending and voting personally at the meeting.
6.  In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint 
holders appear in the Company’s Register in respect of the joint holding (the first‑named being deemed the most senior). 
7.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via 
www.euroclear.com). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be 
valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘‘CREST Proxy Instruction’’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described 
in the CREST Manual.
 
 The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (Equiniti Limited 
CREST participant ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 5 above. For this purpose 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed 
by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means.  
 
 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & 
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and 
limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member

concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting 
service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.
 
 In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings  
(www.euroclear.com).
 
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
8.  A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the 
Resolution. If you either select the “discretionary” option or if no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from 
voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter 
which is put before the meeting.
9.  If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is given discretion as to how the votes the subject of those proxies are 
cast and the voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies, when added to the interests in the Company’s securities 
already held by the Chairman, result in the Chairman holding such number of voting rights that he has a notifiable obligation 
under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make necessary notifications to the Company and the 
Financial Services Authority. As a result, any member holding 3% or more of the voting rights in the Company who grants the 
Chairman a discretionary proxy in respect of some or all of those voting rights and so would otherwise have a notification 
obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, need not make a separate notification to the Company and the 
Financial Services Authority.
10.  If you are not a member of the Company but you have been nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information 
rights, you do not have a right to appoint any proxies under the procedures set out in this “Appointment of proxies” section.  
Please read the section “Nominated persons” below.
Appointment of proxy electronically
11.  Alternatively, members may register the appointment of a proxy for the meeting electronically, by accessing the website www.
sharevote.co.uk where full details of the procedure are given. This website is operated by the Company’s Registrars.
 
 The proxy appointment and any power of attorney or other authority under which the proxy appointment is made must be 
received by the Company’s Registrars not less than 48 hours, excluding non‑business days, before the time for holding the 
meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting or adjourned 
meeting) for the taking of the poll at which it is to be used. Please note that any electronic communication sent to the 
Company or to the Company’s Registrars that is found to contain a computer virus will not be accepted. The use of the 
internet service in connection with the AGM is governed by the Company’s Registrars’ conditions of use set out on the 
Sharevote website, www.sharevote.co.uk and may be read by logging on to that site. If you want to appoint more than one 
proxy electronically please contact the Company’s Registrars on 0871 384 2030 from within the UK (calls to this number cost 
8 pence per minute plus network charges). Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday – excluding Bank 
Holidays; or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK.
Changing proxy instructions
12.  To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment. You will need to request a new Form of Proxy 
from the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited by contacting them at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex 
BN99 6DA or by using their telephone helpline service on 0871 384 2030 from within the UK (calls to this number cost 8 pence 
per minute plus network charges). Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday – excluding Bank Holidays; or 
+44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK. Note that the cut‑off time for receipt of Forms of Proxy (see note 5 above) also applies 
in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut‑off time will be 
disregarded and you will be required to vote at the meeting, if you wish to change your vote.
13.  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of a single share, the appointment received last before the 
latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.

Nominated persons
14.  Any person receiving a copy of this Notice of Meeting as a person nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under 
Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (“CA 2006”) (a “Nominated Person”) should note that the provisions in this Notice 
concerning the appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting in place of a member, do not apply to a Nominated 
Person as only shareholders have the right to appoint a proxy. However, a Nominated Person may have a right under an 
agreement between the Nominated Person and the member by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed, or to have 
someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right, or does not 
wish to exercise it, he or she may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise 
of voting rights at the meeting. If you are a person who has been nominated under Section 146 of CA 2006 to enjoy 
information rights:
 
k you may have a right under an agreement between you and the member of the Company who has nominated you to have 
information rights (“Relevant Member”) to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the meeting; and
 
k if you either do not have such a right or if you have such a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right under an 
agreement between you and the Relevant Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting 
rights. Nominated Persons should also remember that their main point of contact in terms of their investment in the 
Company remains the member who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy information rights (or, perhaps the 
custodian or broker who administers the investment on their behalf). Nominated Persons should continue to contact that 
member, custodian or broker (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to the Nominated Person’s 
personal details and interest in the Company (including any administrative matter). The only exception to this is where the 
Company expressly requests a response from a Nominated Person.
Voting
15.  Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM will be by poll, rather than a show of hands, so that all shares voted are 
included, whether or not the shareholder is able to attend the meeting. The Board believes this to be the most democratic 
procedure for voting on resolutions as member votes will be counted according to the number of shares held. 
 
 The results of the voting at the meeting and the number of proxy votes cast for and against and the number of votes actively 
abstained in respect of each of the Resolutions proposed at the meeting will be announced to the London Stock Exchange as 
soon as practicable following the meeting and also will be published on the Company’s website www.drax.com.
Issued shares and total voting rights
16.  As at 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 404,697,592 ordinary shares of 11 16/29 pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a 
general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is the same as the number 
of shares in issue. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury.
17.  This Notice, together with information about the total numbers of shares in the Company in respect of which members are 
entitled to exercise voting rights at the meeting as at 12 March 2014, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of this document and, if applicable, any members’ statements, members’ resolutions or members’ matters of business received 
by the Company after the date of this Notice, will be available on the Company’s website www.drax.com.
Website publication of audit concerns
18.  Under Section 527 CA2006, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that Section have the right to require 
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting; or any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and 
reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 CA 2006.
 
 The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with 
Sections 527 or 528 CA 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under Section 527 CA 2006, 
it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the 
website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required 
under Section 527 CA 2006 to publish on a website.

Corporate representatives
19.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of 
its powers as a member provided that it does not do so in relation to the same shares.
Questions at the meeting
20.  Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting put by a member attending the meeting. However, members should 
note that no answer need be given in the following circumstances:
 
i. 
 if to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation of the meeting or would involve a disclosure of 
confidential information;
 
ii. if the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or
 
iii. if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Electronic address
21.  Any electronic address provided either in this Notice or in any related documents (including the Form of Proxy) may not be 
used to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
Meeting arrangements
22.  The doors of the AGM venue will open at 10.30am and the AGM will start promptly at 11.30am. Please bring the Attendance 
Card which is attached to the Form of Proxy with you if you attend the meeting. It will authenticate your right to attend, speak 
and vote and will speed up your admission to the meeting.
Documents available for inspection

(public holidays excepted) until the date of the AGM and at the place of the AGM from 10.30am until the close of the Meeting:
