Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Environmental Statement (ES) for the Millbrook Power 
Project which comprises an up to 299 Megawatts (MW) gas fired peaking 
power generation plant designed to produce electricity, along with associated 
development, such as a gas connection and electrical connection (hereafter 
referred to as the ‘Project)’. It has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates 
LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), (the ‘Applicant’).  
1.1.2 
The Project would be located in an area known as ‘the Marston Vale’ between 
Milton Keynes and Bedford with the approximate centre of the Project Site at 
grid reference 501373, 240734, the location of which is shown in Figure 1.1.  
The Project Site falls within areas administered by both Central Bedfordshire 
Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC).   
1.1.3 
The up to 299 MW gas fired peaking power generation plant element of the 
Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) and therefore requires 
development consent under that Act. The Applicant is therefore applying for a 
development consent order (DCO); this ES is provided as part of that 
application. The DCO process is described further in Section 1.3 below.  
1.1.4 
The Project would comprise: 
 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating 
station as a whole, measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
- generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the 
‘Generating Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating 
Equipment Site’; 
- a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
- a temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the ‘Laydown Area’); 
 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length 
(the ‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the 
National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas 
Connection also incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the 
point of connection to the National Transmission System; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
2 
 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Connection’), comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would 
require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be located 
in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby 
resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two Sealing 
End Compounds (SEC)s, one located on each side of the existing 
transmission line, and both circuits would then be connected via 
underground cables approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the 
‘Substation’). 
1.1.5 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 
ha in area.  
1.1.6 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land 
upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in 
order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project 
Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is described 
in more detail in Chapter 3. 
1.1.7 
A full glossary of defined terms is presented in Appendix 1.1. 
1.1.8 
The Project Site and all elements of the Project listed above are shown on 
Figure 1.2.  
1.1.9 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former clay 
pits known as ‘The Rookery’, with the associated Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection extending from The Rookery into adjacent agricultural 
land to the south. 
Peaking Plant 
1.1.10 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment could run up to a maximum of 
2,250 hours in any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does 
not exceed 1,500 hours. For the purposes of the EIA, a worst case yearly 
maximum of 2,250 running hours has been assessed where appropriate. 
Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a ‘stress event’ on the 
grid. This occurs when there is a surge in demand for electricity associated 
with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the country might boil 
a kettle following the end of a popular television programme) or where there is 
a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which are constantly 
operational (e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking plants also help to ‘balance out’ 
the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and help to support the grid 
at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy sources, such as 
wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to their intermittent 
operation and reliance on weather conditions. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

1.2 
Purpose of this Document 
1.2.1 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the ‘EIA Regulations’) require an Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) to be carried out in respect of any development listed in Schedule 1 to 
the EIA Regulations (‘Schedule 1 development’). An EIA is also required for 
development listed in Schedule 2 to the EIA Regulations (‘Schedule 2 
development’) if it is likely to have significant effects on the environment1. 
1.2.2 
The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal generating station 
with a heat output of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a) 
of the EIA Regulations.  Therefore, an EIA for the Project is required under the 
EIA Regulations. 
1.3 
Application for Development Consent  
1.3.1 
In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is considered 
to be a NSIP under the PA 2008 if it has a capacity of more than 50 MW.  As 
the Generating Equipment would have a rated electrical output of at least 50 
MW it would be classified as a NSIP under section 14(1)(a) and section 15 of 
the PA 2008. Under section 31 of the PA 2008, consent is required for 
development that is or forms part of a NSIP and therefore a DCO Application 
must be made to the Secretary of State (SoS) for the Power Generation Plant. 
1.3.2 
Development consent for a NSIP may only be granted further to an application 
made under section 37 of the PA 2008 to the SoS. Development consent can 
also be granted for associated development. The Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection are associated development and consent for them is 
being applied for as part of the DCO Application for the Project. The Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection are included within this ES and are 
being assessed through the EIA process and their likely significant 
environmental effects have been reported on in this ES which forms part of the 
DCO Application.  
1.3.3 
Section 37 of the PA 2008 (and associated legislation) also governs the 
content of a DCO Application, including requirements for certain 
accompanying documents. 
1.3.4 
These requirements are specified, in particular, in the Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (as 
amended) (the ‘APFP Regulations’). The APFP Regulations require that a 
                                                           
 
 
1 The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 2009 before the commencement of the EIA 
Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA 
Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project.

DCO Application, where applicable, must be accompanied by an ES and 
scoping (or screening) opinions. There is a Scoping Opinion dated July 2014 
for the Project, included as Appendix 1.2. A screening opinion was not sought.  
1.4 
The Applicant 
1.4.1 
The Applicant for the Project is MPL, an energy development company 
established for the Project and recently acquired by Drax Group plc (Drax). 
1.4.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via 
Drax power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers 
and is committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal 
off the system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps 
created by intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.  
1.4.3 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag 
Energy Development Co. Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management 
services to Watt Power in relation to MPL. Stag Energy continues to provide 
resources to MPL through a management services agreement. Stag Energy 
was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth of experience within 
a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation 
and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has 
been delivered in the UK. 
1.4.4 
Drax currently has three other power generation projects which have either 
already been granted consent under or are being brought forward through the 
PA 2008 process. They are: Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk): Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales 
(www.hirwaunpower.co.uk): and Abergelli Power Ltd at Abergelli in South 
Wales (www.abergellipower.co.uk).  The first two listed projects were granted 
Development Consent in July 20152.  
1.4.5 
MPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.  MPL recognises the need to 
balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and concerns 
relating to energy projects and believes this balance can be responsibly 
delivered. The Project would be designed and developed to high quality, safety

Regulatory and Policy Background 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This chapter summarises the main regulatory and policy framework that is 
relevant to the Project at the international, national and local level. 
2.1.2 
A summary of the EU Directives, National Policy Statements (NPS) as well as 
national and local policy considered relevant to the Project is set out below. 
2.2 
European Union 
2.2.1 
The UK voted to leave the European Union (EU) on the 23rd June 2016. The 
formal process of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, to commence 
negotiations for exiting the EU was undertaken on 29th March 2017. However, 
the exit process is anticipated to involve lengthy and complex negotiations, 
taking up to two years. Therefore, until the UK formally leaves the EU and/or 
discards or alters EU legislation, it is considered that the following policies are 
still relevant to the Project: 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public 
and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive); 
2.2.2 
The EIA Directive ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely to have 
significant effects on the environment are made subject to an environmental 
assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation. The Directive sets the 
thresholds for projects that require an EIA (as stated in section 1.2) and also 
outlines the impacts on the environment to be assessed in the EIA process. 
This Directive is implemented in the respect of NSIPs in the UK by the EIA 
Regulations. 
2.2.3 
It is noted here that the EIA Directive has been amended as of May 2014 
(Directive 2014/52/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and 
private projects on the environment) and the amendments have now been 
implemented in Member States as of 16th May 2017.  
2.2.4 
For NSIPs, such as the Project, this will be through the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (which came into force 
on 16th May 2017).  
2.2.5 
Regulation 37(2)(a) of the 2017 Regulations states that, where a scoping 
opinion has already been requested, or an application or an ES submitted, 
before the commencement of the new EIA regulations, the previous EIA 
regulations and regime will continue to apply. 
2.2.6 
Therefore, as a Scoping Report was submitted for the Project in June 2014 
(Appendix 1.2), the ES has been undertaken in line with the previous (2011) 
EIA Directive.

Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions 
(integrated pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial Emissions 
Directive (IED)); 
2.2.7 
In December 2010 the EU adopted a proposal for a Directive on industrial 
emissions (IED). The IED recasts seven existing directives related to industrial 
emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15th January 2008 concerning 
integrated pollution prevention and control (the IPPC Directive) and Directive 
2001/80/EC of 23rd October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain 
pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the Large Combustion 
Plant Directive (LCPD)), into a single legislative instrument to improve the 
permitting, compliance and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States. 
However, the general principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD Directive 
are retained and will remain relevant to the Project. The IED has been 
implemented in England and Wales by the Environmental Permitting (England 
and Wales) Regulations 2016. 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of natural 
habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive); 
2.2.8 
The aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-diversity 
through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. 
Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member States are designed 
to maintain or restore, at favourable conservation status, natural habitats and 
species of wild fauna and flora of community interest whilst also taking into 
account economic, social and cultural requirements, and regional and local 
characteristics. The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
implement the Habitats Directive in England and Wales. 
Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU – Final draft Best Available 
Techniques (BAT) reference document (BREF) for large combustion 
plants (June 2016) 
2.2.9 
The draft BREF for the Large Combustion Plants sector covers combustion of 
fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input of 50 MW or more. It sets 
out a series of best available techniques which should be applied to large 
combustion plants in order to drive greater efficiency, cost savings and lower 
emissions. Given the nature of the Project (to operate intermittently as a 
peaking plant) many of the techniques highlighted in the BREF do not apply to 
the Project. Nevertheless, it is has been referenced where appropriate.  
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
2.2.10 
In the UK, Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural 
Habitats and Wild Fauna and Flora (‘the Habitats Directive’), was originally 
transposed into law by means of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) 
Regulations 1994 (as amended). The Regulations came into force on 30th 
October 1994, and have been amended several times. Subsequently the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 was created which 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
9 
 
consolidates all the various amendments made to the 1994 Regulations in 
respect of England and Wales and is commonly known as the 'The Habitats 
Regulations'. The Habitats Regulations contain five Parts and four Schedules, 
and provide for the designation and protection of 'European Sites', the 
protection of 'European protected species', and the adaptation of planning and 
other controls for the protection of European Sites. 
2.3 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects and Planning Act 2008 
2.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant is categorised as a NSIP and, if the DCO 
Application for the Project is accepted by the Planning Inspectorate (PINS), it 
will be examined for a period up to six-months, starting the day after the date 
of the Preliminary Meeting for the Project. PINS will then, within three months 
of the end of the Examination, provide the SoS with a report setting out its 
conclusions and recommendations.  The SoS will then have three months from 
the receipt of the PINS' report to make his or her decision on the DCO 
Application. All of these steps are pursuant to the regime established by the 
PA 2008, as described in Chapter 1. 
2.3.2 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 requires the SoS to make a decision on an 
application in accordance with relevant NPSs, unless particular considerations 
apply (including where the adverse impacts of a development would outweigh 
its benefits). NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy) 
sets out that ‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-specific 
energy NPS, provides the primary basis for decisions’ (paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS 
EN-1). The decision-maker ‘should start with a presumption in favour of 
granting consent to applications for energy NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS 
EN-1) and on the basis that the urgent national need for such projects is 
settled. 
2.3.3 
The decision on an application must also be taken by the SoS having regard 
to a number of factors, including the local impact reports that will be provided 
by relevant local authorities, as well as any other matters which the SoS ‘thinks 
are both important and relevant to its decision’ (section 104 of the PA 2008). 
Important and relevant matters may include the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF), Development Plan Documents (DPD) or other documents 
in the Local Development Framework (LDF). 
2.4 
The Planning Act 2008 and the Localism Act 2011 
The process for considering proposed NSIPs was established by the Planning 
Act 2008, as amended by the Localism Act 2011. 
2.4.1 
Under the Localism Act 2011 PINS became the agency responsible for 
operating the planning process for NSIPs (previously, it had this role whilst also 
being the decision maker). As the Examining Authority (ExA), PINS conducts 
certain pre-application and application procedures (such as EIA Scoping 
consultation and conducting acceptance checks when the DCO Application is 
submitted) and the examination. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

2.4.2 
The examination is a predominantly written process led either by a single 
appointed person or a panel, who submit a report with their recommendation 
on an application to the relevant SoS who will take the final decision as to 
whether to make a DCO for a proposed project and in what terms. The relevant 
SoS for the Project is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy. 
2.4.3 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications, 
the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other documents and matters) to 
any relevant NPS and must decide applications in accordance with such 
relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh 
its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances).  The NPSs relevant to 
this Application are NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5, as set 
out below in section 2.5. 
2.4.4 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important and 
relevant to [the SoS’s] decision”.  Other national and local planning policy 
which may be relevant to this Application is set out in sections 2.6 and 2.7 
below. 
2.5 
National Policy Statements 
2.5.1 
The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) published 6 National 
Policy Statements (NPS) for Energy in 2011: 
 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1); 
 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2); 
 
National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy Infrastructure (EN-3); 
 
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4); 
 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5); 
and 
 
National Policy Statement for Nuclear Power Generation (EN-6). 
2.5.2 
NPS EN-1 is a relevant NPS for any energy NSIP, along with the relevant 
technology specific NPS.  NPS EN-1 is a relevant NPS for any energy NSIP, 
along with the relevant technology specific NPS.  For the DCO Application this 
includes NPS EN-2 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure and NPS EN-4 - National Policy Statement for Gas 
Supply Infrastructure. The majority of NPS EN-5 does not directly relate to the 
Project, since its electrical infrastructure is to be predominantly underground. 
However, NPS EN-5 is of relevance in respect of the substation and SECs and 
so is referred to where relevant in this document. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
2.5.3 
NPS EN-1 sets out the Government’s overall policy towards the delivery of 
major energy infrastructure. 
2.5.4 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-1 states that ‘this NPS, when combined with the 
relevant technology-specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for 
decisions’.  The relevant technology-specific energy NPS for this Application 
are NPS EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5 as set out below.  In addition, Paragraph 4.1.5 
of NPS EN-1 states that Development Plan Documents or other documents in 
the Local Development Framework may be both important and relevant 
considerations to SoS decision-making.  Local planning policy for Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough relevant to this Application is set out in 
section 2.7 below. 
2.5.5 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development consent applications 
for energy infrastructure should be assessed ‘on the basis that the Government 
has demonstrated that there is a need for those types of infrastructure and that 
the scale and urgency of that need is as described for each of them in this 
Part.’  Accordingly, the SoS ‘should give substantial weight to the contribution 
which projects would make towards satisfying this need when considering 
applications for development consent under the Planning Act 2008’ (paragraph 
3.1.4). 
2.5.6 
Section 3.3 of NPS EN-1 sets out the key reasons why the Government 
believes there is an ‘urgent need’ for new electricity NSIPs (paragraph 3.3.1), 
including: 
 
Meeting energy security and carbon reduction objectives; 
 
The need to replace closing electricity generating capacity; 
 
The need for more electricity capacity to support an increased supply from 
renewables; and 
 
Future increases in electricity demand. 
2.5.7 
Furthermore, paragraph 3.7.3 of NPS EN-1 stresses that new electricity 
network infrastructure projects add to the reliability of the national energy 
supply and provide crucial national benefits which are shared by all users of 
the system. 
2.5.8 
Whilst alternatives to the need for new large scale electricity infrastructure 
have been considered – including: reducing demand; more intelligent use of 
electricity; and interconnection of electricity systems – the Government 
believes that these measures will not be sufficient to meet energy and climate 
change objectives on their own (paragraph 3.3.25 of NPS EN-1).   
2.5.9 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 recognises the ‘vital role’ that fossil fuel power 
stations play in providing electricity supplies, and states that ‘they will continue 
to play an important role in our energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a 
low carbon economy.’ 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

2.5.10 
Section 4 of NPS EN-1 sets out the general assessment principles by which 
applications relating to energy infrastructure are to be decided. 
2.5.11 
Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 states that, given the level and urgency of need 
for energy infrastructure, the SoS ‘should start with a presumption in favour of 
granting consent to applications for energy NSIPs.’ 
2.5.12 
Paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1 explains that the Secretary of State will weigh 
up a proposal’s contribution to meeting the need for energy infrastructure, job 
creation and other long term and wider benefits, against the potential adverse 
impacts of the proposal in question including ‘any long-term and cumulative 
adverse impacts, as well as any measures to avoid, reduce or compensate for 
any adverse impacts.’ 
2.5.13 
Paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1 continues and explains that the SoS should take 
into account ‘environmental, social and economic benefits and adverse 
impacts, at national, regional and local levels’ whether identified in the NPSs 
or elsewhere, including in local impact reports.  
2.5.14 
Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states that other matters that the SoS may 
consider both important and relevant to its decision-making could include 
Development Plan Documents or other documents in the Local Development 
Framework and explains that, ‘in the event of a conflict between these or any 
other documents and an NPS, the NPS prevails.’  The documents included 
within the Local Development Frameworks for both Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council are referenced in section 2.7. 
2.5.15 
Paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1 confirms that the SoS will have regard to the 
guidance in Circular 11/95, as revised, on “The Use of Conditions in Planning 
Permissions” in agreeing or suggesting requirements in a DCO. Although that 
circular has in part been superseded by advice contained within NPPG 
(published in March 2014), the Applicant notes that the general advice remains 
essentially similar.  
2.5.16 
Paragraph 4.1.8 states that, “The [SoS] may take into account any 
development consent obligations that an applicant agrees with local 
authorities.”   
2.5.17 
Paragraph 4.1.9 of NPS EN-1 states that viability issues are unlikely to be of 
relevance to decision making providing that the technical feasibility of the 
proposal has been properly assessed, but limited exceptions exist and are set 
out in NPS EN-1 and others. 
2.5.18 
Paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that, ‘All proposals for projects that are 
subject to the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive must be 
accompanied by an ES describing the aspects of the environment likely to be 
significantly affected by the project.’ The Environmental Statement should 
include an assessment of the likely significant effects of the proposed project 
on the environment, including direct, indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
13 
 
medium and long-term, permanent and temporary, positive and negative 
effects at all stages of the project.  Paragraph 4.2.3 of NPS EN-1 adds that ‘the 
ES should cover the environmental, social and economic effects arising from 
pre-construction, construction, operation and decommissioning of the project.’  
When considering cumulative effects, Paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1 advises 
that the ES should provide information on how the effects of the proposal 
combine and interact with the effects of other development, including projects 
for which consent is sought or granted, as well as those already in existence.  
2.5.19 
In respect of Habitats and Species Regulations, paragraph 4.3.1 of NPS EN-1 
advises applicants to consult with Natural England and to subsequently 
undertake an Appropriate Assessment if required.   
2.5.20 
Paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that, “the relevance or otherwise to the 
decision-making process of the existence (or alleged existence) of alternatives 
to the proposed development is in the first instance a matter of law, detailed 
guidance on which falls outside the scope of this NPS.  From a policy 
perspective NPS EN-1 does not contain any general requirement to consider 
alternatives or to establish whether the proposed project represents the best 
option.”  However, paragraph 4.4.2 of NPS EN-1 states that applicants are 
obliged to include, as a matter of fact, information about the main alternatives 
that have been considered within the ES, including the main reasons for the 
applicant’s choice, taking into account the environmental, social and economic 
effects.   
2.5.21 
Paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 states that good design for energy infrastructure 
‘should produce sustainable infrastructure sensitive to place, efficient in the 
use of natural resources and energy used in their construction and operation, 
matched by an appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic as far as 
possible’. However, paragraph 4.5.1 also acknowledges that ‘the nature of 
much energy infrastructure development will often limit the extent to which it 
can contribute to the enhancement of the quality of the area’.  
2.5.22 
Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 seeks that proposals are “sustainable and, 
having regard to regulatory and other constraints, are as attractive, durable 
and adaptable (including taking account of natural hazards such as flooding) 
as they can be”.   Further, Paragraph 4.5.3 states that “Whilst the applicant 
may not have any or very limited choice in the physical appearance of some 
energy infrastructure, there may be opportunities for the applicant to 
demonstrate good design in terms of siting relative to existing landscape 
character, landform and vegetation.”  
2.5.23 
Paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 seeks that applicants “demonstrate in their 
application documents how the design process was conducted and how the 
proposed design evolved. Where a number of different designs were 
considered, applicants should set out the reasons why the favoured choice has 
been selected”.  Further, paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 notes that “in 
considering applications the [SoS] should take into account the ultimate 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
14 
 
purpose of the infrastructure and bear in mind the operational, safety and 
security requirements which the design has to satisfy.” 
2.5.24 
Paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1 states that “applicants are encouraged” to use 
design review services. 
2.5.25 
Paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1 states that, ‘Under guidelines issued by DECC 
(then DTI) in 2006, any application to develop a thermal generating station 
under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 must either include CHP or contain 
evidence that the possibilities for CHP have been fully explored to inform the 
IPC’s consideration of the application.’  Further, paragraph 4.6.7 of NPS EN-1 
advises that the opportunities for CHP should be considered from the outset 
of the site selection process.  
2.5.26 
Section 4.7 of NPS EN-1 explains the considerations to be given to Carbon 
Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and explains that all 
applications for new combustion plant which are of a generating capacity at or 
over 300MW and of a type covered by the EU’s Large Combustion Plant 
Directive (LCPD) should demonstrate that the plant is “Carbon Capture Ready” 
(CCR).  
2.5.27 
Section 4.8 of EN-1 sets out considerations that applicants and the Examining 
Authority/Secretary of State should take into account to help ensure that new 
energy infrastructure is resilient to climate change.  Paragraph 4.8.5 of NPS 
EN-1 advises that applicants ‘must consider the impacts of climate change 
when planning the location, design, build, operation and, where appropriate, 
decommissioning of new energy infrastructure.’   
2.5.28 
Paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult the National Grid 
and to ensure that there is the necessary infrastructure and capacity within an 
existing or planned transmission or distribution network to accommodate the 
electricity generated.   
2.5.29 
Paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that ‘Issues relating to discharges or 
emissions from a proposed project which affect air quality, water quality, land 
quality and the marine environment, or which include noise and vibration may 
be subject to separate regulation under the pollution control framework or other 
consenting and licensing regimes.’     
2.5.30 
Paragraph 4.11.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult with the HSE on 
matters relating to safety which are relevant to the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure.  
2.5.31 
Paragraph 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1 explains that all establishments wishing to hold 
stock of hazardous substances above a threshold will require Hazardous 
Substances consent, and thus should consult the HSE at the pre-application 
stage.  
2.5.32 
Section 4.13 of NPS EN-1 advises that energy production has the potential to 
impact on health and wellbeing (paragraph 4.13.1), through increased traffic, 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
15 
 
air or water pollution, dust, odour, hazardous waste and substances, noise, 
exposure to radiation and increases in pests (paragraph 4.13.3).  Accordingly, 
the ES should assess these effects and identify any measures to avoid, reduce 
or compensate for these impacts as appropriate (paragraph 4.13.2).   
2.5.33 
Paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1 stresses the importance of considering 
possible sources of nuisance and how they may be mitigated or limited at the 
pre-application stage under section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990.  
2.5.34 
Paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1 outlines that ‘Government policy is to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are designed 
into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project development.’  
2.5.35 
Part 5 of NPS EN-1 explains the potential impacts of energy infrastructure, in 
terms of: air quality and emissions; biodiversity and ecological conservation; 
civil and military aviation and defence interests; coastal change; dust, odour, 
artificial light, smoke, steam and insect infestation; flood risk; historic 
environment; landscape and visual; land use including open space, green 
infrastructure and Green Belt; noise and vibration; socio-economic; traffic and 
transport; waste management; and water quality and resources. 
2.5.36 
Paragraph 5.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of infrastructure development ‘can involve emissions to air 
which could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and 
habitats, or on the wider countryside.’  Paragraph 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1 provides 
that the applicant should undertake an assessment as part of the ES, 
describing:  
 
“any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects 
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any 
significant emissions from any road traffic generated by the project; 
 
the predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after 
mitigation methods have been applied; 
 
existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from existing 
levels; and 
 
any potential eutrophication impacts.” 
2.5.37 
With regard to biodiversity and geological conservation for EIA development, 
paragraph 5.3.3 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES ‘clearly sets out any effects 
on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological or 
geological conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats and 
other species identified as being of principal importance for the conservation 
of biodiversity.’  Appropriate mitigation measures should be an integral part of 
the proposed development and should demonstrate that: activities are 
confined to the minimum areas required during construction; best practice is 
followed during construction and operation; habitats are restored after 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
16 
 
construction works where practicable; and opportunities are taken to enhance 
or create new habitats (paragraph 5.3.18).  
2.5.38 
Paragraph 5.4.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that civil and military aviation and 
defence interests can be affected by new energy development, and as such 
an assessment of potential effects should be set out within the ES (paragraph 
5.4.10).  In addition, the MoD, CAA, NATS and any aerodrome likely to be 
affected by the proposed development should be consulted (paragraph 
5.4.11).  
2.5.39 
Paragraph 5.6.1 of NPS EN-1 states that, ‘during the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure there is potential for the release 
of a range of emissions such as odour, dust, steam, smoke, artificial light and 
infestation of insects.’  Accordingly, applicants are required to assess the 
potential for emissions and the impact on amenity in the ES, in particular: the 
type, quantity and timing of emissions; aspects giving rise to emissions; 
locations affected by the emissions; effects of the emissions on identified 
locations; and measures to be employed in preventing or mitigating emissions 
(paragraph 5.6.5).  Paragraph 5.6.11 advises that mitigation measures may be 
provided in respect of engineering, lay-out or administration.  
2.5.40 
Paragraph 5.7.4 of NPS EN-1 states that application for energy projects of 1 
ha or greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 3 
should be accompanied by a flood risk assessment (FRA).  Where necessary, 
paragraph 5.7.18 of NPS EN-1 advises that flood risk should be mitigated by 
making arrangements to manage surface water and the impact of the natural 
water cycle on people and property.  
2.5.41 
Paragraph 5.8.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in adverse 
impacts on the historic environment.  Accordingly, the applicant is required to 
‘provide a description of the significance of the heritage assets affected by the 
proposed development and the contribution of their setting to that significance’ 
(paragraph 5.8.8).  
2.5.42 
Paragraph 5.9.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that the landscape and visual 
effects of energy projects will vary according to the type of development, its 
location and the landscape setting.  Paragraphs 5.9.5 – 5.9.7 advise that the 
applicant should carry out a landscape and visual impact assessment of the 
effects during construction and operation, including light pollution effects on 
local amenity and nature conservation.  Paragraph 5.9.21 notes that reducing 
the scale of the project can help to mitigate the landscape and visual impacts, 
however it is acknowledged that amending the design of proposed energy 
infrastructure may result in a significant operational constraint and reduction in 
function.   
2.5.43 
Paragraph 5.10.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that an energy infrastructure 
project ‘will have direct effects on the existing use of the proposed site and 
may have indirect effects on the use, or planned use, of land in the vicinity for 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
17 
 
other types of development.’  Accordingly, the applicants should consult the 
local community (paragraph 5.10.6) and the ES should include an assessment 
of the impact of the proposed development on existing and proposed land uses 
near the project.  Paragraph 5.10.19 notes that there may be little that can be 
done to mitigate the direct effects of the energy project on the existing use of 
the proposed site; however, the effects may be minimised through the 
application of good design principles, including the layout of the project.  
2.5.44 
Paragraph 5.11.1 of NPS EN-1 states that excessive noise can have wide-
ranging impacts on the quality of human life, health, and use and enjoyment of 
areas, as well as on wildlife and biodiversity (paragraph 5.11.2).  Where noise 
impacts arise, paragraph 5.11.4 states that a noise assessment should be 
provided, to include: a description of the noise generating aspects of the 
proposal, identification of noise sensitive areas, the characteristics of the 
existing noise environment, and a prediction of how the noise environment will 
change.  Mitigation measures may include engineering, layout design, or 
administrative measures (paragraph 5.11.12).  
2.5.45 
Paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1 states that ‘The construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic impacts 
at local and regional levels.’  Accordingly, an assessment should be 
undertaken of all relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: the 
creation of jobs and training opportunities, the provision of additional local 
services and improvements to local infrastructure, effects on tourism, the 
impact of a changing influx of workers during different phases of the project, 
and cumulative effects.  Mitigation measures could include improvements to 
the visual and environmental experience for visitors and the local community 
through high quality design (paragraph 5.12.9).  
2.5.46 
Paragraph 5.13.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that ‘The transport of materials, goods 
and personnel to and from a development during all project phases can have 
a variety of impacts on the surrounding transport infrastructure and potentially 
on connecting transport networks.’  The applicant should therefore undertake 
a transport assessment and consult with the Highways Agency and Highways 
Authority regarding appropriate mitigation (paragraph 5.13.3).   
2.5.47 
Paragraph 5.14.1 of NPS EN-1 outlines that government policy on hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste is intended to ‘protect human health and the 
environment by producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever 
possible.’  Paragraph 5.14.6 states that the applicant should set out the 
arrangements proposed for managing waste and include information on the 
proposed waste recovery and disposal system.   
2.5.48 
Paragraph 5.15.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that infrastructure development can 
have adverse effects during the construction, operation and decommissioning 
phases on the water environment, including groundwater, inland surface water, 
transitional waters and coastal waters.  Accordingly, the applicant should 
undertake an assessment of ‘the existing status of, and impacts of the 
proposed project on, water quality, water resources and physical 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
18 
 
characteristics of the water environment as part of the ES’ (paragraph 5.15.2).  
Paragraphs 5.15.9 and 5.15.10 advise that the impacts on the water 
environment and local water resources can be mitigated through careful 
design.   
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) 
2.5.49 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 states “Fossil fuel generating stations play a vital 
role in providing reliable electricity supplies and a secure and diverse energy 
mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon economy…” 
2.5.50 
Paragraph 1.2.1 of NPS EN-2 states that, NPS EN-2, together with NPS EN-
1, provides the primary basis for decisions by the SoS on applications for 
nationally significant fossil fuel electricity generating stations. 
2.5.51 
Part 2 of NPS EN-2 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-1 
regarding the assessment of impacts specifically associated with fossil fuel 
generating stations.   
2.5.52 
Paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy companies to decide which 
applications to bring forward and the government does not seek to direct 
applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating stations." 
2.5.53 
NPS EN-2 notes that “Fossil fuel generating stations have large land footprints 
and will therefore only be possible where the applicant is able to acquire a 
suitably-sized site” (NPS EN-2, paragraph 2.2.2). It also notes that “Applicants 
should locate new fossil fuel generating stations in the vicinity of existing 
transport routes wherever possible.”   
2.5.54 
Section 2.3 of NPS EN-2 states that government policy criteria for fossil fuel 
generation stations relating to – CHP, CCR, CCS, climate change adaptation, 
and ‘good design’ – must be met before consent is given. 
2.5.55 
Section 2.3.13 of NPS EN-2 sets out considerations specifically for fossil fuel 
generating stations in respect of climate change. NPS EN-2 suggests that as 
fossil fuel generating stations are likely to be proposed for coastal or estuarine 
sites, applicants should set out how the proposal would be resilient to: coastal 
changes and increased risk from storm surge; effects of higher temperatures, 
including higher temperatures of cooling water; and increased risk of drought 
leading to a lack of available cooling water.  
2.5.56 
Paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2 states that, “Applicants should demonstrate 
good design particularly in respect of landscape and visual amenity ...and in 
the design of the project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, 
transport impacts and air emissions.” 
2.5.57 
Section 2.4 of NPS EN-2 contains additional policy for assessing the potential 
impacts of energy infrastructure projects for fossil fuel generating stations, 
relating to: air emissions; landscape and visual; release of dust by coal-fired 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
19 
 
generating stations; residue management for coal-fired generating stations; 
and water quality and resources. 
2.5.58 
Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-2 acknowledges that CO2 emissions are a 
significant adverse impact of fossil fuel generating stations.  As such, 
paragraph 2.5.5 of EN-2 states that an assessment should be carried out at 
the initial stages of developing proposals, and Paragraph 2.5.8 of EN-2 states 
that the SoS and Environment Agency (EA) should be satisfied that the 
potential adverse impacts of mitigation measures are assessed.   
2.5.59 
Paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2 advises that the main structures of a fossil fuel 
generating station – including the turbine and boiler halls, exhaust gas stacks, 
storage facilities, cooling towers, and water processing plant – are large and 
likely to have an impact on the surrounding landscape and visual amenity.  A 
landscape and visual impact assessment should therefore be included as part 
of the ES, and consideration should be given to the design of the plant, the 
materials to be used, and the visual impact of the stack (paragraphs 2.6.3 and 
2.6.4).  Paragraph 2.6.5 of EN-2 states that mitigation is to minimise impact on 
visual amenity as far as reasonably practicable; however, the visibility of a 
fossil fuel generating station should be given limited weight if the SoS is 
satisfied that the location is appropriate for the project and that it has been 
designed sensitively (paragraph 2.6.10).  
2.5.60 
Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that the sources of noise and vibration 
from fossil fuel generating stations may include the gas and steam turbines 
and external noise sources such as externally-sited air-cooled condensers.  
Paragraph 2.7.2 of EN-2 states that the ES should include a noise assessment, 
and paragraph 2.7.5 of NPS EN-2 states that mitigation should be achieved 
through ‘good design’, including enclosure of plant and machinery in noise-
reducing buildings where possible.  
2.5.61 
Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that water cooling systems for fossil 
fuel generating stations may have additional impacts on water quality, 
abstraction and discharge.  Where the project is likely to have an effect on 
water quality and resources, Paragraph 2.10.2 of EN-2 states that an 
assessment should be undertaken to ‘demonstrate that appropriate measures 
will be put in place to avoid or minimise adverse impacts of abstraction and 
discharge of cooling water.’  
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4) 
2.5.62 
NPS EN-4, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for gas supply infrastructure and gas and oil 
pipelines (Paragraph 1.2.1). 
2.5.63 
Part 2 of NPS EN-4 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-1 
regarding the assessment of impacts specific to gas supply infrastructure and 
oil and gas pipelines. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
20 
 
2.5.64 
Sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4 set out addition policy for assessing the 
potential impacts of gas and oil pipelines, relating to: noise and vibration; 
biodiversity, landscape and visual; water quality and resources; and soil and 
geology. 
2.5.65 
Paragraph 2.20.2 of NPS EN-4 states that there are specific noise and 
vibration impacts which apply to gas pipelines, including – ‘During the pre-
construction phase there could be vibration effects from seismic surveys. 
During construction, tasks may include site clearance, soil movement, ground 
excavation, tunnelling, trenching, pipe laying and welding, and ground 
reinstatement. In addition, increased HGV traffic will be generated on local 
roads for the movement of materials.’  The ES should include an assessment 
of all of the above noise and vibration effects during the pre-construction and 
construction phases (paragraph 2.20.5).  
2.5.66 
Paragraph 2.21.1 of NPS EN-4 states that the construction of a pipeline can 
impact upon ‘specific landscape elements within and adjacent to the pipeline 
route, such as grasslands, field boundaries (hedgerows, hedgebanks, 
drystone walls, fences), trees, woodlands, and watercourses.’  Accordingly, 
the ES should include an assessment of the biodiversity and landscape and 
visual effects of the proposed route and of the main alternative routes 
considered’ (paragraph 2.21.3 of EN4).  Where it is not possible to restore the 
landscape to its original state, Paragraph 2.21.3 of EN-4 also states that ‘the 
applicant should set out measures to avoid, mitigate, or employ other 
landscape measures to compensate for, any adverse effect on the landscape.’  
2.5.67 
Paragraph 2.22.2 of NPS EN-4 advises that ‘constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect 
watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone 
to flooding and ecological receptors.  As such, an assessment should be 
provided in the ES where the project is likely to have effects on water resources 
or water quality, for example through impacts on: ‘groundwater recharge or on 
existing surface water or ground abstraction points; associated ecological 
receptors’, or through: ‘siltation or spillages, discharges from maintenance 
activities or the discharge of disposals such as wastewater or solvents’ 
(paragraphs 2.22.3 and 2.22.4).  
2.5.68 
Paragraph 2.23.1 of NPS EN-4 states that ‘it will be important for applicants to 
understand the soil types and the nature of the underlying strata.’  Accordingly, 
applicants should consult with the relevant statutory consultees at an early 
stage regarding the potential impact of gas pipelines on soil and geology 
(paragraph 2.23.4).  Paragraph 2.23.2 states that applicants should assess the 
stability of the ground conditions associated with the pipeline route, including 
considering the options for installing the pipeline.  
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) 
2.5.69 
NPS EN-5, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for electricity networks infrastructure NSIPs 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
21 
 
(Paragraph 1.2.1) such as overhead lines, and associated development of 
electrical networks infrastructure (such as substations) for other NSIPs. The 
Project considered an overhead line as an alternative for the Electrical 
Connection and includes a substation. Accordingly, the Project has had regard 
to the provisions of NPS EN-5 as they relate to substations and the 
consideration of alternative Electrical Connections, as set out below. 
2.5.70 
Part 2 of NPS EN-5 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-1 
regarding the assessment of impacts specific to electricity networks 
infrastructure. 
2.5.71 
In respect of climate change adaptation, paragraph 2.4.1 of NPS EN-5 states 
that applicants should set out the extent to which the proposed development 
would be vulnerable and how it would be resilient to: flooding; the effects of 
wind and storms; higher average temperatures; and earth movement or 
subsidence.  
2.5.72 
Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-5 states that, ‘proposals for electricity networks 
infrastructure should demonstrate good design in their approach to mitigating 
the potential adverse impacts which can be associated with overhead lines’, 
particularly in respect of: biodiversity and geological conservation; landscape 
and visual; noise and vibration; and EMFs.  
2.5.73 
Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that there is the potential for large birds 
to collide with overhead power lines, particularly in poor visibility.  Accordingly, 
the EIA should consider whether the proposed line will cause problems at any 
point along its length, in particular regarding feeding and hunting grounds, 
migration corridors and breeding grounds (paragraph 2.7.2).  Suitable 
mitigation measures may include: careful siting of the line; making lines more 
visible; or reducing electrocution risks through the design of crossarms and 
insulators (paragraphs 2.7.4 – 2.7.6).  
2.5.74 
Paragraphs 2.8.4 – 2.8.6 of NPS EN-5 state that applicants should follow 
guidance set out in the Holford Rules when considering the approach to the 
routeing of new overhead lines.  Paragraph 2.8.4 also states that applicants 
should offer ‘constructive proposals for additional mitigation of the proposed 
overhead lines’, and consider the ‘potential costs and benefits of other feasible 
means of connection or reinforcement’ where the proposed overhead line is 
likely to have a significant visual impact.  
2.5.75 
Paragraph 2.8.8 of NPS EN-5 acknowledges that, whilst the development of 
overhead lines will often be appropriate for meeting the need for new electricity 
lines of 132kV and above, there are cases where overhead lines are not 
appropriate.  This paragraph adds, “Where there are serious concerns about 
the potential adverse landscape and visual effects of a proposed overhead 
line, the IPC will have to balance these against other relevant factors, including 
the need for the proposed infrastructure, the availability and cost of alternative 
sites and routes and methods of installation (including undergrounding).”  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
22 
 
2.5.76 
Paragraph 2.8.9 of NPS EN-5 notes, “The impacts and costs of both overhead 
and underground options vary considerably between individual projects (both 
in absolute and relative terms). Therefore, each project should be assessed 
individually on the basis of its specific circumstances and taking account of the 
fact that Government has not laid down any general rule about when an 
overhead line should be considered unacceptable.” 
2.5.77 
Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that ‘power frequency Electric and 
Magnetic Fields (EMFs) arise from generation, transmission, distribution and 
use of electricity and will occur around power lines and electric cables.  
Paragraph 2.10.15 of EN-5 states that in order to mitigate for EMFs, the 
applicant should consider: height, position, insulation and protection 
measures; optimal phasing of high voltage overhead power lines where 
possible and practicable; and any new Government advice. 
2.6 
Other National Planning Policy 
2.6.1 
Section 104(2)(d) of the PA 2008 states that in determining Applications, the 
SoS should have regard to any other matters which are considered to be ‘both 
important and relevant to the [SoS’s] decision.’ 
2.6.2 
Other national planning policy (in addition to the various high level energy 
policy documents referred to above) which is considered to be important and 
relevant to the Application is contained within the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF) (adopted in 2012) and National Planning Practice 
Guidance (NPPG) are summarised below. 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 
2.6.3 
The NPPF was adopted in March 2012 to replace previous planning policy 
statements and guidance, with one consolidated national planning statement. 
It sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how these are 
expected to be applied. 
2.6.4 
The NPPF does not contain specific policies for NSIPs.  Instead, Paragraph 3 
of the NPPF states that NSIPs “are determined in accordance with the 
decision-making framework set out in the Planning Act 2008 and relevant 
national policy statements for major infrastructure, as well as any other matters 
that are considered both important and relevant (which may include the 
National Planning Policy Framework).”  
2.6.5 
The Application is therefore to be determined primarily in accordance with NPS 
EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5.  However, the NPPF does contain 
some general planning guidance which may be considered to be ‘both 
important and relevant’ to the determination of the Application. 
2.6.6 
Paragraph 14 of the NPPF sets out a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable 
development’, such that development that is sustainable is approved without 
delay.  Sustainable development incorporates: an economic role, which 
includes identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure; a social 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
23 
 
role, which includes meeting the community’s needs; and an environmental 
role, which includes protecting and enhancing the environment and adapting 
to a low carbon economy (paragraph 7).  Further, Paragraph 56 of the NPPF 
states that ‘good design is a key aspect of sustainable development’ and is 
‘indivisible from good planning.’   
2.6.7 
Paragraph 17 of the NPPF sets out 12 core planning principles, which include: 
 
Proactively driving and supporting economic development to deliver 
amongst other things the infrastructure that the country needs; 
 
Always seeking to secure high quality design; 
 
Taking account of the different roles and character of different areas; 
 
Supporting the transition to a low carbon future; 
 
Contributing to conserving and enhancing the natural environment; and 
 
Encouraging the effective use of land by reusing land that has been 
previously developed. 
2.6.8 
Paragraph 18 of the NPPF explains that the Government is committed to 
securing economic growth and to meeting the challenge of a low carbon future. 
2.6.9 
Paragraph 66 of the NPPF states that proposals in which an applicant has 
worked closely with those directly affected by their views should be considered 
favourably. 
2.6.10 
Paragraph 93 of the NPPF acknowledges that planning plays a key role in 
supporting the delivery of low carbon energy and therefore achieving the 
economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  
Paragraph 97 of the NPPF advises that, in order to increase the use and supply 
of low carbon energy, there should be a positive strategy to promoting energy 
from renewable and low carbon sources, whilst ensuring that adverse impacts 
are addressed satisfactorily. 
2.6.11 
Paragraph 109 of the NPPF states that ‘the planning system should contribute 
to and enhance the natural and local environment’ by: 
 
protecting and enhancing valued landscapes, geological conservation 
interests and soils; 
 
recognising the wider benefits of ecosystem services; 
 
minimising impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in biodiversity 
where possible; 
 
preventing new development from contributing to or being put at 
unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by unacceptable levels 
of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability; and 
 
remediating and mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated 
and unstable land, where appropriate. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
24 
 
2.6.12 
Paragraph 121 of the NPPF advises that a site should be suitable, taking into 
account ground conditions and land instability, pollution and proposed 
mitigation.   
2.6.13 
Paragraph 123 of the NPPF advises that planning decisions should seek to 
avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and quality 
of life, and to mitigate any adverse impacts where necessary. 
National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) 
2.6.14 
On 6th March 2014, the Government published new online planning practice 
guidance to replace previous guidance documents and support the application 
of the NPPF. Sections of the NPPG are updated on a rolling basis.  The NPPG 
resource provides planning guidance in respect of a number of topics, 
including: air quality, design, flood risk and coastal change, natural 
environment, noise, renewable and low carbon energy, and water supply, 
wastewater and water quality.  Relevant NPPG guidance, correct as at the end 
of September 2017, is set out below. 
2.6.15 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to air quality advises that air quality, odour 
and dust can be a planning concern because of the effect on biodiversity and 
local amenity.  Accordingly, assessments could include a description of 
baseline conditions, the assessment methods to be adopted and acceptable 
mitigation measures (paragraph 007).  The impacts of air quality could be 
mitigated through the design and layout of development, the use of green 
infrastructure, and controlling dust and emissions from construction, operation 
and demolition (paragraph 008). 
2.6.16 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to design highlights that good quality 
design is an integral part of sustainable development – “Good design responds 
in a practical and creative way to both the function and identity of a place. It 
puts land, water, drainage, energy, community, economic, infrastructure and 
other such resources to the best possible use – over the long as well as the 
short term.” 
2.6.17 
Paragraph 029 of guidance relating to flood risk and coastal change advises 
developers and applicants to consider flood risk to and from the development 
site as early as possible, and to follow the broad approach of assessing, 
avoiding, managing and mitigating flood risk.  Paragraph 030 states that a site-
specific flood risk assessment should be carried out to demonstrate “how flood 
risk will be managed now and over the development’s lifetime, taking climate 
change into account, and with regard to the vulnerability of its users.” 
2.6.18 
Paragraph 016 of guidance relating to the natural environment states that the 
potential impacts on biodiversity should inform all stages of development.  
Biodiversity enhancement should seek to include habitat restoration, re-
creation and expansion (paragraph 017). 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
25 
 
2.6.19 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to noise states that “noise needs to be 
considered when new developments may create additional noise and when 
new developments would be sensitive to the prevailing acoustic environment.”  
Paragraph 008 advises that there are four broad types of mitigation: 
engineering, layout, using planning conditions/obligations and mitigating. 
2.6.20 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to renewable and low carbon energy 
acknowledges that increasing the amount of energy from low carbon 
technologies will help to make sure the UK has a secure energy supply, reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions to slow down climate change and stimulate 
investment in new jobs and businesses. 
2.6.21 
Paragraph 016 of guidance relating to water supply, wastewater and water 
quality states that a detailed assessment will be required where it is likely that 
a proposal will have a significant adverse impact on water quality.  The 
assessment should form part of an Environmental Statement. 
2.7 
Local Planning Policy 
2.7.1 
Prior to April 2009, the Project Site fell within Mid-Bedfordshire District Council, 
South Bedfordshire District Council and Bedford Borough Council. However, 
as part of the structural changes to local government in England, effected on 
1 April 2009, new unitary authorities were created on existing borough 
boundaries, and in parts of the country which previously operated a ‘two-tier’ 
system of counties and districts.  
2.7.2 
As a result of these changes, Mid Bedfordshire District Council and South 
Bedfordshire Council were combined to form Central Bedfordshire (a unitary 
authority). BBC also became a unitary authority on its existing boundaries.  
2.7.3 
Thus, the Project Site now falls within the jurisdiction of the unitary authorities 
of CBC and BBC. However, several of the planning documents from the 
previous districts were saved and therefore remain relevant to the Project Site 
and proposals. As such, local planning policy is contained within the following 
documents:  
The Development Plan

Other Material Considerations  
2.7.4 
CBC and BBC are in the process of preparing new development plan 
documents for their respective local authorities. The draft versions of the 
development plans are material considerations to the determination of the 
proposed development.  
2.7.5 
Further, a number of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and 
guidance notes have been adopted in order to supplement and add further 
details to support the implementation of adopted planning policies. Additional 
planning guidance of potential relevance to the Project is contained within the 
following documents.

2.7.11 
Reference to relevant planning policy considerations, relating to the 
designations of the Project Site on the Proposals Maps, is contained below. 
Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies (2009) 
2.7.12 
The Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies document was adopted in November 2009 as part of the LDF for 
Central Bedfordshire (North). This document is the key Development Plan 
Document (DPD) for the northern part of the district and provides the long-term 
vision and direction for future development in this area over the period 2001-
2026.  
2.7.13 
The Project Site is located on the edge of the Northern Marston Vale Strategic 
Area, as identified on the Core Strategy Key Diagram.  The Spatial Vision for 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
30 
 
the Core Strategy states that the Northern Marston Vale will ‘continue to be a 
growth location where development will help to bring about environmental 
regeneration, support the urban renaissance of Bedford and make the Vale a 
more attractive place to live, do business and enjoy leisure time’ (page 16).   
2.7.14 
Further, Policy CS1 states that sites within Northern Marston Vale will be 
identified and developed for new homes, jobs and key infrastructure, with a 
particular focus on delivery at Wixams (north-east of the Project Site) and 
Marston Moretaine (west of the Project Site). Wixams and Marston Moretaine 
are identified for housing provision of c.1000 dwellings and c.0-100 dwellings 
respectively in Policy CS5. 
2.7.15 
Policy CS9 states that the Council will plan for a minimum target of 17,000 net 
additional jobs in the district over the period 2001-2026.  This target will be 
supported through the provision of 10-20ha of new employment land within 
Northern Marston Vale, in accordance with Policy CS10.  
2.7.16 
The Project Site is located within the floodplain as illustrated on the Central 
Bedfordshire LDF (North) Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy CS13 
applies.  Policy CS13 states that the Council will seek to minimise the risk of 
flooding and manage residual risks, as well as securing new development 
which incorporates measures to take account of climate change.  Policy CS13 
also states that energy generating proposals with low carbon impact will be 
considered positively. 
2.7.17 
Policy CS14 states that the Council will require development to be of the 
highest quality by, inter alia, respecting local context and the varied character 
and local distinctiveness of Mid Bedfordshire. 
2.7.18 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale as illustrated on 
the LDF North Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy CS16 applies.  
Policy CS16 states that the Council will: 
 
Conserve and enhance the varied countryside character and local 
distinctiveness; 
 
Resist development where it will have an adverse effect on important 
landscape features or highly sensitive landscapes; 
 
Require development to enhance landscapes of lesser quality; 
 
Continue to support the creation of the Forest of Marston Vale; 
 
Conserve woodlands including ancient and semi natural woodland, 
hedgerows and veteran trees; and 
 
Promote an increase in tree cover outside of the Forest of Marston Vale, 
where it would not threaten other valuable habitats. 
2.7.19 
Policy CS17 states that the Council will: 
 
Seek a net gain in green infrastructure through the protection and 
enhancement of assets and the provision of new green spaces; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
31 
 
 
Take forward priority areas for the provision of new green infrastructure in 
the Forest of Marston Vale; and 
 
Require new development to contribute towards the delivery of new green 
infrastructure and the management of a linked network of new and 
enhanced open spaces and corridors. 
2.7.20 
The Project Site is part-located within a County Wildlife Site (CWS) as 
illustrated on the Central Bedfordshire LDF (North) Proposals Map, where 
Core Strategy Policy CS18 applies.  Policy CS18 states that the Council will 
support the designation, management and protection of biodiversity and 
geology, including locally important CWS’s. Development that would fragment 
or prejudice the biodiversity network will not be permitted.  
2.7.21 
Policy DM3 requires that all proposals for new development will, inter alia: 
 
Be appropriate in scale and design to their setting; 
 
Respect local distinctiveness through design and use of materials; 
 
Use energy efficiently; 
 
Comply with the current guidance on noise, waste management, vibration, 
odour, water, light and airborne pollution; and 
 
Incorporate appropriate access and linkages. 
2.7.22 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale as illustrated on 
the LDF North Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy DM14 applies.  
Policy DM14 states that the Council will ensure that the impact of proposed 
development on the landscape will be assessed.  Proposals for development 
within the Northern Marston Vale and the Forest of Marston Vale will be 
required to provide landscape enhancement on or adjacent to the development 
site or contribute towards landscape enhancement in these areas.  Trees, 
woodland and hedgerows in the district will be protected by requiring 
developers to retain and protect such features in close proximity to building 
works.  Further, tree planting or contributions towards planting for the purposes 
of enhancing the landscape will be sought from new developments.  
2.7.23 
Policy DM15 states that the Council will ensure that advice is sought from 
relevant national and local organisations where proposed development is 
considered to have an impact on wildlife.  For developments where there is a 
need to protect or enhance biodiversity, developers will be required to carry 
out such work and/or make contributions to secure longer term benefits for 
wildlife. 
Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD (2011) 
2.7.24 
The Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD was adopted in April 2011.  The 
document identifies sites and policies to help deliver the spatial vision, 
objectives and policies of the Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies DPD. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

2.7.25 
Policy E1 states that the Council will safeguard a number of Key Employment 
Sites within the district, including Millbrook Proving Ground (approximately 400 
m to the south of the Project Site). 
2.7.26 
Policy MA4 allocates land at Moreteyne Farm in Marston Moretaine 
(approximately 1.5 km to the west of the Project Site) for a mixed-use phased 
development, comprising residential development of 125 dwellings, 7 ha of 
employment land for B1, B2 and B8 uses, and land reserved for contingency 
housing provision of 320 dwellings. 
2.7.27

to the south-east of the Project Site) for residential development of 38 
dwellings and a public car park. 
2.7.28 
Policy HA4 allocates land west of Abbey Lane, Ampthill (approximately 2.5 km 
to the south-east of the Project Site) for residential development of a minimum 
of 410 dwellings. 
Bedford Borough Council 
Bedford Borough Local Plan (2002) (Saved Policies) 
2.7.29 
The Bedford Borough Local Plan was adopted in October 2002.  The Local 
Plan set out a wide range of policies and proposals to guide development in 
the Borough in the period up to 2006.   
2.7.30 
Following its expiry, a number of Local Plan policies were ‘saved’ for continued 
use in development control.  Some ‘saved’ Local Plan policies have 
subsequently been deleted following the adoption of the Core Strategy and 
Rural Issues Plan in 2008, the Town Centre Area Action Plan in 2008 and the 
Allocations and Designations Local Plan in 2013; however, a number of ‘saved’ 
Local Plan policies remain in force and are applicable to the Application. 
2.7.31 
As illustrated on the adopted Policies Map, the site is part-located within a 
designated County Wildlife Site and to the south-east of a designated Local 
Geological Site.  Saved Local Plan Policy NE3 states that development will not 
be permitted that may directly or indirectly destroy or adversely affect a County 
Wildlife Site or Regionally Important Geological Site.  
2.7.32 
Saved Policy NE4 states that the Borough Council will seek to protect and 
retain trees and hedges which are considered to be of amenity, landscape or 
wildlife significance. 
2.7.33 
Saved Policy NE8 states that where development would result in the loss of 
habitats or features, a replacement asset of a comparable or enhanced nature 
conservation value will be required.  Similarly, saved Policy NE9 seeks to 
control development which may have an impact on the nature conservation of 
a site, and saved Policy NE10 states that development will be expected to 
contribute to nature conservation. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
33 
 
2.7.34 
Saved Policy NE12 seeks to ensure that development proposals make early 
provision for adequate and appropriate landscaping.  In addition, saved Policy 
NE13 advises that adequate provision should be made for the retention, 
protection, management and maintenance of landscape features.  
2.7.35 
Saved Policy NE24 seeks to ensure that development proposals do not 
adversely affect the quality or quantity of water resources or their amenity or 
nature conservation value. 
2.7.36 
Saved Policy H11 allocates land north of Fields Road, Wootton (approximately 
4 km to the north of the Site) for mixed development including approximately 
450 dwellings. 
2.7.37 
Saved Policy H12 allocates land south of Fields Road, Wootton (approximately 
3.5 km to the north of the Site) for approximately 340 dwellings. 
2.7.38 
Saved Policy H13 allocates land at Rousbury Road, Stewartby (approximately 
1.5 km to the north of the Site) for residential development of approximately 
330 dwellings. 
2.7.39 
Saved Policy H14 allocates the Elstow Storage Depot (approximately 4 km to 
the north-east of the Site) for mixed-use development, including approximately 
375 dwellings. 
2.7.40 
Saved Policy T4 seeks to ensure the provision of landscape screening 
appropriate to the scale of proposed roads and the preservation of existing 
trees. 
2.7.41 
Saved Policy LR10 states that the Borough Council will, inter alia: safeguard 
existing footpath/bridleway links; and seek opportunities to enhance existing 
footpath, bridleway and cycle networks in conjunction with new development 
from the urban area into the countryside and the Forest of Marston Vale.  
2.7.42 
Saved Policy BE9 states that the Borough Council will seek to protect the 
character and appearance of designed conservation areas through the careful 
control of development. The policy states that proposals which fail to preserve 
or enhance their character will not be permitted.  
2.7.43 
Saved Policy BE11 states that the Borough Council will ensure that all new 
development likely to affect the setting of conservation areas, preserves or 
enhances its character or appearance. Applications will be assessed according 
to the following criteria: design (scale, form, density & materials), traffic 
generation, visual impact (streetscape, roofscape, skyline & open space) and 
potential economic regeneration benefits.  
2.7.44 
Chapter 13 identifies there are no designated heritage assets located within 
the Power Generation Plant Site however there are two Grade I and four Grade 
II* listed buildings within the wider study area. Saved Policy BE21 states that 
the Borough Council will seek to preserve and enhance the setting of listed 
buildings through controlling the design of new development, use of adjacent 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
34 
 
land and preservation of trees and landscape features in the vicinity of listed 
buildings.  
2.7.45 
Chapter 13 identifies there are no scheduled monuments located within the 
Power Generation Plant Site however there is one scheduled monument 
(Ampthill Castle) located in the vicinity of the site. Saved Policy BE23 states 
that proposals which would have an adverse effect on scheduled ancient 
monuments and other important archaeological assets and their settings will 
not be permitted except where adverse impacts can be mitigated while keeping 
the asset physically preserved in situ.  
2.7.46 
Saved Policy BE24 states that the Borough Council will have regard to the 
need to protect, enhance and preserve sites of archaeological interest and 
their settings when considering planning applications. The policy goes on to 
state that planning permission will be refused where an adequate assessment 
has not been undertaken to evaluate the archaeological aspects of proposals.  
2.7.47 
Saved Policy BE29 Design states that the Borough Council expects all new 
development to be designed to the highest standards and the Council will 
promote good design by means of design guides, good design principles and 
other appropriate measures that it will publicise. 
2.7.48 
Saved Policy BE30 states that the Borough Council will have full regard to all 
material considerations when determining applications for new development 
and particular; visual impact; design quality of building and public spaces; 
traffic generation and potential for sustainable non-car modes; health and 
safety issues; generation of waste; adequacy of existing infrastructure; and 
any adverse impacts on neighbours, the surrounding community, the natural 
environment and built heritage.  
2.7.49 
Saved Policy BE38 states that the Borough Council will not grant planning 
permission unless sufficient provision has been made for landscaping (on-site 
or off-site) which results in an environmental / landscape benefit. The Borough 
Council may also negotiate commuted sums to secure the management and 
maintenance of landscaped areas where appropriate.  
Bedford Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan (2008) 
2.7.50 
The Bedford Borough Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan was adopted in 
2008.  The Plan sets out the long term vision and spatial strategy for Bedford 
Borough to 2021. The following key policies are relevant to the Project. 
2.7.51 
Policy CP2 sets out a number of sustainable development principles which 
seek to ensure that, inter alia: resources and infrastructure are used efficiently; 
biodiversity is protected and resources are conserved; and climate change is 
properly addressed. 
2.7.52 
Policy CP10 states that ‘a minimum of 16,000 net additional jobs will be 
provided in the borough by 2021’, and Policy CP11 states that up to 75ha of 
additional employment land will be provided in the period 2001-2021. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
35 
 
2.7.53 
Policy CP21 advises that all new development should, inter alia, be of the 
highest design quality, fully consider the wider context and address sustainable 
design principles. 
2.7.54 
Policy CP24 states that ‘The Marston Vale will be the focus for landscape 
enhancement and restoration and the council will continue to support the 
Forest of Marston Vale.’  New development should protect and where 
appropriate enhance the quality and character of the landscape. 
2.7.55 
Policy CP25 states that the biodiversity and geodiversity of the borough will be 
protected and where appropriate enhanced.  Appropriate mitigation and/or 
compensation will be required where harm to biodiversity and/or geodiversity 
is likely to be a result of development. 
2.7.56 
In regards to climate change and pollution, Policy CP26 advises that the 
Council will require development to, inter alia: 
 
Minimise the emission of pollutants into the wider environment; 
 
Have regard to the cumulative impacts of development proposals on air 
quality; 
 
Minimise the consumption and use of energy; 
 
Utilise sustainable construction techniques; 
 
Incorporate facilities to minimise the use of water and waste; and 
 
Limit any adverse effects on water quality, reduce water consumption and 
minimise the risk of flooding. 
Bedford Allocations and Designations Local Plan (2013) 
2.7.57 
The Bedford Borough Allocations and Designations Local Plan was adopted in 
2013.  The Plan allocates sites to meet the Borough's future development 
needs and designates areas of land where specific policies will apply. 
2.7.58 
The Local Plan does not allocate any land within close proximity of the Site for 
new development; however Policy AD13 allocates the Marston Vale Innovation 
Park Phase 2 at Wootton (approximately 3 km to the north of the Site) for a 
mix of classes B1(a)(b)(c) and B2 uses. 
Draft Bedford Borough Local Plan 2035 
2.7.59 
Bedford Borough Council is currently preparing a new Local Plan that will guide 
new development within the Borough up to 2035. The new Local Plan will 
allocate the amount and location of new development across the Borough and 
contain planning policies to manage the delivery of new development.   
2.7.60 
An initial ‘Call for Sites’ and Issues and Options consultation was undertaken 
in early 2014, and a further ‘Call for Sites’ was undertaken in late 2015.  A 
Consultation Paper was published in April 2017 and consultation ran from 24th 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
36 
 
April to 9th June 2017. Further consultation is anticipated in early 2018, 
followed by submission of the Draft Local Plan in late 2018 and adoption in 
2019.  Upon adoption, the Local Plan 2035 will replace the adopted Core 
Strategy and Rural Issues Plan as the key DPD for the Borough.   
Mid-Bedfordshire Council 
Mid-Bedfordshire Local Plan (2005) (Saved Policies)  
2.7.61 
The Mid-Bedfordshire Local Plan: First Review was adopted in December 
2005.  The Local Plan set out a wide range of policies and proposals to guide 
development within the former Mid-Bedfordshire district.  The majority of the 
Local Plan policies have now been superseded by the Central Bedfordshire 
Core Strategy and Development Management Policies document (adopted in 
2009), however some policies have not been superseded and continue to be 
part of the development plan. 
2.7.62 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (1) allocates land east of Lidlington 
(approximately 2 km to the west of the Project Site) for residential development 
of approximately 60 dwellings. 
2.7.63 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (2) allocates land at Stewartby (to the north of 
the Project Site) for residential development of approximately 50 dwellings. 
2.7.64 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (2A) allocates land at High Street, Houghton 
Conquest (approximately 2.5 km to the east of the Project Site) for residential 
development of approximately 24 dwellings. 
2.7.65 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (3A) allocated land at Woburn Road, Marston 
Moretaine (approximately 1.5 km to the east of the Project Site) for residential 
development of approximately 100 dwellings. 
2.7.66 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (5) allocates land adjacent to Swaffield Close, 
Ampthill (approximately 3 km to the south-east of the Project Site) for 
residential development of approximately 50 dwellings.   
Joint Waste Authority (Bedford Borough Council, Central Bedfordshire 
and Luton Borough Councils)  
Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan (2005) 
2.7.67 
The Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan was adopted in 
2005 and covers Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough 
Councils.  The majority of the minerals and waste policies contained in the 
Local Plan have now been superseded by the Bedford Borough, Central 
Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council Minerals and Waste Local Plan: 
Strategic Sites and Policies (2014).  However, some policies have not been 
superseded and continue to be part of the development plan. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
37 
 
2.7.68 
Policy W4 states that an overall reduction in the amount of waste generation 
in the region will be actively encouraged. 
2.7.69 
Policy W5 requires that, where developments are likely to generate significant 
volumes of waste, a waste audit is undertaken which demonstrates that waste 
is minimised as far as possible and managed appropriately. 
2.7.70 
Policy W22 states that proposed waste management sites will be protected as 
far as practicable from development that may conflict or prejudice their waste 
management use.  
Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council – 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (2014) 
2.7.71 
The Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (MWLP:SSP) 
was adopted by Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough 
Councils on 30th January 2014.  The MWLP:SSP forms part of the Minerals 
and Waste Local Development Framework for the three Councils which also 
includes the Managing Waste in New Developments SPD (adopted in 2006), 
Minerals and Waste Development Scheme, Monitoring Report, Statement of 
Community Involvement (adopted in 2006) and Policies Map.  
2.7.72 
The General and Environmental Policies Local Development Document (LDD), 
which was anticipated for adoption in 2015/16, was also expected to form part 
of the MWLP:SSP. However instead of adopting this document, the saved 
minerals and waste policies will be replaced by new policy in the main 
Development Plan Documents being produced by the three authorities.   
2.7.73 
The MWLP:SSP sets out a series of strategic objectives for waste and minerals 
over the period 2013-2028, together with strategic allocations for mineral 
extraction and waste management development and strategic policies to guide 
the ongoing supply of minerals and development of waste management 
facilities.   
2.7.74 
The MWLP:SSP sets out a presumption in favour of sustainable development 
when considering development proposals, at Policy MWSP1, reflective of that 
contained in the NPPF.  Accordingly, Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire 
and Luton Borough Council will work proactively to find solutions which mean 
that proposals can be approved wherever possible, to secure development that 
improves the economic, social and environmental conditions in the Plan area.  
Policy MWSP1 further states that planning applications that accord with the 
MWLP:SSP and subsequent Local Development Documents will be approved 
without delay. 
2.7.75 
The MWLP:SSP addresses the provision of additional waste management 
capacity in a number of ways, including through various forms of recovery 
operations, in order to support the move towards a materials reusing economy.  
As part of the Spatial Strategy for Waste, Policy WSP2 allocates four sites for 
waste recovery uses, at Elstow North, Land at Former Brogborough landfill, 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
38 
 
Rookery Pit South, and Land at Thorn Turn.  The site at Rookery Pit South 
(107 ha), located predominantly within Central Bedfordshire Council and partly 
within Bedford Borough Council, is allocated for non-landfill waste 
management 
recovery 
operations 
and 
non-hazardous 
landfill, 
with 
opportunities for pre-treatment recovery operations prior to landfill. 
2.7.76 
Insert 2-4 shows an extract of the MWLP:SSP Policies Map, Inset 2, illustrating 
the extent of Rookery Pit South (shaded in yellow) allocated by Policy WSP2 
for waste recovery uses. 
Insert 2-4: Extract of MWLP:SSP Policies Map Inset 2 
 
2.7.77 
Policy MWSP2 requires that waste management and restoration proposals 
take account of climate change through measures to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and to adapt to future climate changes.  The supporting text to Policy 
MWSP2 acknowledges that all waste management developments have the 
scope to contribute to mitigating climate change (paragraph 4.15).  Paragraph 
4.16 of the MWLP:SSP states that applications should set out how waste 
management developments will make use of renewable, decentralised, and 
low carbon energy. 
2.7.78 
Paragraph 5.16 of the MWLP:SSP notes that a DCO was issued in March 2013 
for “the development [by Covanta Energy Ltd] of a Resource Recovery Facility 
on land at Rookery Pit South.”

2.8.4 
The Draft Local Plan (July 2017) includes broad policies for steering and 
shaping development, and other more detailed policies for determining 
planning applications, it does not at this stage include allocation policies for 
specific sites. These will feature in the next draft of the plan in spring 2018 
known as the pre-submission plan.  
2.8.5 
Once adopted, the Local Plan will be accompanied by the Policies Maps which 
provide a spatial representation of the Local Plan policies. The Policies Map 
has not yet been published with the Draft Local Plan.  
2.8.6 
The Draft Policies relevant to the Project are detailed below:  
2.8.7 
Draft Policy SP1 sets out the Growth Strategy for Central Bedfordshire in the 
period 2011-2031, which includes the delivery of 31,000 new homes and 
27,000 new jobs.   
2.8.8 
Draft Policy SP2 states that development proposals will be considered in 
accordance with the presumption in favour of sustainable development set out 
within the NPPF. 
2.8.9 
Draft Policy T1 states that development will be required to evidence that there 
is sufficient capacity in the transport network to accommodate the increase in 
demand to travel as a result of the development. 
2.8.10 
Draft Policy T2 states that development will be required to evidence that 
sufficient mitigation measures are in place to alleviate any pressures that are 
demonstrated to occur. 
2.8.11 
Draft Policy T3 states that proposals for new development must not have a 
detrimental effect on highway safety, patterns of movement and the access 
needs of all people. It states that development will be permitted where, inter 
alia, the proposal does not impede the free flow of traffic on the existing 
network or create hazards to that traffic and other road users.  
2.8.12 
Draft Policy EE4 seeks to protect existing trees, woodland and hedgerows. It 
states that existing hedgerows and trees should be integrated within 
developments, unless demonstrably inappropriate. Further, it states that any 
removal of trees or hedgerows to accommodate development must be justified, 
and should be replaced within the development site.  
2.8.13 
Draft Policy EE9 states that the Council will continue to support the creation of 
the Forest of Marston Vale. It required developments for new buildings within 
the Forest of Marston Vale to demonstrate how they will deliver 30% tree cover 
across their development site, through a combination of retaining and 
protecting existing trees and planting of new trees.  
2.8.14 
Draft Policy CC1 states that the Council will require that any new development 
minimises the vulnerability of the development and its surroundings to climate 
change. It lists the means through which new development will be required to 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
41 
 
incorporate measures that minimise and mitigate their impact on the 
environment.  
2.8.15 
Draft Policy CC3 states that development will be supported where inter alia, it 
located is in areas at lowest risk of flooding. A sequential approach to site 
layout is applied; a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment has been undertaken 
following the criteria within this policy and the NPPF and mitigation measures 
maximise water efficiency and contribute to a net gain in water quality, 
biodiversity, landscape character and green infrastructure. 
2.8.16 
Draft Policy CC5 states that all new development must, inter alia, demonstrate 
that the discharge of surface water obeys the priority order, demonstrate that 
surface water runoff is managed as close to its source as possible, and 
demonstrate that demonstrate that the run-off from all hard surfaces shall 
receive an appropriate level of treatment to minimise the risk of pollution. 
2.8.17 
Draft Policy CC6 requires all new developments to demonstrate that, inter alia, 
it has no adverse impact on the quality of waterbodies and groundwater, or will 
prevent future attainment of good status, and that development contributes 
positively to the water environment and its ecology and does not adversely 
affect surface and ground water quality.  
2.8.18 
Draft Policy CC7 states that development proposals which are likely to cause 
pollution or are likely to be exposed to potential unacceptable levels of pollution 
or land instability will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that 
measures can be implemented to minimise impacts to a satisfactory level 
which protects health, environmental quality and amenity. 
2.8.19 
Draft Policy HQ6 states that the Council will ensure that all developments are 
of the highest possible quality and respond positively to their context. It states 
that all development proposals should ensure that, inter alia, a clear distinction 
between public and private space using clear boundaries. proposals are 
complimentary to the existing natural environment, there is not an 
unacceptable adverse impact upon nearby existing or permitted uses, 
including impacts on amenity, privacy, noise or air quality; resources are used 
efficiently and energy and water efficiency is maximised; and any lighting 
associated with the development does not have a detrimental impact on the 
surrounding areas.  
2.8.20 
Draft Policy DC1 states that outside Settlement Envelopes the Council will 
work to maintain and enhance the intrinsic character and beauty of the 
countryside and only particular types of new development will be permitted. 
Central Bedfordshire Planning Obligations SPD (North) (2009) 
2.8.21 
The Central Bedfordshire Planning Obligations SPD (North) (2009) sets out 
proposals for negotiating and securing planning obligations associated with 
new development in Central Bedfordshire; however the approach contained 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
42 
 
within the Planning Obligations SPD (North) towards securing planning 
obligations is now no longer in use.   
2.8.22 
CBC is currently preparing a revised Planning Obligations Strategy for the 
whole of Central Bedfordshire which will sit alongside the CIL Charging 
Schedule. However, Central Bedfordshire Council are currently reviewing the 
charging schedule following the withdrawal of the Development Strategy in 
November 2015, and there is no agreed timescale for future work at this stage. 
due for adoption later in 2015.  Prior to adoption of the revised Planning 
Obligations Strategy, planning obligations will be determined on a case-by-
case basis. 
Central Bedfordshire Design Guide (2014) 
2.8.23 
The Central Bedfordshire Design Guide (2014) was adopted on 18th March 
2014 as technical guidance for development management purposes. The 
Design Guide sets out the key principles and standards to ensure the delivery 
of high quality design in Central Bedfordshire.  The document comprises one 
core chapter, entitled ‘Placemaking in Central Bedfordshire’, and nine 
accompanying themed supplements, including a chapter entitled ‘Green 
Infrastructure, Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Buildings’. 
Central Bedfordshire Sustainable Drainage Guide (2015) 
2.8.24 
The Central Bedfordshire Sustainable Drainage Guide provides technical 
guidance on the application of SuDS within Central Bedfordshire. It has been 
created to be a comprehensive resource for SuDS reference and policy 
development for decision makers and designers, developers and partner 
organisations to support the application of SUDS in a range of contexts across 
Central Bedfordshire.  
Central Bedfordshire Landscape Character Assessment (2015)  
2.8.25 
The Central Bedfordshire Landscape Character Assessment is a revision of 
the previous LCAs for the county of Bedfordshire covering the former Mid Beds 
and South Beds districts following unitary reorganisation. The LCA of Central 
Bedfordshire provides a comprehensive landscape evidence base to help 
underpin planning and management decisions in the Unitary Authority. The 
assessment presents a characterisation of the whole Unitary Authority through 
10 landscape types, and each landscape type is subdivided into component 
landscape character areas. 
Bedford Borough Council 
Bedford Borough Climate Change and Pollution SPD (2008) 
2.8.26 
The Bedford Borough Climate Change and Pollution SPD (2008) was adopted 
in December 2008 in order to give detailed guidance on the implementation of 
Policy CP26 of the Council’s Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan, which 
concerns climate change and pollution. The document seeks to promote a 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
43 
 
more sustainable approach to energy use, and provide practical advice on, 
inter alia, how to reduce carbon emissions, conserve water, minimise waste 
and minimise pollution. 
Bedford Borough Planning Obligations SPD (2013) 
2.8.27 
The Bedford Borough Planning Obligations SPD (2013) was adopted in July 
2013.  The SPD explains the Council’s policies and procedures for securing 
developer contributions through planning conditions and obligations in S106 
Agreements, as well as providing evidence and guidance to developers about 
the types of contributions that will be sought.   
Forest of Marston Vale Plan 
2.8.28 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale and therefore the 
Forest of Marston Vale Plan provides planning guidance of relevance to the 
Project.  The Forest of Marston Vale Plan was published as non-statutory 
planning guidance by Marston Vale Trust in 2000, in order to guide the creation 
of the Forest of Marston Vale as a Community Forest.  The Forest of Marston 
Vale Plan is a tool to achieve Forest objectives and support countryside 
enhancement policies, and the plan provides that it shall be a material 
consideration in the local authority’s determination of planning applications for 
development within the Forest boundary.  The publication of the Plan followed 
the designation of the Forest of Marston Vale as a Community Forest through 
the Forests for the Community programme, which aimed to achieve major 
environmental improvements around towns and cities. 
2.8.29 
The Project Site is located within the Brickfields Landscape Zone of the Forest 
of Marston Vale (Forest of Marston Vale Plan, Page15), as illustrated in Insert 
2-5. 
2.8.30 
The Forest of Marston Vale Plan identifies the site as located within the 
Brickfields Landscape Zone (Page 15). According to the Plan, the area is 
dominated by clay pits and their varying after-uses, transport infrastructure and 
expanding village settlements. This area is identified as a core area of the Vale 
where there is a need to secure a higher level of new planting than elsewhere 
in the community forest (Page 16).  
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
44 
 
Insert 2-5: Forest of Marston Vale Landscape Zones (Extract from Forest 
of Marston Vale Plan) 
 
2.8.31 
The Forest of Marston Vale Plan notes that the Brickfields Landscape Zone “is 
the core area of the Vale where there is a need to secure a higher level of new 
planting than elsewhere in the Community Forest”, in order to offer landscape, 
wildlife, recreation and amenity benefits (page 16).  Proposals for the 
Brickfields Landscape Zone include: “The Team will work with landowners to 
secure a higher proportion of woodland planting in this area than the more 
agriculturally productive land to either side of the Vale. All land types will need 
to be targeted to deliver the level of planting needed and landscape impacts of 
project work will need to be assessed from both the Vale floor and elevated 
positions on the ridges” (page 17). 
2.8.32 
The Forest of Marston Vale Plan also provides further guidance in respect of 
woodland creation and tree planting.  Page 21 of the Forest of Marston Vale 
Plan notes that, “Tree planting is the core objective of the Community Forest 
with the new woodland providing a setting for a wide range of other activities.  
Significant areas of tree planting will be secured towards the 30% target, with 
the core Brickfields and urban fringe zones being targeted for the highest 
proportion of tree planting. Reduced tree cover will be sought on the land to 
the east and west.”  Furthermore, in this regard, the Forest of Marston Vale 
Plan continues, that, “Opportunities offered through the restoration of landfill 
and derelict sites and planning agreements offer the greatest future prospects 
for large scale woodland creation” (page 21). 
2.8.33 
The Forest of Marston Vale Plan states that woodland creation and tree 
planting will be achieved through a number of means, including: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
45 
 
 
“implementing an annual programme of tree planting towards realising the 
long-term aim of 30% woodland cover in the Vale over a 40 year period.  
Joint working with landowners and organisations such as the Woodland 
Trust, local authorities and Forestry Commission will be promoted;” 
 
“promoting well designed new woodlands, as a resource, to deliver a wide 
range of landscape, economic, social and environmental benefits. 
Particular emphasis will be placed on securing larger woodlands (>20 ha) 
and those that meet defragmentation, urban fringe and access objectives 
in accordance with the England Forestry Strategy and DETR targets;” 
 
“encouraging and supporting landowners to ensure that all new woodlands 
are successfully established and well maintained, and developing new 
services to assist with this, where appropriate;” 
 
“working with planning authorities to ensure that developments provide 
opportunities to secure large scale new woodland creation in appropriate 
areas;” 
 
“working with site owners and planning authorities to ensure that 
restoration schemes for derelict land and landfill sites meet Forest 
landscape, wildlife and recreation objectives;” 
 
“seeking opportunities to secure land for woodland creation. This could be 
through acquisition, leasing, management partnerships or other suitable 
mechanisms.” 
2.8.34 
The Forest of Marston Vale Plan also notes that, “As part of creating the varied 
and well-wooded countryside of the Community Forest, the creation and 
management of a range of habitats other than woodland, such as farmland, 
grassland, and wetland, is important” (page 24).  Accordingly, page 26 of the 
Forest of Marston Vale Plan states that non-woodland habitats will be 
managed and created through a number of means, including: 
 
securing opportunities to maximise the ecological potential of the Marston 
Vale. This work will be done in conjunction with organisations such as the 
Wildlife Trust and English Nature and is to be guided by Biodiversity Action 
Plans where possible; 
 
using the Countryside Stewardship Scheme or other means to secure new 
hedgerow planting and enhanced management. Networks of well-
managed farmland and roadside hedges that link other habitats will be 
developed or strengthened; 
 
increasing and conserving areas of ecologically valuable grassland within 
the Community Forest, in partnership with the appropriate site owners and 
managers; 
 
promoting the appropriate management and increasing the amount of 
wetland habitats throughout the Marston Vale, including watercourses, 
ponds, lakes and any marsh areas; and 
 
working with the Wildlife Trust, Bedfordshire County Council, English 
Nature and other partners to ensure that any rare habitats and species are 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
46 
 
conserved and their status enhanced. Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
and County Wildlife Sites will be particularly important in this area of work.

Project and Site Description 
3.1 
Project Site and Surroundings 
The Rookery 
3.1.1 
The Project Site is partially located within ‘The Rookery’. The Rookery 
comprises two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South (both shown 
on Figure 1.2)) covering an area of some 210 ha, separated by an east-west 
spine of unexcavated clay.  The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale 
between Milton Keynes and Bedford.  It lies predominantly within the 
administrative area of CBC although it also falls, in part, within the 
administrative area of the adjacent BBC.  
3.1.2 
The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within Rookery 
South Pit which is approximately 95 ha in area and is bound by steep clay 
banks that are varied in nature and substrate. The level of the pit base currently 
varies between approximately 10 m and 15 m below ground level and includes 
open water, reed beds, pools and bare clay.  The land that remains at the 
original ground level, approximately 42 m above ordnance datum (AOD) 
immediately around the periphery of Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare 
ground that has been previously cleared of vegetation and subsequently 
maintained in this state over the last 30 or so years.  
3.1.3 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would extend from Rookery 
South Pit into farmland to the south as shown on Figure 1.2. Part of the Access 
Road would lie within Rookery North Pit. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
3.1.4 
The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing LLRS being undertaken by the 
landowner pursuant to a separate planning consent (application number -  
BC/CM/2000/8) in order to restore the former clay workings (i.e. below pre-
excavation ground levels) to low-intensity agricultural land, with measures 
included in the restoration to enhance biodiversity and landscape.  This 
restoration work is taking place independently of the Project, although a five-
year option agreement, which is extendable to seven under certain conditions, 
has been put in place between the Applicant and the landowner of Rookery 
Pit. Included in the agreement is a clause which ensures that the elements of 
the LLRS as set out below at paragraph 3.1.5 will be completed prior to the 
commencement of the development of the Project (anticipated to be in 2020 at 
the earliest). The EIA baseline assessments, as presented in this ES, assume 
that these LLRS works have been completed.   
3.1.5 
The LLRS works for Rookery South Pit which form part of the baseline for this 
ES comprise: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
48 
 
the re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils and 
clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side with re-
grading of the base of the pit to an approximate level of 15 mbgl; 
 
implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction of an 
attenuation pond and pumping station in order to facilitate a managed 
surface water drainage strategy; 
 
a landscape strategy to include planting on the boundary of the Rookery 
South Pit and the margins of the attenuation pond;  
 
provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to 
ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through 
excavation; 
 
provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of 
Rookery North Pit and around the attenuation pond within Rookery South 
Pit; 
 
provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North Pit 
which connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along the 
western side of Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp and existing track 
are both of an agricultural standard; and 
 
provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery South 
Pit from the south side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, near 
Millbrook Station.     
3.1.6 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of the existing extent of Rookery 
South Pit will be undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms 
part of the existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not 
historically been subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will 
provide material for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to 
Rookery South Pit together with the implementation of a landscape and 
ecology strategy, which will integrate with ecological mitigation works and 
strategic landscape planting in Rookery North Pit.  
3.1.7 
It is anticipated that all LLRS works will be completed prior to the 
commencement of the construction works for the Project. Although it is 
possible that the buttressing and re-profiling to the eastern side of Rookery 
South Pit may not be completed, these works are outside of the Project Site 
and any environmental effects associated with the continued LLRS works have 
been included in the baseline assessments.  
3.1.8 
Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 
15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating 
Equipment Site, Laydown Area and the Substation. 
Wider Setting 
3.1.9 
To the north of The Rookery, beyond Green Lane, lie the remaining former 
brickworks buildings and chimneys of the Stewartby Brickworks as well as the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
49 
settlement of Stewartby, part of which is a conservation area. Other nearby 
residential areas include: Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5 km to the east 
of the Project Site boundary; Marston Moretaine approximately 1.2 km to the 
west; and Millbrook approximately 400 m to the south.  These residential areas 
are shown on Figure 1.1. 
3.1.10 
The Project Site is within The Forest of Marston Vale - an evolving community 
forest which runs south west from the towns of Bedford and Kempston towards 
the M1 motorway. It is operated by a registered charity- The Marston Vale 
Trust. 
3.1.11 
The Forest of Marston Vale is one of twelve of community forest projects in the 
United Kingdom. It was initiated by the Countryside Agency and the Forestry 
Commission, 
in 
partnership 
with Bedfordshire 
County 
Council, Mid 
Bedfordshire District Council, and BBC. The total area covered is 61 square 
miles (158 km2). There are incentives for landowners to plant trees, and the 
target for community forests in general is to reach 30% tree cover. 
3.1.12 
The principal public open space in the Forest is Marston Vale Millennium 
Country Park, as shown on Figure 1.2, which provides habitat conservation 
and indoor and outdoor community amenities and is also the site of a wind 
turbine. There is also a Forest Centre within the Country Park which provides 
the focal point for the indoor and outdoor community amenities. Millbrook 
Proving Ground, a vehicle testing ground covering 285 ha, is located to the 
south-west of the Electrical Connection. 
3.1.13 
Road access to the Power Generation Plant Site is currently from the north 
near Stewartby via the A421, Bedford Road (this is the old-A421 formerly 
known as the C94) and Green Lane, as shown on Figure 1.2. There is a 
junction on Green Lane leading to an access track which extends southwards 
into Rookery South Pit and the Generating Equipment Site. The Gas and 
Electrical Connections would be accessed, in part, by the route described 
above then through the Power Generation Plant Site. They would also be 
accessed from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then 
southwards for approximately 7 km along the B530 (referred to variously along 
its route as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) 
to Millbrook Road (for the Gas Connection) continuing along Houghton Lane 
and Station Lane to access the Electrical Connection.  
3.1.14 
A level crossing of the Marston Vale Rail line is located 70 m to the west of the 
junction between Green Lane and the Access Road. The Kimberley College (a 
STEM - Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics – Sixth Form 
College) is located to the north of Green Lane, 400 m to the west of the 
proposed site access.   
3.1.15 
There are overhead power lines that run west to east, to the south of Rookery 
South Pit. Furthermore, a number of existing public footpaths are located in 
and around the Project Site, linking it to the wider Marston Vale. As part of the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
50 
LLRS there are also a series of permissive footpaths proposed within the 
Rookery (See Appendix 12.1).  
3.1.16 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western 
flank of Rookery South Pit whilst a tributary watercourse, passing to the south 
of Rookery South Pit within the Project Site, joins Mill Brook in the vicinity of 
South Pillinge Farm. Further detail is provided in Chapter 9 and shown on 
Figure 9.1. 
3.1.17 
Substantial areas of land around Stewartby, including The Rookery, have been 
previously worked for clay that was used in Stewartby Brickworks until it closed 
in 2008. Following clay extraction, these former clay working sites have been 
restored (to varying levels of completion) by different means and to different 
uses, including water based recreation and commercial sites.   
3.1.18 
Furthermore, significant regeneration and development is allocated for the 
Northern Marston Vale Growth Area, in which the Project Site is located.  This 
will result in further change within the landscape, not least represented by the 
provision of substantial residential and employment development such as in 
the nearby settlements of Marston Moretaine and Stewartby. 
3.1.19 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located largely 
outside of Rookery South Pit, in a less dynamic, mostly undeveloped 
agricultural landscape which comprises large arable fields, small areas of 
woodland, hedgerows and a number of drainage ditches. 
3.1.20 
The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 130 m to the west of the Project Site 
boundary. South Pillinge Farm is separated from the Project Site by a small 
deciduous woodland.  
Relevant Planning History 
3.1.21 
The area around the Marston Vale has a long history of clay extraction, which 
was used primarily for the brick industry resulting in former clay extraction pits 
dominating the Marston Vale. Some have been restored for amenity use (e.g. 
on the nearby Millennium Country Park), while others have been used for 
landfill (e.g. Stewartby and Brogborough), whereas the Rookery South Pit has 
remained as an open, undeveloped pit.  
3.1.22 
Partial backfilling of Rookery South Pit has been recorded, including deposition 
of non-hazardous liquid organic wastes from a variety of industrial sources.  
The waste was reportedly mixed with un-weathered Oxford Clay deposits 
commonly known as the “callow” and pumped, as sludge, into the south 
eastern quarter of the Rookery North Pit and the north eastern quarter of 
Rookery South Pit but outside of the Project Site boundary. 
3.1.23 
Additional fill to the base of Rookery South Pit has also been historically 
undertaken by placement of variable thicknesses (generally from 1 m to 4 m) 
of Callow Clay Fill across the base of the pit.  These naturally occurring 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
51 
deposits were unsuitable for the brick making process and were cast back into 
the pit along with brick fragments and other overburden deposits. 
3.1.24 
The land directly north of the Generating Equipment Site has been allocated 
to a Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) which Covanta Rookery South Limited 
obtained DCO consent for pursuant to the PA 2008 in autumn 2011 (the 
‘Covanta RRF Project’).  Construction has not commenced on the Covanta 
RRF Project and therefore it has been considered as part of the cumulative 
effects assessment in each topic chapter rather than as part of the baseline 
conditions as discussed in section 4.10 below. Nevertheless, as the proposed 
start of construction for the Covanta RRF Project is Q1 2018 there is the 
possibility that construction of the Covanta RRF Project could occur during 
Examination of the DCO Application for the Project. If this is the case, the 
cumulative assessments presented still represent a sufficient assessment of 
the potential cumulative effects of both projects during construction and 
operation.  
Development Parameters and the ‘Rochdale Envelope’ 
3.1.25 
As a series of parameters have been built into the design of the Project, this 
ES has been prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using 
the Rochdale Envelope’. AN9 states that PINS understands that ‘…the 
‘Rochdale Envelope’ is an acknowledged way of dealing with an application 
comprising EIA development where details of a project have not been resolved 
at the time when the application is submitted’. 
3.1.26 
In the case of this Project, it is considered that the DCO Application would be 
flexible enough using the Rochdale Envelope approach to allow the Applicant 
to construct and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by 
building one Gas Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which 
could be procured from a range of suppliers. 
3.1.27 
It is made clear in AN9 that an EIA must ‘...ensure that all the realistic and likely 
worst case variations of the project have been properly considered and clearly 
set out in the ES and as such that the likely significant impacts have been 
adequately assessed’. 
3.1.28 
To this end, where flexibility in parameters for the Project (such as the height 
of the stack) has been provided, the Applicant has assessed the realistic worst 
case and it is made clear in each ‘topic’ assessment what this constitutes. 
3.2 
Description of Power Generation Plant 
3.2.1 
The elements which make up the Power Generation Plant are set out in 
paragraph 1.1.4 and are described in turn below. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
52 
Generating Equipment 
Overview 
3.2.2 
The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be approximately 
4 ha. Figure 3.1 shows an indicative illustration of the position and layout of 
the Generating Equipment with the Electrical Connection. The design would 
be finalised in the event that a DCO is made by the SoS and the Gas Turbine 
Generator has been procured. The Requirements of the DCO (similar to 
planning conditions) would control the detail of the final design and would 
require approval by the relevant planning authorities at that time (in this case 
CBC and BBC). In addition, embedded and additional mitigation would be 
inherent to the design. The Applicant is therefore proposing to submit its 
application on the basis of a series of parameters for the Project which allows 
an assessment of the realistic worst case in accordance with the ‘Rochdale 
Envelope’ approach as explained in paragraphs 3.1.25 – 3.1.28 above. 
3.2.3 
The nature and purpose of peaking plants such as that which is proposed for 
the Project is set out in paragraph 1.1.10 and the reason for selecting OCGT 
plant as the most appropriate technology choice is further described in Chapter 
5. The paragraphs below therefore describe the operation of OCGT plants in 
more detail.  
Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
3.2.4 
An ‘industrial’ type gas turbine would be used for the Project. This type of 
turbine has been selected as it is suited to generating up to 299 MW using only 
one unit, thereby reducing potential effects of noise, air quality and visual 
impacts. Additionally, they are suitable for frequent and fast start-ups, 
flexibility, and high-availability maintenance techniques.   
3.2.5 
The main equipment in an OCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, including the 
following components: 
 
Gas turbine generator; 
 
air inlet filter house; 
 
air inlet duct; 
 
exhaust diffuser; 
 
Auxiliaries including: 
 
Lube oil system; 
 
Air dryers; 
 
Fuel gas filter package; 
 
Instrument air system; 
 
Compressor washing; and 
 
A stack with an exhaust silencer would also be part of the OCGT.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
53 
3.2.6 
On entering the gas turbine, air would be compressed and natural gas injected 
into the air. The air and natural gas mixture would then burn in the combustion 
chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would then expand 
across the blades of the gas turbine driving the compressor and the electrical 
generator to produce electricity. 
3.2.7 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process would be released into 
the atmosphere via the stack. The stack would contain equipment which would 
reduce emissions released to the atmosphere, including a silencer. 
3.2.8 
Further information on why the exhaust gases are emitted to the atmosphere 
and cannot be recovered is given in Chapter 5 of this ES and in a separate 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) statement (Appendix 5.1).  
3.2.9 
A stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project to 
determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generator required 
for adequate dispersion of emissions to meet legislative air quality targets. The 
findings of this initial study setting out the height parameters are in Table 3.1.  
3.2.10 
Stack emissions would be continuously recorded to ensure correct and 
efficient operation of the Generating Equipment. Any significant deviations to 
emission limit values specified in the Environmental Permit required for the 
Project would be alarmed and corrections carried out on occurrence. Records 
of performance and deviation would be maintained. Full facilities for interfacing 
information, control and alarm systems would be installed so that the 
Generating Equipment can be operated from a central control room via a 
distributed control system (DCS). In the event of a fault in the Gas Turbine 
Generator or other major plant items, the Generating Equipment would shut 
down automatically in a controlled manner. 
3.2.11 
Processed natural gas sourced from the National Transmission System is a 
clean burning fuel and does not produce the particulate or sulphur emissions 
associated with burning coal. Further discussion of emissions characteristics 
from the Generating Equipment is provided in Chapter 6 of this ES which sets 
out the findings of the air quality assessment.

Laydown Area 
3.2.15 
A temporary Laydown Area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. 
This is shown on Figure 1.2.  
Access Road 
3.2.16 
An agricultural access track is already in existence at the Project Site, linking 
Green Lane to Rookery South Pit.  The LLRS, as described in paragraphs 
3.1.4 – 3.1.8, includes work to build a new ramp into the Rookery South Pit 
itself. 
3.2.17 
The Covanta RRF Project includes provision to upgrade this track further, to a 
tarmac road suitable for 594 traffic movements a day for the delivery of waste 
via HGV.  Should this road be developed as part of the Covanta RRF Project 
prior to the development of this Project, it would be suitable to meet both the 
needs of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project. In this instance, there would 
be a requirement for a short section of new Access Road (‘Short Access Road’) 
of up to 1.4 km in length connecting the end of the Covanta RRF road to the 
Generating Equipment Site. References in this ES to the "Access Road" mean 
the up to 2.2 km access road referred to below and includes the Short Access 
Road. References to the "Short Access Road" refer only to the approximately 
1.4 km length road that MPL would construct in the event that the Covanta 
scheme commenced ahead of the Project. The Short Access Road would be 
constructed from tarmac bordered by a concrete kerb. The tarmac surface 
would be 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic. It is bordered on one side by a 
footway.  
3.2.18 
However, because it is not certain when the Covanta RRF Project will be 
implemented, the Applicant has also included the provision of a complete 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
58 
Access Road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site within this 
Project. If the Covanta RRF Project is not built before construction commences 
for the Project, then the complete Access Road would be built. This complete 
2.2 km long Access Road would be constructed from tarmac bordered by a 
concrete kerb. The tarmacked surface would be 6 m wide allowing for two-way 
traffic. It would be bordered in part on one side by a footway where there is no 
existing footpath. 
3.2.19 
The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the alignment of 
the access road proposed within the LLRS and Covanta RRF Project along the 
existing access track which borders Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery 
South Pit, the Access Road (as would also be the case for the Covanta RRF 
Project's access road) would use the access ramp (built to agricultural 
standard as part of the LLRS as described below) to enter into the pit and cross 
through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site.  
3.2.20 
Should the Access Road for the Project be constructed first, it would not 
prevent the Covanta RRF Project or other developments from progressing at 
a later date, although it may mean that the Access Road would be upgraded 
as part of the other scheme(s). The upgrade of the Access Road would be the 
responsibility of Covanta in the event that the permission for that scheme is 
implemented after any DCO for the Project. 
Car Parking 
3.2.21 
During construction adequate car parking would be provided within the 
Laydown Area. During operation car parking for operational and maintenance 
staff would be provided within the Generating Equipment Site and the 
Substation.  
Lighting and Security Fencing 
3.2.22 
Lighting columns would be erected around the perimeter of the Generating 
Equipment in order to provide security lighting and lighting for safe working in 
dark conditions. The lighting columns would be approximately 8 m in height 
and regularly spaced around the perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site.  
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) 
3.2.23 
On the basis that the Project's maximum rated electrical output would be 299 
MW, the Project would be below the threshold set out in Directive 
2009/31/EC29 on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and NPS EN-1 and 
EN-2 for when operators of combustion plants are required to have assessed 
the feasibility of: a storage site, transport facilities and economic 
considerations of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) (e.g. CCR for CCS) 
produced as a result of the combustion process. Therefore, it is not considered 
necessary to assess the viability of CO2 capture or include it further in this ES. 
3.2.24 
It is noted that the Project consented by the DCO must have a “rated electrical 
output” of, or less than, 299 MWe and that the Applicant intends to procure a 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
59 
generating station with a rated electrical output of no more than 299 MWe 
measured at the terminals of the Generating Equipment.  
3.2.25 
The Applicant will be required to demonstrate that it would not be possible for 
the operating plant to exceed 299 MWe, in order to comply with the IED that 
requires all new combustion plants with a rated electrical output of 300 MW or 
more to have met a number of conditions and ensured space is available for 
carbon capture and storage. 
3.3 
Description of Gas Connection 
3.3.1 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas 
to be imported to the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to 
produce up to 299 MW, including a new underground pipeline and AGI.   
3.3.2 
The underground gas pipeline connection (the Pipeline) would be constructed 
between the AGI (to be installed at the connection point with the National 
Transmission System) and the Generating Equipment. The Pipeline and AGI 
are required in order to connect the Generating Equipment to the existing high 
pressure National Transmission System so as to provide a reliable supply of 
fuel.  The feasibility and route selection studies undertaken for this connection 
are described in Chapter 5. 
Route  
3.3.3 
The route of the Gas Connection is approximately 1.8 km in length as shown 
on Figure 1.2. It involves no major road crossings, one minor road crossing, 
one farm track crossing, no major or minor water crossings, two ditch crossings 
and no in-road mains-laying. It also crosses the National Transmission System 
Feeder 9 gas pipeline and an oil pipeline.  
3.3.4 
The Pipeline begins at the AGI which would allow connection into the National 
Transmission System Feeder 9, east of the Millbrook Proving Ground 
approximately 1.45 km south of the Generating Equipment Site. The Pipeline 
exits the AGI to the north and immediately crosses a farm track which is 
connected to Lower Farm. The route then continues in a northerly direction for 
around 25 m before it turns 45 to the west crossing National Transmission 
System Feeder 9. It continues west for approximately 20 m before turning 45 
back to the east. It continues in this northerly direction for approximately 110 
m before crossing a PROW.  
3.3.5 
After another 70 m, the route turns 45 to the west before crossing Millbrook 
Road. The route then turns 45 back to the east for 100 m and then 45 further 
to the east before crossing under a set of overhead lines. After a further 30 m 
the route turns 45° to the west and continues due north for approximately 250 
m before turning a further 22.5° west and crossing between a gap in the 
hedgerow of a field boundary. After crossing the hedgerow, the route turns a 
further 22.5° west and after approximately 300 m crosses beneath an oil 
pipeline. The route then continues in the same direction for approximately 220 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
60 
m before turning 11.25° to the east and after 80 m crosses a further PROW 
and a field drain. 
3.3.6 
The route then continues for a further 100 m before turning 90°west into the 
Generating Equipment Site.   
Connection to the National Transmission System  
3.3.7 
Connection of the Pipeline to a National Transmission System feeder would 
require an AGI to be installed which would include: a Minimum Offtake 
Connection (MOC) facility, which would be owned by National Grid Gas Plc 
(NGG), and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) Facility  which would be owned 
by the Applicant (together, referred to as the AGI). 
3.3.8 
The MOC (approximately 35 m x 35 m in area) would contain: 
 
Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.3.9 
The PIG Facility (approximately 35 m x 30 m in area) would contain: 
 
PIG launching facility; 
 
Emergency control valve; 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.3.10 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at the gas receiving station on 
the Generating Equipment Site.   
3.3.11 
Two options would be used with regard to access for the Gas Connection.  
These access options are shown on Figure 12.2, and are as follows:  
 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site; and 
 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road. 
3.3.12 
An existing junction off Houghton Lane onto an existing agricultural track would 
both be upgraded and used to access the AGI.  
3.3.13 
During construction, a temporary laydown area would be required adjacent to 
the AGI for laydown of plant and equipment.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
61 
3.4 
Description of the Electrical Connection 
3.4.1 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to 
enable power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS, 
such as the Substation comprising switchgear bays, gantries, emergency 
power supply, welfare accommodation, battery rooms, control cubicles and 
internal site roads.  
3.4.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken in March 2014 in order to define 
and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating Equipment 
to the NETS. This (along with consultations undertaken with NGET) identified 
that the most suitable point of connection would be a new substation to be 
located adjacent to the western boundary of the Generating Equipment Site, 
which would connect into the existing NGET double circuit 400 kV line (forming 
part of the NETS) which runs from Sundon to Grendon.  The 400 kV line is 
located approximately 320 m southwest of the Generating Equipment Site as 
shown on Figure 1.2. 
3.4.3 
Further refinement and discussion with NGET in 2017 have allowed the 
connection design to be reduced to a single option which is presented in this 
ES. This comprises one underground 400kV double circuit Tee-in, requiring 
one new transmission tower, which would replace an existing tower, and be 
located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, 
therefore resulting in no net additional towers. The Electrical Connection would 
also require two SECs, which will be located on either side of the existing 
transmission line.  Underground cables would be approximately 500 m in 
length buried in four trenches typically 5 m apart, to a new substation. Three 
cables would be laid together within each trench to make 12 cables in total.  
3.4.4 
The SECs and replacement tower may cause a permanent obstruction to the 
LLRS secondary access. If this is the case, a short permanent diversion would 
be provided.  
Substation  
3.4.5 
A new 400Kv Substation would be located in Rookery South pit, adjacent to 
the Generating Equipment Site.  A substation can either be an air insulated 
substation (AIS) or a gas insulated substation (GIS). MPL considers that a 
Substation with AIS technology is appropriate and acceptable in the location 
(within Rookery South Pit). The Substation would be approximately 200 m x 
150 m.  
3.4.6 
Two access route options would be used for construction access for the 
Electrical Connection.  They are shown on Figure 12.2 and are as follows:  
 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation Plant 
Site; or 
 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7 km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
62 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and 
Station Lane. The secondary access into the southern side of Rookery 
South Pit that is being constructed as part of the LLRS would then be used 
to access the Electrical Connection. 
3.4.7 
An assessment of both access routes has been undertaken and is presented 
in this ES. 
3.5 
Activities relating to Construction, Maintenance and Decommissioning  
Overview 
3.5.1 
Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months. The main works associated with the construction phase would be 
preparation for new foundations, piling (if required), erection of the Generating 
Equipment, construction of the Access Road and the laying of the Gas Pipeline 
and erecting the Electrical Connection. No requirements for demolition or 
remediation have been identified at this stage barring the removal of the 
existing transmission tower in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission 
route corridor.  
3.5.2 
As referred to in paragraphs 3.1.4 to 3.1.8 above, the option agreement 
between the Applicant and the landowner ensures that, as a minimum, those 
highlighted elements of the LLRS would be complete prior to construction of 
the Project commencing (which is anticipated to be in 2020 at the earliest). 
Construction – Power Generation Plant 
Site Establishment 
3.5.3 
If a DCO is granted and ‘Start of Development’ requirements are approved, 
work can start on the Power Generation Plant Site. 
3.5.4 
Haul routes would be established at appropriate locations within the Project 
Site (away from sensitive residential receptors, waterbodies and the 
hedgerows and woodland adjacent to the Power Generation Plant Site).  The 
construction laydown area would also be prepared which would include offices 
and welfare facilities for the management team and construction workers.   
3.5.5 
In terms of site establishment, vegetation would be cleared, topsoil would be 
stripped and the land re-profiled as required for the design of the Project.   
3.5.6 
Suitable steps would be taken to prevent uncontrolled discharge and pollution 
of surface and ground water from commencement of the works on site. 
3.5.7 
Additional geotechnical investigations would be carried out to confirm details 
of ground properties for optimisation of foundation design. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
63 
3.5.8 
For preparation of the laydown area, an area is cleared and stoned and initial 
site cabins placed with offices, first aid, changing rooms, mess facilities with 
temporary sewage system and parking for cars and machinery. 
3.5.9 
The LLRS, as described in paragraphs 3.1.4 - 3.1.8 includes initial work to 
build a new ramp into Rookery South Pit.  Further work would then be 
undertaken to upgrade the existing access track from Green Lane to the 
Generating Equipment Site by reinforcing with suitable sub-grade material and 
covering with bituminous material bordered by a pre-cast concrete kerb. 
Civils  
3.5.10 
Piling, if required, is carried out using bored or driven piles in high load areas 
of the site such as plant and building column foundations. Shallow foundations 
for lighter buildings are excavated.  
3.5.11 
Vertical drainage is established and then underground services are excavated 
and placed.  
3.5.12 
Site roads are excavated, rolled with stone and a base coarse of tarmacadam 
placed. This greatly aids the cleanliness of the site during construction. 
Buildings 
3.5.13 
Steelwork columns, frames and roof trusses would be delivered and erected 
on to cured foundations. 
3.5.14 
Cladding would be fixed to building frames, insulation attached and outer 
cladding fixed to walls and roof. 
3.5.15 
Windows and doors would be fitted to make buildings weather tight. 
3.5.16 
Internal walls would be erected where buildings are divided. All buildings would 
be fitted out with electrical systems, plumbing and drainage as required. 
3.5.17 
Cable draw pits and duct banks around the site would be excavated and cast. 
Generating Plant Installation 
3.5.18 
The gas turbine and generator package with auxiliary equipment skid would 
be delivered to the site and placed over completed foundations with initial 
alignment. 
3.5.19 
Prefabricated interconnecting piping spools and ducting would be fitted to the 
gas turbine and generator package to interconnect its auxiliaries. 
3.5.20 
Fuel handling equipment skids would be placed and interconnecting piping 
made up. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
64 
3.5.21 
Electrical Switchgear is installed and cables pulled through prepared ducts to 
interconnect systems. 
Commissioning  
3.5.22 
All mechanical systems would be cold commissioned once alignment of 
rotating parts and pressure test of enclosed systems has been completed. 
3.5.23 
Electrical systems would be checked, commissioned and energised stage by 
stage. 
3.5.24 
All gas turbine generator systems would be checked and cold commissioned, 
together with control room and NG communications. 
3.5.25 
When all systems are energised and cold commissioned, the gas turbine is 
started and ‘first fired’. The turbine would be run to full speed no load before 
synchronising to the grid and producing electrical energy in increasing load 
steps. 
3.5.26 
Grid Code compliance tests would be carried out as well as performance, noise 
and emissions tests. 
Indicative Generating Equipment Maintenance Activities 
3.5.27 
Sufficient spares would be held to ensure reliable operation of the Generating 
Equipment. Materials and finishes would be selected to ensure that the 
appearance of the Generating Equipment does not deteriorate with time. 
Periodic and routine maintenance would take place, on average, once every 
six months, to ensure optimal operation of the Generating Equipment at all 
times. 
3.5.28 
The Generating Equipment would include on line monitoring and operational 
diagnosis to identify maintenance needs according to lifecycle use. 
3.5.29 
Maintenance would be planned based on a combination of accumulated start 
events and / or running hours. 
3.5.30 
In the event of an issue with the Power Generation Plant, an alarm system 
would signal instances where there are issues with abnormal operation. The 
plant would be shut down immediately in such instances and an engineer 
would attend site. The Power Generation Plant would not start up again until 
the issue had been resolved. 
3.5.31 
The shutdown duration is typically 15-20 days. Critical spare parts would be 
kept on the Power Generation Plant Site in the store building. Air inlet filters 
are changed based on accumulated pressure loss, in accordance with good 
industry practice (for example, after three years’ service). 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
65 
Construction - Gas Connection 
3.5.32 
Construction of the Pipeline would likely take place within a temporary fenced 
strip of land called the ‘working width’. The working width is required to facilitate 
safe construction and the protection of off-site receptors. 
3.5.33 
It is likely that the working width would be 50 m along the length of the Pipeline 
route, although it may be necessary to increase / decrease the working width 
at specific points. For example, adjacent to road and water crossings it may be 
necessary to increase the working width to provide additional working areas 
and storage for materials or special plant. Alternatively, adjacent to areas of 
conservation or existing services it may be necessary to decrease the working 
width to reduce potential impacts. 
3.5.34 
Aside from the special crossings, for example, water and road crossings, 
where trenchless techniques (e.g. Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD)) may 
be used to reduce impact on sensitive areas, it is expected that the Pipeline 
would be constructed using standard open-cut cross-country pipeline 
construction techniques. The main activities would include: topsoil stripping; 
pipe stringing (the process of laying the pipe end to end) and welding; trench 
excavation; pipe laying (positioning of the welded pipe into the trench); back 
filling; pressure testing, drying and pipeline pigging operations; and 
reinstatement of the land. 
3.5.35 
The Gas Connection would need to cross the Oil Pipeline. It is likely that this 
crossing could be completed using an open cut crossing technique, however, 
given the nature of the magnitude of the crossing, a cautious design approach 
has been proposed which utilises a trenchless crossing technique, specifically 
an Auger Bore. This approach would be subject to discussions with the 
operators and may require pre-agreed impact protection slabbing, fencing, 
method statement and/or construction techniques.  
3.5.36 
National Transmission System Feeder 9 high pressure gas pipeline would also 
need to be crossed. It is likely that the crossing would only require a standard 
open cut crossing technique; therefore, appropriate measures would need to 
be in place to ensure no third party damage is caused to the existing National 
Transmission System pipeline. This approach would be subject to discussion 
with NG and pre-agreed impact protection slabbing, fencing, method 
statements and/or construction techniques. Invasive ground investigations and 
more detailed discussions with NG would confirm the appropriateness of this 
crossing method in this situation. 
3.5.37 
The total area required for construction of the Gas Connection, including the 
temporary working width is approximately 6.52 ha.  
Indicative Gas Connection Maintenance Activities 
3.5.38 
The Gas Connection would remain operational for the entire lifetime of the 
Power Generation Plant. No parts of the Gas Connection would be manned. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

Telemetry apparatus (both within the Pipeline trench and at the AGI) would 
report back any issues to a central control room.  Should any issues be 
identified, the Pipeline would be isolated and the supply switched off, pending 
investigation of any faults.  Access to the AGI during maintenance / repair 
would be via an existing access off the Houghton Lane, as already described 
for construction access in section 3.3 above. 
3.5.39 
The primary maintenance and inspection activities would be as follows: 
 
visual checks; 
 
in-line inspection; 
 
cathodic protection checks; and 
 
valve operation checks. 
Construction – Electrical Connection 
3.5.40 
The Electrical Connection Site would be surveyed to mark out the boundaries 
and key features and to fix the equipment centrelines according to the 
approved planning and engineering drawings. 
3.5.41 
The perimeter of the secure Electrical Connection Site would be identified and 
the area cleared of vegetation as necessary, in accordance with the approved 
drawings. A temporary security fence with locked gates for main and 
emergency exits would be installed around the SECs and Substation.  A 
security cabin would be established to provide accommodation for full time 
security personnel for the duration of the works. 
3.5.42 
Additional geotechnical investigations may be required in order to confirm 
details of ground properties for foundation design. 
3.5.43 
Cable installation would follow a similar method to that for the Gas Connection. 
It would predominantly be carried out in an excavated trench with cable directly 
buried in the trench (open-cut method). The cable bedding would be laid (at a 
typical 1 m below ground level, subject to existing conditions and the location 
of existing buried services) and the cable pull set up. Once the cables are 
pulled in and the rollers removed, the cable surround can be installed with 
cable protection cover slabs placed over the cable. Finally, the backfilling and 
final reinstatement would be undertaken. 
3.5.44 
In conjunction with the construction of the Electrical Connection a temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line located adjacent to the three most westerly 
existing transmission towers within the Project Site would be required. It is 
anticipated that the temporary diversion is likely to be constructed as a single 
circuit outage of the existing 400 kV line. The temporary work is likely to require 
mast(s) or temporary tower(s), of up to 55 m in height. The temporary works 
are also likely to include the temporary erection of scaffolding over Station 
Lane for the protection of road users whilst the diversion is installed.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
67 
3.5.45 
Access for the purposes of installing and dismantling the temporary diversion 
would be as described for the Electrical Connection above. At this stage, it is 
anticipated that the installing and dismantling of the temporary works may 
require the temporary closure of Station Lane for up to approximately 1 day on 
two separate occasions and that the temporary diversion of the existing 400 
kV line would be in place for approximately five months.   
3.5.46 
The potential effects of the diversion have been assessed and are presented 
in this ES in each topic chapter under the assessment of the Electrical 
Connection.  
3.5.47 
The total area required for construction of the Electrical Connection, including 
the temporary working width is approximately 19.07 ha.  
Indicative Electrical Connection Maintenance Activities 
3.5.48 
The electrical equipment that is located within the SECs would be subject to 
periodic inspection. To perform such inspections, pedestrian access is 
adequate. Electrical equipment that contains moving parts, i.e. 400 kV earthing 
switches are subject to periodic maintenance, to carry out maintenance 
operations, essential safety equipment (portable earthing equipment) shall be 
brought in from a remote storage site. 
3.5.49 
In order to safely reach parts of the equipment subject to maintenance, a 
suitable access route for mobile elevated working platform (MEWP) shall be 
provided. In the case of a major repair requiring replacement of damaged 
electrical plant, suitable access for a mobile crane and transport shall be 
provided. Traction for vehicles over the open terrain can be achieved using 
temporary matting. 
3.5.50 
High Voltage cable systems are designed to require minimal maintenance 
during their working life. The route would be regularly checked to ensure that 
there are no excavation or construction works in the direct vicinity of the cables, 
that mounds of soil are not deposited above the cables and that trees are not 
planted above the cables; this should normally require little more than a drive 
past. 
3.5.51 
In addition, periodic inspection of any above ground equipment associated with 
the cable system would be required. The above ground equipment would 
include cable terminations, and structures, and bonding system link housings; 
this would require access to the equipment. In some case dirt and debris can 
deposit on cable termination insulators which may therefore require cleaning. 
It is also recommended that the integrity of the cable oversheath be tested at 
least once every two to three years; this would require access to the cable 
terminations and the bonding system link housings. In the event that the 
oversheath is found degraded or damaged then a repair may be required which 
would necessitate some excavation along the cable route (in most cases 
oversheath damage results from the actions of third parties).

Decommissioning 
3.5.52 
For the purpose of the EIA and in order to allow a decommissioning 
assessment to be presented in this ES, assumed working assumption has 
been used that the Project has an operational lifetime of 25 years. However, it 
should be noted that it is common for power stations to run for a much longer 
period than 25 years. In the case of the Project, a decision would be made at 
the appropriate time as to whether it would be ‘re-powered’ after 25 years 
(depending on the condition of plant items and the electricity market at the 
time). As such, the working assumption has been made for the purposes of 
this assessment that after 25 years, the Generating Equipment would be 
removed and the Generating Equipment Site re-instated to a similar condition 
as before construction. Any decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a 
similar duration to construction i.e. 22 months. A requirement has been 
inserted into the MPL Draft Order (Document Reference 3.1) to require the 
decommissioning of the Generating Equipment if it ceases to be used for an 
extended period.  
3.5.53 
Again, a working assumption has been used that the above ground elements 
of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection would be decommissioned 
after 25 years. However, it is important to note that elements of both 
Connections would be owned and operated by NGET and NGG. In accordance 
with its statutory duties, NGET and NGG may use these assets in the future 
as part of its wider network. As such, the date of any decommissioning cannot 
be certain and the 25 years working assumption has been used simply to allow 
for an assessment of decommissioning effects in this ES. Some elements of 
the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection may be left in situ as this is 
likely to cause less environmental effects than removal. This would be the case 
for the Pipeline, for example. 
3.6 
Embedded Mitigation  
3.6.1 
Embedded mitigation is mitigation which is either implicit in the design of the 
Project or its operation (through standard control measures, such as working 
within best practice guidance) either of which would routinely be incorporated 
for the Project or for any similar project constructed in the UK.  This embedded 
mitigation has been assumed in this ES to be in place from the outset, as it is 
mitigation without which the Project would be unlikely to be granted consent or 
allowed to commence. This ES has therefore assessed the likely significant 
effects of the Project, including its embedded mitigation.  
3.6.2 
The embedded mitigation included within the Project, discussed on a topic-by 
topic basis, is set out below and in the Key Mitigation Measures Roadmap at 
Appendix 3.1; it will be secured by the DCO and its requirements (and has 
been secured in the MPL Draft Order (Document Reference 3.1)).  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
69 
CEMP 
3.6.3 
During Construction of the Project a Construction Environmental Management 
Plan (CEMP) would be followed. The CEMP would set out best practice 
construction methods and safe working practices to be followed so as to limit 
construction impacts on the environment. Specific items included in a CEMP 
for the Project are discussed below topic by topic. An outline CEMP for the 
Project is included as Appendix 3.2.    
Air Quality 
Construction 
3.6.4 
Best practice measures to limit dust would be set out in the CEMP. This 
includes mitigation relating to: site planning, construction activities and site 
activities. Key measures include wheel washing, damping down of stockpiles 
during dry and windy conditions, and sheeting materials to prevent dust 
migration. Good site management practices (e.g. adherence to guidance such 
as ‘control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition, best 
practice guidance’ 2006) during the construction works will help to prevent the 
generation of airborne dust. It will be the responsibility of the nominated main 
contractor and site manager to ensure through the CEMP that sufficient 
precautionary measures to limit dust generation are undertaken. 
3.6.5 
Additionally, standard mitigation measures for low risk sites, taken from the 
Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) document ‘Dust and Air Emissions 
Mitigation Measures’ tables would also be applied. These are: 
 
Record all dust and air quality complaints, identify cause(s), take 
appropriate measures to reduce emissions in a timely manner, and record 
the measures taken. Make the complaints log available to the local authority 
when asked.;  
 
Record any exceptional incidents that cause dust and/or air emissions, 
either on- or off- site, and the action taken to resolve the situation in a log 
book. 
 
Avoid bonfires and burning of waste materials on site; and  
 
Ensure vehicles entering and leaving sites are covered to prevent escape 
of materials during transport. 
Operation 
3.6.6 
The Project has been designed from the outset to comply with legislative limits 
for the emissions of pollutants, particularly NOx. Together, NOx control on the 
turbine (through dry low NOx burners) and an appropriate stack height to 
ensure adequate dispersion of pollutants mean that breaches of assessment 
levels for pollutant concentrations during operation of the Project would be 
extremely unlikely under normal operating conditions.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
70 
Noise and Vibration 
Construction 
3.6.7 
The CEMP would incorporate best practice working methods such as: 
 
All construction activities would be undertaken in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS 5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on Construction 
and Open Sites’ Part 1 Noise and Part 2 Vibration; 
 
Construction works shall not take place outside the hours of 07:00 – 19:00 
Monday to Friday and 07:00 – 13:00 on a Saturday, with no working on 
Sundays or Bank Holidays unless otherwise agreed with BBC / CBC; 
 
Only plant conforming with relevant national or international standards, 
directives or recommendations on noise or vibrations emissions would be 
used; 
 
Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately, having 
regard to the manufacturer’s written recommendations or using other 
appropriate operation and maintenance programmes which reduce noise 
and vibration emissions; 
 
All vehicles and plant would be switched off when not in use; 
 
Approved routes and programming for the transport of construction 
materials, spoil and personnel to reduce the risk of increased noise and 
vibration impacts due to the construction of the Project; 
 
Vehicle and mechanical plant used for the purpose of the works should be 
fitted with effective exhaust silencers, to be maintained in good working 
order and operated in such a manner as to be maintained in good working 
order and operated in such a manner as to minimise noise emissions. The 
contractor should use plant items that comply with the relevant EU/UK noise 
limits applicable to all equipment; 
 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps would be 
positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance (e.g. as far away as 
practicable from sensitive receptors). If necessary, temporary acoustic 
barriers or enclosures would be provided; 
 
The positioning of construction plant and activities to minimise noise at 
sensitive receptors such as residential properties; 
 
Equipment that breaks concrete by munching or similar, rather than by 
percussion, should be used as far as is practicable; 
 
The use of mufflers on pneumatic tools; 
 
Where practicable, rotary drills actuated by hydraulic or electrical power 
should be used for excavating hard materials; 
 
The use of non-reciprocating construction plant where ever practicable; 
 
The use, where necessary, of effective sound reducing enclosures; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
71 
 
The targeting, where possible, of noisy work at times which minimise 
disturbance; and 
 
The contractors would be required to produce a noise control plan as part 
of the CEMP which would provide a noise management system tailored to 
the specific needs of the construction activities, the Project Site and the 
surrounding areas.  As a minimum the noise control plan would include:  
 
Procedures for ensuring compliance with statutory or other identified 
noise control limits;  
 
Procedures for minimising the noise from construction related traffic 
on the existing road network; 
 
Procedures for ensuring that all works are carried out according to 
the principle of “Best Practicable Means” as defined in the Control of 
Pollution Act 1974; 
 
General induction training for site operatives and specific training for 
staff having responsibility for particular aspects of controlling noise 
from the Project Site;  
 
A noise monitoring/auditing programme; and  
 
Liaison with the EHO at the LPA and the community.  
Operation 
3.6.8 
The design of the Project is such that the plant items which generate the most 
noise (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator) have been located as far away as 
possible from the nearest residential receptor (South Pillinge Farm, located 
approximately 390 m to the west of the Gas Turbine Generator), within the 
constraints of the Project Site. 
3.6.9 
The use of acoustic enclosures on the Gas Turbine Generator is also an 
inherent part of the project design and will mean that operational noise is 
limited to 75 dBA at 1 m from the Gas Turbine Generator housing and 106 dBA 
from the stack.  Noise from the Fin Fan Cooler(s) would be limited to 85 dBA 
at 1m from the coolers.   
Ecology 
Construction 
3.6.10 
The CEMP would incorporate measures to protect sensitive ecology during 
construction such as:  
 
Work compounds and access tracks etc. would not be located in, or 
adjacent to, areas that maintain habitat value; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
72 
 
Site fencing would be used to prevent access to areas outside working 
areas, particularly in areas adjacent to features of ecological value; 
 
Procedures would be implemented to address site safety issues, including 
storage of potentially dangerous materials; and  
 
Briefings and instruction would be given to contractors regarding the 
biodiversity issues associated with the Project Site.  
Operation 
3.6.11 
As per air quality considerations, the stack height has been set so as not to 
give rise to emissions which would impact sensitive ecological sites. 
Water Quality and Resources 
Construction 
3.6.12 
The CEMP would include the following best practice working methods to 
prevent water pollution: 
 
siting stockpiles away from watercourses;  
 
refuelling on deignated areas of hardstanding supplied with appropriate spill 
kits and bunded bowser only away from watercourses and surface drains; 
and 
 
installing construction site drainage.  
3.6.13 
The most appropriate best practice crossing methods would be used for 
watercourses (in the context of the Gas Connection). These are described in 
more detail in section 3.5.  
3.6.14 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored would be 
surrounded by an impermeable bund and located away from watercourses in 
accordance with as well as COSHH Regulations 2002 and the Control of 
Pollution (Oil Storage) Regulations 2001. Single tanks would be within bunds 
sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity and multiple tanks or drums would be 
within bunds sized to contain the greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the 
largest tank or 25 per cent of the total tanks contents.  Empty drums and any 
drums that are identified as leaking would be removed from the Project Site as 
soon as possible and disposed of appropriately in accordance with the relevant 
legislation.  
3.6.15 
Any surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons would be passed through 
oil/grit interceptors prior to discharge.  
3.6.16 
Precautions would be undertaken to ensure that silt laden runoff, arisings or 
chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses including the use of 
impermeable liners and fixing agents. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
73 
Operation 
3.6.17 
During operation, the EA would set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the Project Site under the Environmental Permit. 
3.6.18 
Operational site drainage would be appropriately designed to meet the needs 
of the Project and would be managed by the LLRS drainage system. Any 
surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons would be passed through oil/grit 
interceptors prior to discharge.  
Ground Conditions 
Construction  
3.6.19 
The CEMP would include best practice working methods to prevent pollution 
to the ground and ground water. These would include: 
 
The carrying out of a Foundation Works Risk Assessment (FWRA) by the 
contractor once the proposed foundation solutions are known, which will 
then form part of the CEMP. This will be in accordance with ‘Piling and 
Penetrative Ground Improvements Methods on Land Affected by 
Contamination: Guidance on Pollution Prevention, NGCLC report 
NC/99/73’ and is required to ensure that the proposed foundations do not 
adversely affect the water environment beneath the site.  
 
Construction activities will be carried out in full compliance with appropriate 
health and safety legislation, at current amendments, and with reference to 
appropriate guidance documents and approved Codes of Practice 
published by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), including where 
appropriate, HSE Guidance Note HS (G) 66 “The Protection of Workers and 
the General Public during the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land” 
HMSO 1991. 
 
Where there is the potential for instability to occur, temporary works 
measures including trench sheeting in any excavations will be utilised. 
 
Apply the following procedures if unidentified contaminant “hotspots” 
showing visual or olfactory evidence of contamination are discovered 
during construction works: 
 Stop work immediately; 
 Report the discovery to the Site Manager; 
 Seal off the area to contain the spread of contaminants; 
 Clear the area to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
74 
 Contact the regulator or local authority once it is confirmed that 
contamination is found; 
 Arrange for testing to be carried out and agree changes to the existing 
contamination strategy;  
 Record details of the incident, including photos and relevant information 
on the Environmental Incident Report Form; and 
 Any soils which are considered to be contaminated hotspots) will be 
removed and disposed of by a suitably licensed contractor or treated 
on-site. 
 
Any material which is excavated and free from visual and olfactory evidence 
of contamination will be stockpiled and tested to assess its suitability for 
reuse on the Project Site.  
 
If significant groundwater flows are encountered within excavations, then 
temporary dewatering pumps will be implemented.  
 
In the relation to the potential to induce mixing of confined groundwater 
bodies by construction of piled foundations, the design and construction will 
be undertaken in accordance with EA guidance ‘Piling and Penetrative 
Ground Improvement Methods on Land Affected by Contamination’ (EA, 
2001), and therefore will follow best practice to ensure that groundwater 
mixing does not occur. 
 
All water from dewatering activities shall either be transported off site by a 
suitably licensed contractor or treated on site. Any proposed discharges to 
existing land drains (or other surface water bodies) will be undertaken in 
accordance with the requirements of the EA Regulatory Position Statement 
on temporary water discharges from excavations. 
 
Where soils are imported onto the Project Site then they shall be subject to 
testing to ensure they are not contaminated.  
 
The imposition of speed restrictions onsite to minimise disturbance of bare 
surfaces. Measures shall also be put into place to ensure that the length of 
time bare surfaces are left exposed are minimised. 
 
The imposition of the following measures to ensure that silt laden runoff, 
arisings or chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses: 
 testing of arisings to see whether they are suitable for reuse on site;  
 siting stockpiles well away from watercourses;  
 covering stockpiles in inclement weather;  
 use of impermeable liners; and  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
75 
 use of fixing agents. 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage in 
order to prevent the contamination of ground water. 
 
To minimise the risk of coming into contact with potentially contaminated 
materials, contractors should comply with the measures set out in the 
following documents: 
− Protection of Workers and the general public during the development of 
contaminated land (HSE 1991); and 
− If applicable, a guide to safe working on contaminated sites R132 
(CIRIA 1996). 
 
Construction workers will wear appropriate personal protective equipment 
(PPE) for the nature of works being undertaken. This will involve standard 
site PPE, plus overall, gloves and eye protection where required. 
3.6.20 Additional mitigation measures that should be implemented are: 
 
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ area of 
the Project Site; 
 
Project Site welfare facilities will be made available; 
 
All workers will be required to wash their hands and remove overalls/boots 
when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the Project Site; 
 
Any soils excavated which are considered to be potentially contaminated 
(e.g. visual or olfactory evidence) will be reported to site management and 
left alone until their appropriate treatment. Suitable training will be 
provided to site personnel to ensure the correct identification of potentially 
contaminated soils by olfactory means; and  
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage 
and construction materials in order to prevent the contamination of ground 
water. Site personnel will be made aware of the potential impact on ground 
and surface water associated with certain aspects of the construction works 
to further reduce the incidence of accidental impacts. 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
Construction 
3.6.21 
As the construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), 
significant mitigation to limit landscape and visual impacts is not anticipated. 
However, the following would be applied through a CEMP: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
76 
 
Land / vegetation clearance and occupation would be limited to the 
minimum area necessary for the works; 
 
Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to be 
retained would be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice; 
 
Temporary storage of soils and other material considered of value for 
retention would be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice. 
Where practical stockpiles would be sited to screen the construction works 
from sensitive receptors such as PROW;  
 
Construction areas would be laid out to minimise adverse impacts arising 
from temporary structures, construction activities and lighting; 
 
Construction roads would be on the same alignment as permanent access 
roads where possible; 
 
Use of construction site lighting outside normal working hours would be 
restricted to the minimum necessary for workforce and public safety, and 
for security. Directional luminaries would be used to limit unwanted light 
spill; 
 
Maintenance of tidy and contained site compounds; 
 
Hoardings erected around the area of construction works, for reasons of 
creating a visual barrier to construction activities and also as a safety 
measure, to prevent access to the general public; 
 
Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary structures and 
stockpiles when no longer required, and prompt reinstatement of 
construction areas; 
 
Reinstatement of all agricultural land required temporarily during 
construction, and a five-year aftercare plan to seek to ensure land is 
returned to its former productivity; and 
 
Replacement of all trees, shrubs and hedgerows removed to 
accommodate the utility Connections, subject to NGET and NGG planting 
constraints. Any planting would be maintained for a minimum of 12 months 
to ensure full and successful establishment.  
Operation 
3.6.22 
The Power Generation Plant is to be located in a former clay extraction pit and 
therefore it would be below ground level. Therefore, the design and siting of 
the Power Generation Plant is such that visual impacts are inherently limited.  
3.6.23 
Additionally, the Pipeline and electrical cable elements of the Electrical 
Connection are underground for the majority of their length and therefore visual 
impacts have been limited as much as possible.   
3.6.24 
Furthermore, the Applicant is working with appropriate advisors to ensure good 
design which would seek to blend the Power Generation Plant into the 
landscape as much as possible and would be fit for purpose for the lifetime of 
the Project.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
77 
Traffic and Transport 
Construction 
3.6.25 
Separate to the CEMP, the mitigation measures designed to limit potential 
impacts from construction phase traffic movements are described in an outline 
Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP (Appendix 12.1)) which would 
include:  
 
a Route Management Plan to direct HGVs away from the sensitive local 
transport network; 
 
a traffic management scheme at the junction with Green Lane and the 
Access Road to control queuing and to ensure no blocking of the railway 
develops; 
 
a traffic management scheme for the Gas Connection access at Houghton 
Lane; 
 
a traffic management scheme for the Electrical Connection Access at 
Station Lane; 
 
the Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy to control the vehicle 
generation and minimise impact on the surrounding area;  
 
a footpath management plan to ensure any footpath route affected by the 
works are protected, and that the pedestrians may use them safely; and 
 
an Abnormal Load Delivery strategy to manage the delivery to site of the 
major items of plant and apparatus that are indivisible.  
Operation 
3.6.26 
Whilst any significant mode shift away from the private car is unlikely for the 
Project - there are likely to be only a maximum of five workers on site at the 
same time - a Travel Plan has been created specifically targeting employees 
to decrease the number of vehicles accessing the Project. This is contained in 
Appendix 12.1. A range of non-car Initiatives would be implemented to 
encourage the use of alternative modes of travel to the private car. 
Lighting 
3.6.27 
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction and 
operation to provide a safe working site during hours of darkness. An Outline 
Lighting Strategy (Appendix 11.2 ) has been prepared to support the DCO 
Application. 
3.6.28 
The contractor should follow relevant guidance and legislation relevant to 
lighting, including:

Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand; 
 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
 
Demolition and construction lighting should be directed away from all 
sensitive receptors; 
 
Preference should be given to several, lower lighting units rather than tall, 
wide beam lighting units to illuminate large areas as it will limit light 
trespass, glare and sky glow from the Project Site; 
 
Vehicle lights should be properly directed (conforming to MOT 
requirements) and lenses must be intact to prevent un-necessary glare 
and light intrusion; 
 
Lighting should be reduced or switched off when not required for safety 
purposes. Security lighting should be kept at the minimum level needed 
for visual and security protection; and 
 
Motion sensitive lighting will be used in order to avoid unnecessary 
lighting. 
3.6.30 Light fittings will comply with the specifications and the requirements of CIE 
150 (2003) and Institute of Lighting Engineer’s Guidance Notes for the 
Reduction of Obtrusive Light.

Environmental Impact Assessment 
Methodology 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This chapter sets out the methodology which has been followed in undertaking 
the EIA. It describes the EIA process, the stages of consultation and 
engagement which have been followed to date, and how the scope of the 
assessment has been defined. The steps in undertaking the EIA have then 
been described in detail, including how the baseline has been defined, the 
realistic worst case Project parameters which are being assessed, the 
assessment methodology, the assumptions and limitations lying behind the 
assessment, how the assessment of cumulative and in combination effects has 
been undertaken, the approach taken to defining mitigation measures 
necessary to limit effects, and how residual effects remaining after mitigation 
have been assessed.  
4.2 
EIA Process 
4.2.1 
In accordance with the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA process for 
the Project has consisted of the following principal activities: 
 
establishing, through consultation, the scope of the EIA including obtaining 
a Scoping Opinion from the SoS; 
 
consideration of potential technical and environmental alternatives to the 
Project; 
 
determining how potential significant adverse environmental effects could 
be avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design (embedded 
mitigation); 
 
determining a realistic worst case scenario for assessment; 
 
establishing 
a 
detailed 
understanding 
of 
the 
existing 
baseline 
environmental conditions for the Project Site and the relevant study areas 
for each topic; 
 
identifying the likely potential environmental effects arising from the 
Project; 
 
assessing the significance of the likely environmental effects of the Project 
against the baseline (which includes existing developments that are 
constructed and/or operational); 
 
assessing the significance of the likely environmental effects of the Project 
arising in conjunction with proposed or consented but not yet constructed 
developments (cumulative effects) as well as certain effects arising from 
the Project acting in combination with others (in-combination effects); 
 
determining how any significant adverse environmental effects could be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through further mitigation (additional mitigation) 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
80 
as well as how any benefits of the Project may be enhanced (enhancement 
measures); and 
 
determining the residual likely significant environmental effects of the 
Project following the application of the additional mitigation measures. 
4.2.2 
These steps are discussed in more detail in the following sections. 
4.3 
Consultation and Engagement 
Non-statutory Consultation 
4.3.1 
The Applicant engaged with the local community and key stakeholders during 
an early phase of non-statutory consultation during June 2014 which was at a 
point where the Project was still being actively refined. Local community 
representatives at the national, regional and local levels were consulted by 
MPL and public exhibitions were held in Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston 
Moretaine. As part of this non-statutory phase of consultation, the Applicant 
explained the rationale and key objectives of the Project, gave reasons why 
the Power Generation Plant Site had been chosen and presented opportunities 
for written and verbal feedback on the early, emerging concepts for the Project. 
4.3.2 
Drawing on this early feedback on the proposals, MPL was able to consider 
the consultation responses as part of the design development and 
environmental assessment processes and this phase of non-statutory 
consultation helped to shape the development of the Project.  
Statutory Consultation - Phase 1 
4.3.3 
MPL conducted a first phase of statutory consultation under s42, s47 and s48 
of PA 2008 between 13 October 2014 and 16 November 2014 (the "Phase 1 
statutory consultation").  Published in September 2014, the initial Statement of 
Community Consultation (SoCC) Notice confirmed where and when the SoCC 
could be inspected by members of the public.  Letters were sent to s42 
consultees directly, briefly explaining the Project concept as well as the dates 
and times of exhibitions. Consultation notices were published in national and 
local newspapers under s48 of the PA 2008.   
4.3.4 
The statutory consultation phase also coincided with the publication of the 
2014 PEIR. The 2014 PEIR provided the environmental information collected 
in the early stages of the EIA process as well as an assessment, on a 
preliminary basis, of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  
The 2014 PEIR, together with supporting information and a Non-Technical 
Summary (2014 PEIR NTS), was compiled to accompany MPL’s statutory 
consultation with both the local community and prescribed consultees in 
advance of submitting its DCO Application. The feedback received relating to 
the 2014 PEIR has further helped to inform and refine the EIA process as well 
as the design and development of the Project. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
81 
Statutory Consultation - Phase 2 
4.3.5 
As the DCO Application for the Project was put on hold in 2015, MPL 
considered it appropriate to undertake a further phase of statutory consultation, 
in order to reflect potential changes in the baseline of the area, policy position 
and to update consultees on key changes to the Project parameters.  
4.3.6 
The Phase 2 statutory consultation period ran from 29th May – 2nd July 2017 
and coincided with the publication of a revised PEIR. The PEIR reflected (and 
provided information regarding) updates on Project parameters and design 
evolution, as well as refined EIA processes.  
4.3.7 
The feedback received relating to the PEIR has further helped to inform and 
refine the EIA process as well as the design and development of the Project. 
4.3.8 
A detailed description of all consultation undertaken throughout the pre-
application stage of the Project is provided in the Consultation Report which 
accompanies the DCO Application (Document Reference 5.1).   
4.4 
Scope of the Assessment 
4.4.1 
Scoping involves focusing the content of the EIA on those issues of greatest 
potential significance. It is an important tool for identifying the likely significant 
environmental effects of a project through its design, construction, operation 
and decommissioning phases and ensures that appropriate mitigation options 
are considered, where necessary.  
4.4.2 
As part of the initial phases of work on the EIA, the Applicant sought a Scoping 
Opinion from PINS in June 2014, coinciding with the non-statutory consultation 
phase as described in paragraph 4.3.1 above.  The request was accompanied 
by a Scoping Report that described the anticipated likely significant 
environmental effects that would require detailed evaluation as part of the EIA.  
The formal Scoping Opinion was received from PINS in July 2014 and has 
allowed for agreement on the aspects of the environment on which the EIA 
should focus.  
4.4.3 
The Scoping Report and Scoping Opinion can be found on the PINS website 
and MPL’s website (www.millbrook.co.uk), and are provided in Appendix 1.2. 
4.4.4 
Regulation 37(2)(a) of the 2017 Regulations states that where a scoping 
opinion has already been requested, or an application or an ES submitted, 
before the commencement of the new EIA Regulations, the previous EIA 
Regulations and regime will continue to apply. 
4.4.5 
Therefore, as a Scoping Report was submitted for the Project in June 2014, 
the ES has been undertaken in line with the previous (2011) EIA Directive.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

4.5 
Environmental Baseline 
4.5.1 
In undertaking an EIA for any project, it is important to identify the 
environmental baseline for the potential receptors which may be affected. 
Essentially, this involves forming an understanding of the environmental 
receptors (e.g. their sensitivity) in an area and the developments that are 
already affecting those receptors, at the time of the assessment.  This allows 
any future baseline conditions to be determined and the effects of the Project 
to be compared and / or combined with the baseline in order to ensure an 
informed assessment is made of the potential effects of a project as well as to 
allow the identification of the most appropriate mitigation which could be 
employed to minimise any identified likely significant adverse effects. 
4.5.2 
To establish the baseline, a study area that is appropriate for each assessment 
topic is identified which takes into consideration the surrounding context and 
the likely scale and range of potential significant effects (the study area for 
noise, for example, would cover a smaller area than that used to assess 
landscape and visual effects which may be experienced over a wider area, or 
conversely, the study areas may be the same for certain assessment topics). 
Confirmation of the study area for each assessment topic is set out in the 
respective topic chapter.  
4.5.3 
Next, a range of environmental data is gathered from a combination of sources 
in respect of each study area. This has included: 
 
documentary information on the Power Generation Plant Site, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection, and their surroundings within each 
relevant study area, including information available from previous EIA work 
for other projects; 
 
field survey information, including: Phase 2 ecological surveys; landscape 
character assessments; background noise levels; ground conditions / 
contaminated land assessments; location of sensitive receptors and 
existing traffic levels on the road network; and 
 
data held by both statutory and non-statutory consultees. 
4.5.4 
It is anticipated that construction of the Project would commence in 2020, if a 
DCO is granted by the SoS for the Project.  The assessment therefore uses a 
'2020 baseline' to provide a future baseline against which the direct, indirect 
and cumulative effects during all phases of the Project can be assessed.  This 
baseline includes the developments that the Applicant knows would be 
completed prior to the commencement of construction of the Project. At this 
time, the only development which the Applicant is certain would be progressed 
and would have an interaction with the Project is the LLRS.  It does not 
therefore include the Covanta RRF project in the 2020 baseline; this would be 
addressed in the assessment of cumulative effects (see section 4.10). 
Nevertheless, even if construction of the Covanta RRF Project commenced 
during Examination of the DCO Application for the Project, the cumulative 
assessments consider a ‘worst case scenario’ of construction and operation 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
83 
timings in each case so that all potential cumulative effects of the Project can 
be adequately assessed.  
4.6 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
4.6.1 
As discussed in paragraphs 3.1.25 - 3.1.28 above, as development parameters 
for the Project have been included in order to provide a degree of design 
flexibility (for example, the height of the stack to be used), each topic specific 
assessment has tested a realistic worst case scenario such that the likely 
significant impacts arising from the Project have been adequately assessed.  
This realistic worst case scenario is set out in each topic chapter. 
4.7 
Assessment Methodology 
4.7.1 
Significance criteria have been used to help understand, evaluate and quantify 
the likely significant environmental effects of the Project which may be positive 
(i.e. beneficial) or negative (i.e. adverse). 
4.7.2 
The significance of environmental effects arising from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project are generally presented in this 
ES using a series of matrices similar to those shown below in Tables 4.1 – 4.3.  
These have been developed to categorise the sensitivity of receptors 
(previously defined in the baseline assessment) which have the potential to be 
affected by the Project and the magnitude of any impacts which are likely to 
arise.  The magnitude of any potential impact and sensitivity of receptor have 
been considered together, using professional judgement, to give an overall 
significance of effect. Where it is not possible to quantify effects, a 
precautionary qualitative assessment has been carried out, based on available 
knowledge and professional judgement. 
4.7.3 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of effects 
upon different environmental components, the assessments generally follow 
the structure and use the terminology set out below in Tables 4.1 – 4.3. 
However, it is noted that for some environmental topics, significance criteria 
may need to differ depending on the topic assessment and conditions 
encountered at the Project Site. Each topic chapter of the ES clearly identifies 
and explains the specific criteria used.

4.8 
Assumptions and Limitations 
4.8.1 
When undertaking the EIA for the Project, the following assumptions have 
been made and have been followed through to every topic chapter:  
Construction / Decommissioning 
 
the total construction programme would be approximately 22 months, with 
a start date of approximately 2020 and an end date of 2022;  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
86 
 
the Generating Equipment would be decommissioned and removed at the 
end of its operational life (a working assumption of 25 years has been used 
for the purposes of this ES); 
 
the Pipeline and underground cables of the Electrical Connection would be 
made safe and left in situ at the end of their operational life;  
 
the decommissioning phase would be similar in duration to the construction 
phase; and 
 
the design, construction and decommissioning phases of the Project would 
satisfy minimum environmental standards, consistent with contemporary 
legislation, practice and knowledge.   
Operation 
 
in order to allow for a decommissioning assessment to be undertaken, the 
operational life of the Power Generation Plant has been assumed to be 25 
years; 
 
the Generating Equipment could run up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in 
any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does not exceed 
1,500 hours. For the purposes of the EIA, a worst case yearly maximum of 
2,250 running hours has been assessed where appropriate; 
 
the Generating Equipment would have a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW (measured as output of the generating station as a whole at the 
terminals of the Generating Equipment);  
 
assessments are based on published sources of information and primary 
data collection; 
 
assessments are based on the description of the Project as set out in 
Chapter 3; 
 
any future development of the Project Site would be determined through 
separate planning or DCO applications and have not been assessed as part 
of the assessment presented in this ES; and 
 
The Project would not constitute a (Control of Major Accident Hazards) 
COMAH site.  
4.9 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
4.9.1 
Full consideration has been given to the mitigation measures which could be 
used to ensure that any potentially adverse significant environmental effects 
of the Project are minimised. 
4.9.2 
In the hierarchy of mitigation, likely significant adverse effects should, in the 
first instance, be avoided altogether; where this is not possible such effects 
should then be reduced and, finally, off-set. 
4.9.3 
Significant adverse effects are best avoided by incorporating appropriate 
measures into the design process. As such, the iterative nature of the EIA 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
87 
process has helped to inform the development of the final design of the Project 
that will be the subject of the DCO Application. 
4.9.4 
Two broad types of potential mitigation measures have been applied in the EIA 
and are reported in this ES being: 
 
embedded mitigation - namely design/standard control measures, such as 
working within best practice guidance, which would routinely be 
incorporated for the Project or for any similar project constructed in the UK, 
and as such would be taken into account in the initial assessment as to the 
likely significant effects of the Project (Further details have been provided 
in section 3.6 above, in the Key Mitigation Measures Roadmap (Appendix 
3.1) and the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.2)); and  
 
additional mitigation - which may be introduced, where appropriate, 
following the assessment of the likely significant effects of the Project alone 
and cumulatively with other projects with embedded mitigation. It is this 
additional mitigation that has been assessed for effectiveness and that has 
been taken into account in the assessment of the residual likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project (i.e. the likely significant environmental 
effects that remain following the application of additional mitigation).  
4.9.5 
The Project has been, and at the detailed design stage will continue to be, 
developed in such a way that the reduction and, wherever possible, elimination 
of significant adverse environmental effects is integral to the overall design 
philosophy. 
4.10 
Cumulative Effects 
4.10.1 
Schedule 4, Part 1 (paragraph 20) of the EIA Regulations requires an ES to 
include ‘…a description of the likely significant effects of the development on 
the environment, which should cover….cumulative effects’.   
4.10.2 
PINS Advice Note 17 (AN17) (Version 1, December 2015) provides advice on 
a ‘staged process that applicants may wish to adopt in cumulative effects 
assessment for NSIPs. The four assessment stages comprise: 
 
1. Establish the NSIPs zone of influence and identify a ‘long list’ of other 
developments which could potentially have effect interactions with the 
NSIP; 
 
2. Develop a ‘short list’ of other developments which could potentially have 
effect interactions with the NSIP. Essentially analysing the ‘long list’ 
developed in stage 1 in more detail in order to include only those 
developments that have potential to give rise to significant cumulative 
effects by virtue of overlaps in temporal scope; due to the scale and nature 
of the ‘other development’/receiving environment; or any other relevant 
factors; 
 
3. Gather available information on the shortlisted developments; and  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
88 
 
4. Assessment of likely significant impacts arising as a result of the NSIP 
cumulatively with the short listed developments identified during stage 2 
and available information gathered in stage 3.’  
4.10.3 
PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) (Version 1, April 2012) provides a definition of 
cumulative effects which are described as considering ‘…other proposed 
development within the context of the site and any other reasonably 
foreseeable proposals in the vicinity’ (AN9, footnote 12). 
4.10.4 
AN9 also sets out that ‘the potential cumulative impacts with other major 
developments would also need to be carefully identified such that the likely 
significant impacts can be shown to have been identified and assessed against 
the baseline position (which would include built and operational development).  
In assessing cumulative impacts, other major developments should be 
identified through consultation with the local planning authorities and other 
relevant authorities on the basis of those that are: 
 
under construction; 
 
permitted application(s), but not yet implemented;  
 
submitted application(s) not yet determined;  
 
projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s Programme of Projects; 
 
identified in the relevant Development Plan (and emerging Development 
Plans - with appropriate weight being given as they move closer to 
adoption) recognising that much information on any relevant proposals 
would be limited; and 
 
identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set the 
framework for future development consents/approvals, where such 
development is reasonably likely to come forward.’  
4.10.5 
Table 3 of AN17 describes potential schemes for cumulative assessment in 
three tiers and recognises that for each tier, there is a decreasing level of detail 
likely to be available.  The three tiers are: 
 
Tier 1 – Projects under construction: 
− permitted application(s), whether under the PA 2008 or other regimes, 
but not yet implemented; and  
− submitted application(s) whether under the PA 2008 or other regimes 
but not yet determined; 
 
Tier 2: 
− projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s Programme of Projects where a 
scoping report has been submitted. 
 
Tier 3: 
− projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s Programme of Projects where a 
scoping report has not been submitted; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
89 
− identified 
in 
the 
relevant 
Development 
Plan 
(and 
emerging 
Development Plans - with appropriate weight being given as they move 
closer to adoption) recognising that much information on any relevant 
proposals would be limited; and  
− identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set the 
framework for future development consents/approvals, where such 
development is reasonably likely to come forward. 
4.10.6

4.10.8 
As part of the initial scoping of the EIA it was determined by the applicant that 
certain topics such as air quality, noise, traffic and landscape and visual effects 
are more likely to give rise to potential significant cumulative effects than 
others, based on the nature of the Project and surrounding development 
proposals. For example, air quality may give rise to a potential cumulative 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
91 
effect given that there are emissions from the Generating Equipment and also 
potential emissions from, for example, the proposed Covanta RRF Project. 
Therefore, those topic assessments have included a detailed, quantitative 
where practicable, assessment on potential cumulative effects and 
interactions.  All topic chapters have considered cumulative and in-
combination effects to an appropriate degree of assessment. 
4.10.9 
It is noted here that there are no COMAH sites within the vicinity of the Project 
Site.  
4.10.10 It is also noted here that the ES for the Covanta RRF Project assumed that 
Phase 1 of the LLRS will have been implemented prior to its construction. This 
differs slightly from the LLRS works which are deemed to have taken place 
prior to construction of the Project. The assumed LLRS works to be undertaken 
ahead of the Covanta RRF comprise: 
 
dewatering of accumulated surface waters within the western half of 
Rookery South Pit by pumping from the base of Rookery South Pit into the

4.10.11 The East West Rail Link project is being promoted by the East-West Rail 
Consortium, a consortium of local authorities and interested bodies along the 
route.  Phase 1 of the western section of the East West Rail Link project from 
Oxford to Bicester was approved by the Government in November 2011 
(committing £270 million to the scheme), has been constructed and is now 
operational.  
4.10.12 Phase 2 of the western section of the project will connect Bicester to Bedford 
via Bletchley and the Marston Vale branch line which runs along the west side 
of Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit. Statutory consultation was 
conducted between 30th June and 11th August on Phase 2 of the East West 
Rail Link and a member of the management team for the Project attended an 
event in Marston Moretaine. A meeting was also held with the East West Rail 
Stakeholder Manager on 10th May 2017. The Marston Vale branch line 
between the Millbrook level crossing and the Green Lane level crossing 
(including the level crossings themselves) are not subject to any upgrade 
works or alterations as part of the Phase 2 proposals.      
4.10.13 For these reasons, the East-West Rail Link project has not been considered 
further as part of the cumulative impacts assessments within the separate topic 
chapters of this ES.  
4.11 
Residual Effects 
4.11.1 
At the end of each topic chapter the residual likely significant effects of the 
Project are described. These are defined as effects which cannot be fully 
remedied through the application of both embedded and additional mitigation 
and therefore remain in place after mitigation has been applied.

Alternatives Considered 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
The EIA Regulations require that an ES should include an outline of the main 
alternatives that have been studied by an applicant and an indication of the 
main reasons for the applicant's choice, taking into account the environmental 
effects. Under the EIA Regulations there is no requirement to assess 
alternatives, only a requirement to provide information on those alternatives 
that have been considered.  
5.1.2 
The design iterations and alternatives considered at this stage in the Project 
are described below.  
5.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
5.2.1 
In deciding upon the location for the Project, Stag Energy has had regard to a 
number of factors such as those described in NPS EN-2. However, in line with 
paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy companies to decide which 
applications to bring forward and the government does not seek to direct 
applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating stations."  
5.2.2 
The key factors considered necessary in selecting a suitable site for a project 
such as this one were broadly fourfold; technical, environmental, economic, 
and in line with local planning policy. 
5.2.3 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, Stag Energy looked at a range of 
sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this nature. This 
search for potential power generation plant sites across the UK was focused 
on areas that were capable of meeting the Applicant’s strategic project 
development criteria, namely:  
 
Acceptable proximity to the national gas transmission system & the national 
electricity transmission system or local distribution networks;  
 
Located within areas that are net importers of electricity; and 
 
Compatible land use designation/s. 
5.2.4 
In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough to 
support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and associated 
infrastructure) and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and electrical 
connection points were both key considerations. 
5.2.5 
From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to close 
sensitive receptors such as residential properties or sites of ecological 
importance (to avoid unacceptable impacts from noise and visual disturbance), 
the current nature of the surrounding area (to limit impacts on the landscape 
character of the area), previous site uses and land quality (to avoid sterilisation 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
94 
of the best and most versatile agricultural land or mineral assets) and proximity 
to sensitive ecological habitats. 
5.2.6 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons: 
 
close proximity to the gas National Transmission System; 
 
close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead line); 
 
the Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, lying 
below ground level; 
 
it is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
 
it has a well-developed road network for access to the Generating 
Equipment Site; 
 
the Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; 
 
there is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
associated infrastructure; and 
 
the Project Site is located in an area of net electricity import. 
5.2.7 
Stag Energy’s site selection process began in 2010 and considered a range of 
factors, in accordance with Section 4.4 (Alternatives) of NPS EN-1 and Section 
2.2 (Factors influencing site selection by developers) of NPS EN-2. This 
process included the following main phases, in order to identify a number of 
potential sites and refine this set of sites through increasingly detailed selection 
criteria: 
 
Identification of a large number of potential sites across the UK through 
existing data sources; 
 
Refinement of this set of sites, driven mainly by the need for electrical 
generation capacity to be located as closely as possible to the main sources 
of demand in the UK; 
 
Further refinement based on the layout of the electricity and gas 
transmission networks in the UK, to ensure proximity to these networks; 
and 
 
Assessment of the remaining sites based on technical, environmental and 
economic factors, as well as consideration of whether or not a proposed 
Project would be in accordance with local planning policy and with the 
availability of the sites. 
5.2.8 
As a result of the site selection process outlined above, Drax is bringing 
forward three other power generation projects through the PA 2008 process. 
They 
are:

Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
95 
2015. It is anticipated that Abergelli Power Ltd will submit an application for its 
NSIP to the Planning Inspectorate in 2018. 
5.3 
Generating Equipment  
5.3.1 
The following technology options have been considered for the Power 
Generation Plant: OCGT plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; 
Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant and CHP Plant. 
5.3.2 
The operation of OCGT plant has been described previously in section 3.2. 
CCGT plant consist of the same plant items as OCGT, although they also 
utilise a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) which uses the waste heat 
from the exhaust gases to produce steam which is used to power a steam 
turbine. RGE plant are similar in operation to a large internal combustion 
engine, with a crankshaft driven by pistons. As described in paragraphs 5.3.5 
to 5.3.9, CHP utilises waste heat from the combustion process to feed to other 
industrial users (deemed off-takers) within the vicinity of the plant. Further 
information is provided in a separate report prepared regarding the use of CHP 
at the Project (Appendix 5.1). 
5.3.3 
OCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant and operating at up to 2,250 hours at the 
Project Site based on the following environmental, technical and feasibility 
considerations: 
 
visual impact: OCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to CCGT 
plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the surrounding 
environment; 
 
water resources: Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, 
the cooling requirements of OCGT plants are significantly lower than, for 
example, CCGT plants. The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication 
oil, etc.) would be met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan coolers 
or Air Cooled Condensers (ACC). The water requirement of an OCGT plant 
is therefore significantly lower than for CCGT plants; 
 
noise and available space: noise levels from an OCGT plant would typically 
be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE units would be 
required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate up to 299 MW. 
Spatially this may not be possible; 
 
financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that the 
Power Generation Plant of the size proposed would be particularly cost 
effective, as it would be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
 
start-up times: OCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to 
meeting variable demands. 
5.3.4 
Uncertain market conditions in 2014 led to the consideration of a number of 
different OCGT technologies and as such, the 2014 PEIR and associated 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
96 
formal consultation process was based on the construction and operation 
of between 1 and 5 Gas Turbine Generators. However, greater clarity on the 
capacity market rules, further engagement with equipment manufacturers, and 
consultation with the local community and relevant stakeholders has led to the 
decision that a single Gas Turbine Generator is the best technology solution 
for the Project. This change has been reflected in the updated EIA and is 
reported on in this ES.   
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
5.3.5 
CHP is the process by which heat generated as a by-product of the generation 
of electricity is captured and re-used, rather than being emitted to the 
atmosphere via stack(s).  
5.3.6 
Efficient CHP plants are usually designed to meet the known heat demands of 
a suitable process. This could be on-site (e.g. for the heating of ancillary 
buildings) or exported off site to a suitable heat user (e.g. industrial process 
plant or district heating system). The heat demands of industrial processes are 
usually continuous, and district heating demands are also usually continuous 
(albeit on a seasonal basis). 
5.3.7 
This is in direct contrast to the operation of a OCGT peaking plant, which is 
designed to operate intermittently and unpredictably which is not suitable for 
CHP where the requirements are for a constant supply of heat. Therefore, any 
heat loads would be better served, and met more appropriately and efficiently 
by dedicated CHP plants, allowing the OCGT peaking plant to provide their 
main function which is as necessary support to the NETS.  
5.3.8 
In addition, as OCGT plant do not have any associated HRSG / steam turbine 
plant, the provision of steam from an OCGT plant would not be possible without 
the provision of additional steam raising plant / equipment, which would require 
more equipment to be constructed and a larger overall land take. 
5.3.9 
With this in mind, CHP has not been a significant factor in the technology 
choice of the plant. Further information will be provided in a separate report 
prepared regarding the use of CHP at the Project (Appendix 5.1) 
5.4 
Gas Connection 
5.4.1 
The Project Scoping Report (Appendix 1.2) described a Gas Connection 
‘Opportunity Area’, to the south and east of the Generating Equipment Site, 
somewhere in which a new underground gas pipeline and AGI would be 
developed. Following publication of the Scoping Report, further studies refined 
this Opportunity Area such that there were two remaining Gas Connection 
Route Corridor Options presented in the 2014 PEIR and formally consulted 
upon in June 2014 as part of the Phase 1 statutory consultation. A preferred 
gas connection route and AGI location were also presented within the more 
southerly Route Corridor Option at that consultation stage.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
97 
5.4.2 
As a result of further refinement, studies and feedback received from the 
Phase 1 statutory consultation process, a spatially refined Gas Connection 
Route Corridor has been brought forward as the selected Gas Connection 
Option to be used in the design of the Project and assessed in this ES. The 
Gas Connection Route Corridor was chosen as the most suitable route 
because it is the most direct and shortest connection between the National 
Transmission System and the Generating Equipment Site, avoiding 
obstructions such as roads, other high pressure gas pipelines, railways, large 
changes in elevation, water bodies and protected sites as much as possible. It 
is therefore less expensive and damaging to agricultural land. An alternative 
AGI location to that suggested in the 2014 PEIR has been selected following 
consultation with the land owner, who was concerned about sterilisation of 
prime agricultural land.      
5.5 
Electrical Connection 
5.5.1 
The EIA Scoping Report described an Electrical Connection Opportunity Area 
to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, somewhere in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Following publication of the 
Scoping Report, further studies were undertaken to refine the available 
options.  
5.5.2 
Studies undertaken up to Phase 1 statutory consultation and feedback 
received during the Phase 1 statutory consultation determined that the most 
suitable location for the Substation was within Rookery South Pit, adjacent to 
the Generating Equipment Site. The main reasons for siting the substation in 
this location are as follows: 
 
lower visual impact – the Substation would be located entirely within 
Rookery South Pit, which will be approximately 15 mblg once the LLRS 
works are complete. The maximum height of the tallest structures within the 
substation would be 17.5 m, meaning they would be substantially screened 
by the pit.  If the substation were to be developed outside of the Rookery 
South Pit, it would need to be sited to the south on higher lying agricultural 
land. In this location, the substation would be far more visually intrusive, 
particularly if viewed from the south and east;  
 
reduced effect on agricultural land – as stated above, should the substation 
be located outside of the Rookery South Pit, it would be developed on 
agricultural land. This would not only take more greenfield land over and 
above the three net additional towers, but could also impact on drainage 
runoff rates as agricultural land would be replaced by hardstanding; and 
 
reduced effect on previously undisturbed ground – previously undeveloped 
land outside of the Generating Equipment Site is known to have the 
potential to support buried archaeology. Therefore, avoiding this area and 
instead using land in Rookery South Pit which has previously been 
disturbed, removes a potential impact on the archaeology and cultural 
heritage of the area.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
98 
5.5.3 
The 2014 PEIR confirmed that the proposed substation would then connect to 
the existing 400 kV double circuit Grendon - Sundon 400 kV line, operated by 
NGET. The line is situated approximately 320 m southwest of the Generating 
Equipment Site as shown on Figure 3.1. 
5.5.4 
Although the Substation is located adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site 
in the Rookery South Pit, the assessment relating to the Substation is 
presented under the ‘Electrical Connection’ section within each topic 
assessment. 
5.5.1 
With respect to the connection between the Substation to the NETS, a number 
of options have been considered and ruled out, for technical or financial 
reasons.  
5.5.2 
The 2014 PEIR also confirmed that for environmental assessment purposes, 
a worst case scenario of up to two 400 kV double circuit overhead line circuits 
with up to seven new transmission towers was considered. It was also 
explained that one of the proposed towers would replace an existing tower. 
Consultees were invited to comment on the proposed worst case connection 
scenario. 
5.5.3 
MPL explained in the 2014 PEIR (Chapter 5) that further liaison with NGET 
would take place regarding the indicative design of the [then] proposed 
connection prior to making a final decision which would be taken forward to the 
DCO Application. 
5.5.4 
Following the conclusion of the Phase 1 statutory consultation in 2014 
subsequent engagement and technical assessment concluded that there were 
four potentially viable electrical connection options, including two overhead line 
and two underground cable options. These four options are summarised 
below. 
5.5.5 
Option 1: One overhead double circuit transmission line (requiring up to four 
new towers including the replacement of an existing tower (therefore three net 
additional towers) located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route 
corridor. This option would require a new substation and two SECs, one 
located on each side of the existing transmission line, together with an 
approximately 100 metre section of underground cable to be constructed at 
the point of connection to the existing NETS.  
5.5.6 
Option 2: Similar to Option 1, Option 2 would involve one overhead double 
circuit transmission line (requiring up to four new towers where one will again 
replace an existing tower) located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor. This option would also require a new substation 
but does not require any SECs or underground cable.  
5.5.7 
Option 3: The third option would involve one underground double circuit. This 
would require one new tower (which will again replace an existing tower and 
be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
99 
thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two 
SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 
m in length to a new substation. 
5.5.8 
Option 4: The fourth option is similar to Option 3 and would involve one 
underground double circuit. This would require one new tower (which will again 
replace an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This 
option would require one SEC, which could be located on either side of the 
existing transmission line, and the circuit would then be connected via 
underground cables approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the 
‘Substation’).  
5.5.9 
The Phase 1 statutory consultation generated a number of responses 
expressing concerns over the potential impacts of new pylons on the 
landscape and visual amenity, and in particular the potential for adverse effects 
on Ampthill Park. During its evaluation of responses, MPL recognised that 
consultees had expressed a strong preference for the development of an 
underground cable connection option.  These views were taken on board by 
MPL and a presumption in favour of developing a wholly or partially 
underground cable option was adopted by the Project team. This was 
considered to represent more limited potential for significant adverse 
landscape and visual impacts than an overhead line option.   
5.5.10 
The resulting two remaining underground Electrical Connection options 
(options 3 and 4 above) were subsequently taken forward for assessment and 
were presented in the PEIR (re-named and presented as options 1 and 2) 
which formed part of the Phase 2 statutory consultation from May – July 2017.   
5.5.11 
Further discussions with NGET have revealed that option 4, as described 
above (presented as option 2 in the PEIR for Phase 2 statutory consultation), 
is unlikely to be feasible for a number of technical and financial reasons.   
5.5.12 
Therefore, a realistic worst case scenario has been assessed within this ES 
assuming that option 3 (presented as option 1 in the PEIR for Phase 2 statutory 
consultation), (one underground double circuit Tee-in and two SECs) would be 
developed, as described in section 3.4.

Air Quality 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
This Chapter presents the findings of the assessment of likely significant air 
quality effects arising from the construction, operation, maintenance and 
decommissioning of the Project.  
6.1.2 
The Project has the potential to affect air quality due to vehicle emissions and 
dust generation during construction and decommissioning, and stack 
emissions during operation of the Generating Equipment. 
6.2 
Legislation and Policy Context 
6.2.1 
The legislation and policy context in relation to air quality is described in detail 
in Appendix 2.6.  In summary, the following items of policy, legislation and 
guidance have been considered in preparing this assessment: 
 
National Policy Statements (NPS) EN-1, 2, 4 and 5;  
 
National Planning Policy Framework 2012;  
 
National Planning Policy Guidance; 
 
The Air Quality Strategy; 
 
EU Limit Values; 
 
Industrial Emissions Directive (IED); 
 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016; 
 
Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010; 
 
The Habitats Directive;   
 
The Ambient Air Quality Directive 
 
The Bedford Borough Council Core and Rural Issues Plan 2021; 


Paper; and 
 
Bedford Borough Council Local Plan 2035 – 2017 Consultation.  
6.2.2 
In particular, the assessment of emissions from the Generating Equipment has 
been undertaken by assuming that the emissions will be equal to the relevant 
limit values in the IED, as referenced and enforced through the Environmental 
Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.

Dust should be considered on-site 
and off-site, e.g. impacts on 
PRoW and including along access 
roads, traffic routes and local 
footpaths. 
The assessment of dust impacts has 
considered both on-site and off-site 
receptors in accordance with the 
methodology described in Section 6.5. 
3.28 
The study area should be 
described and reasons for it 
justified. 
The study area for the air quality 
assessment and the reasons for it and 
justification are described in Section 
6.5. 
3.29 
Any AQMA within the study area 
should be identified and adverse 
changes to air quality should be 
assessed in relation to 
compliance with European air 
quality limit values. 
Any AQMAs in the vicinity of the 
Project Site and/or likely to be 
impacted by the Project are identified 
in Section 6.6.  Compliance with EU 
Limit Values and Environmental 
Assessment Levels is assessed in 
Section 6.7. 
3.3.0 / 3.37 
There is a need for the air quality 
assessment to be consistent with 
the ecology section and to take 
into consideration all relevant 
ecology sites. 
A full list of potentially sensitive 
ecological receptors is presented in 
section 6.6, and this is consistent with 
Chapter 8 (Ecology). 
3.32 
Justification for 1 km study area 
needs to be through consultation 
with councils. 
The 1 km study (for construction / 
decommissioning effects of dust on 
human health) area has been chosen 
on the basis of professional judgement 
of the geographical extent within which 
likely significant effects may occur (see 
Section 6.5), with the results of this 
assessment justifying the selection as 
no likely significant effects have been 
identified. 
A 10 km study area has been chosen 
for assessing likely significant effects 
in the operational phase as this is 
current best practice and has been 
used for other similar projects, as well 
as the proposed neighbouring 
development of the Rookery RRF.

Response Letter 
The adverse effect caused by 
emissions on Cooper’s Hill is of 
concern to us. Sulphur dioxide 
and Nitrogen Dioxide, both 
contributing to acid rain and 
hampering the growth of plants 
will have an adverse impact. 
There is also a health risk from 
dioxins via the food chain and this 
too is of concern to us, being a 
farming area. We would need 
reassurance of how these 
emissions are to be monitored 
and procedures in the event of the 
monitoring system failing. 
The fuel for the Generating Equipment 
is natural gas which contains negligible 
amounts of sulphur. Therefore, there 
will be negligible emissions of sulphur 
dioxide from the Generating 
Equipment.  The effects of oxides of 
nitrogen emissions are considered 
within this Chapter, including the 
increase in nitrogen deposition as a 
result of the emissions from the Power 
Generation Plant in Section 6.7. 
The combustion fuel is natural gas and 
therefore there will be negligible 
emissions of dioxins from the Power 
Generation Plant, and therefore there 
is a negligible health risk from dioxins.   
Monitoring and procedures in the event 
of a failure of the monitoring system 
will be in accordance with the IED, the 
Environmental Permit for the Power 
Generation Plant and the requirements 
of the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 
2016.

6.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
6.4.1 
Modelling of emissions from the Power Generation Plant was undertaken 
based on manufacturer specific emission rates and flue gas parameters for a 
range of gas turbine generators. The gas turbine generator that gave the 
highest maximum ground level concentration of NO2 was considered to be 
representative of a ‘worst case’ emissions profile.  
6.4.2 
Stack height sensitivity testing has revealed that a stack height of 32.5 m would 
be required to achieve adequate dispersion of emissions, with the maximum 
ground level concentrations anywhere within the receptor grid insignificant in 
accordance with EA criteria4. (see section 6.5). This stack height ensures that 
the requirements of the relevant Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 are 
met. Any higher stack than 32.5 m would result in increased dispersion of 
emissions and therefore lower impacts on sensitive receptors. For this reason, 
a 32.5 m stack is considered to be a realistic worst case scenario in relation to 
dispersion of emissions and associated ground level concentrations of 
pollutants that have potential effects on sensitive receptors.  
6.4.3 
The Power Generation Plant could run for up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in 
any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does not exceed 1,500 
hours. For the purposes of this assessment, a worst case yearly maximum of 
2,250 running hours has been assessed for the selection of stack height.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria

6.5.1 
Information on existing air quality has been obtained by collating the results of 
monitoring carried out by CBC and BBC. Background concentrations for the

Project Site have been defined using the national pollution maps published by 
Defra. These cover the whole country on a 1x1 km grid5. 
6.5.2 
Existing nitrogen and acid deposition rates within the study area were 
determined from the Air Pollution Information System ("APIS") website6. 
6.5.3 
CBC has one real time analyser sited in Sandy (approximately 18 km from the 
Project Site) monitoring NO2, PM10 and PM2.5.  In addition, a network of NO2 
diffusion tube monitors are utilised throughout CBC's district.  The nearest 
diffusion tube was in Brogborough, approximately 4.5 km south west of the 
Project Site, but this ceased monitoring in 2015.  There is no local authority 
monitoring in the study area as there are no concerns locally regarding poor 
air quality. 
Study Area – Construction and Decommissioning 
6.5.4 
In relation to construction and decommissioning dust effects, whilst small 
particles (<10 µm) can travel distances in excess of 1 km, the majority of large 
dust particles generated by construction activities (greater than 30 µm) are 
deposited within 100 m of sources, and intermediate sized particles (10-30 µm) 
are likely to travel up to 200-500 m. However, as the particles are transported 
downwind their concentration reduces rapidly due to the action of atmospheric 
dispersion. 
6.5.5 
The study area is defined in accordance with the Institute of Air Quality 
Management (IAQM) ‘Guidance on the assessment of dust from demolition 
and construction’ (the "IAQM Guidance")7 which provides screening criteria for 
the consideration of dust impacts.  The screening distances for human and 
ecological receptors are: 
 
Human – within 350 m of the boundary of the Project Site, or 50 m of the 
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway, within 500 m 
of the site entrance; and 
 
Ecological – 50 m of the boundary of the Project Site or 50 m of the routes 
used by construction vehicles on the public highway, within 500 m of the 
Project Site entrance. 
6.5.6 
These distances have therefore been used to set the study area in this 
assessment as to whether there are any likely significant effects of the Project

in relation to air quality from dust during the construction phase. Both on-site 
and off-site dust effects have been considered.  
Study Area – Operation (including maintenance) 
6.5.7 
The study area for emissions to air during operation of the Generating 
Equipment is 10 km from the approximate centre of the Generating Equipment 
Site as per the Guidance on air emissions risk assessment for environmental 
permitting8.     
6.5.8 
Whilst the study area extends to 10 km, ambient pollutant concentrations as a 
result of emissions from the Generating Equipment are likely to be at a 
maximum concentration within 1 km9 of the boundary of the Generating 
Equipment Site and therefore human receptors are most likely to be affected 
within this distance. For ecological receptors, the study area is 10 km for 
internationally designated sites (SACs, SPAs, and RAMSARs), and 2 km for 
nationally designated sites (SSSIs, NNRs, LNRs, CWSs), as per the Guidance 
on air emission risk assessment for environmental permitting.  
6.5.9 
Project specific monitoring was not undertaken since, as will be demonstrated 
in the following sections, the existing data holdings are sufficient to 
characterise the air quality baseline within the study area.  
Vehicle Emissions 
6.5.10 
The impact of the emissions from vehicles during the construction, operational 
(including maintenance) and decommissioning phases (both on- and off-site) 
of the Project has been considered using the methodology prescribed in the 
Department for Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) 
Volume 11 Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality’ for the estimation of emissions from 
vehicles.  Receptors are defined in relation to their distance from affected 
roads, where the distance is up to 200 m from the road.  Affected roads are 
defined as: 
 
Road alignment will change by 5 m or more; or 
 
Daily traffic flows will change by 1,000 or more; or 
 
Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) flows will change by 200 AADT or more; or 
 
Daily average speed will change by 10 km/hr or more; or Peak hour speed 
will change by 20 km/hr or more.

the emissions. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

6.5.11 
As demonstrated in Chapter 12, it is concluded that there are no air quality 
effects arising from Project-generated traffic with the exception of a very short 
duration peak in construction traffic over a 1 to 2 day period.  
6.5.12 
The trip generation from the Project would only be above 200 vehicles per day 
for the worst case construction movements over a very short period of time (1 
to 2 days).  When averaged over a full year, the HDV movements would be 
less than 200 AADT. The effects of construction vehicle emissions of the 
Project alone are considered to be not significant and are therefore, scoped 
out of the assessment. 
Ambient Air Quality and the Protection of Human Health 
6.5.13 
In the case of combustion of natural gas in a power station, the main pollutants 
produced as a result of that process are NO2 and Carbon Monoxide (CO).  
Assessment of these pollutants therefore forms the basis for assessment of 
emissions to air for the operational phase of the Generating Equipment.  The 
assessment levels for these pollutants are shown in Table 6.2 and have been 
taken from legislation and guidance described in Appendix 2.6, namely The Air 
Quality Standards Regulations 201010, which implements the European 
Union’s Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe 
(2008/50/EC).

therefore, the objectives would not apply in the case of the Project as this would 
be classified as a Part A industrial source.

The long-term (annual average) limit for NOx of 30 µg/m3 is the critical level for 
the protection of vegetation and ecosystems as set in the Air Quality Strategy. 
In addition, the EA Air emissions risk assessment guidance for environmental 
permitting12 has set a NOx daily mean concentration assessment level of 75 
µg/m3 in accordance with WHO guidelines13.

Critical loads for nitrogen deposition onto sensitive ecosystems have been 
specified by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).  
They are defined as the amount of pollutant deposited to a given area over a 
year, below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements 
of the environment do not occur, according to present knowledge14. 
Exceedance of a critical load is used as an indication of the potential for 
harmful effects to occur to an ecological receptor. 
6.5.17 
The critical loads are specific to the individual ecological receptors.  Table 6.11 
sets out the critical loads for the ecological receptors being assessed. 
Building Downwash 
6.5.18 
When an air pollution plume flows over nearby buildings or other structures, 
turbulence is caused on the downwind side of the building. This turbulence can 
cause a plume from a stack source to be forced down to the ground much 
sooner than it would if a building or structure were not present. This is known 
as building downwash.  
6.5.19 
The downwash effects of buildings are taken into account by the air quality 
modelling. All buildings are assumed to be located in the indicative layout as 
shown in Figure 3.1 and to be of the dimensions in Table 3.1. Building

downwash is considered to be potentially significant if buildings are within a 
distance from the stack which is equivalent to five times the stack height and 
if the building height is greater than approximately 30 per cent of the stack 
height.  
Surface Roughness 
6.5.20 
The surface roughness length is a representation of the disruption of airflow 
close to the ground due to obstructions and protuberances, such as buildings, 
trees and hedges. In this case a surface roughness of 0.2 m has been used, 
corresponding to agricultural areas (minimum) as the area surrounding the 
Project Site is primarily open fields, small villages and isolated woodlands. 
Receptors and Additional Model Data 
6.5.21 
The ADMS 5 model was used for the modelling of the dispersion of exhaust 
gases during operation of the Generating Equipment.  ADMS 5 is a second 
generation air dispersion model developed in the UK and accepted by the EA 
for the purposes of EIA (and is also used by the EA in the assessment and 
determination of applications for Environmental Permits). 
6.5.22 
The ADMS 5 model calculates time averaged ground level concentrations over 
any set of distances from the source.  A 4 km by 4 km Cartesian grid with 44.4 
m spacing15 was used to predict the maximum process contributions to ground 
level concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the Generating Equipment 
Site.  Pollutant concentrations were also predicted at the particular locations 
of the identified receptors.  
6.5.23 
The meteorological data used for this modelling exercise was that from the 
station at Cranfield (grid reference: x494227 y242215, elevation 111m), 6.9 km 
west of the Project Site. The data period considered was 2012-2016 inclusive 
as per current Air quality risk assessment guidance16 for the need to use 
recent meteorological data over five consecutive years. For each year the 
predominant wind direction was from the south west. A sensitivity test was 
carried out using meteorological data from Bedford station (grid reference: 
x503736 y258727, elevation 84 m), approximately 9.2 km northeast of the 
Project Site. The sensitivity test results are presented in Appendix 6.1. 
                                                           
 
 
15 There is a difference between study area and the area over which significant effects occur.  In order to identify 
the maximum ground level concentrations, a smaller grid needs to be used.  As the maximum concentrations are 
insignificant within the 4km grid, they are insignificant outside it as well.

6.5.24 
Terrain effects generally occur when ground levels change by more than 1 in 
10.  A terrain file was created to account for the change in levels in the vicinity 
of the Generating Equipment Site. 
6.5.25 
The deposition of nutrient nitrogen and the acidity due to nitrogen as a result 
of operation of the Generating Equipment has been undertaken in accordance 
with the EA guidance “AQTAG 06 - Technical Guidance on detailed modelling 
approach for an appropriate assessment for emissions to air” (2010). Details 
of the deposition velocities used are contained in Table 6.4. 
6.5.26 
Atmospheric dispersion modelling has been used to determine the optimum 
stack height for the Generating Equipment.  The modelling takes into account 
both terrain data and local meteorological data in order to predict the ground 
level concentrations of pollutants.  The methodology that is followed is 
standard to all industrial modelling studies undertaken, and will be subject to 
audit by the EA for the Environmental Permit application for the Project.   
6.5.27 
The modelling has determined an appropriate stack height such that the 
maximum predicted ground level concentrations are insignificant in terms of 
human health impacts (less than 10% of the short term objective and 1% of 
the long term objective17).  Given the magnitude of the predicted 
concentrations it is not envisaged that ambient air quality monitoring would be 
necessary for the Project. The proposed technology choice for the Generating 
Equipment (OCGT) results in a release of exhaust gases from the stack which 
is at an extremely high temperature (over 550oC) and high pressure. This 
ensures that although the actual height of the stack will be at least 32.5 m, the 
effective chimney height (top of the emissions release) is many times higher 
(of the order of hundreds of metres). Therefore, no issues with temperature 
inversions are anticipated, as the exhaust gases would be able to penetrate 
any inversion layers.  
6.5.28 
Furthermore, the weather data used to feed into the model captures all types 
of weather conditions, including times when inversions would be most likely to 
occur.  
6.5.29 
The models have been run for a complete calendar year and the annual 
average results pro-rated by the maximum intended annual operating hours of 
the Power Generation Plant, so as to represent a realistic worst case scenario. 
Objectives are set out in Table 6.2. For the short term objectives, this modelling 
approach is conservative as it is unlikely that the Power Generation Plant will 
be operating during all of the periods in the year that give rise to the highest 
short term concentrations.  Five years’ worth of meteorological data has been

used in the assessment, and the maximum results from any of the five years 
reported. 
6.5.30 
The receptor locations for the assessment are shown in Figure 6.1. 
Fuel-specific Dispersion Model Inputs 
6.5.31 
The air dispersion modelling assumes that the Generating Equipment operates 
at full load for 2,250 hours per year for the selection of the stack height, i.e. the 
maximum possible number of operational hours that the plant can run in any 
one year out of five.  This results in insignificant impacts (less than 10% of the 
short term and 1% of the long term objectives) at the point of maximum ground 
level concentrations.  As the modelling has been undertaken for five years and 
the maximum annual results reported, the results at individual receptors are 
reported on the basis of 1500 hours operation per annum. The Power 
Generation Plant must not exceed an average of 1500 hours operation per 
annum over a rolling five year period.  
6.5.32 
All emissions from the combustion of the fuel gases will be discharged from 
the stack that will be located within the Generating Equipment Site. The 
indicative emission parameters for the stack are shown in Table 6.4.  The only 
pollutants of concern in relation to gas combustion are NOx and CO.  Gas 
combustion does not generate significant quantities of particulate matter or 
sulphur dioxide (SO2) as the sulphur content in natural gas is negligible.  
Emissions of NOx are the controlling pollutant for the determination of the stack 
height, as the predicted ground level concentrations of CO will be insignificant 
due to the release rate of this pollutant compared to the assessment level. 
6.5.33 
Emissions from eight different types of industrial gas turbines were modelled 
to ascertain the equipment that gave the maximum ground level concentrations 
of pollutants.  Whilst the impacts were all similar, emissions from the worst 
case gas turbine have been used for the modelling.

Atmospheric Chemistry 
6.5.34 
Emissions of NOx from combustion sources include both NO2 and NO, with the 
majority being in the form of NO.  In ambient air, NO is oxidised to form NO2, 
and it is NO2 which has the more significant health impacts.  For this 
assessment, the conversion of NO to NO2 has been estimated using the worst 
case assumptions set out in EA guidance18, namely that: 
 
For the assessment of long term (annual mean) impacts at receptors 70 
percent of NOx is NO2; and 
 
For the assessment of short term (hourly mean) impacts at receptors 35 
percent of NOx is NO2.   
6.5.35 
The oxidation of NO to NO2 is not, however, an instantaneous process and 
where the maximum impacts occur within up to 1 km of the stacks (as will be 
the case for the Generating Equipment), the EA assumptions offer a worst case 
assessment as the conversion rates may be very conservative. 
Stack Height 
6.5.36 
A stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project.  This study 
examined differing stack heights in 2.5 m intervals from 27.5 m to 45 m 
(inclusive).  The stack height sensitivity study considered long term and short 
term contributions to ground level concentrations of NO2. 
6.5.37 
Based on this analysis it has been determined that a minimum stack height of 
32.5 m will be suitable for the Generating Equipment so as to achieve adequate 
dispersion of air emissions without impacting on sensitive receptors and whilst 
ensuring compliance with the UK AQS objectives. The impacts have been

6.5.42 
The assessment of the effect of emissions to air from the Generating 
Equipment on human health receptors has been considered in line with criteria 
in the Air emissions risk assessment guidance20. The contribution of the 
Generating Equipment (the process contribution (or PC)) has been added to 
an estimate of the background concentration (based on monitoring data) to

provide the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). The PC can be 
considered to be “significant” if the ground level concentrations exceed 10 
percent of the short term objectives and 1 percent of the long term objectives.   
6.5.43 
In all cases, the PEC should be below the relevant assessment level for the 
relevant pollutant as set out in Table 6.2.  Where a PC causes a breach of the 
relevant assessment level, and the PC is the significant causal factor for the 
breach then the PC is unlikely to be acceptable and further controls are likely 
to be required on the operation of the installation to mitigate the impact (i.e. 
additional mitigation to reduce emissions or the consideration of the need for 
a higher stack). 
Operation (including maintenance) – Ecological Receptors 
6.5.44 
The assessment of the effect of emissions to air from the Generating 
Equipment on ecological receptors has also been carried out in line with criteria 
set out in the Air emissions risk assessment guidance16.  The maximum PEC 
within the habitat should not exceed the critical level as set out in Table 6.3.  
Where a PC causes a breach of the relevant assessment level, and the PC is 
the significant causal factor for the breach then the PC is unlikely to be 
acceptable and further controls are likely to be required on the operation of the 
installation to mitigate the impact (i.e. additional mitigation to reduce emissions 
or the consideration of the need for a higher stack). 
6.5.45 
The maximum predicted deposition (from the process and background), should 
not exceed the critical load.  In the case where the critical level or load are 
already exceeded as a result of the background concentrations or deposition 
rates, then the additional contribution from the process should be less than 1 
percent of the assessment value, otherwise the additional contribution is 
potentially significant and a Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) would be 
necessary. However, it is noted here that no HRA is considered necessary for 
this Project given the distance of Natura 2000 sites from the Project Site (see 
Chapter 8 for further information).  
Gas Connection 
6.5.46 
It is noted here that the SoS, in the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 1.2), 
commented that the potential effects of air quality from operation of the Gas 
Connection could be scoped out of the assessment because operation of the 
Gas Connection would not be likely to release any emissions to air during its 
operation. 
Electrical Connection 
6.5.47 
It is noted here that the SoS, in the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 1.2), 
commented that the potential effects of air quality from operation of the 
Electrical Connection could be scoped out of the assessment because 
operation of the Gas Connection would not be likely to release any emissions 
to air during its operation.

Assumptions 
6.5.48 
The assumptions for this assessment are set out as per Section 4.8. From an 
air quality perspective this is that the Generating Equipment will operate for a 
maximum of 2,250 hours per year, and will not exceed an average of 1,500 
hours of operation over a rolling five-year period.  
6.6 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Power Generation Plant 
6.6.1 
The baseline conditions assume that certain elements of the LLRS are in place 
prior to construction of the Project in 2020, as per Section 3.1.  
6.6.2 
The nearest Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) to the Project Site is within 
Ampthill, approximately 4 km south of the Project Site. The AQMA is declared 
primarily on the basis of traffic related NO2.  
6.6.3 
Monitored concentrations for Brogborough (approximately 5 km from the 
Project Site), taken from the CBC 2016 Annual Status Report, are shown in

6.6.5 
The national maps for carbon monoxide have not been updated since 2001 on 
the basis that there was very little risk of the objectives being exceeded in the 
future. The background concentrations for this pollutant are likely to be below 
the values stated.  
6.6.6 
The NOx and NO2 background concentrations are well below the relevant 
objectives. 
Residential Receptors 
6.6.7 
There are no villages/towns within 1 km of the Generating Equipment Site. 
Residential receptors within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Stewartby and Millbrook. In addition, there are 
farmsteads outside of the settlements and within 1 km of the Project Site 
including, but not limited to:  
 
South Pillinge Farm; 
 
Church Farm and Church Farm Cottages;

6.6.8 
In terms of potential construction related impacts from dust, receptors within 
350 m of the Project Site are limited to South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge 
Cottages.  There are a number of residential properties within 50 m of the 
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway, up to 500 m from 
the site entrance within Stewartby.   
6.6.9 
In order to identify the points of maximum ground level concentration a 
Cartesian grid of receptors has been used.  The grid resolution is 
approximately 44 m, which is less than 1.5 times the optimum stack height and 
therefore complies with the Air emissions risk assessment guidance for the 
grid resolution.  The overall receptor grid was 4 km east to west and north to 
south; from 499500, 238500 to 503500, 242500. This defined sensitive 
residential receptors within the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant Site 
which are set out below in Table 6.10 and shown on Figure 6.1.

Assessment of Effects 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction/Decommissioning 
6.7.1 
The main potential air quality effects during construction and decommissioning 
of the Power Generation Plant are dust deposition and associated elevation in 
PM10 concentrations. The following activities have the potential to cause 
emissions of dust:  
 
Site preparation including delivery of construction material, erection of 
fences and barriers; 
 
Earthworks including digging foundations and landscaping; 
 
Materials handling such as storage of material in stockpiles; 
 
Construction and fabrication of units;  
 
Decommissioning activities; and 
 
Removal of materials from the site. 
6.7.2 
Typically, the main cause of unmitigated dust generation on construction / 
decommissioning sites is from demolition and vehicles using unpaved haul 
roads, and off-site from the suspension of dust from mud deposited on local 
roads by traffic. The main determinants of unmitigated dust annoyance are the 
weather and the distance to the nearest receptor.  
6.7.3 
In addition to the generation of dust and PM10 emissions, emissions of NOx 
can occur from road traffic, plant and equipment used on site. 
6.7.4 
The study area for dust effects is considered to be of low sensitivity (see Table 
6.5). The Power Generation Plant site is located in an area of light industrial 
development and agricultural land with few residential properties. The closest 
significant residential developments lie over 500 m from the Power Generation 
Plant Site boundary, although isolated roadside properties are present within 
150 m. 
6.7.5 
The Power Generation Plant site does not warrant a higher sensitivity rating 
since local particulate matter concentrations are at low risk of exceedance of 
the air quality objectives. Locations without permanent habitation such as 
agricultural land and/or PROW are judged to be of low sensitivity for dust and 
health effects. 
6.7.6 
Although Rookery Clay Pit CWS and Stewartby Lake CWS are within 50 m of 
construction activities, in accordance with Table 6.5 they have been 
considered to be of low sensitivity given that they are not nationally or 
internationally designated and do not have any dust sensitive species present.  
6.7.7 
No demolition works are required during construction of the Project and only a 
small category of dust emission magnitude is warranted during demolition 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
127 
works in the decommissioning phase given the limit number of buildings on 
site, many of which are metal and pre-fabricated (i.e. they would be dismantled 
rather than demolished). No significant earthworks are anticipated for the 
Power Generation Plant as the LLRS will be responsible for the majority of site 
preparation. However, the dust emission potential for construction of the 
Project is assessed as being large (Table 6.6) for earthworks associated with 
the Power Generation Plant, primarily due to the scale of the development 
area. 
6.7.8 
Emissions during construction itself are moderated by the largely prefabricated 
nature of the installation and have therefore been classed as low in line with 
Table 6.6. 
6.7.9 
Emissions from track-out are of medium potential. For the Power Generation 
Plant, risks arise due to the number of vehicles potentially operating on the 
Power Generation Plant site. 
6.7.10 
The dust emission potential is considered in combination with the distance to 
the nearest receptors to assess the potential risks associated with the 
construction phase of the Project. 
6.7.11 
Based on the IAQM criteria (Table 6.7), the highest risk of dust emissions, 
associated with the construction / decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant, is considered to be low (large dust emissions class of earthworks on a 
low sensitivity receptor).  Appropriate mitigation corresponding to a low risk 
site is therefore required during the construction phase and is incorporated 
within the outline CEMP as embedded mitigation, as set out in Section 3.6 and 
Appendix 3.2.     
6.7.12 
In accordance with the IAQM criteria (Table 6.5), the study area is considered 
to be of low sensitivity, as there are no receptors in close proximity to the 
Access Road. The dust emissions class associated with construction of the 
Access Road is small.  The risk of dust effects associated with the construction 
of the Access Road is therefore negligible (Table 6.7). 
6.7.13 
The results of the assessment are summarised below in Table 6.13.

6.7.14 
Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using the emissions data set 
out in Table 6.4 and meteorological data from 2012 to 2016. 
6.7.15 
Dispersion model runs were undertaken for various stack heights between 
27.5 m and 45 m with a model grid resolution of 44 m. The optimum stack 
height was determined such that the maximum predicted annual NO2 
concentration was less than 1% of the long term objective (40 µg/m3) and the 
maximum predicted hourly NO2 concentration was less than 10% of the 
objective (200 µg/m3 as a 99.78th percentile). 
6.7.16 
Table 6.14 to Table 6.17 and Insert 6.1 show the results of the stack height 
sensitivity testing. Significant benefits are seen as the stack height increases 
from 27.5 m to 45 m, as the effects of building downwash reduce. By 32.5 m, 
the maximum impact on ground level concentrations of NO2 anywhere on the 
grid is less than 1% of the annual mean objective and 10% of the hourly mean 
objective. Beyond 35 m, whilst benefits are still seen with increasing stack 
height, the rate of reduction in impacts decreases significantly, especially for 
annual mean nitrogen dioxide concentrations. Additionally, in terms of 
balancing environmental effects (i.e. adequate dispersion vs greater visual 
impacts from a higher stack), 35 m is considered a suitable maximum 
parameter.

Potential Impacts on Human Health 
6.7.17 
In this section, the modelled contributions of the Power Generation Plant to 
pollution and deposition levels are presented as maximum ground level 
concentrations of NO2 and CO anywhere within the study area. 
6.7.18 
Furthermore, the model results are presented as the contribution of the Power 
Generation Plant on its own (PC), and in combination with background 
concentrations (PEC). 
6.7.19 
Within the dispersion modelling, twenty specific human sensitive receptors 
were defined in close proximity to the site, as set out in Table 6.10.  
6.7.20 
The maximum predicted ground level concentrations from the realistic worst 
case scenario for a stack height of 32.5 m are all insignificant when compared 
to the assessment levels for human health impacts (section 6.5, Table 6.2).  
As the maximum predicted concentrations are all insignificant, the 
concentrations at selected human health receptors are also all insignificant. 
The results for short term contributions and PECs are shown below in Tables 
6.18 and 6.19 respectively. The results for long term concentrations are shown 
in Table 6.20.

Isopleths showing the predicted annual average NO2 concentration and the 
predicted hourly average 99.79th percentile NO2 concentration are presented 
in Figures 6.2 and 6.3 respectively.  
Impacts on Ecological Receptors 
6.7.22 
Impacts on ecological receptors can occur both in terms of impacts on plants 
exposed directly to airborne pollutants and also through deposition of 
substances to soil, which subsequently changes soil chemistry. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
 
135 
6.7.23 
Within the dispersion modelling, 15 specific ecologically sensitive receptors 
were defined, in close proximity to the Site, as set out in Table 6.11.  
6.7.24 
For the ecological receptors, all of the predicted annual mean oxides of 
nitrogen process contributions are insignificant, i.e. below 1% of the 
assessment level.  When combined with the background concentrations, no 
breaches of the critical level are predicted to occur.   
6.7.25 
The predicted daily mean oxides of nitrogen concentrations are not 
insignificant, but when added to the background concentrations, no breaches 
of the daily mean critical level are predicted to occur. 
6.7.26 
All of the predicted nitrogen and acid deposition rates are insignificant when 
compared to the critical loads for the habitats under consideration.

Gas Connection 
Construction/Decommissioning 
6.7.28 
The main potential air quality effects during construction and decommissioning of 
the Gas Connection are dust deposition and associated elevation in PM10 
concentrations. The following activities have the potential to cause emissions of 
dust:  
 
Site preparation including delivery of construction material, erection of fences 
and barriers; 
 
Earthworks including digging of pipeline trench; and 
 
Materials handling such as storage of material in stockpiles. 
6.7.29 
Typically, the main cause of unmitigated dust generation on construction / 
decommissioning sites is from demolition and vehicles using unpaved haul roads, 
and off-site from the suspension of dust from mud deposited on local roads by 
traffic. The main determinants of unmitigated dust annoyance are the weather 
and the distance to the nearest receptor.  
6.7.30 
In addition to the generation of dust and PM10 emissions, emissions of NOx can 
occur from road traffic, plant and equipment used on site. 
6.7.31 
The receptors within the study area are considered to be of low sensitivity (see 
Table 6.5). The Gas Connection is located in an area of light industrial 
development and agricultural land with few residential properties. The closest 
significant residential developments lie over 500 m from the Gas Connection, 
although isolated properties are present within 150 m. 
6.7.32 
The Gas Connection Site does not warrant a higher sensitivity rating since local 
particulate matter concentrations are at low risk of exceedance of the air quality 
objectives. Locations without permanent habitation such as agricultural land 
and/or PROW are judged to be of low sensitivity for dust and health effects.  
6.7.33 
Although Rookery Pit CWS is within 50 m of construction activities, in accordance 
with Table 6.5 it has been considered to be of low sensitivity given that it is not 
nationally or internationally designated and does not have any dust sensitive 
species present.  
6.7.34 
No demolition works are required for any construction aspect of the Project and 
only a small category of dust emission magnitude is warranted during demolition 
works in the decommissioning phase given the limit number of buildings, many of 
which are metal and pre-fabricated (i.e. they would be dismantled rather than 
demolished). The Pipeline is also likely to be left in-situ. The dust emission 
potential for construction of the Project is assessed as being large for earthworks 
associated with the Gas Connection primarily due to the scale of the development 
area. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
141 
 
 
6.7.35 
Emissions during construction itself are moderated by the largely prefabricated 
nature of the installation (length of gas pipeline brought to Gas Connection) and 
are therefore classed as small. 
6.7.36 
Emissions from track-out are of medium potential. For the Gas Connection, risks 
arise due to the number of vehicles potentially operating on the Gas Connection 
and using unpaved access. 
6.7.37 
The dust emission potential is considered in combination with the distance to the 
nearest receptors to assess the potential risks associated with the construction 
phase of the Gas Connection. 
6.7.38 
In line with Table 6.6, the highest risk of dust emissions during the construction 
and decommissioning of the Gas Connection is considered to be large (as a result 
of earthworks). The study area is considered to be of low sensitivity (Table 6.5). 
In line with Table 6.7, the risk of dust emissions associated with the construction 
of the Gas Connection is therefore low. This is summarised below in Table 6.25.

Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Overview 
6.8.1 
Construction, decommissioning or operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Section 4.10.  However, the majority of these  proposed developments are all 
distant from the Project Site (greater than 2 km). 
6.8.2 
These developments and any effects arising from them are outside the study area 
for this topic within which significant effects could occur (e.g. dust deposition on 
the same residential receptors as the Project).  As such it is considered that no 
cumulative or in combination effects are likely to arise in relation to air quality 
during the construction or decommissioning phases of the Project. Furthermore, 
each of these developments will be bound by its own CEMP and will apply best 
practice construction methods so as to minimise impacts on air quality.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
144 
 
 
6.8.3 
Similarly, it is considered that these developments are all a significant distance 
from the Project Site and outside of the study area, and as such are not 
considered likely to cause any cumulative impacts on air quality in conjunction 
with the Project. Only limited operational emissions to air (limited to numbers of 
traffic movements which are considered insignificant in EIA terms) are anticipated 
to result from these developments during operation. Furthermore, each of these 
developments will be bound by its own best practice working methods so as to 
limit operational impacts on air quality.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
6.8.4 
The projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects assessment 
for this chapter (taken from Section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, (immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
6.8.5 
Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery South Pit. At present, only a high level 
scoping report has been submitted. No details are set out regarding potential 
impacts on air quality as a result of the development. However, it is likely that this 
development will be bound by its own CEMP and best practice construction 
methods so as to limit impacts on air quality during construction. Should it go 
ahead, then any application for consent will need to consider the Project to ensure 
that no significant cumulative effects will arise between it and the Project. 
Nevertheless, in order to minimise the possibility of cumulative effects arising, a 
CEMP will be followed during construction of the Project, which will ensure best 
practice construction methods are followed and limit, as far as practicable, the 
possibility of impacts occurring to air quality. The measures proposed to minimise 
impacts during construction are listed in Section 3.6.   
6.8.6 
Furthermore, given the early stage of the Integrated Waste Management 
proposals and the likely time required to achieve planning consent, it is 
considered unlikely that there would be any overlap on the construction periods 
of these two projects, which further mitigates against any potential cumulative 
effects.  
6.8.7 
As set out in Section 4.10, the project with the most potential for simultaneous 
construction or decommissioning effects is the Covanta RRF to be developed to 
the north of the Generating Equipment Site.   
6.8.8 
The construction of both the Project and the Covanta RRF Project at the same 
time represents the greatest potential for creating cumulative dust and traffic 
emission impacts and is therefore judged to be a realistic worst case scenario for 
cumulatively assessing construction impacts. Any other scenario (e.g. operation 
of one scheme and constriction of the other) would generate less dust and 
therefore lower impacts.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
145 
 
 
6.8.9 
The ES for the Covanta RRF concluded that there were two main potential pre-
mitigation impacts relating to air quality that may arise during the construction and 
decommissioning of the plant. 
6.8.10 
These impacts include: 
 Dust emissions – (human receptor) minor adverse  
 Road traffic emissions – (human receptor) negligible  
6.8.11 
However, the Covanta RFF ES proposed a number of mitigation measures to 
reduce these potential impacts, which essentially include working to a Code of 
Construction Practice (CoCP) and the visual monitoring of dust during a 
combination of meteorological events (i.e. when there is a wind of greater than 3 
m/s, from the northeast during periods when there is no precipitation or the ground 
is dry). In the event that dust emissions are likely to impact the nearest residential 
receptor, South Pillinge Farm, onsite measures would be adopted, including 
water-spray dampening of soils, stockpiles and exposed surfaces. 
6.8.12 
Subsequent to the implementation of the above mitigation measures, the residual 
effects of construction dust were judged to be not significant.  
6.8.13 
Similarly, potential impacts from dust deposition were identified for the Project. 
However, applying the embedded mitigation described in this Chapter, there are 
expected to be no effects arising from the construction and de-commissioning of 
the Project from deposition of dust either. Based on professional judgement and 
experience and knowledge of other schemes, there are therefore not anticipated 
to be any significant effects from construction related dust deposition cumulatively 
from both projects. 
6.8.14 
It is concluded that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation of 
the embedded mitigation described in this Chapter along with the implementation 
of embedded mitigation in the Covanta RRF project, no potential significant 
cumulative effects will arise in relation to dust as part of construction and 
decommissioning.  
6.8.15 
Traffic generated by the Project is compared with other cumulative developments 
in Chapter 12. Cumulative effects are only expected with the Covanta RRF 
Project given the close proximity of the two sites, the same location for the main 
site access and the potential for construction of both projects at the same time. 
Both projects will use Green Lane as their primary access route for construction. 
6.8.16 
The trip generation of Covanta RRF Project is significantly greater than that from 
the Project (Chapter 12). Taking into consideration the cumulative effects of the 
Project and Covanta RRF, Green Lane would meet the criteria for an assessment 
of road traffic impacts to be undertaken.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

6.8.17 
The Covanta RRF Project assessed the impacts of vehicle emissions on Green 
Lane21 brought about by the Energy from Waste (EfW) facility, where the increase 
in HGVs was predicted to be greater than 200 HGVs per day. The assessment 
indicated that although the additional traffic would result in an increase in airborne 
pollution at sensitive receptors, the predicted concentrations of NO2 and PM10 
would be well below the air quality objectives. On this basis, it concluded that 
there was unlikely to be any risk of unacceptable impacts to air quality due to road 
traffic, and impacts were considered not significant.  
6.8.18 
The cumulative impacts of the Project and Covanta RRF traffic would be not 
significant, as the impacts of the Project construction traffic would be insignificant 
by virtue of the traffic being below relevant thresholds for an assessment to be 
necessary.  
Operation (including maintenance)  
6.8.19 
The projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects assessment 
for this chapter (taken from Section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
6.8.20 
Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery Pit. At present, only a high level scoping 
report, requesting a scoping opinion, has been submitted. No details are provided 
in the scoping report regarding potential impacts on air quality or from acid 
deposition. However, it is likely that, should any of the proposed waste 
developments involve combustion processes, they will be bound by their own 
emissions limits, and will need to consider other cumulative schemes when 
applying for consent. Should the development go ahead, the application for 
consent will need to consider the Project to ensure that no cumulative effects will 
arise between it and the Project as this development will follow development of 
the Project.  
6.8.21 
The ES for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site concluded that there were potential (pre-mitigation) effects from operation of 
the project resulting from: 
 
Emissions associated with road traffic (human receptor) – negligible  
 
Emissions associated with combustion process (human receptor) – negligible

(Resource Recovery Facility) Order. Document Reference: 3.1. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

 
Emissions associated with combustion process (Kings Wood and Glebe 
Meadows SSSI) – minor adverse  
6.8.22 
Effective traffic planning and management was referred to, such as design of 
vehicle routing onsite and optimising waste delivery schedules to minimise vehicle 
queueing, optimising junction arrangements between the site access and Green 
Lane, and routing traffic to optimise access to the trunk road network.  
6.8.23 
The Covanta RRF ES states that although emissions are low, the nutrient nitrogen 
deposition at the Kings Wood and Glebe Meadows, Houghton Conquest SSSI 
was predicted to be marginally greater than 1% PEC. It should be noted that this 
result was based upon the assessment of impacts using a stack height of 100 m, 
and the extension of the stack to 105 m (as has been subsequently approved by 
their DCO) would be likely to reduce the impacts to below 1% for the upper limit 
and therefore there would be no significant effects. 
6.8.24 
Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and the 
Generating Equipment operating together and the results are contained in 
Appendix 6.3.  There are no predicted exceedances of the assessment levels for 
the two plants operating together at any of the human health receptors. The 
combined impacts of the two plants at the receptors are all insignificant, and 
therefore the cumulative effect will be negligible and not significant.  As the effects 
of vehicle emissions from the Project have been scoped out of this assessment, 
there will be no cumulative traffic effects. 
6.8.25 
The effect of road traffic emissions associated with the Covanta RRF was 
assessed in the ES for the development.  The increase in traffic was found only 
to be significant on Green Lane.  The effect of this traffic increase was assessed 
and it was found that it was unlikely to be any risk of unacceptable impacts to air 
quality due to road traffic, and impacts were considered not significant. 
6.8.26 
The proposed Covanta RRF project will release both oxides of nitrogen and 
carbon monoxide from the combustion process.  However, the exhaust stack for 
the Covanta RRF will be much higher than the stack for the Project (105 m 
compared to 32.5 m) and therefore the location of maximum ground level 
concentrations will be different from those associated with the Project.   
6.8.27 
The assessment on ecological receptors for the Project states that all impacts 
would be insignificant except for the Kings Wood and Glebe Meadows SSSI, 
where the impact is minor adverse due to nutrient nitrogen deposition.  The 
Covanta RFF stack has been modelled with Millbrook Power Project stack, and it 
is concluded that the cumulative impact is not significant (Appendices 6.2 and 
6.3). 
6.8.28 
When the Covanta RFF and the Generating Equipment are operating 
simultaneously, all of the predicted annual mean oxides of nitrogen process 
contributions are insignificant, i.e. below 1% of the assessment level. When 
combined with the background concentrations, no breaches of the critical level 
are predicted to occur.  The predicted daily mean oxides of nitrogen 
concentrations are not significant in EIA terms, and when added to the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
148 
 
 
background concentrations, no breaches of the daily mean critical level are 
predicted to occur.  The combined impacts at the receptors are all insignificant, 
and therefore the cumulative effect will be negligible and not significant.   
Effect Interactions 
6.8.29 
Whilst the air quality impact assessment is informed by a number of other topics, 
the primary interactions with other topics are in informing the landscape and visual 
assessment as to a suitable stack height, and informing the ecology assessment 
as to the potential impacts on sensitive ecological receptors due to emissions 
arising during operation of the Generating Equipment. 
6.8.30 
The stack height was determined by the need to comply with air quality standards 
and guidelines for the protection of sensitive human receptors and sensitive 
ecological receptors. As such there was little opportunity for flexibility in the stack 
height due to visual impacts, with the need to comply with air quality standards 
and guidelines. The stack height has been set at a minimum of 32.5 m and a 
maximum of 35 m.  
6.8.31 
With regard to sensitive ecological receptors, the air quality impact assessment 
included all nationally protected statutory habitat sites and locally designated 
sites, and informed the ecological impact assessment based upon the results of 
the dispersion modelling. The results are set out in Section 6.7.  
6.8.32 
The number of construction and operational traffic movements presented in 
Chapter 12 have been used to assess potential effects from exhaust emissions.  
6.9 
Additional Mitigation 
6.9.1 
No additional mitigation is considered necessary over and above embedded 
mitigation described in Section 3.6 to limit air quality effects, either as a result of 
the Project in isolation or cumulatively with other projects.  
6.10

6.11 
Conclusion 
6.11.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect air quality both through the generation of dust during the 
construction and decommissioning phases and the generation of stack 
emissions during operation. 
6.11.2 
A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling have been 
carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from the Project 
on identified residential and ecological receptors within 10 km of the Project 
Site.  
6.11.3 
The nearest AQMA to the Project Site is within Ampthill, approximately 4 km 
south of the Project Site.  
6.11.4 
In light of the fact that this AQMA is located approximately 4 km south of the 
Project Site, and taking account of the results of this assessment, emissions 
from the Generating Equipment will not impact significantly on this AQMA. 
6.11.5 
No exceedances of air quality objectives have been identified as likely to occur 
as a result of the Project.  
6.11.6 
It is considered unlikely that levels of atmospheric dust would be generated 
which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to residential or ecological 
receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site. The limited numbers of vehicle 
movements associated with the Project also means that there is not anticipated 
to be any impacts from exhaust emissions.  
6.11.7 
Impacts would be minimised through implementation of a CEMP (Appendix 
3.2) to support the DCO Application (Document Reference 3.1) which would 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather. 
Additionally, the majority of particulates from construction activities settle 
within a very short distance of the construction site. Therefore, effects on 
receptors further afield from the Project Site will be negligible.  
6.11.8 
Air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height which will 
achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits and prevent any 
likely significant effects to identified receptors is between 32.5 m and 35 m. It 
is concluded, therefore, that effects on air quality during operation will be 
negligible. For nitrogen and acid deposition no significant effects on ecological 
receptors are expected as a result of the operation of the Generating 
Equipment. 
6.11.9 
The assessment presented above has shown that the Project will not result in 
any likely significant environmental effects in relation to air quality either as a 
standalone project or cumulatively with other projects, having regard to the 
design and proposed operation of the Project and embedded mitigation.

Noise and Vibration 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 This Chapter presents the assessment of the noise and vibration effects likely 
to arise from the construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning 
of the Project.  
7.1.2 The Project has the potential to affect noise and vibration levels at the nearest 
noise sensitive receptors due to the construction and decommissioning 
activities associated with the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection (e.g. excavation for foundations and laying of the  
Pipeline and electrical cables), and the operation and maintenance of the 
Power Generation Plant (e.g. from the moving parts of the Generating 
Equipment, cooling equipment and noise generated from the stack).  
7.2 
Legislation and Policy Context including guidance: 
Noise Policy Statement for England (NPSE) (March 2010) 
7.2.1 The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs published the Noise 
Policy Statement for England (NPSE) in March 2010.  
7.2.2 There are three aims in the NPSE 
1. Avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
environmental, neighbour and neighbourhood noise within the context of 
Government policy on sustainable development. 
 
The first aim of the NPSE requires that significant adverse effects on health and 
quality of life should be avoided whilst taking into account the guiding principles 
of sustainable development.  
2. Mitigate and minimise adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
environmental, neighbour and neighbourhood noise within the context of 
Government policy on sustainable development.  
 
The second aim of the NPSE requires that all reasonable steps should be taken 
to mitigate and minimise adverse effects on health and quality of life whilst also 
aking into account the guiding principles of sustainable development. This does 
not mean that such adverse effects cannot occur.  
3. Where possible, contribute to the improvement of health and quality of 
life through the effective management and control of environmental, 
neighbour and neighbourhood noise within the context of Government 
policy on sustainable development.  
 
This aim seeks “positively to improve health and quality of life through the pro-
active management of noise while also taking into account the guiding 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
159 
 
principles of sustainable development, recognising that there will be 
opportunities for such measures to be taken and that they will deliver potential 
benefits to society. The protection of quiet places and quiet times as well as the 
enhancement of the acoustic environment will assist with delivering this aim.” 
7.2.3 The explanatory note of NPSE provides further explanation as follows: 
  
“There are two established concepts from toxicology that are currently 
being applied to noise impacts, for example, by the World Health 
Organisation. They are:  
  
NOEL – No Observed Effect Level  
  
This is the level below which no effect can be detected. In simple terms, 
below this level, there is no detectable effect on health and quality of life 
due to the noise.  
  
LOAEL – Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level  
  
This is the level above which adverse effects on health and quality of life 
can be detected.  
  
Extending these concepts for the purpose of this NPSE leads to the concept 
of a significant observed adverse effect level.  
  
SOAEL – Significant Observed Adverse Effect Level  
  
This is the level above which significant adverse effects on health and 
quality of life occur.”  
7.2.4 The NPSE does not define the SOAEL numerically, stating at Paragraph 2.22: 
 
 
“It is not possible to have a single objective noise-based measure that 
defines SOAEL that is applicable to all sources of noise in all situations. 
Consequently, the SOAEL is likely to be different for different noise sources, 
for different receptors and at different times. It is acknowledged that further 
research is required to increase our understanding of what may constitute 
a significant adverse impact on health and quality of life from noise. 
However, not having specific SOAEL values in the NPSE provides the 
necessary policy flexibility until further evidence and suitable guidance is 
available.”

NPS EN-1 ‘Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy’ (July 2011) 
7.2.5 The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) issued by 
the Department for Energy and Climate Change (as was) sets out national 
policy with respect to energy infrastructure. 
7.2.6 Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1 sets out the requirements for assessing and 
mitigating noise and vibration from nationally significant infrastructure projects 
(NSIPs) in the energy sector. It also sets out the approach the Secretary of 
State (SoS) should adopt when considering noise assessments. 
7.2.7 It advises that operational noise from a proposed development and the 
proximity to noise sensitive receptors, quiet areas or sites designated for 
ecological reasons will determine the likely impact of noise. 
7.2.8 Where noise impacts are likely, a noise assessment should be undertaken in 
line with details listed in the NPS EN-1.   
7.2.9 Operational noise and vibration should be assessed using relevant British 
Standards (e.g. BS 4142, BS 6472, BS 8233 and BS 5228) and other 
guidance, including the other NPS’s. 
7.2.10 NPS EN-1 advises the SoS that the project should: 
“demonstrate good design through selection of the quietest cost-effective plant 
available; containment of noise within buildings wherever possible; 
optimisation of plant layout to minimise noise emissions; and, where possible, 
the use of landscaping, bunds or noise barriers to reduce noise transmission.” 
(paragraph 5.11.8) 
7.2.11 The proposal should meet the following aims before the SoS grants consent: 
 “avoid significant impacts on health and quality of life from noise, 
 mitigate and minimise other adverse impacts on health and quality of life 
from noise, 
  where possible, contribute to improvements to health and quality of life 
through the effective management and control of noise.” (paragraph 
5.11.9) 
7.2.12 Paragraphs 5.11.11 to 5.11.13 of NPS EN-1 also sets out advice on mitigation 
and states: 
“The IPC should consider whether mitigation measures are needed both for 
operational and construction noise over and above any which may form part of 
the project application. In doing so the IPC may wish to impose requirements. 
Any such requirements should take account of the guidance set out in Circular 
11/95 (see Section 4.1) or any successor to it. 
Mitigation measures may include one or more of the following: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
161 
 
 
engineering: reduction of noise at point of generation and containment of 
noise generated; 
 
lay-out: adequate distance between source and noise-sensitive receptors; 
incorporating good design to minimise noise transmission through 
screening by natural barriers, or other buildings; and 
 
administrative: restricting activities allowed on the site; specifying 
acceptable noise limits; and taking into account seasonality of wildlife in 
nearby designated sites. 
In certain situations, and only when all other forms of noise mitigation have 
been exhausted, it may be appropriate for the IPC to consider requiring noise 
mitigation through improved sound insulation to dwellings.” 
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4) 
7.2.13 The National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4) issued by the Department for Energy and Climate Change 
(as was) sets out national policy with respect to energy infrastructure. 
7.2.14 Section 2.20 of EN-4 advises that: 
“During the pre-construction phase there could be vibration effects from 
seismic surveys. During construction, tasks may include site clearance, soil 
movement, ground excavation, tunnelling, trenching, pipe laying and welding, 
and ground reinstatement. In addition, increased HGV traffic will be generated 
on local roads for the movement of materials. These types of noise and 
vibration impacts will need to be assessed. (paragraph 2.20.2) 
The commissioning of a new pipeline can involve extensive periods of drying 
after hydrotesting, using air compressors, and noise mitigation may be 
required for this type of activity. (paragraph 2.20.3) 
A new gas pipeline may require an above ground installation such as a gas 
compression station on the route of the pipeline to boost transmission line 
pressure. A new oil pipeline may require pumping stations. These may be 
located in quiet rural areas, and therefore the control of noise from these 
facilities is likely to be an important consideration.” (paragraph 2.20.4) 
7.2.15 Paragraph 2.20.7 of EN-4 also advises on mitigation measures and states: 
“Noise mitigation measures for gas and oil pipelines, in particular their 
associated above-ground installations, include screening or enclosure of 
compressors and pumps. Other measures could include the use of sound 
attenuators on ventilation systems, acoustic lagging on pipework, multi-stage 
(inherently quiet) control valves, gas turbine exhaust silencers, and high 
efficiency low speed cooler fans, depending on the specific issues. Vibration 
mitigation measures could include the use of non-impact piling such as augur 
boring.”

The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (March 2012) 
7.2.16 The Department for Communities and Local Government published the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) on 27 March 2012 and upon its 
publication, the majority of planning policy statements and guidance notes 
were withdrawn. 
7.2.17 The NPPF states that it does not contain specific policies for NSIP’s, however 
it does state that “These are determined in accordance with the decision-
making framework set out in the Planning Act 2008 and relevant national policy 
statements for major infrastructure, as well as any other matters that are 
considered both important and relevant (which may include the National 
Planning Policy Framework). National policy statements form part of the overall 
framework of national planning policy, and are a material considerations in 
decisions on planning applications.” 
7.2.18 Therefore, for matters that the Government consider important, decisions on 
NSIPs may include reference to the NPPF. In addition, the NPPF requires that 
local planning authorities should work with other authorities and providers to 
take account of the need for strategic infrastructure, including nationally 
significant infrastructure within their areas. 
7.2.19 The NPPF contains four aims, which are set out at paragraph 123 in Section 
11 of the document, titled Conserving and enhancing the natural environment: 
  
“Planning policies and decisions should aim to: 
 Avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and 
quality of life as a result of new development; 
 Mitigate and reduce to a minimum other adverse impacts on health and 
quality of life arising from noise from new development, including 
through the use of conditions;  
 Recognise that development will often create some noise and existing 
businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their business should 
not have unreasonable restrictions put on them because of changes in 
nearby land uses since they were established; and  
 Identify and protect areas of tranquillity which have remained relatively 
undisturbed by noise and are prized for their recreational and amenity 
value for this reason.” 
7.2.20 There are two footnotes to the above guidance. The first footnote refers to the 
Explanatory Note to the Noise Policy Statement for England, which defines 
both “significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life” and “adverse 
impacts on health and quality of life” as referred to in the first two bullet points.  
7.2.21 The second footnote indicates that the third bullet point is “subject to the 
provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and other relevant law”.

Planning Practice Guidance 
7.2.22 The National Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) was published on 6 March 
2014. It states that the guidance relating to noise provides answers to a 
number of questions and reiterates the guidance within the NPSE. It states that 
“noise needs to be considered when new developments may create additional 
noise and when new developments would be sensitive to the prevailing 
acoustic environment” (Paragraph: 001 Reference ID: 30-001-20140306). 
7.2.23 The PPG provides advice regarding how to determine the impact of noise, 
including whether or not a significant adverse effect or adverse effect “is 
occurring or likely to occur” and whether or not a “good standard of amenity 
can be achieved”. 
7.2.24 It provides more descriptive detail for the definitions of NOEL, LOAEL and 
SOAEL than the NPSE, but refrains from using numerical values. A summary 
of the advice given in the PPG (Paragraph: 005 Reference ID: 30-005-
20140306) is reproduced as Table 7.1.

7.2.25 The PPG (at Paragraph: 006 Reference ID: 30-006-20141224) also provides 
guidance regarding what factors influence whether noise could be a concern, 
including: 
 
Source and absolute level of the noise 
 
Time of day 
 
Number and pattern of noise events (for non-continuous sound) 
 
Frequency content of the noise 
 
General character (“i.e. whether or not the noise contains particular tonal 
characteristics or other particular features”), and 
 
Local topology and topography. 
7.2.26 Additionally, “when relevant”: 
 
The cumulative impact of multiple sources along with the extent to which 
the noise source is intermittent and of limited duration 
 
The provision of alternative ventilation if proposed mitigation relies on 
closed windows most of the time 
 
Noise Action Plans and Important Areas (as defined in the Environmental 
Noise Directive) should be taken into account 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
165 
 
 
The acoustic environment of external amenity space (if it is an intrinsic part 
of the design) should be considered, so they can be enjoyed as intended 
 
Increased potential of impact from fast food restaurants, night clubs and 
public houses, not only noise generated from within the premises but also 
the noise that may be made by customers within the vicinity. 
7.2.27 The PPG provides advice on how the adverse effects of noise can be 
mitigated. It advises that this will depend on “the type of development being 
considered and the character of the proposed location” (Paragraph: 008 
Reference ID: 30-008-20140306). Four broad classifications of mitigation are 
defined. These include: 
 
Engineering methods: Reducing the noise generated at source and/or 
containing the noise generated; 
 
Layout: Optimising the distance between the source and noise-sensitive 
receptors and/or incorporating good design to minimise noise transmission 
through the use of screening (by natural or purpose built barriers, or other 
buildings); 
 
Use of planning conditions/obligations: Restricting activities allowed onsite 
at certain times and/or specifying permissible noise levels for different time 
periods (e.g. daytime, evening and night-time), and; 
 
Mitigating: the impact on areas likely to be affected by noise including 
through noise insulation when the impact is on a building. 
7.2.28 Furthermore, it advises at Paragraph: 009 Reference ID: 30-009-20140306 
that the impact of the noise may be “partially off-set if the residents of those 
dwellings have access to: 
 
A relatively quiet façade (containing windows to habitable rooms) as part of 
their dwelling and/or 
 
A relatively quiet external amenity space for their sole use, (e.g. a garden 
or balcony). Although the existence of a garden or balcony is generally 
desirable, the intended benefits will be reduced with increasing noise 
exposure and could be such that significant adverse effects occur and/or 
 
A relatively quiet, protected, nearby external amenity space for sole use by 
a limited group of residents as part of the amenity of their dwellings, and/or, 
 
A relative quiet, protected, external publically accessible amenity space 
(e.g. a public park or a local green space designated because of its 
tranquillity) that is nearby (e.g. within a 5 minutes walking distance)”.

BS 4142:2014 Methods for rating and assessing industrial and 
commercial sound (October 2014) 
7.2.31 British Standard 4142: 2014 “Methods for rating and assessing industrial and 
commercial sound” (BS4142) describes methods for rating and assessing 
sound of an industrial and/or commercial nature. The methods described in the 
standard use outdoor sound levels to assess the likely effects of sound on 
people who might be inside or outside a dwelling or premises used for 
residential purposes upon which sound is incident.  
7.2.32 The standard is used to determine the rating levels for sources of sound of an 
industrial and/or commercial nature and the ambient, background and residual 
sound levels at outdoor locations. These levels can be used for the purposes 
of assessing sound from proposed source(s) of sound of an industrial and/or 
commercial nature. However, the determination of noise amounting to a 
nuisance is beyond the scope of the standard. 
7.2.33 The standard should not be used to assess sound from the passage of vehicles 
on public roads and railway systems; recreational activities; music and other 
entertainment; shooting grounds; construction and demolition; domestic 
animals; people; public address systems for speech and other sources falling 
within the scopes of other standards or guidance. The standard cannot be 
applied to the derivation of indoor sound levels arising from sound levels 
outside, or the assessment of indoor sound levels. 
7.2.34 The procedure contained in BS4142 assesses the significance of sound which 
depends upon the margin by which the rating level of the specific sound 
sources exceeds the background sound level and the context in which the 
sound occurs/will occur.  
7.2.35 An initial estimate of the impact of the specific sound is obtained by subtracting 
the measured background sound level from the rating level and considering 
the following: 
 
Typically, the greater this difference, the greater the magnitude of the 
impact. 
 
A difference of around +10 dB or more is likely to be an indication of a 
significant adverse impact, depending on the context. 
 
A difference of around +5 dB is likely to be an indication of an adverse 
impact, depending on the context.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
167 
 
 
The lower the rating level is relative to the measured background sound 
level, the less likely it is that the specific sound source will have an adverse 
impact or a significant adverse impact. Where the rating level does not 
exceed the background sound level, this is an indication of the specific 
sound source having a low impact, depending on the context.  
7.2.36 Where the initial estimate of the impact needs to be modified due to the 
context, the following factors should be considered:  
 
The absolute level of sound. 
 
The character and level of the residual sound compared to the character 
and level of the specific sound.  
 
The sensitivity of the receptor and whether dwellings or other premises 
used for residential purposes will already incorporate design measures that 
secure good internal and/or outdoor acoustic conditions such as: 
 Façade insulation treatment; 
 Ventilation and/or cooling that will reduce the need to have windows 
open so as to provide rapid or purge ventilation; and 
 Acoustic screening. 
BS 5228-1:2009+A1:2014 Code of practice for noise and vibration control 
on construction and open sites Part 1 Noise, (February 2014) 
7.2.37 BS 5228-1 does not provide limits for construction nose. The standard provides 
a ‘best practice guide’ for noise control and includes sound power level (Lw) 
data for individual plant as well as a calculation method for the prediction of 
noise from construction activities.  
BS 5228-2:2009+A1:2014 Code of practice for noise and vibration control 
on construction and open sites Part 2 Vibration, (June 2014) 
7.2.38 BS 5228-2 provides advice on the human response to construction vibration. 
BS 5228-2 suggests that, for construction activities, it is considered more 
appropriate to provide guidance in terms of the peak particle velocity (PPV) as 
measured outside of the building. This parameter is likely to be more routinely 
measured based upon the more usual concerns over potential building 
damage.

Therefore, operational noise

There is no accepted methodology 
for assessing the impact on footpath

is a camp site in this vicinity 
used by the sailing club which 
should be considered. 
This location has been considered in 
Section 7.7 of this assessment.

Central Bedfordshire Council 
policy states that the NOAEL, 
LOAEL and SOAEL should be 
relative standards (i.e. relative to 
the typical background noise 
levels at the time corresponding 
to the activity). 
As per, BS4142:2014, Public 
Protection would look to adopt 
levels in relation to the typical 
measured background noise 
levels 
Public Protection would look to 
BS4142:2014 which states in 
section 11 (when the difference 
between the measured 
background level and the rating 
level) that +10 dB or more is 
likely to be an indication of a 
significant adverse impact; a 
difference of + 5 dB is likely to be 
  
Criteria set out in this ES chapter are 
based on the methodology detailed 
in BS4142:2014 which requires that 
the context of the development is 
considered when undertaking any 
noise impact assessment.

Health 
Department 
CBC agree with the items 
scoped out of the assessment 
based on the information 
provided. 
 
CBC notes that the predicted 
construction noise levels in the 
report are a worst case scenario, 
however, the prediction also 
include a 10dB reduction due to 
noise attenuation through 
appropriate acoustic screens 
/enclosures in accordance with 
the CEMP. 
 
A noise level of 55dBA LAeq 1Hr 
associated with construction 
noise should be imposed on the 
Millbrook Power project in line 
with the Covanta RRF DCO.  As 
stated in the report, as a worst 
case these levels may be 
marginally exceeded if both 
Millbrook and Covanta are 
operating to their maximum at 
the same time. 
 
Further baseline monitoring at 
the nearest receptor has been 
suggested given the time that 
has elapsed since the previous 
monitoring that was undertaken 
for this application.  
 
Concerns have been raised 
regarding the derivation of the 
LOAEL and SOAEL for 
operational noise. It is proposed 
that the levels for the project are 
a LOEAL of 0 dB above 
background noise levels and a 
SOAEL of +10 dB above 
background noise levels.  
Construction noise limits are noted.  
Construction noise will be limited by 
mitigation measures outlined in the 
CEMP which will be secured by a 
Requirement attached to the DCO 
(Requirement 10). The outline 
CEMP is included in Appendix 3.2. 
 
Additional baseline monitoring at the 
nearest noise sensitive receptor has 
been undertaken within an agreed 
time period and location.  
 
The comments on the proposed 
LOAEL and SOAEL are noted. 
However, our assessment considers 
both this criteria and the context 
which the updated BS 4142:2014 
standard requires.  
Requirement 12 of the DCO 
proposes a noise scheme to be 
submitted which limits noise levels 
generated by operation of the 
Project to no greater than 
background levels.

7.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario Assessed 
7.4.1 In respect of noise and vibration, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Chapters 3 and 5 of 
this ES) is to use warranted sound power levels from the loudest Gas Turbine 
Generator type which could realistically be installed at the Project Site.  
7.4.2 The worst case scenario for the Generating Equipment has been modelled 
comprising one Gas Turbine Generator with dimensions of 50 m (length) x 13 
m (width) x 25 m (height). These dimensions represent the elements of the 
Gas Turbine Generator which could emit noise. The Gas Turbine Generator 
has a stack height of up to 35 m. The model also considers the Fin Fan 
Cooler(s) unit with dimensions of 9 m (Height) x 28 m (Length) x 14 m (Width) 
as above, these dimensions represent elements of the Fin Fan Cooler(s) which 
could emit noise.  
7.4.3 It is assumed that, as the worst case scenario, all construction activities occur 
simultaneously, although in reality this is unlikely to happen. 
7.4.4 Detailed information in relation to the noise output from the Generating 
Equipment is not available at this early stage and before procurement of the 
actual Generating Equipment to be installed. Following discussions with 
various manufacturers an initial noise impact appraisal has been undertaken 
based on the following assumptions: 
 
A sound power noise level of 106 dBA from the stack; 
 
Sound pressure levels of 75 dBA at 1 m from all façades of the Generating 
Equipment; and 
 
Sound pressure levels of 85 dBA at 1 m from all façades of the Fin Fan 
Cooler(s).   
7.4.5 
A computer noise model has been built using these parameters. It should be 
highlighted that the methodology used should be considered as worst case. 
Modelling the Generating Equipment as a box with sound power area sources 
at the walls and roof calibrated to provide the suggested sound pressure level 
is likely to overestimate the impact in the far field. Detailed assessment and 
informed design may therefore result in lower noise output levels (for instance 
by orientating ventilation openings away from the noise sensitive receptors).

Baseline Environmental Sound Survey 
7.5.4 Appendices 7.2 and 7.3 provide full details of the noise surveys, which are 
summarised here, including the instrumentation used and complete time-
history graphs of the survey results. 
7.5.5 Previous unattended environmental sound surveys were undertaken between 
14 and 18 August 2014 and 21 and 26 November 2014. Given the time which 
had passed since these initial surveys, and at the request of CBC, an additional 
environmental sound survey was undertaken over a period of 1 week from 
approximately 09:00 hours on Friday 08 September 2017 to approximately 
09:00 hours on Friday 15 September 2017 in order to determine the current 
sound climate at the closest noise sensitive receptor. 
7.5.6 During the time period 14 and 18 August 2014, an unattended environmental 
noise measurement was undertaken in the garden of South Pillinge Farm. The 
sound level meter was located approximately 6 m to the north east of the 
farmhouse with the microphone positioned approximately 1.4 m above ground 
level. 
7.5.7 During the time period 21 and 26 November 2014, unattended environmental 
noise measurements were undertaken at two locations (LTN1 and LTN2 as 
defined in Appendix 7.1). At location LTN1 the sound level meter was located 
approximately 20 m to the east of South Pillinge farmhouse with the 
microphone positioned 1.4 m above ground level. At location LTN2 the sound 
level meter was located approximately 20 m to the south east of the farmhouse 
with the microphone positioned 1.4 m above ground level 
7.5.8 During the time period 08 and 15 September 2017, unattended environmental 
sound measurements were undertaken at one position LT1. The microphone 
was located on the western boundary of the Project Site approximately 10 m 
                                                           
 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

to the east of the closest façade of South Pillinge farmhouse. The microphone 
was located at a height of approximately 1.5 m.   
7.5.9 
The approximate locations of the sound survey locations are shown in Figures 
2, 3 and 4 of Appendix 7.1. The methodology for all surveys was agreed with 
CBC.  
7.5.10 Measurements were taken continuously of the LA10,T, LA90,T, LAeq,T, and LAFmax 
sound pressure levels over 15-minute periods. Appendix 7.2 7.3 present the 
time history graphs during the environmental sound surveys.  
Construction and Decommissioning Noise 
7.5.11 Construction/decommissioning site noise is assessed differently to noise from 
permanent installations during the operational phase as it is an inevitable by-
product of required works and effects are limited in duration. Noise and 
vibration is considered for the activities associated with the construction and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection. 
7.5.12 BS 5228 provides practical information on construction noise and vibration 
reduction measures and promotes a ‘Best Practice Means’ approach to control 
noise and vibration during construction and decommissioning.  
7.5.13 The likely construction and decommissioning noise levels that may arise from 
construction of the Project have been predicted using general information 
regarding proposed activities and the methodology set out in BS 5228 Part 1 
as follows: 
 
Obtain an activity LAeq,T (by direct measurement of similar plant in the same 
mode of operation, or use the indicative plant noise sound pressure values 
provided in Annexes C and D of BS 5228 Part 1); 
 
Correct the LAeq,T for distance, ground attenuation, reflections, screening 
and on-time as applicable; and 
 
Logarithmically add the individual LAeq,T to predict the total LAeq,T at the NSR. 
7.5.14 Information regarding the noise output of specific items of plant such as an 
excavator, piling rig, steam roller, compactor and welder likely to be involved 
in the construction and decommissioning of the Project have been taken from 
the BS 5228 Part 1 database. The noise levels from all plant items have then 
been combined using the process above to assume a realistic worst case 
scenario for noise relating to the construction and decommissioning phase of 
the Project. 
7.5.15 It is assumed that, as the worst case scenario, all construction activities occur 
simultaneously, although in reality this is unlikely to happen. The shortest 
distances between a construction area and a NSR are used in the worst case 
scenario. However, the worst case scenario also considers the use of a CEMP 
including suitable, temporary sound reducing screens/enclosures around plant 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
176 
 
and activities (where possible) which provide 10 dB of noise attenuation from 
construction activities. The outline CEMP, which is to be secured via a DCO 
Requirement (10), is contained in Appendix 3.2. 
7.5.16 The final list of plant to be used and a full construction programme will not be 
known until a contractor is appointed, hence, worst case assumptions have 
been used in the assessment of construction/decommissioning noise. Annex 
C of BS 5228-1 states that the database “will apply in the majority of cases, 
but can be lower or higher due to the make and maintenance of the machines, 
their operation and the procedures adopted when work is carried out”.  
7.5.17 It is expected that the decommissioning phase of the Project will involve similar 
techniques and procedures as used during the construction phase. It is also 
noted that some elements of the Project may remain in situ at the end of the 
Project and thus reduce the impact of the decommissioning phase on NSRs. 
As a worst case assessment, it has been assumed that the noise and vibration 
levels during the decommissioning phase are the same as those during the 
construction phase. 
Construction and Decommissioning Vibration 
7.5.18 BS 5228 Part 2 provides further guidance on the perception of vibration 
resulting from construction activities within occupied buildings. This provides a 
simple method of determining annoyance alongside evaluation of cosmetic 
damage associated with vibration. 
7.5.19 Vibration, even of very low magnitude, can be perceptible to people. Vibration 
nuisance is frequently associated with the assumption that, if vibrations can be 
felt, then damage is inevitable; however, considerable greater levels of 
vibration are required to cause damage to buildings and structures, or to cause 
computers and similar electronic equipment to malfunction. Vibration 
transmitted from site construction activities to the neighbourhood can, 
therefore, cause anxiety as well as annoyance. 
7.5.20 A simple approach to quantifying the effects of vibration is to use the concept 
of peak particle velocity (PPV) as measured outside the building. BS 5228 Part 
2 suggests that, for construction activities, it is considered more appropriate to 
provide guidance in terms of the PPV, since this parameter is likely to be more 
routinely measured based upon the more usual concerns over potential 
building damage. 
7.5.21 Table 7.4 presents potential vibration levels measured in terms of PPV.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

Table 7.4 - Guidance on the Effects of Vibration (PPV) Levels 
Peak Particle Velocity 
Description

Vibration might just be perceptible in the most sensitive 
situations for most vibration frequencies associated with 
construction. At lower frequencies, people are less sensitive 
to vibration 
0.3 mm/s  
Vibration might just be perceptible in residential 
environments. 
1.0 mm/s 
It is likely that vibration of this level in residential environments 
will cause complaint, but can be tolerated if prior warning and 
explanation has been given to residents. 
10 mm/s 
Vibration is likely to be intolerable for any more than a very 
brief exposure to this level. 
7.5.22 Construction activities, in particular, may impact on adjacent buildings. The 
criteria used in this assessment relate to the potential for cosmetic, not 
structural damage. The principle concern is generally transient vibration due 
to piling. Cosmetic damage is most likely to occur within the first 20 m of piling 
activities. At greater distances damage is less likely to occur. Likely levels of 
vibration at given distances can be estimated from existing piling vibration 
data, as presented in BS 5228 Part 2.  
7.5.23 BS 7385 establishes the basic principles for carrying out vibration 
measurements and processing the data, with regard to evaluating vibration 
effects on buildings. Recommended PPV Vibration limits for transient 
excitation for different types of buildings are presented in Table 7.5.

7.5.24 When vibration experienced at structures exceeds the values shown in Table 
7.5, this would be considered a significant impact. 
Operational noise 
Road Traffic Noise 
7.5.25 There is not expected to be any significant increase in traffic during the 
operational phase of the Project associated with the Power Generation Plant, 
Gas Connection or Electrical Connection, as set out in Transport Chapter of 
this ES. Therefore noise impacts associated with operational road traffic noise 
have not been considered further in this ES. 
Power Generation Plant 
7.5.26 The assessment of operational noise at the Power Generation Plant largely 
comprises noise generated by the Generating Equipment.  
7.5.27 To undertake detailed noise calculations of the Generating Equipment, the 
noise propagation modelling software SoundPLAN version 7.4 has been used. 
The noise model considers directional and screening effects to predict the 
noise levels at the NSR locations. The effects of ground and air absorption are 
also taken into consideration. 
7.5.28 The embedded mitigation identified in Section 3.6 of this ES has been 
considered in the noise model including the location of the Generating 
Equipment and the use of acoustic enclosures around the Gas Turbine 
Generator and Fin Fan Cooler(s). These mitigation measures are likely to limit 
the operational noise from the Gas Turbine Generator and the Fin Fan 
Cooler(s) to around 75 dBA and 85 dBA at 1 m respectively. A sound power 
noise level of 106 dB coming out from the top of the stack has also been 
assessed, based on discussions with EPC contractors.  
7.5.29 The significance of the predicted operational noise effects of the Generating 
Equipment has been assessed taking into consideration guidance within BS 
4142: 2014. 
7.5.30 BS 4142 highlights the importance of applying an appropriate context when 
assessing sound from an industrial/commercial source.  
7.5.31 BS 4142 does not provide values for LOAEL and SOAEL for sound from 
commercial/industrial sources which could be used to review whether the aims 
in NPS EN-1 are met. These levels should be specific to a project and not 
generic.  Proposed levels for this Project and how these have been derived 
are therefore set out below in Table 7.6.

NB: The above are rating levels (i.e. equivalent to BS 4142 without a penalty)  
7.5.32 In order to derive the above criteria, the following factors have been taken into 
consideration: 
 
Response from CBC in 2015 set out in the Pre Application Advice: 
Consultation on Full Environmental Statement, prior to submission of NSIP 
(see Table 7.1); 
 
The level of the typical background noise level (LA90,15mins) at the nearest 
NSR (taking into account the results of the three surveys undertaken in 
different periods), level of typical background noise levels and difference 
between night-time and daytime levels; 
 
The Generating Equipment could run up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in 
any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does not exceed 
1,500 hours. For the purposes of the EIA, a worst case yearly maximum of 
2,250 running hours has been considered); 
 
The likely operating regime of the Generating Equipment (i.e. likely to be 
run during hours of peak electricity demand) which is typically during the 
daytime (e.g. outside the time when the lowest background noise levels will 
occur).  
 
The likely non-tonal nature of cumulative noise from the Generating 
Equipment; 
 
A single worst affected NSR; 
 
The location of the nearby Marston Vale Railway Line; 
 
The location of the nearby Bedford – London Railway Line; 
 
Minimal levels of operational vibration;

The location of the nearby Millbrook Proving ground; 
 
The location of windows on the NSR which do not overlook the Generating 
Equipment;  
 
Potential noise from nearby developments; 
 
The fact that the LOAEL and SOAEL levels are proposed to be external 
(e.g. outdoors) noise levels; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

 
The desirable internal noise levels for residential properties in BS 8233 and 
World Health Organisation guidelines for bedrooms being 30 dB LAeq8h 
during the night-time; and 
 
The statement in BS 8233 which maintains that a partially open window 
reduces the composite sound reduction of a façade to around 15 dB. 
Significance Criteria 
7.5.33 All NSRs identified in Table 7.3 comprise residential uses; therefore, the matrix 
based approach for significance criteria outlined in Chapter 4, has not been 
followed on the basis that the sensitivity of the receptors will be the same for 
all NSRs. The sensitivity of residential receptors is considered to be high.   
7.5.34 The significance of noise and vibration effects for construction and 
decommissioning for residential dwellings is achieved by referencing the 
values shown in Table 7.7 below, derived from BS 5228 methodology. 
7.5.35 Significance of effect levels of moderate and above are considered significant 
in respect of the EIA regulations. 
7.5.36 With respect to the NPPF/NPSE/EN-1 assessment, the proposed LOAEL 
values are considered to have a slight significance of effect and the proposed 
SOAEL values are considered to have a moderate significance of effect on a 
receptor of high sensitivity.

Items Scoped out of Assessment  
7.5.40 Table 7.9 below details the items to be scoped out of the assessments.

Justification 
Construction vibration 
Given the distances between construction works and the 
closest NSRs, it is anticipated that the level of induced 
vibration will be imperceptible at the nearest sensitive 
receptors. 
Operational traffic noise 
There are expected to be approximately 15 car trips per day 
to the Power Generation Plant (spread over 3 shifts with 
approximately 5 cars for each shift). Based on the existing 18 
hour average annual weekday traffic flows (AAWT) on Green 
Lane, this would constitute a negligible increase in noise 
level of 0.04 dB. There is expected to be less than one car 
trip per week to the Gas Connection and Electrical

Connection which is considered as no change in noise level 
on the local road network 
Footpaths 
Footpaths around the Project Site have not been considered 
in this assessment for the following reasons:  
- 
There is no known methodology for assessing the noise 
impact on footpath users;  
- 
Construction and decommissioning works are 
considered to be temporary impacts and limited in 
duration;  
- 
The intermittent nature of the operation of the Power 
Generation Plant; and 
- 
The temporary nature of footpath users passing the site. 
Electrical connection 
The Electrical Connection comprises two major components: 
the substation and the underground cable. 
Any background noise caused by corona discharge is barely 
subjectively discernible outside of the substation fence line. 
Therefore, given the distance of the substation to NSRs 
(approximately 100 m), there would be no effect from corona 
discharge on these receptors. Based on this information, 
operational noise from the Electrical Connection substation is 
considered to have neutral significance and has been scoped 
out of the need for further assessment.  
The underground cable of the Electrical Connection will not 
generate any noise as the electrical cables are wrapped in 
insulating material, buried in a trench approximately 1 m 
below ground level surrounded by well compacted backfill 
material and topped with concrete caps to prevent accidental 
damage. Operational noise from the underground cable has 
therefore been scoped out of further assessment.   
Where the underground cable meets the existing overhead 
line connection, up to two SECs are proposed. Any 
background noise caused by corona discharge on the cables 
connecting the underground line to the existing overhead line 
is barely subjectively discernible outside of the compound 
fence line.  
Operational noise associated with the re-routing of the 
existing 400kV overhead line will not cause an increase in 
noise at any of the identified NSRs. This is because the 
location is very similar (e.g. no closer to any of the NSRs) and 
it will be a single circuit in place of a double circuit, thereby 
reducing any existing noise currently produced by the 
overhead line.  
As such, operational noise from the Electrical Connection 
underground line is not considered to be significant and has 
been scoped out of the need for further assessment.

Gas Connection 
During operation, there will be small amounts of noise 
generated by the gas AGI. This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or 
‘hiss’ type of noise as the AGI regulates the flow of gas from 
the NTS to the Generating Equipment. 
This noise is rarely perceptible outside of the AGI compound. 
The nearest NSR is approximately 130 m to the west of the 
AGI, therefore, the significance of effect of operational noise 
from the AGI will be neutral. This is not considered to be 
significant.  
As the gas pipeline which connects the NTS to the Power 
Generation Plant Site is underground, the significance of 
effect due to operational noise will be neutral. This is not 
considered to be significant. 
Operational noise from the Gas Connection and AGI has 
therefore been scoped out of further assessment.   
 
Operational Vibration 
Given the distances involved between the Generating 
Equipment and NSRs (approximately 390 m to South Pillinge 
Farm which is the closest NSR), as well as the inherent 
design by gas turbine suppliers to limit vibration, it is 
anticipated that the level of induced vibration will be 
imperceptible at the nearest sensitive receptor (South Pillinge 
Farm). Additionally, it is unlikely that vibration from the 
Generating Equipment will be perceived at the Covanta RRF 
Project due to the distance and the heavy construction of the 
facility. Operational vibration impacts are thus not assessed 
further.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Existing Noise Sources 
7.6.1 
Appendices 7.2 and 7.3 provide full details of the noise surveys undertaken in 
August and November 2014 and September 2017 at South Pillinge Farm and 
Lower Farm.  
7.6.2 
The dominant environmental noise sources at the NSRs are road traffic and 
train pass-bys. 
7.6.3 
The Project Site and NSRs identified in Table 7. are bound to the east and 
west by the Midland Main Line and Marston Vale Line railways respectively.  
7.6.4 
Additionally, Station Lane, Houghton Lane, and Millbrook Road pass close to 
Pillinge Cottages, Moreteyne House and Lower Farm to the south of the 
Project Site.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

7.6.5 
The wider road network includes the A421 dual carriage way to the north west 
of the Project Site and the M1 motorway to the south west of the Project Site. 
7.6.6 
During all of the baseline noise surveys undertaken, no activity was noted at 
the Millbrook Proving Ground.  
August 2014 Environmental Sound Survey 
7.6.7 During the site visits associated with the noise survey undertaken in August 
2014 at South Pillinge Farm (survey location LTA1), the dominant noise 
sources were deemed to be distant road traffic, local wildlife and farm animals.  
November 2014 Environmental Sound Survey 
7.6.8 Construction work associated with the LLRS was underway during the 
November 2014 noise survey at South Pillinge Farm (survey location LTN1). 
Noise associated with construction plant was dominant at the commencement 
of the noise survey as work was being undertaken at the closest point to South 
Pillinge Farm. However, at completion of the noise survey, construction work 
had moved further north into the pit and benefitted from screening due to the 
LLRS earth bund. As such, construction noise was much quieter and did not 
dominate the noise climate.  
7.6.9 The survey was not abandoned due to untypical conditions as it was 
considered that the evening, weekend and night-time measurements would be 
recorded under typical conditions. Historically, noise levels measured during 
these periods are the lowest noise levels.  
7.6.10 Other noise sources noted during site visits associated with the noise survey 
at South Pillinge Farm comprised distant road traffic, trains passing by on the 
Midland Main Line, bird song and running water in the nearby brook.  
7.6.11 The survey locations at South Pillinge Farm are screened by farm buildings 
from train pass-by noise from the Marston Vale Line. Additionally, at the time 
of the surveys, trains on the Marston Vale Line only pass once an hour in each 
direction. The farmhouse also provided noise screening at the survey locations 
of typical farm activities including tractor movements in the farmyard which is 
located to the west of the farmhouse. 
7.6.12 At Lower Farm, during the November 2014 noise survey (survey location 
LTN2), the dominant noise sources were road traffic on Houghton Lane and 
train pass-bys on the Midland Main Line to the east of the survey location. 
Additionally, distant road traffic and bird song were noted. It was also noted 
that the farm buildings are used by local businesses and a mix of HGV and 
LGV deliveries occurred during site visits.  
September 2017 Survey 
7.6.13 The noise sources noted during the sound survey at South Pillinge Farm 
comprise distant road traffic, trains passing by on the Midland Main Line, bird

song and farm yard activities including tractor movements. The LLRS 
construction works were not audible at the measurement location.    
Generating Equipment 
7.6.14 The nearest NSR to the Generating Equipment is South Pillinge Farm.  
7.6.15 Noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm are expected to be quieter than 
noise levels at Pillinge Cottages due to screening and distance attenuation 
from existing noise sources including Station Road and Marston Vale Railway 
Line. As the assessment is based on the typical background noise levels 
(LA90,T), noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm have also been deemed 
representative of noise levels at Pillinge Cottages and the campsite by way of 
considering a worst case scenario. Pillinge Cottages are located approximately 
460 m to the south west of the Generating Equipment Site. Apart from this 
small pocket of dwellings it should be noted that the next noise sensitive 
receptors are Lower Farm South at around 1300 m, Manor Farm east at around 
1400 m and dwelling in Stewartby North at around 1400 m. The campsite is 
located approximately 500 m from the Generating Equipment Site.  
7.6.16 To assess construction noise, the LAeq,10h values have been determined from 
the noise surveys at the potentially affected NSRs. Table 7.10 below 
summarises the relevant noise survey results. The noise survey results are 
presented in greater detail including time history graphs of the complete data 
in Appendices 7.2 and 7.3. 
7.6.17 Weekend LAeq,10h levels are also presented due to the presence of LLRS 
construction noise during the weekdays at survey location LTN1.

7.6.18 In order to assist in the assessment of operation noise, the typical LA90,15min 
recorded during the daytime and night-time measurements at South Pillinge 
Farm are taken into consideration. The background noise levels have been 
derived by taking an arithmetic average of the typical LA90, 15 min for each 
Daytime and night time period of each day during the survey periods. Time 
history graphs for each day are provided in Appendices 7.2 and 7.3. 
7.6.19 The results of the environmental sound survey undertaken in September 2017 
have been used to derive the background noise levels at the closet noise 
sensitive receptor given that these are the most up to date and representative 
results. Table 7.11 summarises the background noise levels.

7.6.20 The typical background sound levels are around 3dB above the background 
sound levels presented in the submitted PEIR from surveys undertaken in 
2014 / 2015. There were no clearly identifiable sources of noise in the vicinity 
of the survey location that were not present during the previous surveys. It is 
therefore considered that the increase in measured background sound levels 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
187 
 
is as a result of a general increase in sound levels due to increased 
development in the area around the Project Site. The LLRS construction works 
were not audible at the measurement location and are not operational at night, 
therefore it is unlikely that the LLRS construction works have influenced the 
measured noise levels. 
Gas Connection 
7.6.21 The nearest NSRs to the Gas Connection are South Pillinge Farm, Pillinge 
Cottages and Lower Farm. South Pillinge Farm is located approximately 330 
m to the west of the Gas Connection at the closest point and Pillinge Cottages 
are located approximate 460 m to the south west of the Gas Connection at the 
closest point. Lower Farm is located approximately 130 m to the south west of 
the Gas Connection AGI at the closest point. 
7.6.22 Noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm are expected to be quieter than 
noise levels at Pillinge Cottages due to screening and distance attenuation 
from existing noise sources including Station Road and Marston Vale Railway 
Line. As the assessment is based on the typical background noise levels 
(LA90,T), noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm have also been deemed 
representative of noise levels at Pillinge Cottages by way of considering a 
worst case scenario. 
7.6.23 To assess construction noise, the LAeq,10h values have been determined from 
the noise surveys at the potentially affected NSRs. Table 7.12 below 
summarises the relevant noise survey results. The noise survey results are 
presented in greater detail including time history graphs of the complete data 
in Appendices 7.2 and 7.3.

Electrical Connection 
7.6.25 The nearest NSRs to the Electrical Connection are South Pillinge Farm, 
Pillinge Cottages and Moreteyne House.  
7.6.26 South Pillinge Farm is located approximately 90 m to the west of the Electrical 
Connection. Pillinge Cottages are located approximately 190 m to the west of 
the Electrical Connection. Moreteyne House is approximately 300 m to the 
north west of the existing transmission tower which is to be replaced as part of 
the Electrical Connection and proposed SEC(s). 
7.6.27 Noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm are expected to be quieter than 
noise levels at Pillinge Cottages and Moreteyne House due to screening and 
distance attenuation from existing noise sources including Station Road and 
Marston Vale Railway Line. As the assessment is based on the typical 
background noise levels (LA90,T), noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm 
have also been deemed representative of noise levels at Pillinge Cottages and 
Moreteyne House.  
7.6.28 It is likely that noise levels at Moreteyne House will be higher than those 
presented here as it is located immediately adjacent to the Millbrook railway 
station and overlooks Station Road and will therefore experience greater noise 
levels associated with trains arriving and departing from the station as well as 
road traffic. Therefore, the noise levels presented below are considered to 
provide a realistic worst case assessment of noise levels at Moreteyne House. 
7.6.29 To assess construction noise, the LAeq,10h values have been determined from 
the noise surveys at the potentially affected NSRs. Table 7.13 below 
summarises the relevant noise survey results. The noise survey results are 
presented in greater detail including time history graphs of the complete data 
in Appendices 7.2 and 7.3.

and small tools such as drills.

7.7.3 Assuming the worst case scenario of all construction activities occurring 
simultaneously at the closest point to the NSR, a logarithmic sum of all 
construction activities predicts an LAeq,10h of 52 dB at South Pillinge Farm and 
49 dB at Pillinge Cottages.  
7.7.4 This worst case scenario assumes a noise attenuation of 10 dB through the 
use of appropriate acoustic screens/enclosures at the construction site in 
accordance with the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.2). 
7.7.5 The significance of the effect of construction noise is therefore predicted to be 
neutral at the nearest NSRs as defined by the values in Table 7.7 (e.g. a 
daytime LAeq,10h equal to or below 55 dB). This effect is not significant.  
7.7.6 During decommissioning, similar impacts to those described for construction 
could result from, for example, plant removal or site reinstatement. However, 
it is likely that these impacts would be less, given that some items may be left 
in situ. Therefore, based on the very conservative and worst case construction 
impacts outlined above, the significance of the effect of noise impacts from the 
decommissioning phase is predicted to neutral in line with Table 7.7 (e.g. a 
daytime LAeq,10h equal to or below 55 dB). This effect is not significant.  
Construction Traffic 
7.7.7 The peak construction traffic movements are predicted to comprise 125 HGV 
deliveries per day for concrete pouring and 40 cars per day.  
7.7.8 The predicted LAeq,10h at the NSR closest to the Access Road (the Campsite) 
due to peak construction plant movements would be 45 dB without the 
provision of any screening. The significance of effect is deemed to be neutral 
as defined by the values in Table 7.7 (e.g. a daytime LAeq,10h equal to or below 
55 dB). However, this worst case scenario would only occur for one to two 
days during the construction period.  
7.7.9 Over the course of the entire construction period, the average number of 
construction vehicles comprises 31 HGV movements and 31 car movements 
per day.  
7.7.10 The predicted LAeq,10h at the NSR closest to the Access Road (the Campsite) 
due to average construction plant movements would be 39 dB (without the 
provision of screening). This is considered to be of neutral significance as 
defined by the values in Table 7.7 (e.g. a daytime LAeq,10h equal to or below 55 
dB). 
7.7.11 In both situations, the effect of noise due to construction traffic at the Campsite 
would not be significant.

Operation

7.7.12 Details of the assessment of the potential noise impact associated with the 
operation of the Power Generation plant are presented in Appendix 7.3. The 
results of the assessment are summarised below.  
7.7.13 The computer noise model used to undertake the assessment includes the 
topography of the Rookery pits post LLRS works.  
7.7.14 Table 7.15 presents the calculated rating level of the Generating Equipment at 
the closest noise sensitive receptor.

7.7.17 Calculations indicate that the rating level associated with the operation of the 
Generating Equipment is likely to fall below the background sound level at 
South Pillinge Farm by approximately 8 dB during the daytime and 1 dB during 
the night-time.  With reference to BS4142 this is an indication of the specific 
sound source having a low impact and therefore not significant, depending on 
the context.  
7.7.18 It is noted that for this assessment, there are several contextual factors which 
should be taken into consideration as follows: 
 
The Generating Equipment could run up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in 
any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does not exceed 
1,500 hours. For the purposes of the EIA, a worst case yearly maximum of 
2,250 running hours has been assessed); 
 
The likely operating regime of the Generating Equipment (i.e. likely to be 
run during hours of peak electricity demand which is typically during the 
daytime (e.g. outside the time when the lowest background noise levels will 
occur).  
 
The likely non-tonal nature of cumulative noise from the Generating 
Equipment; 
 
A single worst affected NSR; 
 
The location of the nearby Marston Vale Railway Line; 
 
The location of the nearby Bedford – London Railway Line; 
 
Minimal levels of operational vibration; 
 
The location of the nearby proving ground; 
 
The location of windows on the NSR which do not overlook the Generating 
Equipment; and 
 
Potential noise from nearby developments. 
7.7.19 The above contextual factors confirm the assessment of a low, and therefore 
not significant impact.

7.7.23 General site activities include the provision of power generation for flood lights 
and small tools such as drills. 
7.7.24 Assuming the worst case scenario of all construction activities associated with 
the substation and underground cable connection and temporary electrical 
connection works occurring simultaneously at the closest points to the NSRs, 
the predicted LAeq,10h is 61 dB at South Pillinge Farm, 60 dB at Pillinge Cottages 
and 54 dB at Moreteyne House.  
7.7.25 This worst case scenario assumes a noise attenuation of 10 dB through the 
use of appropriate acoustic screens/enclosures at the construction site in 
accordance with the CEMP (Appendix 3.2). 
7.7.26 The significance of the effect of construction noise is therefore predicted to be 
slight at South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge Cottages and neutral at Moreteyne 
House as defined by the values in Table 7.7. These effects are not considered 
to be significant.  
7.7.27 During decommissioning, similar impacts to those described for construction 
could result from, for example, plant removal or site reinstatement. However, 
it is likely that these impacts would be less, given that some items may be left 
in situ. Therefore, based on the very conservative and worst case construction 
impacts outlined above, the significance of the effect of noise impacts from the 
decommissioning phase is predicted to be slight at South Pillinge Farm and 
Pillinge Cottages and neutral at Moreteyne House. These effects are not 
considered to be significant.    
Gas Connection 
Construction and Decommissioning 
7.7.28 Two scenarios have been considered for the assessment of construction noise 
for the Gas Connection. The first scenario comprises digging a trench along 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
195 
 
the entire gas pipeline route then returning to lay the Pipeline. The second 
scenario comprises a rolling construction programme where a section of trench 
is dug and the Pipeline laid beginning at one end of the route and progressing 
towards the other end of route. The second scenario is considered to be the 
realistic worst case with regards to construction noise as a greater number of 
plant items would be required to be in use during each section of the 
programme.  
7.7.29 Table 7.20 provides the likely noise levels generated by typical construction 
activities associated with the Gas Connection and predicts the likely noise level 
contributed by each item of plant at the nearest NSR.

7.7.30 General site activities include the provision of power generation for flood lights 
and small tools such as drills. 
7.7.31 Assuming the worst case scenario of all construction activities occurring 
simultaneously at the closest points to the NSR, the predicted LAeq,10h is 51 dB 
at South Pillinge Farm, 48 dB at Pillinge Cottages and 59 dB at Lower Farm.  
7.7.32 This worst case scenario assumes a noise attenuation of 10 dB through the 
use of appropriate acoustic screens/enclosures at the construction site in 
accordance with the CEMP (Appendix 3.2). 
7.7.33 The significance of the effect of construction noise is therefore predicted to be 
neutral at South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge Cottages and slight at Lower Farm 
as defined by the values in Table 7.7 (e.g. a daytime LAeq,10h equal to or below 
55 dB). These effects are not considered to be significant.  
7.7.34 During decommissioning, similar impacts to those described for construction 
could result from, for example, plant removal or site reinstatement. However, 
it is likely that these impacts would be less, given that some items may be left 
in situ. Therefore, based on the very conservative and worst case construction

impacts outlined above, the significance of the effect of noise impacts from the 
decommissioning phase is predicted to neutral at South Pillinge Farm and 
Pillinge Cottages and slight at Lower Farm. These effects are not considered 
to be significant. 
The Project 
7.7.35 Table 7.21 presents the effects of construction noise on the NSRs based in the 
worst case assessment. In this assessment, it is assumed that all construction 
work associated with each individual construction activities (Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection) assessed above occur 
simultaneously.

7.7.36 The significance of effect of construction noise based on the worst case

7.7.37 During decommissioning, similar impacts to those described for construction 
could result from, for example, plant removal or site reinstatement. However, 
it is likely that these impacts would be less, given that some items may be left 
in situ. Therefore, based on the very conservative and worst case construction 
impacts outlined above, the significance of the effect of noise impacts from the 
decommissioning phase is also given in Table 7.21. These effects are not 
considered to be significant.

7.8 
Assessment of Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Construction 
7.8.1 It is considered that, due to distance attenuation, only the Covanta RRF Project 
and the integrated waste management facilities at Rookery South Pit have the 
potential to have a cumulative effect with the Project in terms of construction 
noise from the developments listed in section 4.10.  
7.8.2 However, the integrated waste management facility is currently only a very 
high level concept with a scoping report submitted six months after the date 
that the Covanta RRF Project DCO came into force and hence no detailed 
noise data is available. It is not considered likely that the integrated waste 
management facility will be constructed at the same time as this Project. 
7.8.3 Based on requirement 17 of the Covanta RRF Project DCO, a construction 
noise limit at South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge Cottages for this scheme has 
been set as 55 dB LAeq,1h.  
7.8.4 It is possible that construction works associated with the Covanta RRF project 
and the Project may occur concurrently.  Assuming that the Covanta RRF 
project meets its construction noise limit (55 dB) and assuming that all 
elements of the Project are constructed simultaneously, as per Table 7.21, the 
total sound level at noise sensitive receptors due to construction noise could 
be up to 63 dB (a 8 dB difference when compared to the individual limits). 
7.8.5 However, it should be noted that the above assumes an absolute worst case 
scenario of all construction activities for both projects happening at the same 
time.  
7.8.6 Based on the significance of effects scale in Table 7.7 the significance of noise 
effects from cumulative construction impacts from both schemes is considered 
to be slight and therefore not significant.   
Operation 
7.8.7 The DCO granted for the Covanta RRF Project sets out the operational noise 
limits at NSRs provided in Table 7.22.

7.8.8 Based on the information set out above a cumulative noise assessment has 
been undertaken using the calculated rating level of the Generating Equipment 
set out in Table 7.16 together with the operational noise levels specified for the 
Covanta RRF project in Table 7.22. The assessment is presented below in 
Table 7.23.

Indication of the specific 
sound source having a low 
impact, depending on the 
context 
 
7.8.9 Calculations indicate that the cumulative rating level associated with the 
operation of both the Generating Equipment and the Covanta RRF project is 
likely to be around 1 dB above background sound levels at South Pillinge Farm 
during the night-time and -4 dB below the background sound levels during the 
daytime.   
7.8.10 With reference to BS4142 this is an indication of the specific sound source 
having a low impact, depending on the context. In considering the context of 
the application, as set out in paragraph 7.7.19 above, this re-affirms the 
assessment of a low, and therefore not significant impact.  
7.8.11 A comparison of the calculated rating level with the LOAEL and SOAEL 
identified in this ES chapter, indicates that the cumulative rating levels 
associated with the operation of the Project and the Covanta RRF project are 
likely to fall below the proposed LOAEL and therefore any effects are not 
anticipated be significant. 
7.9 
Mitigation and Assessment of Residual Effects 
Construction / Decommissioning 
7.9.1 In order to keep noise impacts from the construction/decommissioning phase 
to a minimum, all construction activities relating to the Power Generation Plant, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be carried out in accordance 
with the recommendations of BS 5228 (as stated in the CEMP), along with the 
embedded mitigation measures outlined in Chapter 3.6.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
 
199 
 
Operation 
7.9.2 Assessment of the operational noise levels associated with the  Generating 
Equipment suggest that the potential noise impact is likely to fall below the 
proposed LOAELs.  
7.9.3 No additional mitigation over and above the embedded measures outlined in 
section 3.6 and the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.2) is therefore required to limit 
noise levels.  
7.9.4 Based on the assessment presented above, and taking into consideration the 
contextual factors presented, we would suggest that a Requirement is attached 
to the DCO which states: 
“Control of noise during operation 
 12.—(1) Prior to the date of final commissioning a written noise scheme 
providing for the control of noise generated during the operation of the 
authorised development must be submitted to and approved by the relevant 
planning authority. The noise scheme must include the following: 
 (a) the locations at which noise will be monitored; 
(b) the defined representative background sound level at South Pillinge Farm 
house; 
(c) the method of noise measurement (which must be in accord with BS 
4142:2014, an equivalent successor standard or other agreed noise 
measurement methodology appropriate to the circumstances) and when such 
measurements will be carried out; and 
(d) a complaints procedure. 
 (2) Except in the case of an emergency, noise (in terms of the BS 4142:2014 
rating level) emitted from the operation of the authorised development must 
be no greater than the defined representative background sound level as 
approved in the noise scheme submitted pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) 
 (3) The noise scheme must be carried out as approved”.  
7.9.5 If any abnormal operations occur which lead to noise levels in excess of any 
agreed planning limits (e.g. any equipment malfunction), the operator will 
inform the local authority and residents of the reasons for these operations, 
and the anticipated emergency period. 
7.10 Residual Effects 
7.10.1 During operation, the cumulative residual effect would remain as not 
significant.

7.12 Conclusions  
7.12.1 The dominant environmental noise sources currently at the NSRs are road 
traffic on the local and national road networks, and train pass-bys from the 
Marston Vale Line and Midland Main Line railways.  
7.12.2 Three environmental noise surveys have been undertaken. The first noise 
survey was undertaken in August 2014 at South Pillinge Farm for four days 
including a weekend. The second noise survey was undertaken in November 
2014 at South Pillinge Farm and Lower Farm for a duration of five days 
including a weekend. Construction noise associated with the LLRS works was 
present during the November 2014 survey at South Pillinge Farm however the 
survey was not aborted as evening, weekend and night-time noise levels at 
this location were deemed to be representative of typical conditions at this 
location. Given the time elapsed since these initial surveys, and at the request 
of CBC an additional environmental sound survey was undertaken over a 
period of 1 week from approximately 09:00 hours on Friday 08 September 
2017 to approximately 09:00 hours on Friday 15 September 2017. 
7.12.3 LOAEL 
and 
SOAEL 
levels 
have 
been 
proposed 
for 
construction/decommissioning and operational noise based on the context of 
the site following the guidance of BS 4142, NPPF, NPSE and NPS EN-1. 
Factors considered in order to derive the adverse effect levels include (but are 
not limited to) the noise survey results, the number of NSRs in the vicinity of 
the noise source, existing noise sources, and the characteristics of the 
proposed noise sources (including the intermittent and temporary nature of 
operation). 
7.12.4 Worst case assessments of construction/decommissioning noise have been 
undertaken based on the assumption that all noise generating construction 
plant associated with a construction site are operating at the same time at the 
closest point of the site to the nearest NSR. In all cases, the significance of 
effect was no greater than slight and is thus not considered to be significant. It 
is unlikely that the situation assessed as the worst case will occur in practice.  
7.12.5 An assessment of the operational noise from the Gas Turbine Generator has 
been undertaken with the aid of the noise modelling software SoundPLAN 7.4.  
7.12.6 The results of the noise modelling indicate that the rating level associated with 
the operation of the Generating Equipment is likely to fall below the 
background sound level at South Pillage Farm by approximately 8 dB during 
the daytime and 1 dB during the night-time.  With reference to BS4142 this is 
an indication of the specific sound source having a low, and therefore not 
significant impact, depending on the context. The context described above in 
paragraph 7.7.19 further confirms the conclusion of a low and not significant 
impact.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
208 
 
7.12.7 
It is possible that construction works associated with the Covanta RRF project 
and the Project may occur concurrently.  Assuming that the Covanta RRF 
project meets its respective noise limits (55 dB) assuming that all elements of 
the Project are constructed simultaneously, as per Table 7.21 the total sound 
level at noise sensitive receptors due to construction noise could be up to 62 
dB (a 7 dB difference when compared to the individual limits). 
7.12.8 
However, it should be noted that the above assumes an absolute worst case 
scenario of all construction activities for both projects happening at the same 
time.  
7.12.9 
Based on the significance of effects scale in Table 7.6, the significance of noise 
effects from cumulative construction impacts from both schemes is considered 
to be slight and therefore not significant.  
7.12.10 A comparison of the calculated rating level with the LOAEL and SOAEL 
identified in this ES chapter, indicates that the cumulative rating levels 
associated with the operation of the Generating Equipment and the Covanta 
RRF Project are likely to fall below the proposed LOAEL and therefore 
cumulative noise levels would not be significant. 
7.12.11 Based on the assessment presented above, and taking into consideration the 
contextual factors presented, the following text has been included as a 
Requirement in the draft DCO (Requirement 12 of Document Reference 3.1) 
submitted with the Application: 
“Control of noise during operation 
 12.—(1) Prior to the date of final commissioning a written noise scheme 
providing for the control of noise generated during the operation of the 
authorised development must be submitted to and approved by the relevant 
planning authority. The noise scheme must include the following: 
 (a) the locations at which noise will be monitored; 
(b) the defined representative background sound level at South Pillinge Farm 
house; 
(c) the method of noise measurement (which must be in accord with BS 
4142:2014, an equivalent successor standard or other agreed noise 
measurement methodology appropriate to the circumstances) and when such 
measurements will be carried out; and 
(d) a complaints procedure. 
 (2) Except in the case of an emergency, noise (in terms of the BS 4142:2014 
rating level) emitted from the operation of the authorised development must 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

be no greater than the defined representative background sound level as 
approved in the noise scheme submitted pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) 
 (3) The noise scheme must be carried out as approved”.

8 Ecology 
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 This Chapter presents the assessment of likely significant ecological effects 
arising from the construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of 
the Project.  
8.1.2 The Project has the potential to result in: indirect noise and vibration 
disturbance to species, including protected species; loss, disturbance and/or 
fragmentation of habitat and hedgerows; disturbance effects associated with 
lighting proposals to bats and other nocturnal species; and indirect air quality 
effects on retained County Wildlife Site (CWS) habitats within the Rookery Clay 
Pit associated with dust and particulate matter emissions.  
8.2 
Legislation and Policy Context

SoS Scoping Opinion 
3.46 
Need to consider protecting and 
enhancing biodiversity and habitats 
and species processes within the site 
and surrounding area. 
The SoS notes the recommendations 
in the extended phase 1 habitat survey 
for further surveys either on the Project 
site or in the vicinity of the site for: 
bats, badger, water voles, GCN, 
breeding birds, reptiles and terrestrial 
and aquatic invertebrates.  
Agreed and this has been addressed 
in Section 8.9 which outlines mitigation 
measures.  
 
 
The results of these further surveys 
are presented in appendices 8.1-8.5. 
The need for aquatic invertebrate 
surveys has been scoped out of 
assessment following further detailed 
study of the Project Site and 
refinement of the red line.  
3.48 
Inconsistency between number of 
SSSIs in para 5.5.5 and Appendix 1 of 
the Scoping Report 
There are seven SSSIs within 5 km of 
the Project Site, and one SSSI within 
2km of the Project Site which is correct 
and set out in Section 8.6 of this ES. 
3.48 
Study areas should be clearly defined 
for each species. 
This has been included in Section 8.5 
of this ES. 
3.49 
Stage of LLRS at submission of DCO 
and how this relates to ecology should 
be defined. 
The baseline is defined in Section 8.5 
of this ES, and the stage of completion 
of the LLRS is discussed at section 
3.1. The baseline is defined in relation 
to Ecology at Section 8.6.  The 
approach to defining the baseline has 
been discussed and agreed with 
Natural England (email dated 
12.09.14, S42 response dated 
06.07.17, and email dated 10.08.17) 
and CBC (email dated 03.09.14 and

NE are concerned that if the great 
crested newt (GCN) exclusion fence 
(that was part of the licence 2014-
1762-EPS-MIT-1) as part of previous 
translocation work fence is taken down 
before the DCO works commence then 
there is likelihood that GCNs may 
access the site. We require further 
information as to why it is considered 
that no further surveys for GCNs are 
required. 
Through the commitment under The 
Rookery South (Resource Recovery 
Facility) Order 2011, to amend licence 
2014-1762-EPS-MIT-1 in order to 
retain GCN exclusion fencing until 
2020; it is assumed that GCN will 
remain absent from the footprint of the 
proposed Power Generation Plant prior 
to the start of construction, and as 
such, no further GCN surveys in 
relation to works in this area of the 
Project Site, are considered to be 
necessary. Furthermore, if for any 
reason, there are delays in the 
construction programme for either the 
Covanta Scheme and/ or the MPL 
Project, there is assurance that GCN 
will remain excluded from the 
development footprint through relevant

clauses in the Land Option Agreement 
between MPL (the Applicant) and O&H 
(landowner). 
Given that construction is due to 
commence six years after the 2014 
great crested newt surveys were 
completed; pre-commencement 
surveys may be required to confirm the 
management and/or mitigation 
measures required in relation to the 
proposed re-surfacing of the access 
road, and the installation of the gas 
and electrical connections which can 
be expected to be implemented 
through the CEMP. Great crested 
newts have not been excluded from 
these areas of the Project Site which 
support suitable habitat for this 
species. If necessary, any such 
surveys would be completed prior to 
construction.  
Whilst the existing 2014 survey data is 
sufficient to underpin the assessment 
in this ES; the purpose of such pre-
commencement surveys would be to 
provide up to date survey data (for 
2019/ 2020) to inform any necessary 
management measures to be 
implemented during construction in 
2020, to avoid a breach in the 
legislative protection afforded to great 
crested newts.

We note the presence of other 
protected species including bats and 
badgers within the proposal area. 
Should the development involve a 
requirement for any protected species 
licences to be issued by Natural 
England it is important that the details 
are agreed with us at an early stage, to 
ensure that Letters of No Impediment 
can be issued with submission. 
Noted. However, at this stage, there is 
not considered to be any requirement 
for protected species licences to be

The need to demonstrate achieving a

the Project (in accordance with 
National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF)) was raised as an issue to be 
addressed in the EIA process. 
 
Confirmation obtained that CBC is in 
agreement with the approach to 
determining the baseline.  
This has been taken into account in 
the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
and Management Strategy (LEMMS) 
(Appendix 11.3). Planting within the 
Order limits but some distance from 
the Generating Equipment Site is 
proposed which has been designed to 
ensure value for biodiversity is 
maximised, whilst performing a 
landscape screening function.  In 
addition a new pond is proposed, 
which would also be of value for 
biodiversity.  Given the negligible 
nature conservation value of the 
habitats affected as a result of the 
Project, it is anticipated that the 
creation of a new pond and structurally 
diverse and species-rich areas of 
planting, to reflect the species 
composition within the wider Marston 
Vale Forest, would be expected to 
result in a net gain in biodiversity.

Cumulative Impact 
The NPS EN-1 states that when 
considering cumulative effects, the ES 
should provide information on how the 
effects of the applicant’s proposal 
would combine and interact with the 
effects of other development (including 
projects for which consent has been 
sought or granted, as well as those 
already in existence). 
It is not apparent that the additional 
impacts of the Covanta Energy from 
Waste plant, which has consent 
granted, have been taken into account. 
In some instances, the combined 
impact could have a greater impact on 
the range of species identified. 
Agreed. Additional details on the 
consideration of cumulative effects in 
relation to the Covanta RRF Project 
have been added to Section 8.8 of this 
ES. 
Pre-application

dated 21st 
October 2015) 
 
The Net Gain for Biodiversity 
Table 8.2 details the ecological 
receptors and applies a level of 
consideration/importance (local, parish 
etc.). This states that in many 
instances that they will be considered 
as an “…‘other ecological receptor’ 
requiring appropriate management to 
avoid breach of legislation”. However, 
the NPS EN-1 states that ‘the applicant 
should show how the project has taken 
advantage of opportunities to conserve 
and enhance biodiversity and 
geological conservation interests’. This 
would go beyond action to avoid 
breach of legislation and should 
demonstrate consideration of 
enhancement opportunities more 
clearly. 
Agreed. Biodiversity enhancement 
opportunities have been incorporated 
in the LEMMS for the scheme 
(Appendix 11.3) which will benefit 
these ‘other’ ecological features. 
Planting within the Order Limits but 
some distance from the Generating 
Equipment Site is proposed which has 
been designed to ensure value for 
biodiversity is maximised, whilst 
performing a landscape screening 
function.  Tree and shrub planting will 
provide nesting and foraging resources 
for breeding birds. In addition, a new 
pond is proposed, which would also be 
of value for biodiversity including newts 
and reptiles such as grass snake.  
Given the negligible nature 
conservation value of the habitats 
affected as a result of the Project, it is 
anticipated that the creation of a new 
pond and structurally diverse and 
species-rich areas of planting, to 
reflect the species composition within

Pre-application 
advice (letter 
dated 21st 
October 2015) 
 
It is noted that the proposal will deliver 
ponds to increase the wetland habitat, 
as well as planting and reinstating tree 
and hedgerow habitat. The applicant 
should investigate further opportunities 
e.g. for enhanced grassland, ditches 
as well as opportunities linked to the 
built development itself. 
The outline LEMMS is set out in 
Appendix 11.3.  
The surface water management 
ditches have been incorporated into 
the LEMMS. These wetland features 
will be managed to enhance their 
biodiversity value. The strategy also 
includes the creation of wildflower 
grassland areas. 
 
Pre-application 
advice (letter 
dated 21st 
October 2015) 
 
It is noted that the draft CEMP will 
relate to landscape and ecological 
mitigation strategy, given that the 
works will not commence prior to 2017 
further survey updates will be required. 
The report accepts that habitats will 
continue to evolve during the 
intervening period and one would 
expect the mitigation strategy will need 
to be informed by up to date ecological 
information. 
Agreed. Updated surveys may be 
required to refine the management 
measures required and/ or it may be 
appropriate to adopt a precautionary 
approach.

Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
8.4.1 Modelling was undertaken based on manufacturer specific emission rates and 
flue gas parameters for a Gas Turbine Generator considered representative of 
a ‘worst case’ emissions profile from several potential makes and models of 
Gas Turbine Generators. This was required in order to identify the realistic 
worst case option for the Power Generation Plant.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
219 
 
8.4.2 Stack height sensitivity testing has revealed that a minimum stack height of 
32.5m would be required to achieve adequate dispersion of emissions to meet 
relevant air quality standards under the IED. Any higher stack than 32.5 m 
would result in a better dispersion of emissions and therefore lower impacts on 
sensitive ecological receptors. For this reason, a 32.5m stack is considered a 
realistic worst case scenario in relation to dispersion of emissions and 
associated ground level concentrations of pollutants that have potential effects 
on sensitive ecological receptors. Further discussion is provided in Chapter 6. 
8.5 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
8.5.1 The Project has the potential to have direct and indirect ecological effects. The 
distance of some ecological features from the Project Site and the mobility of 
others are such that ecological impacts have the potential to occur at some 
distance from the Project Site. For the purposes of this Ecology Chapter of this 
ES, the study area has been split into the following distinct areas as described 
in Section 1.1:  
 
Power Generation Plant Site; 
 
Electrical Connection; and 
 
Gas Connection. 
8.5.2 Additionally, the wider study area is defined as the area within 1 km of the 
Project Site in relation to desk study information on protected / notable species 
and non-statutory designated sites; and any nationally and internationally 
statutory designated sites within 2 km and 10 km of the Project Site, 
respectively (as explained further in paragraph 8.5.3, below). 
8.5.3 The assessment of direct impacts of the Project is limited to the Project Site as 
no land outside of the Project Site will be directly disturbed. However, the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the potential 
to result in indirect impacts on some ecological features, primarily as a result 
of changes to air quality and chemical deposition rates, in the wider area. The 
significance of these more distant potential impacts is therefore considered 
with reference to internationally designated sites within 10km and national 
statutory nature conservation sites (Appendix 8.1, Figure 1b) within 2 km of the 
Project Site, in accordance with criteria in the EA’s ‘Air Emissions Risk 
Assessment for your Environmental Permit’ guidance.  In addition, the potential 
for impacts on non-statutory designated sites within 2km of the Project Site 
has also been assessed (see section 8.7 and: Chapter 6 (Air Quality)).    
Desk Study 
8.5.4 Existing data in relation to the Project Site and the wider study area were 
obtained during 2014 in order to secure a better understanding of the 
ecological context of the Project Site. Biological records in relation to statutory 
and non-statutory nature conservation sites within 2 km of the Project Site 
boundary, were obtained from Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
220 
 
and Monitoring Centre (BRMC). Records and other information in relation to 
protected and notable species were also obtained from BRMC up to 2 km from 
the Project Site boundary. On-line resources, including data available through 
the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside website 
(www.magic.gov.uk) complemented information obtained from BRMC.  This 
information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work 
undertaken by BSG Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, including land 
within and immediately north of the survey area (PBA, 2009; BSG Ecology 
2013); see Appendices 8.1 and 8.3.  
8.5.5 Up to date information on the boundary of Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife 
Site (which lies within the Project Site) has been obtained from BRMC in April 
2017 and the boundary has been confirmed to be unchanged since 2014. 
Field Surveys 
8.5.6 A wide range of habitat and protected or notable species surveys were 
undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 to inform this assessment. The 
information below confirms the field surveys that have been undertaken, their 
timing and the extent of the study area relevant to each survey type.  It is noted 
that the Project Site as defined in the original 2014 Scoping Report covered a 
larger area than the current Project Site (the original Project Site boundary is 
shown within the Scoping Report and Scoping Opinion in Appendix 1.2).  
 
Extended Phase 1 habitat survey - February 2014 and updated throughout 
the survey season. The study area was the Project Site as that term was 
defined in the Project Scoping Report (see Appendix 8.1, Figure 2);  
 
Terrestrial invertebrate surveys between May and September 2014. Habitat 
within the Project Site (as that term was defined in the Project Scoping 
Report) assessed as having potential to support a valued invertebrate 
assemblage was surveyed (see Appendix 8.2, Figure 1); 
 
Great crested newt surveys (between mid-April and mid-June 2014); ponds 
within the Project Site and within 250 m of the Project Site (as that term was 
defined in the Project Scoping Report) were surveyed (see Appendix 8.3, 
Figure 1); 
 
Reptile surveys (between end-April and late-August 2014); suitable habitat 
within the Project Site (as that term was defined in the Project Scoping 
Report) was surveyed (see Appendix 8.3, Figure 3); 
 
Breeding bird surveys (April, May and June 2014) the Project Site (as that 
term was defined in the Project Scoping Report), plus a 50 m buffer were 
surveyed (see Appendix 8.4, Figures 1 to 3); 
 
Bat activity survey (May, July and September 2014); transects in the north 
and south of the Project Site (as that term was defined in the Project 
Scoping Report) were undertaken (see Appendix 8.5, Figure 2a and 2b);

on 4th April 2017 of the Project Site. This updated the previous Phase 1 habitat 
survey information, confirming the nature and extent of the habitats now 
present within the Project Site. The current suitability of the habitats for which 
species specific surveys were previously undertaken was re-assessed in order 
to determine any requirement for existing survey information to be updated so 
as to define an adequate baseline for assessment.   
Impact Assessment 
8.5.9 This ecological assessment has been undertaken having regard to guidance 
set out in the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management’s 
(CIEEM) Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (2016) (‘the CIEEM 
Guidelines’). The CIEEM Guidelines state that ‘EcIA is a process of identifying, 
quantifying and evaluating the potential effects of development-related or other 
proposed actions on habitats, species and ecosystems’. It requires an 
assessment of likely significant effects on important ecological features, and 
as such, does not require consideration of effects on every species or habitat 
that may be present within the Project Site. 
8.5.10 In order to determine whether there are likely to be significant effects, it is first 
necessary to identify whether an ecological feature is ‘important’, and therefore 
whether an effect upon it could be significant, and thus, material in decision-
making. To achieve this, where possible, animal species and their populations 
have been valued on the basis of a combination of their rarity, status and 
distribution, using contextual information where it exists. Habitats and plant 
communities have been evaluated against existing selection criteria, wherever 
possible (such as those developed to aid the designation of SSSIs or non-
statutory designated sites).  
8.5.11 This assessment examines effects on important ecological features with 
reference to the extent, magnitude, duration, timing, frequency, and 
reversibility of the impacts. For each ecological feature within the relevant 
study area, the baseline is identified and evaluated.  For each important 
ecological feature, relevant impacts are characterised; effects defined and 
their significance assessed; mitigation identified and residual impacts reported. 
This exercise is performed for each phase of the Project.

Determining the Importance of Ecological Features 
8.5.12 The importance of each ecological feature within the Study Area has been 
determined having regard to a number of contributory factors relating to 
conservation value. 
8.5.13 The CIEEM Guidelines recognise that determining importance is a complex 
process, which is a matter of professional judgement guided by the importance 
and relevance of a number of factors. These include designation and 
legislative protection as well as biodiversity value, potential value and 
secondary/supporting value. Consideration of each ecological feature having 
regard to these factors allows their importance to be determined, with 
reference to the geographic context set out below: 
 
International and European; 
 
National; 
 
Regional (East of England); 
 
County (Bedfordshire); and 
 
Local (Bedford Borough and Central Bedfordshire). 
8.5.14 Once the importance of each ecological feature that will potentially be affected 
by the Project has been determined, those features that are deemed to be 
important, and therefore require full consideration in the impact assessment, 
are identified. These features are those that are important within a ‘Local’ 
context or above. This approach allows exclusion of those ecological features 
that are of less than ‘Local’ importance i.e. those that may be considered to be 
important only within the context of the parish/ neighbourhood or Project Site. 
Establishing Potential Air Quality Effects 
8.5.15 The potential for impacts on sensitive ecological features, as a result of an 
increase in NOx either during the construction/ decommissioning or 
operational phase of the Project has been addressed in Chapter 6 of this ES.   
8.5.16 An assessment of the deposition of nutrient nitrogen and the acidity due to 
nitrogen as a result of operation of the Power Generation Plant has been 
undertaken in accordance with the EA guidance “AQTAG 06 - Technical 
Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate assessment for 
emissions to air” (2010).  
8.5.17 Critical loads (to be used as standards for the assessment of significance) 
have been obtained from the Air Pollution Information System (APIS) (see 
section 6.5 of this ES). The assessment has shown that the predicted nitrogen 
and acid deposition rates are insignificant when compared to the critical loads 
for the habitats under consideration (see Section 6.7 in Chapter 6 of this ES).  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
223 
 
Determining Significance  
8.5.18 The CIEEM guidelines state that an effect should be determined as being 
significant when it ‘either supports or undermines biodiversity conservation 
objectives for important ecological features’. It relates to the weight that should 
be afforded to effects when decisions are made, and to the consequences, in 
terms of legislation, policy and/or development control. So, a significant 
negative effect on a feature of importance at one level would be likely to trigger 
related planning policies and, if permissible at all, generate the need for 
development control mechanisms, such as planning conditions or legal 
obligations, as described in those policies. In determining significance, 
consideration is given to aspects of the structure and function of designated 
sites and habitats, the conservation status of species, and the likely resilience 
of ecological features to change. 
8.5.19 An effect on an important ecological feature may be significant at the same 
geographic scale at which the feature is determined to be important (see 
Section 8.5.13), or at a lesser geographical scale, depending on the 
characterisation of the impact. By way of example, limited impacts on a 
woodland of county importance might be assessed as being significant at a 
local level of importance. This methodology supports an evidence based 
approach and supersedes and replaces the matrix-based assessment 
methodologies outlined in Tables 4.1-4.3 (Chapter 4) of this ES. 
8.5.20 The mitigation/ compensation response to a significant effect relates directly 
to the geographic scale at which the effect is considered to be significant. As 
such, an effect which is significant at a national level can be expected to 
generate objectives and actions designed to mitigate/ compensate at a 
national scale. 
Assumptions and Limitations 
8.5.21 The assumptions used in this Chapter of the ES are as per section 4.8. It is 
assumed that the footprint of the Generating Equipment Site will be left free of 
ecological constraints following the re-profiling of the pit during the LLRS.  This 
is because the LLRS includes measures (such as newt fencing) to keep 
ecological features out of the pit. It is assumed that the LLRS will be completed 
before construction of the Project commences, as described in Section 3.1. It 
is also assumed that the herpetofauna exclusion fencing will remain in place 
in the intervening period to the start of construction of the Project, and that the 
base of the pit will be free of ecological constraints. The mechanism for this is 
through a commitment under The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011, to amend licence 2014-1762-EPS-MIT-1 in order to retain 
exclusion fencing in situ until 2020; as well as through relevant clauses in the 
Land Option Agreement between MPL (Applicant) and O&H (landowner).   
8.5.22 The Project Site as defined at Scoping comprised a larger area than that 
assessed within this ES, but did not include an arable field at the southern 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
224 
 
extent of the Project Site. This arable field and surrounding hedgerows was 
therefore not included in the survey area for the species-specific surveys 
undertaken in 2014. However, the update survey carried out in April 2017 
included a walkover survey of this additional area, and it was considered to 
support similar habitats as those surveyed in 2014. Similar numbers and 
assemblages of species can therefore be expected in this additional area as 
those recorded within the 2014 survey area, and this has been assumed to be 
the case in this assessment. This approach has been agreed with consultees. 
Further detail is provided in Appendix 4.O of the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.2). see Table 8.1 above). 
8.6 
Baseline Conditions and Ecological Features 
8.6.1 This section sets out the baseline conditions and evaluates the importance of 
ecological features in accordance with the methodology set out in Section 8.5, 
to identify those important ecological features which are subject to the 
Assessment of Effects in Section 8.7. Whilst the evaluation of each ecological 
feature has not been specifically discussed and agreed with statutory 
consultees; no concerns regarding the identification of important ecological 
features were raised during the consultation period. 
Power Generation Plant 
Background and approach 
8.6.2 It would be the rate of habitat re-establishment and species re-colonisation 
following implementation of the LLRS, as opposed to the specific 
commencement date of the Project (being 2020), that is the primary factor in 
determining baseline conditions relevant to this ecological assessment. 
However, the baseline for the ecological assessment is based on the 
assumption that elements of the LLRS are implemented, including re-profiling 
of Rookery South Pit as described in Sections 3.1. Additionally, the land option 
agreement, between the landowner and applicant includes a clause which 
guarantees a development site which would be free of ecological constraints.   
8.6.3 Baseline ecological conditions (designated sites, habitats and species) are 
therefore informed by the desk and field studies undertaken in 2014 and 2017, 
and determined on the basis of their predicted status and importance during 
the construction, operational and decommissioning phases, taking into 
account the assumptions set out in Section 8.5.21 above. The base of the pit 
will be re-profiled and the footprint of the Power Generation Plant Site will be 
excluded from the habitat creation associated with the LLRS; it will not be 
returned to agriculture. It will be maintained as a clay base, following the 
excavation of clay to win material for re-profiling works within the wider 
Rookery South Pit.  For the purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that 
the Rookery South Pit will be constraint free in terms of valuable habitats and 
the continued absence of protected species following completion of the great 
crested newt and reptile translocation.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
225 
 
8.6.4 The extended Phase 1 habitat survey undertaken in February 2014 – Appendix 
8.1 – confirmed that the base of the south-western corner of Rookery South 
Pit comprised sparsely vegetated ground, swamp vegetation (including drying 
reedbeds) and bare ground.  Significant areas of the western half of the base 
of Rookery South Pit were levelled following completion of Phase 1 of a 
programme to translocate great crested newts as part of the LLRS (see 
paragraph 8.6.16 below).  The surrounds of the pit comprised a patchy mosaic 
of bare ground, species-poor neutral grassland and woodland/scrub habitats 
that had developed since clay extraction ceased. The access track comprised 
a mosaic of bare ground with ephemeral vegetation and scrub. These habitats 
are shown on the Phase 1 habitat map in Appendix 8.1, Figure 2.  
8.6.5 No material changes in the nature and extent of habitats within the Project Site 
were identified during the walkover survey undertaken in April 2017 (see 
updated Phase 1 map in Appendix 8.1). The base of the Rookery South Pit 
was dominated by a mosaic of sparsely vegetated and bare ground, with 
occasional channels and pools of standing water supporting emergent 
vegetation including reed grasses and sedges. This was also the case in those 
areas of the pit which had previously not been mapped as part of the 2014 
Phase 1 habitat survey. The surrounds of the pit continued to support a mosaic 
of bare ground, sparsely distributed low-growing plant species, species-poor 
neutral grassland and woodland/scrub habitats. An area of bare ground which 
was previously present on the southern bank of the pit in 2014, had since been 
colonised by ephemeral/ short perennial vegetation; and an adjacent area of 
species-poor neutral grassland appeared to have been removed as part of the 
LLRS mitigation works.  
8.6.6 The access track comprised bare ground and sparsely vegetated areas 
bordered by trees and shrubs. Much of the scrub that was previously recorded 
along the edges of the access track appeared to have been removed, and 
there was clearance in progress at the time of the 2017 walkover survey. The 
southern end of the access track, which had previously not been mapped as 
part of the 2014 Phase 1 habitat survey, also comprised bare ground. Trees, 
shrubs and a wet ditch were present along the north-western edge of the 
access track.  
Statutory Designated Sites 
8.6.7 Desk studies identified that there are no Special Areas of Conservation 
(SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or Ramsar sites within 10 km of the 
Power Generation Plant Site. Together, SACs and SPAs form the Natura 2000 
network, which aims to assure the long-term survival of Europe’s most valuable 
and threatened habitats.  The nearest Natura 2000 site is the upper Nene 
Valley SAC, which is approximately 27 km to the south-west of the Project Site.  
As such, Natural England has agreed the Project is unlikely to result in any 
significant effects on the integrity of the special interest of any European Site 
and that a Habitats Regulation Assessment undertaken in accordance with the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) is not 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
226 
 
required (see Table 8.1). Nevertheless, in accordance with PINS Advice Note 
10, a No Significant Effects Report has been produced to formally record this 
assessment (Document Reference 5.7).   
8.6.8 There is one SSSI within 2 km of the Power Generation Plant Site (Cooper’s 
Hill SSSI) which is approximately 1.2 km to the south-east. The grid references 
and principal reasons for designation of the SSSIs within the study area are 
given in Appendix 8.1.  This site is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve 
(LNR).  
8.6.9 Given the distances of these statutory designated sites from the Power 
Generation Plant Site, no direct or indirect impacts are anticipated on any 
statutory designated sites. The air quality assessment presented in Chapter 6) 
concluded that no breaches of the critical level are predicted to occur at 
Cooper’s Hill SSSI and LNR, and that all of the predicted nitrogen and acid 
deposition rates are insignificant when compared to the critical loads for the 
habitats under consideration.  The sensitivity of nationally designated sites to 
construction and decommissioning dust impacts are defined (in Section 6.6) 
as those supporting dust sensitive features which are located within 50 m of 
the Project Site. As Cooper’s Hill SSSI and LNR are located more than 50 m 
from the Project Site, the potential to have a significant effect on these 
ecological features due to dust is considered to be negligible. These statutory 
designated sites were screened out of the Air Quality assessment in Section 
6.6 of this ES and consequently will not be considered any further in the 
ecological impact assessment. This approach has been agreed with Natural 
England (see S42 response dated 06.07.2017 in Table 8.1). 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
8.6.10 Rookery Clay Pit CWS comprises Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit. 
Rookery South Pit will be directly affected by the Power Generation Plant; 
although by the time of construction the area to be affected will have already 
been re-profiled as part of the LLRS works. The existing access track, which 
is located along the western margin of Rookery North Pit, comprises bare 
ground with ephemeral vegetation, lined with young silver birch (Betula 
pendula) and alder (Alnus glutinosa) trees. A proportion of the scrub habitat 
which was recorded in this location in the 2014 PEIR (dominated by hawthorn 
(Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa)) has now been 
removed as preparatory works for the construction of the access road for the 
Covanta RRF Project.   
8.6.11 At the time of the protected species surveys in 2014, the base of Rookery 
South Pit had been subject to dewatering operations, but still contained small 
areas of standing water and swamp habitat, along with areas of bare clay.  It 
was noted during the 2017 survey that the areas of standing water and swamp 
habitat had decreased further in extent. All of this area will be re-profiled as 
part of the LLRS. By 2020, being the date of the commencement of the 
construction phase of the Project, these more valuable habitats within Rookery 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
227 
 
South Pit and those recently associated with the Rookery Clay Pit CWS will 
therefore no longer exist. This is assured by the commitments in the land option 
agreement between the land owner and Applicant to undertake the LLRS 
works as specified in section 3.1 of the ES and to provide the applicant with a 
site which is free of ecological constraints.   
8.6.12 The desk study revealed that ecological surveys undertaken in 2008 – 2009 
showed the Rookery Clay Pit CWS to have supported a large population of 
great crested newts; a small population of grass snakes; and a medium 
population of common lizards. The studies also confirmed that the Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS supported a valuable invertebrate fauna, along with numerous 
bird species of conservation importance (see Appendices 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4, for 
further information) in 2008-2009.  
8.6.13 At the time that the Project begins construction in 2020, it is assumed that all 
great crested newts and reptiles will have been removed from the base of the 
Rookery South Pit and surrounding area as part of the translocation operation 
which has been completed as part of the LLRS (see below). It is also assumed 
that measures will remain in place to prevent re-colonisation by great crested 
newts and reptiles (see Section 8.5.21). In addition, the LLRS re-profiling 
works will replace any terrestrial habitat currently suitable for great crested 
newts, reptiles, breeding birds and/or invertebrates within Rookery South Pit 
with clay, rendering it of negligible nature conservation value for protected or 
notable species.    
8.6.14 The baseline at the time of implementation of the Project in 2020 will constitute 
any colonisation of ephemeral vegetation within the re-profiled Rookery South 
Pit following completion of the LLRS re-profiling works.  Without intervention, 
the re-colonisation by protected species (including great crested newts, and 
reptiles) would also be expected.  However, as identified in 8.5.21, it is 
assumed for the purposes of this assessment that the site will remain 
constraint free, in terms of valuable habitats and the continued absence of 
protected species (following completion of the great crested newt and reptile 
translocation). A commitment under The Rookery South (Resource Recovery 
Facility) Order 2011, to retain herpetofauna exclusion fencing in situ until 2020, 
together with relevant clauses in the Land Option Agreement between MPL 
(the Applicant) and O&H (landowner) provide assurance that this will remain 
the case. Nevertheless, the habitats and features of value supported by 
Rookery North Pit will be retained, and the potential exists for indirect impacts 
on this site of ‘County’ importance for nature conservation.  This is considered 
in Section 8.7, below. 
Other non-statutory designated sites 
8.6.15 A further 11 non-statutory designated sites are present within 2 km of the 
Project Site.  These include the large water bodies that dominate the base of 
the Marston Vale as well as woodland and grassland sites which are present 
both in the base and on the sides of the Marston Vale. The grid references and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
228 
 
principal reasons for designation of these CWS are set out in Appendix 8.1 of 
this ES. Given the distances of these other non-statutory designated sites from 
the Power Generation Plant Site, no impacts are anticipated on these other 
CWS within 2 km of the Generating Equipment Site. The sensitivity of locally 
designated sites to construction and decommissioning dust impacts are 
defined (in Section 6.5) as those supporting dust sensitive features which are 
located within 50 m of the Project Site. Although Stewartby Lake CWS is within 
50 m of construction activities, it is considered to be of low sensitivity (see 
Table 6.5) as it is not nationally or internationally designated and no dust 
sensitive species are present. Similarly, during the operation phase, no indirect 
impacts are anticipated on these sites as the air quality assessment (Section 
6.7) concluded that no breaches of the critical level are predicted to occur, and 
all of the predicted nitrogen and acid deposition rates are insignificant when 
compared to the critical loads for the habitats under consideration. No 
significant effects on these ecological features are considered likely and they 
have not been considered in the ecological impact assessment. This has been 
confirmed by Natural England (see Table 8.1).    
Great crested newts 
8.6.16 Trapping and translocation of great crested newts (and reptiles) has taken 
place under a mitigation licence, issued by Natural England in 2011 as part of 
the LLRS. This has affected the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
incorporating the southern portion of the Access Road and a proportion of the 
arable land in the south of the Project Site. The translocation programme in 
Rookery South Pit was completed in November 2014, although it was noted 
during the 2017 survey that the great crested newt fencing had been retained 
in place. The baseline at the time of implementation of the Project will be the 
re-profiled base of Rookery South Pit following completion of the LLRS re-
profiling works, along with any habitat re-establishment during the intervening 
period up to 2020. However, the assessment has assumed that the Rookery 
South Pit will be constraint free at the time of construction. 
8.6.17 The existing access track, along the alignment of the proposed Access Road, 
on the western edge of Rookery North Pit, comprises areas of scrub, 
ephemeral vegetation and bare ground with cracks and crevices located 
outside of the exclusion area described above. These habitats, including the 
voids in the bare ground, could be used by the meta-population of great crested 
newts supported by Rookery North Pit during their terrestrial phase.  
8.6.18 Great crested newts are relatively common and widespread throughout the 
county. The desk study has confirmed that the base of the Marston Vale 
supports several large and robust meta-populations (including in nearby 
habitats). Furthermore, the majority of the suitable habitat for great crested 
newts within the Power Generation Plant Site will already have been lost as a 
result of the LLRS. Overall the meta-populations of great crested newts within 
the Power Generation Plant Site are therefore considered to be important at 
less than ‘Local’ level. As such, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines and the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
229 
 
methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, great crested newts are not 
considered to be an important ecological feature and hence no impact 
assessment for this species is required.    
8.6.19 Whilst the great crested newt meta-populations within the Power Generation 
Plant Site are not of sufficient importance to trigger consideration in the impact 
assessment, the potential exists for construction of the Access Road (which is 
outside of the area where the LLRS will be completed) to result in incidental 
harm to great crested newts using suitable features associated with terrestrial 
habitat along the route of the proposed Access Road.  Appropriate 
management measures will therefore be implemented to ensure there is no 
breach of the legislation that protects great crested newts. These measures 
are further explained in section 8.9.  
Reptiles 
8.6.20 The existing access track along the alignment of the Access Road, on the 
western edge of Rookery North Pit comprises areas of scrub, ephemeral 
vegetation and bare ground with cracks and crevices which could be used by 
common species of reptiles associated with Rookery North Pit.  
8.6.21 The baseline at the time of implementation of the Project will be the re-profiled 
base of Rookery South Pit following completion of the LLRS re-profiling works, 
along with any habitat re-establishment during the intervening period up to 
2020.  As identified in 8.5.21, it is understood that measures will be 
implemented during the intervening period, to ensure that reptiles remain 
absent from the base of the pit.  The terrestrial habitats adjacent to the access 
track, suitable for use by reptiles would be expected to remain unchanged, 
although reduced in extent due to the construction of the Access Road.  
8.6.22 Given that other similar habitat is widespread in Marston Vale and the 
surrounding area, and only small to medium populations of reptiles have been 
confirmed during the baseline surveys, and any remaining suitable habitat will 
be removed as part of the LLRS works, the reptile populations within the area 
required for the Power Generation Plant are considered to be important at less 
than ‘Local’ level. As such, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines and the 
methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, reptiles are not considered to be an 
important ecological feature and hence no impact assessment is required for 
this species group. 
8.6.23 Whilst the reptile populations within the Power Generation Plant Site are not 
of sufficient importance to trigger consideration in the detailed impact 
assessment process, the potential exists for construction of the Access Road 
to result in incidental harm to reptiles using terrestrial habitat along the route 
of the proposed Access Road.  Appropriate management measures will 
therefore be implemented to ensure there is no breach of the legislation that 
protects reptiles. These measures are reported in Section 8.9 of this ES.  
Breeding Birds 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
230 
 
8.6.24 A relatively diverse assemblage of 65 species of breeding birds (either 
confirmed or potentially breeding) was recorded during the 2014 surveys.  Of 
these, 31 species appear on one or more schedules or lists of species of 
conservation importance (see Appendix 8.4 for more information).  The 
majority of these were recorded within Rookery South Pit, which is subject to 
the ongoing LLRS and will be re-profiled before the construction phase of the 
Project in 2020.  The areas of scrub along the existing access track can be 
expected to support nesting birds, and during the 2014 surveys a pair of song 
thrush were confirmed breeding, along with probable breeding white throat 
(two pairs) bullfinch, turtle dove, stock dove and dunnock.   
8.6.25 The baseline at the time of implementation of the Project will be the re-profiled 
base of Rookery South Pit following completion of the LLRS re-profiling works, 
along with any habitat re-establishment during the intervening period up to 
2020.  Vegetation suitable for use by nesting birds would not be expected to 
re-colonise the base of the pit during this time, and in any event, there is a 
commitment to ensure the site remains free of ecological constraints (Section 
8.5.21).  The habitats along the existing access track would expect to remain 
unchanged, although reduced in extent due to the construction of the Access 
Road.   
8.6.26 The most valuable habitats for breeding birds within Rookery South Pit will 
have been lost ahead of the time of construction as a result of implementation 
of the LLRS. It is considered that breeding birds using the remaining habitats 
within the Power Generation Plant Site are important at less than ‘Local’ level. 
As such, breeding birds are not considered to be an important ecological 
feature and hence no impact assessment is required.  
8.6.27 Nevertheless, 
appropriate 
management 
measures 
will therefore 
be 
implemented to ensure no breach of the legislation that protects breeding 
birds. These measures are set out in Section 8.9 of this ES. 
Bats 
8.6.28 A diverse bat assemblage was recorded during the activity and automated 
static bat detector surveys undertaken in May, July and September 2014, 
which focussed on the existing access track to the west of Rookery North Pit.  
A total of nine species were recorded, including barbastelle (Barbastella 
barbastellus), noctule (Nyctalus noctula), Leisler’s (N. leisleri), serotine 
(Eptesicus serotinus), long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), Myotis spp. 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle (Pipistrellus nathusii), common pipistrelle (P. pipistrellus) 
and soprano pipistrelle (P. pygmaeus) bats. Common and soprano pipistrelle 
bats were recorded most frequently; further information is provided in Appendix 
8.5 of this ES.  
8.6.29 The majority of bats were recorded foraging and commuting along the tree/ 
scrub-lined access track, which constitutes a ‘green corridor’, linking the known 
bat roosts at South Pillinge Farm (see below) with valuable foraging habitat to 
the north, associated with Rookery North Pit and beyond.  The ecological 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
231 
 
function of the access track as a green corridor would be expected to remain 
unchanged at the time of implementation of the Project in 2020.  
8.6.30 Although a diverse assemblage of bats has been recorded using the Power 
Generation Plant Site, albeit it in relatively small numbers (with the exception 
of common and soprano pipistrelle bats), similar habitats are widespread 
elsewhere within Marston Vale, and these can be expected to be used by a 
similar range of bat species associated with wetlands and surrounding 
habitats.  The bat populations using the Power Generation Plant Site are 
therefore considered to be important at less than ‘Local’ level. As such, bats 
are not considered to be an important ecological feature and hence no impact 
assessment is required. 
8.6.31 Nevertheless, appropriate management measures will be implemented in 
relation to the legislative protection afforded to bats. These measures are 
reported in Section 8.9 of this ES.  
Other mammals 
8.6.32 There are no features suitable for use by water voles or otters within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  Although signs of badger activity were recorded in the 
vicinity of the Power Generation Plant Site, no setts were revealed during the 
surveys.  These species will not therefore be considered any further in the EIA 
process. 
Gas and Electrical Connection 
8.6.33 The baseline conditions of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are 
extremely similar in ecological terms, and were assessed together as one large 
area for the purposes of the extended Phase 1 habitat Survey and detailed 
protected species surveys in 2014, and the update walkover survey in 2017. 
They have therefore been grouped together for the purposes of this 
assessment.  
8.6.34 The baseline surveys undertaken in 2014 (see Appendices 8.1 – 8.5) related 
to the Project Site boundary as reported in the Project Scoping Report (see 
Appendix 1.2).  This encompassed a wider survey area than the footprint of 
the Project Site which is the subject of this ES. For the purposes of this Ecology 
Chapter, relevant information has been extracted from the baseline surveys to 
cover the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, as described in Sections 
3.3. and 3.4.  
8.6.35 Two additional arable fields and an access track in the south of the Project Site 
(to the east of Lower Farm), were beyond the limits of the 2014 survey areas 
for breeding birds, water vole and otter, invertebrates, reptiles and badger 
surveys. This additional area was subject to an updated Phase 1 habitat survey 
in 2017, and has been considered in the baseline information below. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
232 
 
8.6.36 The majority of the habitats within the areas proposed for the Gas and 
Electrical Connection comprise intensively managed agricultural land, 
characterised by large arable fields, with grassy field margins which are bound 
by young species-poor hedgerows. A small number of plantation woodlands, 
which appeared, during the surveys, to be relatively recent in origin (less than 
30 years old) are present within the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Connection. These habitats are considered to be important at less than ‘Local’ 
level, being common and widespread, and hence no impact assessment is 
required. Parts of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection (e.g. the 
Substation) are within Rookery South Pit. The habitats within the footprint of 
these areas are assumed to be the same as for the Power Generation Plant 
Site (see Sections 8.6.4 and 8.6.5).  
Invertebrates 
8.6.37 The diversity of invertebrates recorded in the more valuable areas of habitat 
within areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection (woodland 
plantations, ponds and field margins) during the 2014 surveys, was limited. 
This is largely due to their setting within intensively managed arable land and 
their associated field margins and managed hedgerows. The majority of the 
species recorded are common and widespread across England. Of the 155 
species recorded, three are nationally scarce and nine are Species of Principal 
Importance, including beetles and moths.  Similar to other areas within the land 
required for the Gas and Electrical Connections, the land in the south of the 
Project Site, which was beyond the 2014 invertebrate survey limits, comprised 
arable fields and species-poor hedgerows. These habitats were considered to 
be of limited value for terrestrial invertebrates during the 2017 update survey.  
8.6.38 Overall, the terrestrial invertebrate populations within the areas proposed for 
the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are considered to be of less 
than ‘Local’ importance. The assemblage does not therefore constitute an 
important ecological feature and hence, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines 
and the methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, no impact assessment is 
required.    
8.6.39 Further information is provided in Appendix 8.2 of this ES.   
Great crested newts 
8.6.40 Surveys were undertaken of 13 ponds within 250 m of the Project Site (Project 
Site boundary as reported in the Scoping Report) in 2014, to confirm the 
presence or likely absence of great crested newts.  The presence of great 
crested newts was confirmed in eight of the ponds; full details are provided in 
Appendix 8.3 of this ES.  
8.6.41 The population assessments confirmed three small populations and one 
medium population of great crested newts, in ponds to the north, east, west, 
and to the south, respectively; as indicated in Appendix 8.3, Figure 2 of this 
ES.  Population A (within Pond C) supported a small population of great 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
233 
 
crested newts, to the north-east of the Gas Connection, with Population D 
(within Ponds H, J and K) supporting a medium population of great crested 
newts, adjacent to the proposed AGI for the Gas Connection. These ponds are 
set within an intensively managed agricultural landscape, and suitable 
terrestrial habitat for great crested newts is limited to hedgerows, plantation 
woodland, and field margins. 
8.6.42 Great crested newts are relatively common in the county and are widespread 
within the vicinity of the Project Site (comprising four meta-populations 
recorded during the surveys, a large population associated with the receptor 
sites from the Rookery South Pit translocation, and robust meta-populations 
known to occur elsewhere within the base of Marston Vale). The great crested 
newt populations associated with the areas proposed for the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection are therefore considered to be of less than ‘Local’ 
importance. As such, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines and the 
methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, the great crested newt populations 
are not considered to be an important ecological feature and hence, no impact 
assessment is required. 
8.6.43 
Whilst the great crested newt populations are not sufficiently important to 
trigger consideration in the impact assessment process (see Section 8.5), the 
potential exists for construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection to result in incidental harm to great crested newts using suitable 
terrestrial habitat within 250 m of Ponds C and H see Figure 2 in Appendix 8.3) 
which have been confirmed to support great crested newts. Appropriate 
management measures will therefore be implemented to ensure no breach of 
the legislation that protects great crested newts. This approach has been 
confirmed with Natural England (see Table 8.1).  
Reptiles 
8.6.44 The baseline surveys undertaken in 2014 confirmed the presence of small 
populations of common lizard and grass snake within the areas proposed for 
the Gas and Electrical Connection, specifically associated with the Bletchley 
to Bedford railway corridor, field boundaries and areas of broadleaved 
woodland. Peak counts of adult common lizard and grass snake were eight 
and three, respectively; further information is provided in Appendix 8.3, Figure 
3 of this ES. The land in the south of the Project Site, which was beyond the 
2014 reptile survey limits, comprised arable fields and species-poor 
hedgerows during the 2017 update survey. These habitats were considered to 
be of limited value for reptiles but as for elsewhere within the land required for 
the Gas and Electrical Connections, the field margins could potentially support 
similarly small populations of common lizard and grass snake. 
8.6.45 The suitability of reptile habitat within the areas proposed for the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection is limited due to the intense 
management of the arable farmland.  There are more valuable reptile habitats 
in the surrounding area, including Rookery North Pit; and reptiles are 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
234 
 
widespread in Marston Vale and the county. Based on the 2014 and 2017 
survey information, the reptile populations within the areas proposed for the 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are considered to be of less than 
‘Local’ importance. The reptile populations do not therefore constitute an 
important ecological feature and, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines and 
the methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, will not be considered in the 
impact assessment.   
8.6.46 Nevertheless, appropriate precautionary mitigation measures will be 
implemented in advance of the site clearance works in order to avoid a breach 
of the protective legislation relating to reptiles. These measures are set out in 
Section 8.9 of this ES. 
Breeding Birds 
8.6.47 The majority of the areas proposed for the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are of limited value for breeding birds, consisting of large arable 
fields, delineated by species-poor hedgerows and ditches. The majority of the 
species recorded during the 2014 surveys are generalist species, breeding 
within the hedgerows, scrub and small wooded copses within the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection with only skylark recorded as 
probable breeding in the open fields. Similar habitats were recorded in the land 
in the south of the Project Site, which was beyond the 2014 breeding bird 
survey limits, such that a similar assemblage of breeding birds can be 
expected to be present. 
8.6.48 No evidence of breeding barn owls was recorded during the surveys of the 
farmhouse buildings.  A single barn owl was incidentally recorded foraging 
during the bat activity surveys. The areas proposed for the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection as a whole however, are considered to be of limited 
value to foraging barn owls, due to the intensive management of the 
agricultural land which has poor suitability for supporting suitable prey.  
8.6.49 Overall, the assemblage of breeding birds associated with the areas proposed 
for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection is considered to be of less 
than ‘Local’ importance.  Breeding birds are not therefore considered to be an 
important ecological feature and in accordance with CIEEM guidelines and the 
methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, no impact assessment is required.   
8.6.50 Nevertheless, appropriate management measures will be implemented in 
relation to the legislative protection afforded to breeding birds. These 
measures are set out in Section 8.9 of this ES.  
Bats 
8.6.51 During the bat activity surveys undertaken in May, July and September 2014, 
a total of four species were recorded within the areas proposed for the Gas 
and Electrical Connections. These were noctule, Myotis spp., common 
pipistrelle and soprano pipistrelle bats. Common and soprano pipistrelle bats 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
235 
 
were recorded most frequently; further information is provided in Appendix 8.5 
of this ES.  The majority of bats were recorded foraging and commuting along 
the edge of plantation woodlands, field margins and roadside species-poor 
hedgerows. Similar results can be expected over the land in the south of the 
Project Site which was beyond the limits of the 2014 bat activity survey extents, 
and supported similar habitats. 
8.6.52 Emergence and return to roost surveys of the building complex at South 
Pillinge Farm confirmed the continued presence of bat roosts (previously 
identified during surveys undertaken by BSG in 2008 at the Power Generation 
Plant Site in relation to the LLRS (see Appendix 8.5 of this ES).  A small 
number of small, non-breeding summer roosts for common pipistrelle, soprano 
pipistrelle and brown long-eared bats were recorded within a brick-built barn 
building (see B5 on Figure 4 in Appendix 8.5 of this ES), the farmhouse (B6) 
and a brick-built out-building (B8); further detail is provided in Appendix 8.5.  
Whilst these buildings will not be directly affected by the Project, the potential 
exists for disturbance impacts associated with any bats using these roosts 
during the construction phase of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection.   
8.6.53 The bat species recorded during the activity surveys are relatively common 
and widespread, and the habitats present within the Project Site are typical of 
the surrounding area. The bat populations associated with the areas proposed 
for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are therefore considered to 
be of less than ‘Local’ importance and, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines 
and the methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, an impact assessment on 
this species group is not required. Nevertheless, appropriate management 
measures will be implemented to avoid a breach of the legislation that protects 
bats and their roosts. These measures are set out in Section 8.9 of this ES.  
Badgers 
8.6.54 Although badger activity was recorded throughout the survey area in 2014, no 
setts were recorded within the areas proposed for the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection. The large arable fields are considered to be of limited 
value to foraging badgers, with more valuable habitat being provided by the 
areas of plantation woodland.  Overall, the badger population associated with 
the areas required for the Gas and Electrical Connections is considered to be 
of less than ‘Local’ importance and, in accordance with CIEEM guidelines and 
the methodology set out in Section 8.5 above, an impact assessment on this 
species group is not required.   
Other mammals 
8.6.55 No signs of water voles were recorded during the 2014 surveys within the 
areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection.  The ditches were 
considered to constitute sub-optimal habitat, as the majority were shallow in 
depth, shaded by trees and scrub, and lacked fringes of emergent vegetation 
which would be required for food and shelter. No changes to the assessment 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
236 
 
of the suitability of ditches within the Project Site for water voles were identified 
during the 2017 update walkover survey. Similarly, none of the features in the 
areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection were considered 
suitable for use by otters, and they had limited connectivity to more suitable 
habitat in the wider area.  No habitat suitable for water vole or otter was 
recorded in the land in the south of the Project Site which was beyond the limits 
of the 2014 survey extent. As a consequence, no further consideration is given 
to ‘other mammals’ in this assessment.   
Importance of Ecological Features 
8.6.56 This section summarises the importance of the ecological features associated 
with the Project.  As described in paragraph 8.5.14, in accordance with the 
CIEEM assessment methodology, those features which are determined to be 
important ecological features, and which are considered to be potentially 
impacted as a result of the Project, are selected for inclusion in the impact 
assessment. These are identified below for the Power Generation Plant (Table 
8.2) and the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection (Table 8.3).

Assessment of Effects 
8.7.1 In accordance with CIEEM Guidelines, the following section assesses the 
potential effects of the topic-specific worst case scenario for assessment 
(Section 8.4) on the individual ‘Important Ecological Features’ identified in 
Section 8.6, in the absence of additional mitigation or enhancement measures. 
Measures that have been incorporated into the design of the Project to 
minimise any potentially significant effects (embedded mitigation) are outlined 
in Section 3.6 of this ES, and have been considered in this section. 
8.7.2 Only one Important Ecological Feature (Rookery Clay Pit CWS) has been 
identified and this is subject to the detailed assessment process below.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
239 
 
Power Generation Plant 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
Construction/Decommissioning– effects upon Important Ecological 
Features 
Direct effects: Habitat loss 
8.7.3 There will be direct habitat loss within Rookery Clay Pit CWS associated with 
the construction of the Power Generation Plant.  As identified above, the re-
grading works associated with the LLRS within Rookery South Pit will replace 
any terrestrial habitat suitable for newts, reptiles, breeding birds and/ or 
reptiles.  Impacts are therefore limited to the loss of any new habitat that would 
have been created associated as part of the LLRS restoration strategy, in the 
absence of the Project.  The area affected by Power Generation Plant would 
have been returned to agricultural use, and is described on the LLRS 
Restoration Strategy as ‘base of pit, levelled, graded and grassed’, which 
would be expected to be of negligible ecological value.  Although two surface 
water management ditches are proposed as part of the LLRS Restoration 
Strategy in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant, the Landscape and 
Ecology Strategy for the Project will re-align these features to ensure there is 
no net reduction in the habitats that would have been created as a result of the 
LLRS (as illustrated on the Outline LEMMS Appendix 11.3).  Habitat loss within 
the CWS will therefore be limited to areas of ephemeral vegetation and scrub 
habitat on the peripheral areas of the western edge of Rookery North Pit, 
including along the Access Road, if vegetation removal is required.   
 
8.7.4 The construction of the Access Road may result in the removal of bird nesting 
opportunities, habitat suitable for use by reptiles and potentially great crested 
newts (see paragraphs 8.9.5-8.9.6, below). However, the more valuable 
habitats within Rookery North Pit, including the pools and associated reedbed 
(swamp), marshy grassland and unimproved neutral grassland will not be 
affected, and an appropriate buffer zone will be maintained to protect the 
retained habitats.   
8.7.5 Given that the LLRS will be completed by the time of construction of the 
Project, and Rookery North Pit will be retained, the effect of habitat loss upon 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS before mitigation is considered to be ‘Not Significant’.  
Indirect effects: Pollution 
8.7.6 The presence of machinery and plant on site, with storage of fuel oils and other 
materials, may present an increased risk of pollution incidents and accidents 
(e.g. spillages and emissions) during construction.  This will be particularly 
relevant for the new habitats to be created as part of the LLRS Restoration 
Strategy and the Ecology and Landscape Strategy for the Project.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
240 
 
However, the embedded mitigation for the Project includes the implementation 
of a CEMP, as outlined in Section 3.6 of this ES, to limit construction impacts 
on the environment, and to protect retained ecological features.  Assuming the 
effective implementation of the CEMP, the effect of indirect impacts on Rookery 
Pit CWS is considered to be Not Significant. This assessment is supported by 
the Water Quality Chapter in Section 9.7 of this ES, which concludes that there 
will be no significant effects due to the contamination of surface waters during 
construction/ decommissioning. An outline CEMP is provided in Appendix 3.2.     
Operation and maintenance – effects upon Important Ecological 
Features 
8.7.7 The operational impacts of the Power Generation Plant on ecological features 
are limited to the potential for emissions of NOx, nitrogen and acid deposition 
to have an effect on the retained habitats within the Rookery Clay Pit CWS, in 
particular Rookery North Pit.  
8.7.8 The Air Quality Chapter (Chapter 6) has assessed the potential impacts of 
pollutants arising from the operation of the Power Generation Plant on the 
retained habitats within Rookery Pit CWS. This has confirmed there are 
unlikely to be significant effects from oxides of nitrogen emissions, nitrogen 
and acid deposition during the operational phase of the Project on the CWS, 
as the maximum ground level concentrations are such that for a stack height 
of 32.5 m, they are considered to be Not Significant. Further information is 
provided in Section 6.7.  
8.7.9 No likely significant effects are anticipated to result from the Access Road 
during operation given the very limited number of vehicles and hence limited 
exhaust emissions. See Chapter 6.  
Gas Connection / Electrical Connection 
8.7.10 None of the ecological features within the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are considered sufficiently important to be included in the impact 
assessment. Nevertheless, they still warrant consideration during the design 
and mitigation of the Project on the basis of their legal protection; see 
paragraphs 8.9.3 to 8.9.24.   
Project as a whole 
8.7.11 The Summary of Effects Table 8.4 below includes a section on the effects of 
the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection). 
8.7.12 No likely significant effects are predicted on Important Ecological Features 
from any of the individual elements of the Project or from the Project as a 
whole.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

8.8 
Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Overview 
8.8.1 Construction, decommissioning or operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
section 4.10.7.  However, the majority of these developments are  distant from 
the Project Site (at least 2 km).  
8.8.2 These developments and any effects arising from them are outside the study 
area for this topic within which significant effects could occur. As such it is 
considered that no cumulative or in combination ecological effects are likely to 
arise during the construction or decommissioning phases of the Project. 
Furthermore, each of these developments will be bound by its own CEMP and 
will apply best practice construction methods so as to minimise impacts on 
ecology.  
Construction/Decommissioning 
8.8.3 The projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for this chapter (taken from section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
8.8.4 Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery South Pit. At present, a request for 
a scoping opinion has been submitted by the promoter of the project although 
no details are provided regarding potential impacts on ecology as a result of 
the project. However, it is likely that this development will be bound by its own 
CEMP and best practice construction methods so as to limit impacts on 
ecology during construction. Should it go ahead, then it will need to consider 
the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative effects will arise between it 
and the Project. Nevertheless, in order to minimise the possibility of cumulative 
effects arising, a CEMP will be followed during construction of the Project, 
which will ensure best practice construction methods are followed and limit, as 
far as practicable, the possibility of impacts occurring to the ecology. The 
measures proposed to minimise impacts during construction are listed in 
section 3.6 of this ES e.g. site fencing will be used and pollution prevention 
guidelines would be followed to prevent pollution of water courses. 
8.8.5 Furthermore, given the early stage of the Integrated Waste Management 
proposals and the likely time required to achieve planning consent, it is 
considered unlikely that there would be any overlap on the construction periods 
of these two projects, which further mitigates against any potential cumulative 
effects.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
242 
 
8.8.6 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site concluded that there were potential impacts arising from construction and 
decommissioning of the project on ecology.   
8.8.7 The potential for cumulative effects on Rookery Clay Pit CWS has been 
assessed, as the Covanta Scheme will result in the loss of an area of Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS.  However, one of the pre-commencement DCO requirements 
for the Covanta Scheme states that construction works may not commence 
until the early stages of the LLRS (Phase 1, as described in Section 4.10) have 
been completed. The ES for the Covanta Scheme states that the baseline 
ecological conditions will therefore comprise habitats of limited or no value to 
protected species. Furthermore, an Ecological Management Scheme has been 
produced as part of the pre-commencement DCO requirements which 
describes measures that will be implemented to safeguard retained valuable 
habitats, protected and notable species, and enhance biodiversity post-
construction. 
8.8.8 The effects on the Rookery Clay Pit CWS associated with construction of the 
Project considered together with the effects associated with construction of the 
Covanta RRF Project will not give rise to a significant cumulative effect or give 
rise to new or different effects that would occur if the projects are constructed 
independently of one another. The Environmental Statement for the Covanta 
RRF Project concluded that there would be no residual significant effects on 
non-statutory designated sites. Similarly, no significant effects on Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS are expected as a result of the Project given the limited extent 
of habitat loss after completion of the LLRS and the embedded mitigation. In 
light of this, and based on professional judgement in relation to the potential 
effects of the two projects, there are not anticipated to be any effects on 
ecology cumulatively from the construction and decommissioning of the 
Project and the Covanta RRF project.  
8.8.9 In relation to Air Quality (see Section 6.8), in the ES for the Covanta RRF 
Project, the residual effects of construction dust were judged to be not 
significant with appropriate mitigation measures in place. The construction 
period for the Covanta RRF Project could coincide with that for the Project, 
however both projects will employ appropriate mitigation measures. Indeed, 
DCO requirement 16 for the Covanta RRF Project requires that all construction 
works are undertaken in accordance with the Code of Construction Practice. 
Similarly, appropriate mitigation in relation to dust emissions will be 
implemented as part of the Project during the construction phase and is 
incorporated within the Outline CEMP as embedded mitigation (see Section 
6), The Air Quality chapter (Chapter 6) for the Project has concluded no 
significant residual effects during construction, operation or decommissioning. 
8.8.10 The effects on ecology from Air Quality associated with construction of the 
Project considered together with the effects associated with construction of the 
Covanta RRF Project will not give rise to a significant cumulative effect or give 
rise to new or different effects that would occur if the projects are constructed 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
243 
 
independently of one another. This is supported by the conclusion of the Air 
Quality cumulative assessment (Section 6.8). Based on professional 
judgement, there is therefore not anticipated to be any effects on ecology 
cumulatively from the construction and decommissioning of the Project and the 
Covanta RRF project.  
8.8.11 The Landscape Strategy associated with the Covanta RRF has been taken 
into account when designing the outline LEMMS for the Project (Appendix 
11.3).  All areas of proposed planting and habitat creation associated with the 
Covanta Scheme have been taken into account in the context of the Outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy. Should areas 
of landscape mitigation planted as part of the Covanta RRF Project need to be 
disturbed by the construction of the Project, provision has been made for the 
areas to be replaced, re-planted or equivalent planting placed appropriately so 
as not to detract from the overall mitigation screening or habitat creation 
originally envisaged by the Covanta RRF landscape and ecology strategy.  If 
mitigation planting used at the Covanta RRF Project is disturbed by the Project, 
it would be the responsibility of the developer of the Project to replace this 
planting.   
8.8.12 With the implementation of the embedded mitigation described in this ES, the 
effects arising from the construction and de-commissioning of the Project are 
anticipated to be not significant.  With the proposed embedded mitigation in 
place for the Covanta RRF Project it is considered that no potential cumulative 
or in combination effects with Covanta RRF are likely to arise in the 
construction phase of the Project.    
Operation 
8.8.13 As above, the projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for the operation of the Project (taken from section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
8.8.14 Impacts during the operational phase of the Project are limited to the potential 
for emissions of NOx, nitrogen and acid deposition to have an effect on the 
retained habitats within the Rookery Clay Pit CWS, in particular Rookery North 
Pit.   
8.8.15 Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery Pit. At present, only a high level 
scoping report, requesting a scoping opinion, has been submitted. No details 
are provided in the scoping report regarding potential impacts on ecology from 
air quality or acid deposition. However, if any of the proposed waste 
developments involve combustion processes, they will be bound by their own 
emissions limits under relevant environmental permits, and will also need to 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
244 
 
consider other cumulative schemes when applying for planning or 
development consent. Should the development go ahead, then it will need to 
consider the Project to ensure that no cumulative effects will arise between it 
and the Project, as this development will follow development of the Project.  
8.8.16 The proposed Covanta RRF project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site will release both oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide from the 
combustion process.  However, the exhaust stack for the Covanta RRF will be 
much higher than the stack(s) for the Project (105m compared to 32.5 m) and 
therefore the location of maximum ground level concentrations will be different 
from those associated with the Project.  The assessment of cumulative Air 
Quality effects during operation is discussed in Section 6.8, and is summarised 
here. 
8.8.17 Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and 
the Generating Equipment together and the results are contained in Appendix 
6.1.  There are no predicted exceedances of the assessment levels for human 
health impacts for the two plants operating together and therefore the 
cumulative effect will be negligible and not significant. 
8.8.18 For the ecological features, all but one of the predicted annual mean oxides of 
nitrogen process contributions is insignificant, i.e. above 1% of the assessment 
level when the plants are operating simultaneously. In one case, (at Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS) there is a minor breach in annual mean oxides of nitrogen 
process contributions, at 1.7% of the assessment level. However, when 
combined with the background concentrations, no breaches of the critical level 
are predicted to occur and therefore the significance of effect is minor and not 
significant. The predicted daily mean oxides of nitrogen concentrations are not 
significant in EIA terms, and when added to the background concentrations, 
no breaches of the daily mean critical level are predicted to occur.  
Effect interactions 
8.8.19 This Chapter has identified one Important Ecological Feature (Rookery Clay 
Pit CWS). In-combination effects on Rookery Clay Pit CWS have been 
considered as an integral part of the assessment in Section 8.7, where 
reference is made to the Air Quality and Water Quality assessments. 
8.8.20 Whilst the ecology assessment is informed by a number of other topics, the 
primary interactions with other topics are from the potential impacts on 
sensitive ecological receptors due to emissions arising during operation of the 
Generating Equipment. 
8.8.21 With regard to sensitive ecological receptors, the Air Quality Impact 
Assessment included all nationally protected statutory habitat sites and locally 
designated sites, and informed the ecological impact assessment discussed in 
Section 8.7 above, based upon the results of the dispersion modelling. The Air 
Quality Assessment results are set out in Section 6.7.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
245 
 
8.8.22 This Chapter has also assessed the potential indirect effects of pollution on 
ecological receptors in Section 8.7. This has been informed by the results of 
the Water Quality Assessment set out in Section 9.7.

Mitigation and Assessment of Residual Effects 
Important Ecological Features 
8.9.1 Given that no likely significant effects are predicted on Important Ecological 
Features (Rookery Pit CWS), no Project specific mitigation is required in 
addition to the embedded design mitigation described in Section 3.6.   
8.9.2 The outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy for 
the Project will ensure that any habitats of ecological value that would have 
been created as part of the LLRS (in the absence of the Project) will be 
incorporated into the design of the Project.  These include surface water 
management ditches, and areas of tree and scrub planting.  Should the 
construction of the Access Road result in the loss of any vegetation, this would 
be replanted with appropriate native species.  In addition, the enhancement of 
retained vegetation and creation of new habitats, through tree and hedgerow 
planting and new ponds (as detailed in the LEMMS at Appendix 11.3) would 
be expected to result in a net gain in biodiversity.  Further information is 
provided in paragraphs 8.9.23 to 8.9.25 and in Chapter 11 of this ES.  
Ecological Features Requiring Appropriate Management in Relation to 
Legislative Protection 
8.9.3 A number of ecological features are considered to be of insufficient importance 
to be included in the assessment.  Nevertheless, due to their protection under 
the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) or 
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), consideration needs to 
be given to appropriate management measures during the design and 
implementation of the Project, so as to ensure no breach of the protective 
legislation. These measures are identified for each ecological feature, below.   
8.9.4 Biodiversity enhancement measures which will deliver on relevant policy 
objectives, including those for the ecological features discussed below, have 
been incorporated into the landscape and ecology design for the scheme. 
These are also considered below. 
Great crested newts 
Power Generation Plant 
8.9.5 Great crested newts and their places of shelter are protected under the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended). They 
are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981(as amended).  
The management measures identified below are required in order to avoid the 
incidental mortality/ injury of great crested newts during the implementation of 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
246 
 
the Project, and to ensure that the favourable conservation status of the local 
great crested newt population is maintained.  
8.9.6 Whilst no ponds would be directly affected by the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant, short sections of the Access Road are located approximately 
490 m from the Rookery North Pit large population of great crested newts, as 
illustrated on Figure 2 in Appendix 8.3 of this ES.  The LLRS will involve 
upgrading the existing track to be agricultural standard, and the Covanta RRF 
Project includes provision to further upgrade the track to be a tarmac road.  
The new Access Road will be 6 m in width, with a concrete curb.  A new section 
of Access Road will be constructed within Rookery South Pit, which has been 
‘cleared’ of great crested newts, as part of the licensed translocation 
associated with the LLRS.    
8.9.7 The potential exists for the incidental mortality of great crested newts, 
associated with the re-surfacing works.  Approximately 250 m of the 1.7 km 
Access Road is located on the edge of the 500 m buffer zone from the newt 
breeding ponds within Rookery North Pit; although newts can travel up to 1 km 
from a breeding pond, they are most likely to be encountered within 250 m, 
and habitats within 50 m are the most important for them.  In addition, the areas 
of terrestrial habitat within the retained Rookery North Pit constitute optimal 
great crested newt terrestrial habitat, between the ponds and the existing 
access track, which are likely to be more attractive to newts.  Finally, the 
resurfacing works will be limited in extent and will avoid the removal of trees 
and scrub habitat.  As a consequence, the risk of encountering newts as a 
result of the works is considered to be very low.  
8.9.8 Using Natural England’s Rapid Risk Assessment tool (which helps to 
determine the need for a great crested newt licence), the likelihood of an 
offence being committed as a result of the Access Road improvements is 
considered to be ‘highly unlikely’.  Any requirement to carry out the works under 
a precautionary method statement included within the CEMP or a derogation 
licence issued by Natural England to ensure that no newts are harmed during 
the construction process, will be determined prior to construction. This will be 
based on the historical context of mitigation works associated with great 
crested newts in and adjacent to the Project Site. If required, appropriate 
mitigation measures will involve the appropriate timing of works, avoidance of 
suitable terrestrial habitat as far as possible, and the careful removal/ 
dismantling by hand of any suitable refugia beneath the footprint of the works.     
8.9.9 The mitigation strategy associated with the LLRS to maintain the favourable 
conservation status of the local great crested newt population present within 
Rookery North Pit is focussed on the retained waterbody within the pit, and the 
series of small new pond(s) created within the Project Site. The Restoration 
Strategy associated with the LLRS would have returned the area affected by 
the Power Generation Plant to agricultural land, which would be unsuitable for 
great crested newts; this did not form part of the habitat creation for the great 
crested newt mitigation strategy.  The surface water management ditches 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
247 
 
proposed as part of the LLRS Restoration Strategy will be incorporated into 
the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy for the Project, albeit with 
minor realignments to the north and south of the Power Generation Plant. 
These features may be of value to great crested newts, depending upon any 
flow in the ditches.  In addition, a small number of ponds/ scrapes have been 
incorporated into the landscape design for the Project, which will be specifically 
designed to be of value for great crested newts.  They will have shallow sloping 
edges planted with marginal vegetation to provide egg laying opportunities for 
newts. Overall, the Project would not be expected to be detrimental to the 
maintenance of the population of great crested newts at favourable 
conservation status.  Indeed, the new pond creation would be expected to 
contribute towards relevant targets in the Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity 
Action Plan, which is aiming to increase the number of ponds available for 
meta-populations of newts. 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
8.9.10 The AGI associated with the Gas Connection will be installed within 75 m of 
Pond H.  Together with Ponds I, J and K, these ponds are considered to 
support a medium meta-population of great crested newts.  Although the 
baseline surveys confirmed the absence of great crested newts from Pond I 
(within 50 m of the AGI), it was determined to be of ‘good’ suitability in the HSI 
assessment, and therefore this pond is likely to be used by great crested newts 
in the future.   
8.9.11 The location of the AGI has been carefully selected to minimise potential 
impacts on great crested newts.  The footprint of the AGI, as described in 
Section 3.3, will comprise an area of approximately 0.3 ha. The small copse of 
trees surrounding Pond I has been avoided and the footprint of the AGI will be 
located within a ploughed arable field, considered to constitute unsuitable 
terrestrial habitat for newts. In addition, Pond H (where the presence of great 
crested newts has been confirmed) is to the west of Houghton Lane, and the 
AGI location is to the east; although this lane does not constitute a significant 
barrier to the movement of newts, they are more likely to use suitable habitats 
immediately surrounding the pond and the terrestrial habitat at the base of the 
roadside hedgerow to the west of Houghton Lane, rather than cross Houghton 
Lane.  Using Natural England’s Rapid Risk Assessment tool, the likelihood of 
an offence being committed as a result of the AGI construction is calculated as 
being ‘likely’, due to the relatively close proximity to the known breeding pond 
(within 100 m) and the footprint of the AGI (0.1-0.5 ha).  However, this is a 
simplistic tool, which does not take into account the habitat suitability affected 
by the works.  Given that suitable terrestrial habitat for newts will be avoided, 
and that the AGI will be installed within an arable field (unsuitable newt 
terrestrial habitat), the likelihood of encountering great crested newts during 
the construction of the AGI is considered to be low.  For this reason, a licence 
from Natural England is not considered necessary for the works to proceed.  
This approach has been confirmed with Natural England (see Table 8.1 in 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
248 
 
Section 8.3 Further detail is provided in Appendix 4.O of the Consultation 
Report (Document Reference 5.2).  
8.9.12 The route of the Gas Connection is 1.82 km in length, involving a 50 m working 
width corridor with 10 m permanent land take.  A total of five sections of 
hedgerows will be removed, four of which are located within 250 m of Pond H. 
The working width through the hedgerows will be minimised as far as possible 
and gaps will be used in the hedgerows to reduce the habitat loss.  The Gas 
Connection will be installed across arable fields, which constitute largely 
unsuitable terrestrial habitat for newts.  Given the small area of suitable habitat 
for newts affected by the installation and the distances involved, the likelihood 
of encountering newts is considered to be low.   
8.9.13 The Electrical Connection will be installed within 250 m of Pond C which 
supports a small population of great crested newts (Population A).  The 
potential for impacts is limited to the footprint of the cable trench, the majority 
of which is located within arable fields.  Although a strip of plantation woodland 
(indicated by Target Note 2 on Figure 2, Appendix 8.1 of this ES) will require 
removal within 250 m of this pond, the area of trees which require clearance 
has been reduced to 0.17 ha (85 m x 20 m). A proportion of this vegetation will 
be coppiced/ pollarded to reduce ground disturbance. There is also suitable 
terrestrial habitat closer to the pond, which great crested newts would also be 
expected to use.  As a consequence, the likelihood of encountering newts is 
considered to be low.  
8.9.14 Using Natural England’s Rapid Risk Assessment tool, the likelihood of an 
offence being committed as a result of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection installation is considered to be ‘highly unlikely’.  As for the Power 
Generation Plant, any requirement to carry out the works under a 
precautionary method statement included within the CEMP or a derogation 
licence issued by Natural England to ensure that no great crested newts are 
harmed during the construction process, will be determined prior to 
construction. This will be based on the historical context of mitigation works 
associated with great crested newts in and adjacent to the Project Site.  Given 
that construction is due to commence six years after the 2014 great crested 
newt surveys were completed; updated surveys may be required to confirm 
the management and/or mitigation measures required which can be expected 
to be implemented through the CEMP. This approach has been agreed with 
Natural England (see Table 8.1 in Section 8.3). 
Reptile population 
8.9.15 The majority of the habitats affected by the Project are considered to be largely 
unsuitable for reptiles, constituting the re-profiled base of Rookery South Pit, 
and arable land.  The exception is the scrub and ephemeral habitats present 
along the existing access track, which constitutes suitable reptile habitat, 
although only a limited amount of habitat will be affected, as described in 
paragraph 8.9.6, above.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
249 
 
8.9.16 The most valuable habitats within the Project Site and adjacent habitats 
specifically associated with the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor, field 
boundaries and the majority of the plantation woodland will not be affected by 
the Gas and Electrical Connection. However, the potential exists for suitable 
reptile habitat to be affected by the felling works to allow the installation of the 
Electrical Connection, in particular associated with the glade and the narrow 
strip of species-rich grassland to the east of this plantation woodland.  
8.9.17 Reptiles are afforded protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 
(as amended).  Any elements of the Project affecting the limited areas of 
potential reptile habitat will give due regard to the legislation protecting 
common and widespread reptile species, i.e. protection against injury and 
killing through implementation of precautionary mitigation measures (this 
approach was agreed with Natural England – see Table 8.1 in Section 8.3 of 
this ES).  This will be achieved through the displacement of any reptiles present 
into areas of retained habitat within and adjacent to the Project Site prior to 
construction works commencing through the following approach: 
 
Progressive removal of suitable low-lying vegetation, including long grass, 
ruderals and scrub, using hand-held tools.  The final stages of clearance to 
ground level should take place during suitable climatic conditions at a time 
of year when reptiles are active (generally April to September inclusive). 
 
Dismantling of any potential hibernacula or refugia by hand, including 
compost heaps and log piles. 
 
Where appropriate, ground level clearance work will be overseen by a 
suitably experienced ecologist who would relocate any reptiles encountered 
to an area of suitable retained habitat within and adjacent to the site. 
 
Following the clearance of vegetation, the vegetation will be maintained at 
ground level to prevent re-colonisation prior to works commencing. 
8.9.18 This is outlined in the LEMMS (Appendix 11.3) and the CEMP (Appendix 3.2). 
Given that construction is due to commence six years after the 2014 reptile 
surveys were completed; updated surveys may be required to confirm the 
management/mitigation measures that will be implemented through the CEMP.  
Breeding birds 
8.9.19 Nesting birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981(as 
amended). Any clearance or cutting of woody vegetation will avoid the 
breeding bird season (generally taken to be March to August inclusive) in order 
to avoid the destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the 
vegetation will be checked prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' 
nests.  If active nests are present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be 
retained around the nest and such works will be delayed until the young birds 
have fledged and the nest becomes inactive.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
250 
 
8.9.20 This will be outlined in the LEMMS (Appendix 11.3) and the CEMP (Appendix 
3.2).  
Local bat population 
8.9.21 All species of bats in the UK are European protected species, benefiting from 
protection under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
(as amended).  They are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 
1981 (as amended). 
8.9.22 The Project layout has been designed to ensure that the tree and scrub-lined 
Access Road, which was found to constitute an important resource for foraging 
and commuting bats will be retained.  Similarly, the plantation woodland edge, 
field margins and road side hedgerows will be retained (as outlined in the 
Landscape and Ecological Mitigation Strategy).  In addition, the Bletchley to 
Bedford Railway corridor will not be affected by the Project.   
8.9.23 There will be no night time working associated with the construction phase of 
the Project.  The lighting scheme associated with the operation of the Project 
has been sensitively designed to minimise potential impacts on bats including 
the following:   
 
Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand; 
 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
 
Demolition and construction lighting should be directed away from all 
sensitive receptors; 
 
Preference should be given to several, lower lighting units rather than tall, 
wide beam lighting units to illuminate large areas as it will limit light 
trespass, glare and sky glow from the Project Site; 
 
Vehicle lights should be properly directed (conforming to MOT 
requirements) and lenses must be intact to prevent un-necessary glare and 
light intrusion; 
 
Lighting should be reduced or switched off when not required for safety 
purposes. Security lighting should be kept at the minimum level needed for 
visual and security protection; and 
 
Motion sensitive lighting will be used in order to avoid unnecessary lighting. 
8.9.24 Light fittings will comply with the specifications and the requirements of CIE 
150 (2003) and Institute of Lighting Engineer’s Guidance Notes for the 
Reduction of Obtrusive Light.  
8.9.25 An outline lighting strategy, setting out measures to minimise effects from 
lighting at the Project Site has been prepared and is included as Appendix 
11.2.    
Enhancement measures 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
 
251 
 
8.9.26 Whilst the scope for enhancement measures within the Project Site is limited 
due to the restricted land-take for the Project, opportunities have been 
maximised to increase the nature conservation value of the area within the 
Order limits, as illustrated on the Landscape and Ecology Strategy Plan. This 
is included in the LEMMS (Appendix 11.3).   
8.9.27 The planting proposed has been designed to ensure the value for biodiversity 
is maximised, whilst performing a landscape screening function.  This will 
involve the creation of a new structurally diverse and species-rich belt of 
woodland planting, to reflect the species composition within the wider Marston 
Vale Forest.  The existing species-poor hedgerow would be augmented and 
additional planting and appropriate management of existing blocks of planted 
woodland would be expected to enhance their nature conservation value.  
Native species of local provenance will be used, wherever possible. These new 
areas of planting linking existing habitats would be expected to increase the 
connectivity of the site for wildlife, including amphibians, reptiles and bats. The 
tree and shrub planting will also provide nesting and foraging resources for 
breeding birds.   
8.9.28 The surface water management ditches proposed as part of the LLRS 
Restoration Strategy will be incorporated into the Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy for the Project, albeit with minor realignments to the north 
and south of the Power Generation Plant. These features may be of value to 
great crested newts, depending upon any flow in the ditches. In addition, a 
series of small ponds will be created within the Project Site, designed to be of 
value to wildlife, with shallow sloping edges planted with marginal vegetation 
to provide egg laying opportunities for newts. The creation of suitable ponds 
will contribute towards objectives in the Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity 
Action Plan, which includes an action plan for great crested newts. The exact 
location of the ponds would be defined prior to construction, in liaison with 
stakeholders.  
8.9.29 Given the negligible nature conservation value of the habitats affected as a 
result of the Project, it is anticipated that the creation of new ponds and 
structurally diverse and species-rich areas of planting, will result in a net gain 
in biodiversity.

8.11 Conclusions  
8.11.1 Baseline conditions at the Power Generation Plant Site comprise the Rookery 
South Clay Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. The Gas and 
Electrical Connections are mainly located within agricultural land.  
8.11.2 At the time that the Project begins construction in 2020 it is assumed that great 
crested newts and reptiles will be absent from the base of the Rookery South 
Pit and surrounding area following completion of the LLRS translocation 
operation and implementation of measures to ensure that the base of the pit 
remains free of ecological constraints.  In addition, the LLRS re-profiling works 
will replace any terrestrial habitat suitable for great crested newts, reptiles, 
breeding birds and/or invertebrates within Rookery South Pit with clay, 
rendering it of negligible nature conservation value for these species.  
Nevertheless, Rookery Clay Pit CWS is considered an Important Ecological 
Feature.  
8.11.3 Construction of the Project could result in the loss, disturbance and/or 
fragmentation of scrub habitat and hedgerows; cause disturbance effects 
associated with lighting proposals to bats and other nocturnal species; and 
cause indirect air quality effects on the retained CWS habitats within the 
Rookery Clay Pit associated with dust and particulate matter emissions.  
However, following the implementation of embedded mitigation measures, no 
likely significant effects have been identified as a result of construction, 
operation or decommissioning of the Project. 
8.11.4 A series of appropriate management measures will be implemented during the 
construction of the Project, to avoid a breach of legislation associated with 
notable and protected species, including nesting birds, reptiles, great crested 
newts, and foraging and commuting bats.   
8.11.5 The LEMMS (Appendix 11.3) for the Project will ensure that any habitats of 
ecological value that would have been created as part of the LLRS (in the 
absence of the Project) will be incorporated into the design.  This includes 
surface water management ditches, and areas of tree and scrub planting.  In 
addition, the creation of a series of new ponds/ scrapes (locations to be defined 
prior to construction), and new planting between retained and proposed 
woodland within the Order Limits, would be expected to result in a net increase 
in biodiversity. This is in accordance with national and local planning policy 
and guidance (NPPF, 2012; ODPM, 2005, and NPS EN1) and the 2006 NERC 
Act.  
8.12 Assessment of Effects on Natural Features (APFP Regulations 2009) 
8.12.1 In addition to the assessment of significant effects presented in this ES, it is 
also necessary to consider all potential effects on sites, features, habitats or 
bodies likely to affected by the Project, not just those effects which are 
significant in EIA terms. This accords with the requirements of Regulation 
5(2)(l) of the APFP Regulations (2009). 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
258 
 
 
8.12.2 Potential significant effects are assessed in Section 8.7 above. Appendices 
8.1-8.5 also present information on sites, features, habitats or bodies likely to 
effected by the Project, as required under Regulation 5(2)l of the APFP 
Regulations (2009). In addition, a plan showing the location of statutory and 
non-statutory sites of nature conservation importance is included as Figure 8.1 
in this ES. 
8.12.3 Habitat receptors considered for the Natural Features assessment are those 
habitats situated within the Project Site only and therefore potentially subject 
to direct impacts. Any indirect disturbance (in the form of increased dust, noise, 
vibration and lighting) that may occur to adjacent habitats will be mitigated 
through the implementation of avoidance measures detailed in the CEMP. This 
will reduce any effects to a negligible level and therefore indirect impacts are 
not considered necessary for inclusion. All species receptors identified were 
included in the Natural Features assessment. 
8.12.4 The majority of effects on Natural Features are negligible or neutral when 
taking mitigation measures that will be delivered by the Project into account. 
Where no mitigation has been proposed the receptors are of such limited value 
for nature conservation that mitigation is not considered.  
8.12.5 The conclusions of this Chapter are that the construction, operation and 
maintenance and decommissioning of the Project does not result in any likely 
significant effects on ecology, either when considered alone or cumulatively 
with other developments.

Water Quality and Resources 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
This Chapter presents the assessment of likely significant effects on water 
quality, water resources, hydrology and flood risk arising from the construction, 
operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the Project. An assessment 
of likely significant effects on groundwater are presented in Chapter 10.  
9.1.2 
The Project has the potential to affect water quality and water resources due 
to construction activities, including earthworks operations, and contamination 
of surface water run-off arising from the Access Road and areas of 
hardstanding associated with the Power Generation Plant. 
9.1.3 
There is also the potential for the Project to affect the existing surface water 
drainage regime and for the Project to be affected by current or future flooding 
events arising from watercourses lying adjacent to or in close proximity to the 
Project Site. 
9.2 
Legislation and Policy Context

SoS Scoping Opinion 
3.55 
The SoS welcomes the fact that an 
FRA will be undertaken. It should 
form an appendix to the ES. 
Noted. The FRA is presented as 
Document Reference 5.4. 
3.13 
The SoS agrees that impacts on 
water quality and water resources 
from operation of the Gas and 
Electrical Connection can be 
scoped out of the assessment. 
Noted. The elements scoped out 
of the assessment are described 
in Section 9.5 and 9.6 of this ES.  
3.57 
The applicant should ensure that 
the assessment of impacts on 
water resources identifies and 
considers all watercourses that may 
be affected, including Mill Brook. 
 
Noted.  The FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4) considers the 
potential impact of the Project 
upon the Mill Brook, as does 
Section 9.6 of this ES.  The FRA 
also considers the nature of flood 
risk arising from the Mill Brook and 
how this may affect the Project. All 
water courses in the vicinity of the 
site have been identified and are 
shown on Figure 9.1.  
3.58 
It should be made clear in the ES 
whether the proposed development 
includes any discharges to water 
and, if so, impacts should be 
robustly assessed. 
No discharges to watercourses will 
occur as a result of the Project. 
It is noted that surface water is 
pumped from the LLRS surface 
water balancing pond to the Mill 
Brook at a rate consistent with an 
existing IDB consent. This is 
discussed in Section 9.5 of this 
ES.

All water body crossing locations 
should be identified in the ES and 
all potential techniques identified 
and assessed. 
Noted. Crossing methods are 
described in Section 9.7 of this 
ES.  
3.61 
Impacts of climate change, in 
relation to rises in sea level and 
increased run off, should be 
considered. 
Rises in sea level are not 
considered relevant to the scope 
of this EIA given the significant 
distance of the Project Site from 
the coast. The surface water 
drainage strategy developed as 
part of the LLRS has been 
designed in accordance with the 
climate change contingency 
allowances set out in the NPPF as 
described in Section 9.6 of this 
ES.

2014) 
Identifies issues to be considered 
for the asset protection of the 
railway, including surface water 
disposal and whether this will affect 
railway infrastructure, especially 
culverts. 
Noted. Provisions for drainage will 
be as per the LLRS which has 
been consented and will not 
impact on Network Rail Assets. 
 
Environment Agency 
Response to 
2014 PEIR 
The current proposals are to utilise 
the existing drainage system to 
discharge surface water.  It must be 
clearly demonstrated that the 
system has sufficient capacity to 
cope with run-off from the new 
development…….and that the 
project does not increase risk to the 
site or third parties. 
Noted.  Details are presented in 
Sections 9.6, 9.7 of this ES and 
the FRA (Document Reference 
5.4). 
We require further information 
regarding pollution prevention, such 
as arrangements during 
construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposal. 
Noted.  Measures for pollution 
control are included as embedded 
mitigation (Section 3.6 of this ES) 
and measures associated with the 
surface water drainage strategy 
are also presented in Sections 9.6 
and 9.7 of this ES and in the FRA 
(Document Reference 5.4).  
It is the responsibility of the 
applicant to ensure that the 
development will not affect any 
water features (i.e. wells, 
boreholes, springs, streams or

9.7 of this ES. 
The responsibility for the provision 
of a mains water supply lies with 
the water undertaker, Anglian 
Water Services.  If the proposal will 
require the abstraction of water the 
applicant should be made aware 
that under the terms of the Water 
Resources Act 1991, an 
Abstraction Licence may be 
required from the Environment 
Agency for the abstraction of water 
from any inland water or 
underground strata. 
Noted.  No abstraction of water 
from any inland water or 
underground strata will occur as a 
result of the Project, as outlined in 
Section 9.7 of this ES.  
Response to 
2017 PEIR 
The site is located entirely within 
Flood Zone 1 (lowest probability of 
flooding) on our Flood Map. 
Noted.  This is consistent with the 
conclusions of the FRA 
(Document Reference 5.4) 
The site is considered to be of 
moderate sensitivity and could 
present potential 
pollutant/contaminant linkages to 
controlled waters. 
Noted.  Chapter 8 considers the 
potential effects of pollution on 
sensitive ecological receptors and 
chapter 10 considers pollution and 
effects on groundwater in more 
detail.  
Please contact the Lead Local 
Flood Authority (LLFA) and the 
Internal Drainage Board (IDB) for 
drainage advice. 
Both the LLFA and IDB have been 
re-consulted (July 2017) and the 
2015 FRA revised/updated in 
accordance with their 
requirements. 
We understand that due to the 
ground conditions of the site, that 
infiltration SuDS are not being 
considered as part of the proposed 
development. 
A surface water drainage system, 
comprising a balancing pond, 
network of interceptor channels

Foul water would most likely be 
sent to a septic tank given the 
limited numbers of staff on site

The development lies within the 
area traditionally supplied by 
Anglian Water Services Ltd.  It is 
assumed that water will be supplied 
using existing sources and under

sought from the water company to 
find out whether this is the case or 
whether a new source needs to be 
developed or a new abstraction 
licence sought.

On the basis that the pumped 
discharge rate for surface water 
from Rookery Pit into Millbrook 
Brook will remain unchanged i.e. 
maintains the status quo and does 
not increase flows into Stewartby 
Lake, the proposal is acceptable. 
The rate of pumping from Rookery

Central Bedfordshire Council 
Pre-application 
advice (letter 
dated 21st 
October 2015) 
Sets out the criteria and design 
principles that should be applied in 
respect of surface water 
management (SuDS). 
The FRA (Document Reference 
5.4) sets out proposals for surface 
water management, prepared in 
accordance with the requirements 
of both the Environment Agency 
and the Internal Drainage Board, 
the foundation of the drainage 
strategy being provided by the 
LLRS. 
9.3.2 
Both the EA and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board (IDB) 
were consulted at several points during the pre-application phase of the Project 
to identify the issues to be addressed and the scope of work required to be 
undertaken to prepare an ES for the Project, along with the supporting FRA 
that is compliant with the NPPF, National Planning Policy Guidance (NPPG) 
and NPSs.   
9.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
9.4.1 
In respect of water quality, water resources, hydrology and flood risk, the range 
of proposed Project parameters (which are described in Chapters 3 and 5 of 
this ES) has no bearing on potential effects on water quality and water 
resources.   
9.5 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
Assessment Methodology 
9.5.1 
The study area extends to include the reaches of watercourse and surface 
water drainage infrastructure shown in Figure 9.1 as (in the professional 
opinion of the assessor) these have the potential for significant interaction with 
the Project.  The study area has also been defined following previous 
consultation with the EA and IDB.  
9.5.2 
To facilitate an understanding of the watercourses and associated structures 
and general landform of the area in and surrounding the Project Site, the 
Project Site was visited by a qualified hydrologist.   
9.5.3 
Data collected as part of the desk based assessment to support preparation of 
this ES and the associated FRA (Document Reference 5.4) includes: 
 
Topographical survey; 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
265 
 
 
 
Water quality data from watercourses in the study area;24,25 
 
Anglian Water sewer records; and 
 
EA flood maps. 
9.5.4 
In addition, and to further assess the nature of flood risk associated with the 
Mill Brook, a hydraulic model of the Mill Brook and its tributary has been 
developed using topographical survey of the Mill Brook corridor undertaken in 
2009.  The hydraulic model extends from a point approximately 200m 
downstream of the Marston Vale Railway and extends to include the Mill Brook 
tributary that lies in close proximity to the southern edge of Rookery South Pit, 
as outlined in Figure 9.1.  The hydraulic model is used to estimate water levels 
associated with flood events of different magnitudes or frequency (i.e. rarity). 
The hydraulic model is presented in more detail in the FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4).  
Elements which have been Scoped out of the Assessment 
9.5.5 
It is anticipated that the operation of the Pipeline of the Gas Connection would 
have no impacts upon water quality and water resources as it does not require 
any water during operation. It will not be at risk from flooding as it is within 
Flood Zone 1 and there will be no increase in impermeable surfaces associated 
with the Pipeline so it will not cause flooding elsewhere and it will not cause 
the release of any silt or contaminants. As agreed by the SoS in the Scoping 
Response (Appendix 1.2), the operational impacts of this part of the Gas 
Connection have therefore been scoped out of this assessment.   
9.5.6 
It is anticipated that the operation of the underground cable part of the 
Electrical Connection would have no impacts upon water quality and water 
resources as it does not require any water during operation. It will not be at risk 
from flooding as it is within Flood Zone 1 and there will be no increase in 
impermeable surfaces associated with the cable and so therefore it will not 
increase the risk of causing flooding elsewhere and it will not cause the release 
of any silt or contaminants. As agreed by the SoS in the Scoping Response 
(Appendix 1.2), the operational impacts of these parts of the Electrical 
Connection have therefore been scoped out of this assessment.   
9.5.7 
Information collated as part of the Ground Conditions Chapter (Chapter 10) 
and the Geo-environmental Phase 1 Report (Appendix 10.1) have not 
identified any evidence of elevated groundwater levels or records of

groundwater flooding.  Flooding arising from groundwater sources is not 
therefore considered to be an issue at the Project Site. 
9.5.8 
Water Framework Directive (WFD) screening has been undertaken to identify 
the extent to which the Project is likely to affect waterbodies in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.  
9.5.9 
The study area (zone of influence) extends to include the reaches of 
watercourse and surface water drainage infrastructure shown in Figure 9.1 as 
(in the professional opinion of the assessor) these have the potential for 
interaction with the Project.  The study area has also been defined following 
previous consultation with the EA and IDB.  
9.5.10 
The screening has been undertaken in accordance with PINS Advice Note 18 
‘Water Framework Directive’.  
9.5.11 
The impact on all waterbodies shown on Figure 9.1 is considered to be 
negligible (see assessment of effects in section 9.7), and the Project is not 
regarded to pose a risk of deterioration or a risk to the water body status of 
Stewartby Lake (the only identified River Basin Management Plan water body 
in the vicinity of the Project Site). As such, a WFD compliance assessment has 
been scoped out. Further information on baseline status of waterbodies is 
provided in section 9.6 and an assessment of effects is provided in section 9.7.  
 
 
Assumptions and Limitations 
9.5.12 
The assumptions and limitations used in this assessment are as per Section 
4.8 of this ES. Additionally, it has been assumed that no water will be required 
for NOx control for the Generating Equipment, that no water would be required 
for typical operation of the Gas Connection or Electrical Connection and that 
the LLRS works will proceed as outlined in section 3.1.  
Significance Criteria 
9.5.13 
There are no ‘industry standard’ significance criteria for the consideration of 
water quality, water resources, hydrology and flood risk impacts and it has 
therefore been necessary to employ a qualitative approach based upon 
available knowledge and professional judgement. 
9.5.14 
The significance of effects has been assessed through consideration of their 
magnitude, duration and nature (i.e. reversible or irreversible) and also the 
geographic context (i.e. highly localised or widespread).  The significance 
criteria are outlined in Table 9.2 below. Effects of moderate or above are 
deemed to be significant.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Power Generation Plant 
9.6.1 
Rookery South Pit will be subject to the LLRS works prior to construction of the 
Project in 2020, as described in paragraph 3.1.4 of this ES.  This will result in 
changes to watercourses, surface water drainage characteristics and the 
nature of flood risk within and in the vicinity of Rookery Pit, as outlined below 
in paragraph 9.6.7.  The completion of the LLRS works therefore provides the 
baseline for the assessment of likely significant environmental effects relating 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
268 
 
 
to water quality, water resources, hydrology and flood risk associated with the 
Project. 
9.6.2 
The Mill Brook flows to the north, close to the western boundary of Rookery 
South Pit, and drains a predominantly rural catchment of approximately 2.9 
km2. It passes through a culvert beneath the Marston Vale Railway Line and 
ultimately outfalls to Stewartby Lake a further 400 m downstream.  A tributary 
watercourse draining a catchment of 0.9 km2 joins the Mill Brook to the east of 
South Pillinge Farm. These watercourses are shown on Figure 9.1. 
9.6.3 
The 
EA's 
Flood 
map 
for 
planning 
(https://flood-map-for-
planning.service.gov.uk) does not include the Mill Brook watercourse and its 
tributary on account of the small size of the contributing catchment area. 
9.6.4 
The nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook has therefore been 
assessed using a hydraulic model, the results of which are presented in detail 
in the FRA (Document Reference 5.4).  The model provides a series of design 
flood levels for the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 100 year plus climate change (i.e. 
increase in fluvial flows of 35 percent, as defined by the EA guidance titled 
‘Flood risk assessments: climate change allowances (February 2016)’ events.  
The modelling analysis suggests that floodwater may spill into the south east 
corner of Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 year event.  
9.6.5 
The Power Generation Plant Site landform is such that any floodwater spill into 
the Pit will be intercepted and routed to the Rookery South Pit attenuation pond 
as part of the drainage works implemented as part of the LLRS.   
9.6.6 
The principal components of the LLRS works in respect of surface water 
drainage are as follows: 
 
Excavation to form an attenuation pond within the north west area of 
Rookery South Pit, sized to provide sufficient storage to accommodate the 
1 in 100 year rainfall event (plus climate change) and cater for a 1 in 10 
year (plus climate change) event following within one week of the 1 in 100 
year (plus climate change) rainfall event; 
 
Re-profiling of the base of the Pit such that surface water run-off sheds 
towards the attenuation pond; 
 
In addition to re-profiling the base of the Pit, an interceptor channel will have 
been constructed to intercept surface water run-off and convey it to the 
attenuation pond; 
 
Surface water run-off that collects within the Rookery South Pit attenuation 
pond will be pumped to Rookery North Pit as a strategic attenuation facility 
at a rate of 100 l/s and to Mill Brook at a rate of 23 l/s in accordance with 
an existing Consent to Discharge (surface water flows).  Water will be 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
269 
 
 
discharged from Rookery North Pit back to the attenuation pond in Rookery 
South Pit at a rate of no more than 23 l/s26; 
 
The normal water level within Rookery North Pit will have been drawn down 
from 36 m to 35 m AOD to allow Rookery North Pit to be used as a strategic 
attenuation facility; 
9.6.7 
It is noted here that one of the LLRS surface water drainage channels is 
currently planned to be located where the Generating Equipment is located. 
However, this will be re-aligned prior to construction of the Project and the 
surrounding landform re-profiled so that there will be no conflict between the 
LLRS surface water management strategy and the Project.  
9.6.8 
On this basis, that part of Rookery South Pit that will accommodate the Power 
Generation Plant will not be affected by flooding associated with either the 1 in 
100 year or 1 in 100 year plus climate change events. 
9.6.9 
In 2015 it was agreed with the EA that, following implementation of the LLRS, 
the Power Generation Plant Site would be classified as Flood Zone 1. 
9.6.10 
In accordance with the Flood Risk Vulnerability Classification set out in Table 
2 of the NPPF Planning Practice Guidance, the Generating Equipment is 
classified as Essential Infrastructure.  Essential Infrastructure is defined as that 
which is essential to the needs of the country and includes ‘electricity 
generating power stations’. 
9.6.11 
Taken together, the Flood Zones and the Flood Risk Vulnerability

The relevant sewerage and water undertaker for the study area is Anglian 
Water.  There are no existing public sewers located within or adjacent to the 
Project Site. 
9.6.13 
Assessment of the water quality of the surface water bodies in the vicinity of 
the Generating Equipment Site has been undertaken since 199927,28.  During 
this time, surface water samples have been taken from the lakes in Rookery 
South Pit (prior to the implementation of any works associated with the LLRS) 
and Rookery North Pit, Harrowden Brook, the Mill Brook tributary, Mill Brook 
watercourse and Stewartby Lake. 
9.6.14 
Analyses have included testing for a range of potential contaminants.

9.6.15 
The data29 shows that the ammonia concentration within all of the water bodies 
is generally low.  The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) concentration is also 
generally low. 
9.6.16 
Sulphate concentrations within the Rookery North Pit and the Rookery South 
Pit lakes are consistently higher than those within the surrounding ditches and 
within Stewartby Lake. The sulphate concentrations within the Rookery North 
Pit and Rookery South Pit lakes are also considerably higher than the 
threshold for the protection of controlled waters (400 mg/l) and the threshold 
for the protection of human health (250 mg/l).  
9.6.17 
The chloride concentrations and electrical conductivity are also generally 
higher in the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit lakes than the 
surrounding water bodies, although elevated concentrations are recorded on 
occasion within Mill Brook and Harrowden Brook.  The chloride concentrations 
are generally below the threshold criteria for the protection of controlled waters 
and for the protection of human health (other than a single exceedance 
recorded in the Rookery North Pit Lake in 2000).  The electrical conductivity 
values recorded within the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit lakes are 
intermittently above the threshold criteria for the protection of human health 
(no available criteria for the protection of controlled waters).   
9.6.18 
The lakes within the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit (prior to the 
implementation of the LLRS) collected surface water run-off from a large area 
across the base and sides of the pits that are underlain by Oxford Clay.  The 
elevated concentrations of sulphates that have been recorded within the water 
bodies of the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit reflect the naturally 
occurring high sulphate levels within the Oxford Clay.  The waters within the 
surrounding brooks and the nearby Stewartby Lake are also influenced by the 
geochemistry of the underlying Oxford Clay but to a lesser extent since these 
water bodies are subject to some degree of natural attenuation and/or dilution 
during periods of rainfall when flowing waters may be present within the 
brooks. 
9.6.19 
The concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Semi Volatile 
Organic Compounds (SVOC), Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), dioxins, furans 
and pesticides have all been consistently below or very close to the laboratory 
detection limits and the data5 shows no evidence of contamination having 
occurred at the Power Generation Plant Site.

9.6.20 
On the basis of the measures outlined above, the historic water quality 
information set out for Rookery North and South Pits, Stewartby Lake, Mill 
Brook and its tributaries, and Harrowden Brook is considered to represent a 
robust baseline within the context of water quality with which to assess the 
likely significant effects on water quality and water resources arising from the 
development of the Power Generation Plant. 
9.6.21 
The area in which the Project Site is located is administered by the Anglian 
River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) and the Ouse Upper and Bedford 
management catchment. The EA does not include RBMP data on the Mill 
Brook on account of its small size, however, status objectives are available for 
the Stewartby Lake (approximately 75 m from the Access Road at its closest 
point) which is the only RBMP waterbody identified in the vicinity of the Project 
Site. Stewartby Lake has been classified by the EA as having an overall 
waterbody status of Moderate, with a chemical status of Good, an ecological 
status of Moderate, and a hydromorphological status of ‘Supports Good’.  
Gas Connection 
9.6.22 
The Mill Brook tributary rises approximately 700 m to the south of Rookery 
South Pit in the vicinity of the point where the Millbrook Road crosses the 
Midland Mainline Railway.  The tributary passes close to the Gas Connection 
Route Corridor at a point approximately 500 m south of Rookery South Pit.  In 
the vicinity of the south east corner of Rookery South Pit the tributary turns to 
the west and follows a route a short distance to the south of the southern edge 
of Rookery South Pit.  The tributary passes through the Route Corridor at a 
point approximately 500 m from the south eastern corner of Rookery South Pit. 
9.6.23 
The hydraulic modelling analysis has shown that floodwater may spill from the 
tributary into the south east corner of Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 
year event.  However, the spill occurs in a very localised area along the upper 
reach of the tributary and the rate of floodwater spill is very low. 
9.6.24 
The Gas Connection crosses a ditch/field drain (immediately to the north of the 
Millbrook Road) and the Mill Brook Tributary (flowing along the southern edge 
of Rookery South Pit). 
9.6.25 
Water quality in the vicinity of the Gas Connection is as reported for the Power 
Generation Plant.  
Electrical Connection 
9.6.26 
The Mill Brook passes immediately to the west of the point of connection to the 
existing National Grid infrastructure and the Mill Brook tributary passes 
beneath the Electrical Connection.  The hydraulic modelling analysis has 
shown that the area of the Electrical Connection is not affected by flooding. 
9.6.27 
Water quality in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection is as reported for the 
Power Generation Plant.

Assessment of Effects 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction / Decommissioning  
9.7.1 
The main construction / decommissioning activities associated with the Power 
Generation Plant are outlined in Section 3.5 of this ES.  
9.7.2 
The main construction activities which have the potential to impact on water 
quality and water resources are the compaction of the ground caused by 
construction plant and an increase in the extent of impermeable surfaces 
associated with access tracks and compounds, which has the potential to 
increase surface water run-off to the Rookery South Pit interceptor channels 
and surface water balancing pond. 
9.7.3 
As set out in Section 9.6 of this ES, the LLRS includes works to facilitate the 
management of surface water run-off within Rookery South Pit and these 
works will be implemented prior to construction of the Project.  The Power 
Generation Plant Site falls within the catchment of the LLRS surface water 
drainage system, which has been designed assuming that the entire Pit is 
impermeable.  The LLRS drainage system therefore offers adequate capacity 
to accommodate run-off arising from additional impermeable areas associated 
with the Power Generation Plant Site.  The effect from flooding is therefore 
considered to be Negligible and is Not Significant. 
9.7.4 
Construction / decommissioning activities also have the potential to give rise 
to 
the 
contamination 
of 
surface 
waters 
resulting 
from 
spilled 
hydrocarbons/petrochemicals from construction plant, and the mobilisation of 
silts during earthworks operations leading to increased silt loading in 
watercourses.  However, such impacts would be controlled by the embedded 
mitigation measures implicit within the Project, as outlined in Section 3.6 of this 
ES, for example industry standard/best practice and other embedded 
mitigation secured by way of a CEMP.  The extent of any effects would be 
local, the duration short term and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  
On this basis, the effect is considered to be Negligible and is therefore Not 
Significant.  
Operation 
9.7.5 
The Power Generation Plant Site will give rise to an increase in the 
impermeable area within Rookery South Pit, thereby increasing run-off to the 
Rookery South Pit interceptor channels and surface water balancing pond.  
However, as noted above, the Power Generation Plant Site falls within the 
catchment of the LLRS surface water drainage system, which offers adequate 
capacity to accommodate run-off arising from additional impermeable areas 
within Rookery South Pit.  As the baseline takes into account the LLRS no 
further mitigation is therefore required over and above that embedded into the 
design of the Project.   The extent of any effects would be local, the duration 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
274 
 
 
short term and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  The impact in 
flood risk terms is therefore considered to be Negligible and is Not Significant.  
9.7.6 
The additional impermeable area associated with the length of Access Road 
extending from Green Lane to the north-west corner of Rookery South Pit (e.g. 
outside of the catchment of the Rookery South Pit LLRS drainage system) 
equates to approximately 17,200 m2.  It is proposed that surface water run-off 
from this area drains via channels on either side of the Access Road to the 
Rookery South Pit attenuation pond.  Calculations undertaken as part of the 
FRA (Document Reference 5.4) have shown that there would be sufficient 
capacity in the LLRS drainage system and attenuation pond to accommodate 
this run-off.  As the baseline takes into account the LLRS no further mitigation 
is therefore required over and above that embedded into the design of the 
project. The extent of any effects would be local, the duration short term and 
there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  The impact in flood risk terms 
is therefore considered to be Negligible and is Not Significant.  
9.7.7 
During the operational phase, there is the potential for the contamination of 
surface water resulting from the flushing of silts and hydrocarbons from areas 
of hardstanding within the Power Generation Plant Site.  However, such 
impacts would be controlled by the embedded mitigation measures referred to 
above, comprising industry standard/best practice and measures required to 
ensure legislative compliance, contained within an operational environmental 
management plan, to be developed by the operator prior to commissioning of 
the Project.  The extent of any effects would be local, the duration short term 
and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  On this basis, the impact 
is considered to be Negligible and is therefore Not Significant.  
Gas Connection 
Construction / Decommissioning 
9.7.8 
Construction of the Gas Connection is described in Section 3.5 of this ES, 
which may include temporary drainage/de-watering measures to prevent 
water-logging of the pipeline trench and enable the crossing of field drains. 
9.7.9 
The potential effects along the Gas Connection would be associated with 
installation of the Pipeline by either standard open-cut, cross-country pipeline 
construction techniques or trenchless techniques.  Construction of the Pipeline 
will necessitate the crossing of a ditch/field drain (immediately to the north of 
the Millbrook Road) and the Mill Brook Tributary (flowing along the southern 
edge of Rookery South Pit). 
9.7.10 
Although the field drain and tributary are over 1 m deep, environmental surveys 
and visual inspection suggests that an open cut crossing technique is 
preferred.  Further study into the depth or local significance of the field drain 
may require that a trenchless crossing be considered in the future, however 
the investigations to date have shown no such concern.  Standard techniques 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
275 
 
 
for pumping around the crossing for the duration of the open cut works will 
maintain the flow.  
9.7.11 
The laying of temporary surfacing material for access purposes, establishment 
of temporary construction compounds, stockpiling areas and compaction of the 
ground due to construction plant has the potential to reduce the permeability 
of the ground, leading to increased surface water run-off to nearby 
watercourses.  Similarly, the installation of temporary drainage/de-watering 
measures 
could 
potentially 
increase 
flows 
in 
nearby 
drains/ditches/watercourses.  Construction activities also have the potential to 
give rise to the contamination of surface waters resulting from spilled 
hydrocarbons/petrochemicals from construction plant and the mobilisation of 
silts during earthworks operations and open-cut works, leading to increased 
silt loading in watercourses. 
9.7.12 
Such impacts will be controlled by the embedded mitigation measures implicit 
within the Project as outlined in Section 3.6 of this ES and set out in the CEMP.  
The extent of any effects would be local, the duration short term and there 
would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  On this basis, all of the above impacts 
are considered to be Negligible and therefore Not Significant.  
9.7.13 
The crossing of ditches/drains/watercourses using open-cut techniques has 
the potential to reduce the flow capacity and/or change the flow regime, 
thereby leading to a temporary increase in localised flood risk.  However, flows 
will be managed by over-pumping or the creation of flow diversion channels, 
in accordance with the methodologies set out in the embedded mitigation 
measures in section 3.6.  The extent of any effects would be local, the duration 
short term and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence, such that impacts 
would be Negligible and therefore Not Significant.  
Operation 
9.7.14 
The only above ground structure associated with the Gas Connection is the 
AGI.  This will give rise to an increase in the impermeable area within the 
catchment of the Mill Brook tributary, thereby increasing surface water run-off 
to the watercourse. However, the surface water drainage would be managed 
by way of soakaways on the perimeter of the AGI. The extent of any effects 
would be local, and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  The impact 
in flood risk terms is therefore considered to be Negligible and is Not 
Significant.  
Electrical Connection 
Construction / Decommissioning  
9.7.15 
The principal activities associated with construction / decommissioning of the 
Electrical Connection are described in Section 3.5 of this ES.   
9.7.16 
Construction / decommissioning activities associated with the Electrical 
Connection have the potential to reduce the permeability of the ground, leading 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
276 
 
 
to increased surface water run-off.  Construction activities also have the 
potential to give rise to the contamination of surface waters resulting from 
spilled hydrocarbons/petrochemicals from construction plant and the 
mobilisation of silts during earthworks operations and excavation for the cable 
trench and SECs, leading to increased silt loading in watercourses. 
9.7.17 
Such impacts will be controlled by the embedded mitigation measures implicit 
within the Project as outlined in Section 3.6 of this ES set out in the CEMP. 
These are: 
 
siting stockpiles away from watercourses;  
 
refuelling on areas of hardstanding only away from watercourses and 
surface drains; and 
 
installing construction site drainage.  
9.7.18 
On this basis, the impacts are considered to be Negligible and therefore Not 
Significant. 
Operation 
9.7.19 
The Substation will give rise to an increase in the impermeable area within 
Rookery South Pit, thereby increasing run-off to the Rookery South Pit 
interceptor channels and surface water balancing pond.  However, the 
substation falls within the catchment of the LLRS surface water drainage 
system, which offers adequate capacity to accommodate run-off arising from 
additional impermeable areas within Rookery South Pit.  No additional 
mitigation is therefore required and the impact in flood risk terms is considered 
to be Negligible and is Not Significant. 
9.7.20 
The SECs will give rise to an increase in the impermeable area within the 
catchment of the Mill Brook tributary, thereby increasing surface water run-off 
to the watercourse. However, the surface water drainage would be managed 
by way of soakaways on the perimeter of the SECs. The extent of any effects 
would be local, and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  The impact 
in flood risk terms is therefore considered to be Negligible and is Not 
Significant.  
9.7.21 
During the operational phase, there is the potential for the contamination of 
surface water resulting from the flushing of silts and hydrocarbons from areas 
of hardstanding within the substation compound.  There is also the risk of 
leakage from any oil-filled electrical apparatus contaminating surface waters.  
However, such impacts would be controlled by the embedded mitigation 
measures implicit within the Project, comprising industry standard/best 
practice and measures required to ensure legislative compliance and the use 
of an operational environmental management plan (secured as part of the 
Environmental Permit). During operation, the EA will set limits on the quality of 
water that is discharged from the Project Site under the Environmental Permit. 
On this basis, the impact is considered to be Negligible and is therefore Not 
Significant. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
277 
 
 
Water Framework Directive 
9.7.22 
An assessment of potential effects has been undertaken which considers the 
main construction, operation and decommissioning activities that have the 
potential to impact on water quality and water resources.  The assessment 
concluded that although there is potential for temporary contamination of 
surface waters resulting from spilled hydrocarbons/petrochemicals from 
construction plant and the mobilisation of silts during earthworks operations, 
the extent of any effects would be local, the duration short term and there would 
be a low likelihood of occurrence.  Any impacts would be controlled by the 
embedded mitigation measures implicit within the Project, such as a CEMP 
(outlined in Section 3.6).  On this basis, the impact on all waterbodies shown 
on Figure 9.1 is considered to be Negligible (see assessment of effects in 
section 9.7), and the Project is not regarded to pose a risk of deterioration or 
a risk to the water body status. As such, a WFD compliance assessment has 
been scoped out. 
9.8 
Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Overview 
9.8.1 
Construction, decommissioning or operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Section 4.10.  However, the majority of these proposed developments are 
distant from the Project Site (greater than 2 km).  
9.8.2 
These developments and any effects arising from them are outside the study 
area for this topic and there is no overlap in the study areas within which 
significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no cumulative or 
in combination effects are likely to arise in relation to water quality and water 
resources during the construction, decommissioning or operation phases of 
the Project. Furthermore, each of these developments will be bound by its own 
CEMP and will apply best practice construction methods to minimise impacts 
on water quality and water resources. To be policy compliant, other schemes 
must incorporate measures to ensure development does not increase flood 
risk elsewhere, and that water quality is not adversely affected. Based on 
professional judgement, there are therefore not considered to be any 
cumulative effects from these projects. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
9.8.3 
The projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for this chapter (taken from Section 4.10 of this ES) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facility at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, (immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
9.8.4 
Little detail is known about the Integrated Waste Management Facility 
proposed for development in the Rookery South Pit. It is understood that a 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
278 
 
 
request for a scoping opinion was previously submitted by the promoter of the 
project, although no details are provided regarding potential impacts on water 
quality or water resources as a result of the project. However, it is likely that 
this development will be bound by its own CEMP and best practice construction 
methods to limit impacts on water resources during construction. Should it go 
ahead, then it will need to consider the Project to ensure that no significant 
cumulative effects will arise between it and the Project. Nevertheless, to 
minimise the possibility of cumulative effects arising, a CEMP will be followed 
during construction of the Project, which will ensure best practice construction 
methods are followed and limit, as far as practicable, the possibility of impacts 
upon water quality. The measures proposed to minimise impacts during 
construction are listed in Section 3.6 of this ES and include e.g. siting 
stockpiles away from watercourses and refuelling on areas of hardstanding 
only.  
9.8.5 
Furthermore, given the early stage of the Integrated Waste Management 
proposals and the likely time required to achieve planning consent, it is 
considered unlikely that there would be any overlap on the construction periods 
of these two projects, which further mitigates against any potential cumulative 
effects.  
9.8.6 
The ES for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site concluded that there were (pre-mitigation) potential impacts arising from 
construction and decommissioning of the project on water quality and water 
resources.   
9.8.7 
These include impacts on controlled waters from the potential release of 
contaminants and silts. 
9.8.8 
However, the Covanta RRF ES concluded that embedded mitigation measures 
required, such as the use of a CoCP, CEMP and working within best practice 
guidelines, will prevent the release of contamination and therefore negate any 
effects on controlled waters during construction and decommissioning. The 
implementation of the embedded mitigation described in this Chapter means 
that there will be no effects arising from the construction and de-commissioning 
of the Project on controlled waters either.  
9.8.9 
The effects on controlled waters associated with construction of the Project (no 
effect) considered together with the effects associated with construction of the 
Covanta RRF Project (no effect) would not give rise to a significant cumulative 
effect or give rise to new or different effects that would occur if the projects are 
constructed independently of one another.  
Operation 
9.8.10 
As above, the projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for the operation of the Project (taken from Section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facility at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
279 
 
 
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit (immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
9.8.11 
Little detail is known about the Integrated Waste Management Facility 
proposed for development in the Rookery Pit. As set out above, it is understood 
that a request for a scoping opinion was previously submitted by the promoter 
of the project.  However, no details are provided in the scoping report regarding 
potential impacts on water quality and water resources. Should the 
development go ahead, then it will need to consider the Project to ensure that 
no cumulative effects will arise between it and the Project as this development 
will follow development of the Project. Nevertheless, the assessment set out 
in this ES has shown no significant effects on water quality and water 
resources associated with the Project. 
9.8.12 
The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were a number of 
(pre-mitigation) potential impacts arising from operation of the project on water 
resources. 
9.8.13 
These include potential impacts on surface water run-off. 
9.8.14 
However, the Covanta RRF ES demonstrated that embedded mitigation 
measures required as part of the Covanta RRF Project, such as surface water 
attenuation provision as part of Phase 1 of the LLRS, will be sufficient to 
accommodate the increase in impermeable area and associated increase in 
surface water run-off. Therefore, embedded mitigation measures will negate 
any negative effects.  
9.8.15 
The effects on water quality and water resources associated with operation of 
the Project (no effects) considered together with the effects associated with 
operation of the Covanta RRF Project (no effects) will not give rise to a 
significant cumulative effect or give rise to new or different effects that would 
occur if the projects are operational independently of one another.  
9.8.16 
Following the granting of the DCO for the Covanta RRF Project, Requirement 
12 was set out relating to surface water and foul water drainage. It states: 
“(1) Except where the authorised development is constructed in accordance 
with the approved drainage strategies, details of the surface and foul water 
drainage system (including means of pollution control and information 
demonstrating compliance with the best practice for sustainable drainage 
schemes) must be submitted to and approved in writing by Central Bedfordshire 
Council. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Central Bedfordshire Council, 
such details must accord with the principles of the drainage strategy submitted 
with the application, making provision for the construction of Work No. 3, and 
must be implemented in accordance with the approved details. 
 
(2) The drainage strategy must provide that all drains provided as part of the 
authorised development must, where necessary and appropriate, contain trap 
gullies or interceptors”. 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
280 
 
 
 
9.8.17 
The drainage strategy outlined in this Chapter, and the FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4), have taken account of the drainage strategies proposed by 
Covanta in their DCO Application. Both drainage strategies are also based 
largely on the wider drainage strategy for the Rookery South Pit, to be 
delivered as part of the LLRS. There are therefore not anticipated to be any 
conflicts between the two projects. 
Effect Interactions 
9.8.18 
Chapter 8 considers the potential effects of pollution (e.g. entering 
watercourses) on sensitive ecological receptors. 
9.8.19 
Chapter 10 considers effects of pollution and effects on groundwater in more 
detail.  
9.9 
Additional Mitigation  
9.9.1 
Following the implementation of the embedded mitigation measures adopted 
as part of the Project, as outlined in Section 3.6 of this ES, it is concluded that 
impacts associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning 
phases are Not Significant.  On this basis, no project specific mitigation is 
required in addition to the embedded design mitigation that is proposed.  
9.10

Conclusions 
9.11.1 
The Mill Brook flows to the north, close to the western boundary of Rookery 
South Pit, and drains a predominantly rural catchment of approximately 2.9 
km2. It passes through a culvert beneath the Marston Vale Railway Line and 
ultimately outfalls to Stewartby Lake a further 400 m downstream.  A tributary 
watercourse draining a catchment of 0.9 km2 joins the Mill Brook to the east of 
South Pillinge Farm. These watercourses are shown in Figure 9.1. 
9.11.2 
The flood risk associated with the Project Site has been assessed using a 
hydraulic model and undertaking a separate FRA (Document Reference 5.4). 
9.11.3 
Construction of the Project has the potential to mobilise silts and contamination 
as well as construction and operational activities themselves being at risk from 
flooding. However, following the implementation of embedded mitigation 
measures, no likely significant effects have been identified as a result of 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. 
9.11.4 
The assessment of the potential effects of the Project on water quality and 
water resources presented in this ES has shown that the Project will not result 
in any likely significant environmental effects in relation to water quality and 
water resources either as a standalone project or cumulatively with other 
projects.

Ground Conditions 
10.1 
Introduction 
10.1.1 
This Chapter presents the assessment of likely significant effects of the Project 
on ground conditions (including land stability and geological hazards) arising 
from the construction, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning of 
the Project. 
10.1.2 
The Project has the potential to affect ground conditions due to the potential 
release of pollution during construction and decommissioning activities and the 
introduction of new pathways between groundwater aquifers during installation 
of foundations. It is also recognised that the groundwater within the underlying 
strata within the Rookery South Pit has the potential to be under artesian 
pressures and as such needs to be considered in relation to the construction 
practices, final development levels and any buried structures of the Project 
once constructed.

A Foundation Works Risk 
Assessment (FWRA) will need 
to be produced to determine 
the risks to the underlying 
aquifers from proposed 
possible piled foundations, as 
much of the site is understood 
to be underlain by a shallow 
depth of clay above the 
Kellaways Sand (Secondary A 
Aquifer). A better 
understanding should be 
made to the sensitivity of the 
Blisworth Limestone 
Formation (Principal Aquifer), 
which we understand to be 
uplifted due to faulting to the 
north of the site. This highly 
sensitive aquifer may be 
adjacent to the proposed 
piles. 
Noted. Reference to a 
FWRA has been included 
in Section 10.7. An 
assessment of the 
sensitivity of the 
underlying aquifers is

Consultation Response to PEIR

An agricultural land survey 
and soil resources 
assessment should be 
considered for the Project Site 
to quantify any impacts on 
agricultural land and soil 
quality.  
Further detail on soil 
quality and agricultural 
land is provided in section 
10.5.  
10.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
10.4.1 
In respect of ground conditions, the range of proposed Project parameters 
(which are described in Chapters 3 and 5 of this ES) have no bearing on 
potential effects on ground conditions as the worst case total area for 
development has been assumed  throughout the ES.   
10.5 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
10.5.1 
The study area is defined as the Project Site and a 1km radius from the Project 
Site as, based on professional judgement and accepted industry practice, this 
is considered to represent the likely zone of influence of any impacts on ground 
conditions or from contamination. Where impacts have the potential for effects 
further afield than this, this has been identified.  
10.5.2 
The assessment of the ground conditions at the Project Site has been 
undertaken by following a tiered approach as recommended within the industry 
guidance (namely the Model Procedures for the Management of Contaminated 
Land (CLR11)):  
 
Tier 1 – a qualitative assessment of historical and published information, 
together with a site reconnaissance, undertaken in order to develop a 
preliminary conceptual site model and inform a preliminary risk 
assessment;  
 
Tier 2 – an assessment of ground condition data using published generic 
assessment criteria to screen the site and establish whether there are 
actual, or potential, unacceptable risks; and (if required); 
 
Tier 3 - detailed - a quantitative assessment involving the generation of site 
specific assessment criteria (SSAC). 
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
290 
 
10.5.3 
For this assessment, Tier 1 and Tier 2 assessments have been undertaken. 
The requirement for a Tier 3 assessment has not been identified following the 
completion of the Tier 2 Assessment, which showed no actual, or potential, 
unacceptable risk that required a Tier 3 assessment. The results of the Tier 1 
and Tier 2 assessments form the basis for the baseline conditions and 
assessment of effects within this ES chapter. 
10.5.4 
The assessment has involved a study of available desk based information 
(including the results of previous soil sampling for investigations undertaken 
within the wider Rookery Pit) as well as a site walkover survey together with 
groundwater monitoring of existing boreholes and surface water monitoring at 
the site undertaken in 2014 and 2017.  
10.5.5 
In order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of contamination could 
potentially lead to harmful consequences a source-pathway-receptor 
methodology is adopted, with the underlying principle that the identification of 
pollutant linkages consists of the following three elements: 
 
A source/hazard (a substance or situation that has the potential to cause 
harm or pollution); 
 
A pathway (a means by that the hazard moves along / generates 
exposure); and 
 
A receptor/target (an entity that is vulnerable to the potential adverse 
effects of the hazard). 
10.5.6 
Without a pollutant linkage, the contamination may be a potential hazard but 
does not constitute a risk unless all three elements are present. Therefore, in 
assessing the potential for contamination to cause a significant effect, the 
extent and nature of the potential source or sources of contamination must be 
assessed, pathways identified, and sensitive receptors or resources identified 
and appraised, to determine their value and sensitivity to contamination related 
impacts.  
10.5.7 
The methodology adopted in this chapter is qualitative with a progression from 
factual information (stated with reasonable certainty) regarding the baseline 
conditions, to appraisal informed by professional judgement and expression of 
opinions on the relative significance. 
10.5.8 
Baseline conditions for the study area have been identified for the purpose of 
this ES using a Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (GCA) for the site, 
undertaken by PBA in 2014 and updated in 2017 which presents information 
on the geotechnical and geoenvironmental setting of the Project Site and study 
area, included as Appendix 10.1, combined with a walkover of the site in July 
2017.   
10.5.9 
The PBA 2017 report describes the types and locations of: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
291 
 
 
Potential Sources of Contamination (PSCs), based on identification of 
current and historic land use; and 
 
Potential Geological Hazards (PGHs), (such as ground stability hazards 
that may result from artificial and natural cavities, and potential adverse 
foundation conditions that may be affected by compressibility, 
shrinkage/swelling of clay stratum, groundwater and drainage).  
10.5.10 The GCA report also identifies the type and sensitivity of potential receptors 
(including consideration of human health, buildings, groundwater, surface 
water and certain ecological systems) and identification of possible migration 
or transportation pathways.   
Elements Scoped out of the Assessment 
10.5.11 There are not considered to be any potential impacts on ground conditions as 
a result of the operation and maintenance of the Gas Connection as the 
operational phase will not result in any ground disturbance, nor will there be 
any potential release of contaminants to land or water as no operational 
requirements need any potentially polluting substances. This has therefore 
been scoped out of the assessment. 
10.5.12 There are not considered to be any potential impacts on ground conditions as 
a result of the operation and maintenance of the Electrical Connection as the 
operational phase will not result in any ground disturbance, nor will there be 
any potential release of contaminants to land or water as no operational 
requirements need any potentially polluting substances. This has therefore 
been scoped out of the assessment. 
Agricultural Land and Soils 
10.5.13 The majority of the Project is sited within brownfield land (Power Generation 
Plant, Substation, Laydown Area and Access Road). The Gas Pipeline part of 
the Gas Connection and the underground cable element of the Electrical 
Connection would both be buried in agricultural land.  
10.5.14 The remaining elements of the Project sited on agricultural land include the 
Gas Connection AGI (approximately 0.5ha) and the Electrical Connection 
SECs (approximately 0.4ha). Although these elements are sited on agricultural 
land, it is Grade 3 according to the Agricultural Land Classification and 
therefore not the best quality or most fertile land (Grades 1 and 2).  Although 
the areas have not been assessed as part of the post 1998 agricultural land 
assessment, land immediately to the east of the Access Road has, which 
further classifies this land as Grade 3b – “Land capable of producing moderate 
yields of a narrow range of crops, principally cereals and grass or lower yields 
of a wider range of crops or high yields of grass which can be grazed or 
harvested over most of the year”. Therefore, there is a high possibility that land 
on which the Gas and Electrical Connections sit is also Grade 3b.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
292 
 
10.5.15 Additionally, the area required for the SECs has already been taken out of 
agricultural tenancy and is no longer farmed.  
10.5.16 A CEMP would be produced prior to construction on site, along with method 
statements for construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. 
These documents would advise on the most appropriate working methods to 
protect, as far as is possible and practicable, agricultural land and soil quality. 
An outline of the CEMP is included as Appendix 3.2.  
10.5.17 Methods to protect soils and agricultural land outlined in the CEMP will include: 
 
stockpiling of any excavated materials in discreet horizons, in reverse 
order of excavation to test whether any can be re-used on site and also to 
ensure that proper reinstatement (where appropriate) can take place; 
 
methods to prevent compaction of soils such as constructing access 
roads first and ensuring traffic only uses designated access routes; 
 
ensuring any exposed soils are re-vegetated as soon as practical to 
prevent excess runoff or wind erosion and all agricultural land required 
temporarily during construction would be reinstated, with a five-year 
aftercare plan to ensure land is returned to its former productivity.  
10.5.18 Taking all of the above into consideration, it is not anticipated that there would 
be a significant impact on soil resources or agricultural land as a result of the 
Project and therefore this has been scoped out of the assessment. This has 
been agreed with key stakeholders (e.g. Natural England as highlighted in 
Table 10.1).  
Assumptions and Limitations 
10.5.19 The assumptions and limitations used in this assessment are as per Section 
4.8. 
Significance Criteria 
10.5.20 The significance of the effects is defined using a combination of the value of 
the potential receptor and the potential consequence of the effect.  Tables 
10.2-10.4 illustrate how the value of the receptor and the magnitude of the 
impact determine the significance level of the effect which can be “negligible”, 
“minor”, “moderate”, or “major”. 
10.5.21 The classifications have been generated using descriptions of environmental 
receptor importance and value given in various guidance documents including 
NHBC 20081 and DETR 20002. Human health and buildings classifications 
have been generated by PBA using the attribute description for each class 
based on professional judgement.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
10.6.1 
Baseline conditions for the Project Site and study area have been identified 
using the GCA as described above, as well as reports for previous 
investigations undertaken within the Project Site and the wider Rookery Pit in 
2000 by CLA and in 2009 and 2011 by PBA3, 4, 530 
10.6.2 
The baseline for the ground condition assessment has assumed that the LLRS 
works as noted in Section 3.1 of this ES will have been completed, prior to the 
commencement of construction of the Project in 2020.  
Power Generation Plant  
Site History 
10.6.3 
A description of the historical land use both on-site and off-site is provided in 
the Phase 1 GCA presented in Appendix 10.1. However, in summary, the 
Power Generation Plant site is indicated by historical maps as being 
agricultural fields until the 1970s when the Rookery Pits are first shown. The 
clay pits are predominantly shown as disused by 1982/1983 and in the more 
recent maps (2014) are indicated to be partly water filled.  
Geology 
10.6.4 
A summary of the baseline geology associated with the Power Generation 
Plant Site is presented in Table 10.5 below.

10.6.5 
Following excavation of the unweathered Oxford Clay (‘Knotts Clay’) from The 
Rookery clay pits for brick manufacture, the overlying weathered Oxford Clay 
(‘Callow’), which was not suitable for brick making process, was cast back into 
the worked pits as “Callow Clay Fill”.  The investigations undertaken within 100 
m of the Power Generation Plant Site3,5 have encountered Callow Clay Fill at 
all locations at thicknesses in excess of 4.7m, although more typically the 
thicknesses are in the region of 2m, tapering to a thin veneer, or are absent 
altogether close to the pit edges. Furthermore, deposits of Callow Clay Fill 
were slurried and then deposited back into the Rookery North pit as well as the 
north eastern corner of Rookery South, during the historic operations of the pit. 
These were subject to ground investigations by CLA 2000 and PBA 2011. 
10.6.6 
The base of the Oxford Clay has a persistent pyritic shell bed less than 0.5m 
above the base.  This was unsuitable for brick making and typically accounts 
for the horizon of clay left at the base of the pits following the completion of 
clay extraction.  The ground investigations have typically encountered up to 
2.0m of remnant Oxford Clay underlying the Callow Clay Fill, albeit that it was 
absent in some isolated areas. 
10.6.7 
Along the western edge of the Power Generation Plant Site the ground levels 
rise from the base of the pit (pre LLRS works) at approximately 28m AOD to 
approximately 38m AOD. The slope is formed at an angle of approximately 
1(Vertical):2(Horizontal) to 1(Vertical):3(Horizontal).  Boreholes situated on the 
top of the western slope have encountered 1.65m – 3.0m of clayey Made 
Ground overlying in-situ Oxford Clay (Knotts).  The borehole records indicate 
that this slope is formed from in-situ Oxford Clay deposits, i.e. it represents a 
cut profile rather than an embankment of entirely Callow Clay Fill. 
10.6.8 
In addition to the geological stratum identified above, a horizon of engineered 
fill will be placed across the base of the Rookery South Pit as part of the LLRS 
works.  Fill will be formed from reworked Oxford Clay deposits extracted from 
a permitted excavation area to the south of the Rookery South Pit.    Fill will be 
placed and compacted in layers according to predefined method statements.  
Across the footprint of the Generating Equipment Site, engineered fill will be 
placed at thicknesses of generally 1m – 2m but will be up to 3m in places where 
existing topographic levels are lowest. The base of the pit would be around 
15mbgl following the LLRS works.  
Hydrogeology 
10.6.9 
The main water bearing strata present below the Power Generation Plant Site 
are the Blisworth Limestone Formation and, to a lesser extent, the Cornbrash 
Formation and the Kellaways Sand.  The clay formations present (Oxford Clay, 
Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay) are all of low mass permeability and, as 
such, act as aquicludes, retaining the groundwater bodies in the underlying 
water bearing strata.   
10.6.10 The EA classifies the Kellaways Sand Member and Cornbrash Formation as 
Secondary A aquifers and the Blisworth Limestone Formation as a Principal 
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
298 
 
aquifer.  However, site specific assessment together with extensive historical 
published information3 has shown that the permeability of the Kellaways Sand, 
the Cornbrash Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation is relatively 
low and the quality of the groundwater within these strata is generally poor. 
Therefore, it is considered that these deposits do not constitute a significant 
water source for abstraction purposes and that they act as aquitards. 
10.6.11 The Power Generation Plant Site does not lie within a Groundwater Source 
Protection Zone (as defined by the EA).  
10.6.12 The Power Generation Plant Site is situated in a low sensitivity 
geoenvironmental setting for the following reasons:  
 
there are no significant groundwater abstractions or source protection 
zones in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant Site;  
 
the Secondary Aquifers of the Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash Formation 
are of limited thickness, low permeability and poor quality;  
 
the Principal Aquifer of the Blisworth Limestone Formation is of low 
permeability, poor quality and is protected by the overlying Blisworth Clay 
Formation. 
10.6.13 Further information on historical groundwater levels and groundwater 
monitoring is included in the GCA, report (2017) presented within Appendix 
10.1.  
10.6.14 In 2017, a total of three groundwater samples and three surface water samples 
were obtained from the Project Site and submitted for geoenvironmental 
laboratory testing as described in Appendix 10.1. In general, the recent results 
are broadly similar to the available historical data and many determinands, 
particularly metals and hydrocarbons were recorded at concentrations below 
the laboratory limit of detection. It is considered that the results are typical of 
naturally occurring conditions and that there is no indication of anthropogenic 
contamination. 
Sites of Geological Importance 
10.6.15 The closest site designated for its geological interest is at Biddenham Pit, 
approximately 8 km north of the Power Generation Plant Site. It is designated 
for its outcrop of terrace gravel including interglacial mollusca and mammalian 
remains and Palaeolithic evidence. 
Geoenvironmental Conditions – Soils 
10.6.16 As part of wider historical ground investigations in Rookery South Pit (in 2009), 
two trial pits were excavated, six window sample boreholes and fourteen 
boreholes were sunk in the base of the pit within and in the vicinity of the Power 
Generation Plant area. No visual or olfactory evidence of contamination was 
noted within any of these exploratory holes.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
299 
 
10.6.17 As part of the ground investigation undertaken in 2009, a total of fifteen soil 
samples were submitted to the laboratory for geoenvironmental testing for a 
range of metals, Extractable Petroleum Hydrocarbons (EPH) and Polyaromatic 
Hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results of this testing were compared to relevant 
assessment criteria for the protection of human health and there was no 
evidence of significantly elevated concentrations of any of the determinands.   
10.6.18 As part of historical PBA ground investigations in 20096, supported by further 
investigations undertaken by PBA in 2011 in support of discharge of planning 
conditions associated with the LLRS31, soil samples were taken from the north-
eastern quarter of Rookery South for geoenvironmental laboratory analysis in 
order to target the area known to have been previously subject to deposition 
of Callow sludge waste.  None of the determinants tested showed any 
evidence of elevated concentrations when compared to relevant assessment 
criteria.   
Geoenvironmental Conditions – Groundwaters 
10.6.19 The historical ground investigation works3,5 have included assessment of the 
water quality within the Kellaways Sand, Cornbrash Formation and Blisworth 
Limestone Formation.  Analyses have included testing for a range of potential 
historical contaminants. 
10.6.20 In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash 
Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been 
identified as being poor, with saline conditions reported from the historical 
investigations undertaken in 20094,6.  
10.6.21 Historical monitoring of water quality3,5 within the Kellaways Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation has identified that the quality of the 
groundwater within both formations is similar in nature, with naturally elevated 
concentrations of electrical conductivity, chloride, sulphate, ammoniacal 
nitrogen, boron, iron and zinc when compared to the relevant assessment 
criteria at the time, and as described in the Phase 1 GCA.  
10.6.22 Groundwater and surface water analysis for hydrocarbons has also been 
undertaken within the wider Rookery South Site.  During the more recent PBA 
monitoring (2014 and 2017) hydrocarbon analysis was undertaken and found 
to be below the laboratory detection limit at each monitoring location.

Gas Connection  
10.6.23 The geological and hydrogeological baseline in the vicinity of the Gas 
Connection is similar to the natural strata which would have existed at the 
Power Generation Plant Site and in the Rookery South Pit prior to excavation 
of clay.  
Geology 
10.6.24 BGS Borehole records for the area in which the Gas Connection would be sited 
indicate the following geological sequence: 
 
weathered Oxford Clay described as ‘Callow’, overlying  
 
Oxford Clay described as ‘Knotts’ to generally between about 15m and 30m 
depth below ground level, overlying 
 
The Kellaways Formation  
Hydrogeology 
10.6.25 The clayey deposits of the Callow /Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, Kellaways 
Clay and Blisworth Clay Formation underlie the Gas Connection Route. They 
have been shown to be of extremely low permeability and can be considered 
as being aquicludes. Whilst the Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash Formation are 
classified as Secondary A aquifers, they have been shown to be insignificant 
water resources during previous investigations3,5 due to their limited thickness, 
low permeability and poor water quality and are considered herein to act as 
aquitards.  
Sites of Geological Importance 
10.6.26 The closest site designated for its geological interest is at Biddenham Pit, 
approximately 8km north of where the Gas Connection connects to the 
Generating Equipment. It is designated for its outcrop of terrace gravel 
including interglacial mollusca and mammalian remains and Palaeolithic 
evidence. 
Geoenvironmental Conditions – Soils, Groundwater  
10.6.27 No ground investigation works have been undertaken directly on the route of 
the Gas Connection (other than for the part within Rookery South Pit which is 
as described above for the Power Generation Plant). However, as the land on 
which the Gas Connection has not previously been developed and ground 
investigations on surrounding land (e.g. the Rookery South Pit) have not 
revealed any evidence of contamination, it is very unlikely that land on which 
the Gas Connection will be sited is contaminated either as no potential sources 
of significant contamination have been identified in the Phase 1 GCA.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
301 
 
Electrical Connection  
10.6.28 The baseline ground conditions of the parts of the Electrical Connection 
located outside of Rookery South Pit (e.g. buried cables and SECs) are as 
described above for the Gas Connection. The baseline conditions underlying 
the substation are as described for the Power Generation Plant Site.  
10.6.29 No ground investigation works have been undertaken directly on the route of 
the Electrical Connection (other than for the part within Rookery South Pit 
which is as described for the Power Generation Plant). However, as the land 
on which the Electrical Connection has not previously been developed and 
ground investigations on surrounding land (e.g. the Rookery South Pit) have 
not revealed any evidence of contamination, it is very unlikely that land on 
which the Electrical Connection will be sited is contaminated either, as no 
potential sources of significant contamination have been identified in the Phase 
1 GCA.   
10.7 
Assessment of Effects 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction/Decommissioning 
10.7.1 
On-site construction workers have the potential to be affected by unstable 
slopes through the construction of any deep excavations and/or cuttings into 
the toe of the western slope of the Rookery South Pit where there is the 
potential for instability to occur. However, the embedded mitigation measures 
as outlined in Section 3.6 of this ES, such as, temporary works measures 
including trench sheeting in any excavations will be utilised.  Therefore, there 
is anticipated to be a negligible adverse effect on a receptor of medium 
sensitivity, resulting in a slight significance of effect and therefore not 
significant.  
10.7.2 
High groundwater levels and potential for hydraulic uplift have the potential to 
affect construction workers. Due to historical clay extraction at the Generating 
Equipment Site, groundwater levels are close to existing ground levels (before 
completion of the LLRS) in the base of the Rookery South Pit.  Once the LLRS 
works have been completed in the Generating Equipment Site, groundwater 
levels are anticipated as being at circa 29m AOD compared to an average 
development platform level for the LLRS of 31.5m AOD.  The shallowest 
groundwater body in the base of the pit is around 29m AOD with a 
corresponding (current) ground elevation of around 29.9m OD. Hence at the 
moment groundwater is at around 0.9m below ground level in places. The 
groundwater levels will be at much the same elevation after the implementation 
of the LLRS, but the base of the pit will be raised by up to 3m in places, hence 
the depth to groundwater consequently will be greater, not the groundwater 
elevation. High piezometric groundwater levels may have the potential to result 
in ground heave and groundwater influx in the base of any deep excavations 
(around 2m or 2.5m bgl depending on the elevation of the base of the pit) 
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017)

during construction. However, permeability test results have shown that the 
deposits are of limited permeability and seepage rates will be slow.  If 
significant groundwater flows are encountered within excavations then 
temporary (embedded) mitigation measures including dewatering pumps will 
be implemented.  Following the implementation of these measures there is 
anticipated to be a negligible adverse effect on a receptor of medium 
sensitivity, resulting in a slight significance of effect.   
10.7.3 
Potential contamination within the soils and groundwater has the potential to 
affect construction workers. Whilst ground investigations have shown no 
evidence of contamination present at the Power Generation Plant Site, there 
remains the potential for small, localised, inclusions of potentially 
contaminated materials within any residual Made Ground/reworked deposits 
present at the Power Generation Plant Site. Any as yet undiscovered potential 
sources of contamination may cause health impacts as a result of direct or 
indirect contact with contaminated materials. No additional mitigation 
measures are considered necessary, over and above the embedded mitigation 
referred to above and in Section 3.6 (e.g. construction workers will undergo 
appropriate health and safety training and will wear personal protective 
equipment in conjunction with appropriate hygiene facilities and a CEMP will 
be implemented). Following the implementation of these measures there are 
not anticipated to be any effects.  
10.7.4 
Any pollution releases during construction/decommissioning works have the 
potential to affect construction workers. During construction works there is 
potential to introduce new sources of contamination into the environment (for 
instance; uncontrolled leaks and spills from machinery). To mitigate this 
potential, no additional measures are required over and above the embedded 
mitigation referred to in Section 3.6 that will be included in the CEMP. Once 
the embedded mitigation measures are implemented, there are not anticipated 
to be any effects. 
10.7.5 
A potential effect of the construction/decommissioning of the Generating 
Equipment will be the mixing of aquifer bodies through the creation of new 
pathways. The construction of piled foundations extending through the 
Kellaways Sand Member, Cornbrash Formation and into the Blisworth 
Limestone Formation has the potential to introduce new pathways between 
aquifer bodies. However, no special mitigation measures are considered 
necessary over and above the embedded mitigation referred to in Section 3.6. 
This includes the provision of a Foundation Works Risk Assessment (FWRA) 
which will be undertaken by the contractor once the proposed foundation 
solutions are known. EA guidance ‘Piling and Penetrative Ground 
Improvement Methods on Land Affected by Contamination’ (EA, 2001) and a 
requirement to carry out such an assessment will be incorporated into the 
CEMP (which is secured via a requirement on the draft DCO). Once these 
mitigation measures are implemented there are not anticipated to be any 
effects. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
303 
 
Operation (which includes maintenance) 
10.7.6 
High piezometric groundwater levels may have the potential to result in ground 
heave in the base of the pit if piezometric pressures exceed confining 
pressures from the overlying structures, resulting in the potential for 
uncontrolled release of groundwaters. However, given the placement of 
engineered low permeability fill across the base of the pit as part of the LLRS, 
widespread heave is not expected to occur. However, this cannot be confirmed 
until further ground investigations have been undertaken (as described in 
Section 10.9) and therefore a precautionary approach has been taken to the 
assessment. This represents a potential major adverse impact on a receptor 
of medium sensitivity, resulting in a large adverse significance of effect (without 
mitigation in the form of further investigations).  
10.7.7 
These further assessments will form part of the additional mitigation measures 
required and will include Phase 2 investigations to confirm the findings of 
Phase 1 studies to date, along with the determination of an appropriate 
foundation solution and a subsequent reappraisal of risk. These have been 
secured as a requirement attached to the DCO (Requirement 8). There are not 
expected to be any effects following the implementation of these additional 
mitigation measures.  
Gas Connection 
Construction/ Decommissioning  
10.7.8 
During construction and decommissioning of the Gas Connection there is 
potential for mobilisation of silt and contamination associated with the 
excavations required during construction.  
10.7.9 
Embedded mitigation will be implemented to offset mobilisation of silt and 
contamination which will be included in the CEMP including the installation of 
silt interceptors at the Project Site. Once these measures are implemented, 
there is expected to be a negligible impact on a receptor of medium sensitivity 
and therefore a slight significance of effect and ‘not significant’.    
Operation (including maintenance) 
10.7.10 Based on this assessment, there are not considered to be any potential 
impacts on ground conditions as a result of the operation of the Gas 
Connection. This has therefore been scoped out of the assessment as per 
Section 10.5.11. 
Electrical Connection  
Construction/ Decommissioning Electrical Connection  
10.7.11 During construction and decommissioning of the Electrical Connection there is 
potential for mobilisation of silt and contamination during construction. 
Embedded mitigation will be implemented to offset mobilisation of silt and

contamination which will be included in the CEMP. Once these measures are 
implemented, there is expected to be a negligible impact on a receptor of 
medium sensitivity and therefore a slight significance of effect and ‘not 
significant’.  
Operation (including maintenance)  
10.7.12 Based on this assessment, there are not considered to be any potential 
impacts on ground conditions as a result of the operation of the Electrical 
Connection. This has therefore been scoped out of the assessment as per 
Section 10.5.12. 
10.8 
Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Overview  
10.8.1 
Construction, decommissioning or operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
Section 4.10  However, the following proposed developments are all distant 
from the Project Site and outside of the study area: 
 
Land at Moreteyne Farm; 
 
Land at Warren Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill;  
 
The proposed new settlement at Wixams,  
 
Land off Marston Road, Lidlington – proposed residential development; 
 
Land opposite The Lane & Lombard Street, Lidlington – proposed 
residential development; 
 
Lower Shelton Road, Marston Moretaine – proposed residential 
development; 
 
Land to the rear of Cowlgrove Parade – Flitwick – proposed multi storey car 
park; 
 
Land east of Ampthill Road at Houghton Conquest – proposed mixed use 
development; 
 
Land off Chapel End Road at Houghton Conquest – proposed residential 
development; 
 
Land at Wootton – proposed residential development. 
10.8.2 
These developments and any effects arising from them are outside the 
influence area for this topic within which significant effects could occur (e.g. 
mobilisation of contamination) meaning that any cross over in study areas and 
therefore effects would be extremely unlikely.  As such it is considered that no 
cumulative or in combination effects are likely to arise in relation to ground 
conditions or from contamination during the construction or decommissioning 
phases of the Project. Furthermore, each of these developments will be bound 
by its own CEMP and will apply best practice construction methods so as to 
minimise impacts on ground conditions and from contamination.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
305 
 
Construction and Decommissioning 
10.8.3 
The projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for this chapter (taken from Section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, (immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
10.8.4 
Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery South Pit. At present, a request for 
a scoping opinion has been submitted by the promoter of the project although 
no details are provided regarding potential impacts on ground conditions or 
human health as a result of the project.  
10.8.5 
The construction of both the Project and the Integrated Waste Management 
Facilities at the same time represents the greatest potential for creating 
cumulative effects on ground conditions as this represents the greatest 
potential for ground disturbance across the two projects. This is therefore 
judged to be a realistic worst case scenario for cumulatively assessing 
construction impacts. Any other scenario (e.g. operation of one scheme and 
construction of the other) would generate less ground disturbance and 
therefore less impacts.  
10.8.6 
However, it is likely that this development will be bound by its own CEMP and 
best practice construction methods so as to limit impacts on ground conditions 
during construction. Should it go ahead, then it will need to consider the Project 
to ensure that no significant cumulative effects will arise between it and the 
Project. Nevertheless, in order to minimise the possibility of cumulative effects 
arising, a CEMP will be followed during construction of the Project, which will 
ensure best practice construction methods are followed and limit, as far as 
practicable, the possibility of impacts occurring to ground conditions. The 
measures proposed to minimise impacts during construction are listed in 
Section 3.6 and include e.g. spill response procedures and correct handling of 
any hazardous substances.  
10.8.7 
Furthermore, given the early stage of the Integrated Waste Management 
proposals and the likely time required to achieve planning consent, it is 
considered unlikely that there would be any overlap on the construction periods 
of these two projects, which further mitigates against any potential cumulative 
effects.  
10.8.8 
The construction of both the Project and the Covanta RRF Project at the same 
time represents the greatest potential for creating cumulative effects on ground 
conditions as this represents the greatest potential for ground disturbance 
across the two projects. This is therefore judged to be a realistic worst case 
scenario for cumulatively assessing construction impacts. Any other scenario 
(e.g. operation of one scheme and construction of the other) would generate 
less ground disturbance and therefore less impacts.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
306 
 
10.8.9 
The ES for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site concluded that there were a number of potential (pre-mitigation) impacts 
arising from construction and decommissioning of the project on ground 
conditions. These include: 
 
Impacts on controlled waters from potential release of contaminants and 
silts (minor adverse); 
 
Slope instability (moderate adverse); 
 
High groundwater levels leading to uplift (minor adverse); 
 
Mixing of groundwater aquifers (moderate adverse); and  
 
Impacts from existing contamination on construction workers (moderate 
adverse). 
10.8.10 However, a number of mitigation measures were proposed within the Covanta 
RRF ES to limit these potential impacts. These were subsequently imposed by 
the Order (Requirements 13 and 14). In the main, these include working to 
best practice guidance and stringently adhering to a Code of Construction 
Practice (CoCP). Some slope stabilisation measures were also proposed in 
the western edge of the Operations Area and reliance was placed on the 
completion of phase 1 of the LLRS prior to construction (e.g. low permeability 
fill in the base of the pit to prevent uplift).   
10.8.11 In all cases, once mitigation was taken into consideration, there were deemed 
to be no residual effects on ground conditions from construction or 
decommissioning of the Covanta RRF Project as stated in the Covanta RRF 
ES.   
10.8.12 Similarly, potential effects on controlled waters from potential release of 
contaminants and silts was identified for the Project. However, applying the 
implementation of the embedded mitigation described in section 3.6 of this ES 
(including adherence to a CEMP) it has been concluded that there will be no 
effects arising from the construction and de-commissioning of the Project on 
controlled waters.    
10.8.13 Therefore, it is considered that, based on professional judgement, the effects 
on controlled waters associated with construction of the Project (no effect) 
considered together with the effects associated with construction of the 
Covanta RRF Project (no effect) would not give rise to a significant cumulative 
effect or give rise to new or different effects that would occur if the projects are 
constructed independently of one another.  
10.8.14 Slope instability was also identified as a potential effect relating to both the 
Project and the Covanta RRF Project. However, the LLRS works, which have 
been assumed as part of the baseline for the Project would mean that any 
effects would be reduced to ‘slight’ adverse.    Further to this, the two projects 
would be constructed in different phase areas of the LLRS within Rookery 
South Pit and therefore would not involve excavations into the same areas of 
the pit or the same slopes.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
307 
 
10.8.15 Based on professional judgement, there is therefore not anticipated to be any 
effects from slope stability cumulatively from the construction and 
decommissioning of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project. The effects of 
slope instability associated with construction of the Project (slight) considered 
together with the effects associated with construction of the Covanta RRF 
Project (no effects) will not give rise to new or different effects that would occur 
if the projects are constructed independently of one another.  
10.8.16 Potential effects on human health were also identified from e.g. mobilisation of 
contamination from construction of the Project. However, the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in section 3.6 and Appendix 3.2, there 
would be no effects arising from the construction and de-commissioning of the 
Project on human health.  Based on professional judgement, there is therefore 
not anticipated to be any cumulative effects on human health from the two 
projects.  
10.8.17 The potential for effects from hydraulic uplift have also been identified for the 
Project. However, based on professional judgement, even considering the 
combined pressure, provided that embedded mitigation measures were 
followed including the use of a CoCP/CEMP, working within best practice 
guidelines, and the placement of a low permeability fill as part of the LLRS 
works, then the resulting effect is likely to be slight.  
Operation (including maintenance) 
10.8.18 As above, the projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for the operation of the Project (taken from section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
10.8.19 Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery Pit. At present, only a high level 
scoping opinion has been submitted. No details are proposed regarding 
potential impacts on ground conditions or human health as a result of the 
project. However, it is likely that this development will adopt practices to limit 
impacts on ground conditions and human health. The assessment set out in 
this Chapter has shown no significant effects on ground conditions are 
anticipated to arise from the operation and maintenance of the Project.  
Accordingly, then given that the Project alone is anticipated to have no 
significant effects on ground conditions it is anticipated that no cumulative 
impacts will occur with this development during operation and maintenance. 
10.8.20 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site concluded that there were potential (pre-mitigation) effects from operation 
of that project resulting from: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – ES (2017) 
 
308 
 
 
Impacts on controlled waters from potential release of contaminants and 
silts (minor adverse); 
 
Slope instability (moderate adverse); 
 
High groundwater levels leading to uplift (major adverse); 
 
Mixing of groundwater aquifers (moderate adverse);  
 
Impacts from existing contamination on construction workers (moderate 
adverse); and  
 
Contamination resulting from the waste reception area, hazardous 
materials storage area and site access roads (minor adverse). 
10.8.21 However, a number of mitigation measures were proposed within the Covanta 
RRF ES to limit these potential impacts. In the main, these include working to 
best practice guidance and stringently adhering to an environmental permit. 
Some slope stabilisation measures were also proposed in the western edge of 
the Operations Area and reliance was placed on the completion of phase 1 of 
the LLRS prior to construction (e.g. low permeability fill in the base of the pit to 
prevent uplift).   
10.8.22 In all cases, once mitigation was taken into consideration, there were deemed 
to be no residual effects on ground conditions from operation and maintenance 
of the Covanta RRF Project.   
10.8.23 The assessment set out in this Chapter has shown that the only potential 
significant effect on ground conditions anticipated to arise from operation and 
maintenance of the Project is the potential for hydraulic uplift.  Accordingly, this 
will be the subject of detailed additional mitigation (see Section 10.9) which 
would mean that there would be no residual effects. Based on professional 
judgement, even considering the combined pressure, provided that embedded 
mitigation measures were followed including the use of a CEMP, working 
within best practice guidelines, and the placement of a low permeability fill as 
part of the LLRS works, then there would be no cumulative effects.  
10.9 
Additional Mitigation  
10.9.1 
A detailed assessment of the uplift forces acting upon any permanent buried 
structures will be undertaken prior to construction and following confirmation 
of the construction technique and therefore the mass of any buried structures.  
This will form part of the ground investigation works which would be secured 
by a Requirement to the DCO (Requirement 8). If uplift forces exceed the mass 
of the structure and any permanent contents, then foundations will be designed 
to accommodate uplift forces with appropriate factors of safety.  Appropriate 
method statements and foundation works risks assessments will be developed 
in accordance with industry guidelines. A range of different foundation designs 
can all be incorporated within the boundary of the Generating Equipment Site.   
10.9.2 
There are not expected to be any significant effects following the 
implementation of these additional mitigation measures.

10.11 
Conclusions and ongoing work 
10.11.1 Baseline conditions at the Power Generation Plant Site comprise the Rookery 
South former clay extraction pit. The Gas and Electrical Connections are 
mainly located on previously undeveloped agricultural land.  
10.11.2 The geological sequence underlying the Project Site broadly comprises the 
Oxford Clay Formation overlying the Kellaways Formation (sand and clays) 
which overlie Blisworth Clay and Limestone.   
10.11.3 In order to determine appropriate design solutions for foundations and any 
associated infrastructure design, additional structure specific Phase 2 ground 
investigation will be undertaken, which will further inform the appropriate risk 
assessments and the need for any site specific mitigation measures. This will 
be secured as a Requirement of the DCO (Requirement 8).  
10.11.4 Construction of the Project has the potential to mobilise silts and 
contamination, and construction and operation of the Project has the potential 
for experiencing uplift groundwater pressures from high groundwater levels 
and slope instability. However, following the implementation of both the Low 
Level Restoration Scheme (future baseline), and embedded and additional 
mitigation measures, no likely significant effects have been identified as a 
result of construction or decommissioning of the Project on ground conditions, 
either when considered alone or cumulatively with other developments. 
10.11.5 The conclusions of this Chapter are that the construction, operation and 
maintenance and decommissioning of the Project does not result in any likely 
significant effects on ground conditions, either when considered alone or 
cumulatively with other developments.

Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 
(LVIA) 
11.1 
Introduction 
11.1.1 
This Chapter presents the assessment of likely significant effects on the 
landscape character of the study area for this topic and the visual amenity of 
sensitive 
receptors 
arising 
from 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project.  
11.1.2 
The Project has the potential to affect the landscape, including landscape 
character, and people’s views and visual amenity due to the processes 
involved in construction (e.g. ground clearance, use of large plant) and 
decommissioning (e.g. dismantling structures, restoring land) as well as during 
operation from the introduction of new large structures into the landscape (e.g. 
the stack of the Generating Equipment and SECs associated with the Electrical 
Connection).  
11.2 
Legislation and Policy Context 
11.2.1 
The legislation and policy context in relation to landscape and visual effects is 
described in detail in Appendix 2.11 of the ES. However, in summary, the 
following items of policy, legislation and guidance have been referred to in 
preparing this assessment:

SoS Scoping Opinion 
3.71 
The landscape and visual cumulative 
impacts assessment should include not 
just other proposed large industrial 
developments in the area, but also other 
types of development that could 
contribute to a cumulative effect. The 
SoS recommends that the wind turbine 
in the Marston Vale Millennium Country 
Park is included in the assessment of 
potential cumulative effects of this 
Project, and that consideration should 
be given to the potential for a further 
turbine at Stewartby landfill site.  
Cumulative impacts are 
described in section 11.9 the 
application for the proposed 
turbine at Stewartby has been 
withdrawn and has not been 
considered further. As the 
turbine at the Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park is 
already operational, it has been 
considered in the baseline 
assessment (Section 11.6).  
3.72 
Study area should be clearly defined - is 
1km large enough?  
The study area is described in 
section 11.5.  
3.73 
Reference is made in this section to a 
Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan. 
The SoS advises that the ES should 
describe the ZTV model used, and 
provide information on the area covered, 
the timing of any survey work, and the 
methodology used. The SoS welcomes 
the intention to provide photomontages, 
and recommends that the locations of 
viewpoints are agreed with the relevant 
local authorities. 
The ZTV methodology is 
described in Section 11.5, as 
are fieldwork methodology and 
timings. Viewpoints have been 
agreed with key consultees 
(e.g. CBC).   
 
3.74 
Further info should be provided on the 
Chilterns AONB and more justification 
as to why it has been scoped out. 
The Chilterns AONB has been 
scoped out of the assessment 
given the distance between it 
and the Project Site 
(approximately 12 km) 
intervening topography and the 
size of the Project. The ZTV has 
shown that the Project will not 
be visible from the AONB.  
3.75 
The ES should include a plan showing 
all landscape features including PRoW. 
Noted this is included on Figure 
11.3.

Night lighting and visible plumes also 
need to be considered. 
An outline lighting strategy 
which addresses lighting at 
night is submitted alongside the

Scoping 
Response Letter 
The size of the plant will have a major 
impact on the visual quality of the 
landscape and will adversely impair the 
views from the Vale to the surrounding 
Greensand Ridge and the panoramic 
views from the ridge, especially those 
seen from Ampthill Park a Grade II listed 
historic park and Houghton House ruins, 
a Grade I English Heritage site 
This Chapter presents a 
landscape and visual impact 
assessment. Assessment of 
Effects is set out in Section 
11.7. The assessment includes 
potential effects on the views 
from the Greensands Ridge, 
representative of Houghton 
House and from Ampthill Park 
and its environs. 
Local policy seeks to protect, conserve 
and enhance the County’s scheduled 
ancient monuments, conservation areas, 
parks and gardens and their settings. 
The proposed EFW is contrary to these 
policies. 
It is considered that the Project, 
which is not an energy from 
waste plant, aligns with local 
policy in that it is an appropriate 
development to site in the 
Rookery South Pit.  
Further details on local policy 
are provided in Chapter 2.

Would like to see a green roof on the

The Applicant has considered 
this request but the provision of 
a green roof on the Gas Turbine 
Generator is not practical given 
the limited roof space available 
and the nature and finish of the 
materials to be used for the Gas 
Turbine Generator. Final layout 
and design will be subject to 
approval of CBC. 
The colour palette would also be an 
important factor in terms of mitigation.

Response to 2014 
PEIR 
The LVIA is not as comprehensive as 
required for a development of this 
nature. The Zone of Visual Influence has 
been limited to a 5 km radius - whilst this 
area will experience the greatest 
change, the impact over 10km would 
highlight the communities which would 
be affected by the proposal.  
 
Following the publication of the 
2014 PEIR and receipt of 
comments, the ZTV was 
extended further north to show 
full extent of theoretical visibility. 
The ZTV diagram Figure 11.1 does not 
differentiate between the visibility of the 
vertical features and the built form of the 
plant and substation. It would be 
preferable to have a conventional ZTV 
map showing visual impact of these 
different aspects over a wider area. 
 
The ZTV represented the 
visibility of the Project based on 
the maximum height of 35m for 
the stack.

The montages currently available 
highlight the intrusive nature of the 
transmission towers. Although there is a 
line of pylons already (one of which 
would be removed) and the railway 
catenary, these structures are 
considered to be detracting features, 
particularly in the view from the Ridge. 
Photomontages 6, 6b and 15 are from 
the Country Park.  Viewpoint 7 is 
adjacent to Ampthill Park House. Views 
from Millbrook Village were assessed on 
site and no views were established. 
Additional photo montages are also 
required, particularly for short distance 
views from the Country Park, Millbrook 
village and Ampthill Park House. 
No additional towers are 
proposed as the electrical 
connection will be underground, 
which is now reflected in the 
updated photomontages. 
 
The views included in the 
assessment are considered to 
be representative of the range 
of views, both long and short 
distance views, available from 
the topic study area around the 
Project Site.   
 
Viewpoint 15 is short range

The cumulative impact of the 
development has not been fully 
examined e.g. the PEIR has not taken 
the visual impact of the wind turbine at 
the Millennium Country Park and the 
proposed turbine at Stewartby landfill 
site into consideration. (Forest of 
Marston Vale turbine is illustrated in the 
photomontages). The information 
provided with the EIA should illustrate in 
drawing form the impact of the MP 
proposal without Covanta - and without 
the benefits of the Covanta landscape 
scheme. In the photomontages - the 
Covanta Energy from Waste (EfW) 
building acts as a screen in views from 
the north. As the development is without 
significant landscape screening, the 
power station would be seen from the 
rights of way and some residential 
properties in Stewartby. Whilst the latter 
is an issue for BBC, the visual impact 
from public access routes needs to be 
fully considered and mitigation designed 
accordingly. 
 
The Millennium Park turbine 
forms part of the baseline; the 
Stewartby turbine application 
has been withdrawn and is not 
considered further. 
 
The outline  Landscape and 
Ecology Mitigation and 
Management Strategy drawings 
(Appendix 11.3) shows 
significant new plantings and 
the effect of the planting has 
been addressed in the LVIA.  
The "Illustrative Visual" (consultation 
leaflet) of the MP development does not 
show strategic landscape planting on the 
Application site. The "woodland" planting 
to the south is part of the Low Level 
Restoration Scheme, the land for which 
is currently being excavated. The 
proposed planting would need around 
15 year’s growth to achieve partial 
screening of the proposal. The rest of 
Rookery Pit appears "green" as if it was 
open space. 
 
This is correct –the Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
planting has been shown 
because it forms part of the 
baseline – there is a 
commitment to this being 
carried out. The rest of the pit is 
shown as green space because 
the only plans available (for the 
LLRS) show it as such.

Strategy Plan shows the 
combined mitigation (LEMMS)

Considerations of the Water Courses in 
the vicinity of the site should be

There will be no views from any 
of the waterways linking the 
River Great Ouse to the Grand 
Union Canal, along the 
proposed route of the of the 
Bedford - Milton Keynes

Pre Application 
Advice: 
(letter dated 21 
October 2015) 
The Site is within the Forest of Marston 
Vale for which the long term aim is to 
achieve the target of 30% woodland 
cover in the Forest area by 2030. Policy 
CS16 of the Core Strategy and 
Development Management Policies for 
Central Bedfordshire (North) 2009 
should be adhered to.  
 
It would be useful to provide a plan 
showing trees and hedgerows to be 
removed and what they consist of. 
 
 
 
 
 
NCA 88 – Bedfordshire Claylands. The 
update of the NCA places greater 
emphasis on the need to recognise the 
sense of place created by the brickwork 
industry. The ES could reflect this with 
reference to the NCA. 
 
Landscape designation: the Site falls 
within the landscape designation of 
Community Forest. As one of only 12 
Forests nationally, the Forest is 
considered an environmental 
designation of significance. The Forest 
of Marston Vale work with developers to 
achieve 30% tree cover across the 
Forest area. The text should be 
amended to reflect this. 
 
If the Covanta development is 
withdrawn, there may be a need for 
further landscape integration, including 
consideration of planting within the 
Millennium Country Park. 
 
Long Distance Paths: ensure that

Cumulative landscape impact: 
Brogborough Wind Farm has not been 
progressed. 
 
 
There are proposals to electrify the 
Marston Vale Line as part of the east-
west rail scheme. The visual impacts of 
Millbrook Power need to be considered 
with the catenary and other structures 
proposed. This infrastructure is in the 
initial stages of consultation but has the 
potential to increase vertical structures 
in the Rookery corridor. 
Brogborough Wind Farm has 
been deleted from the list of 
projects for cumulative 
assessment as set out in 
Chapter 4. 
Phase 2 of the East-West Rail 
Link Project has been described 
in section 4.10 of the ES. Little 
detail is known on the scheme 
or the timings and so it has not 
been considered at this stage. 
Should more details be made 
available prior to submission of 
the DCO Application for the 
Project, they will be included 
within the ES.

We are aware of the ambition for the 
Forest of Marston Vale which is close to 
this therefore we hope that the 
developers will seek to avoid any 
deforestation. Should this be a 
requirement we would like to see 
compensatory new plantings in the ratio 
of at least 4:1 i.e. four trees planted to 
one removed, this precedent having 
been set in other planning applications 
Approximately 0.2ha of 
woodland will be managed for 
the temporary diversion of the 
400kV line, but the trees can be 
left to grow back once 
construction is complete. 
Approximately 0.2ha of 
woodland will be removed as a 
result of the construction of the 
SECs and almost 0.9ha. will be 
planted to compensate for the 
loss (i.e. greater than a 4:1 
ratio). 
The distance from Marston Vale 
Forest Centre is approximately 
1km from the Power Generation 
Plant, located to the west of the 
Project Site beyond a railway 
line.

May be useful to have views from 
Warden Hills in Luton and from the A6 
across Barton Le Clay. 
It is considered that these views 
would not have any sight of the 
Project given their distance 
(approximately 17km south of 
the Project Site). Analysis of the 
ZTV has shown that there will 
be no views of the Project from 
this location.  
11.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
11.4.1 
In respect of landscape and visual effects, the realistic worst case scenario for 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Chapters 3 and 5 of 
this ES) is to assume that the Power Generation Plant will have a 35m high 
stack. 
11.4.2 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case for the Power 
Generation Plant in relation to landscape and visual effects is that a taller stack 
height will increase the magnitude of visual and landscape effects as the 
Power Generation Plant will be more prominent, and it will be visible over a 
larger geographical area.  
Assumptions and Limitations 
11.4.3 
The assumptions and limitations for undertaking this assessment are as per 
Section 4.8. Specifically, in relation to LVIA they assume the maximum Project 
parameters as set out in Table 3.1.  
11.5 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria  
11.5.1 
The methodology used for undertaking the LVIA is set out below and is based 
on professional experience as well as the Landscape Institute / Institute of 
Environmental Management and Assessment ‘Guidelines for Landscape and 
Visual Impact Assessment’ (3rd Edition, 2013) (GLVIA3). 
11.5.2 
The assessment of landscape and visual effects aims to be as objective as 
possible, however, as explained in GLVIA3: 
“Professional judgement is a very important part of LVIA. While there is some 
scope for quantitative measurement of some relatively objective matters, for 
example the number of trees lost to construction… much of the assessment 
must rely on qualitative judgements, for example about what effect the 
introduction of a new development or land use change may have on visual 
amenity, or about the significance of change in the character of the landscape 
and whether it is positive or negative”.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
325 
(Paragraph 2.23, page 21, GLVIA3) 
11.5.3 
This chapter considers effects of the Project on: 
 
landscape character; 
 
landscape features (the ‘landscape fabric’); and 
 
views available to people and their visual amenity, from publicly accessible 
viewpoints. 
11.5.4 
Cultural Heritage issues have been covered in Chapter 13 along with Cultural 
Heritage assets and designations. 
Study Area 
11.5.5 
A Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan has been created by selecting spot 
locations to simulate the tops of the stack, assigning a maximum height of 35m 
above the floor of Rookery South Pit after the LLRS has been completed. 
Another ZTV has been run with the addition of the replacement electrical tower 
at a height of 49m. The ZTV computer software processes landform data and 
other selected features influencing the extent of visibility (visual barriers), for 
example, woodland and settlements, in order to identify the theoretical extent 
of the area from which the Project is likely to be visible.  It is important to note 
that the ZTV illustrates the worst-case scenario, in that it will only take into 
account the landform and principal areas of woodland and settlements.  In 
reality other features, such as hedgerows or street trees or isolated properties, 
are likely to provide additional filtering of views. 
11.5.6 
The ZTV has been used to guide the initial selection of representative 
viewpoints to be included within the visual impact assessment and provides 
the maximum extent of the study area.  It has been tested on the ground during 
site visits which have confirmed the typical viewpoints used in the 
assessments.   
11.5.7 
The ZTV is provided as Figure 11.1. It covers a 15km square centred on the 
Power Generation Plant Site. 
11.5.8 
A data search has been undertaken to establish the baseline landscape fabric 
and landscape character information, including topography, landscape 
planning designations and published sources of landscape character set out 
in Tables: 11.1a (Visual Effects Table); and 11.1b (Landscape Effects Table).  
Site Survey and Photographic Record 
11.5.9 
Site visits were made to the Project Site and surrounding area in July and 
August 2014 and January 2015 and a photographic record to represent views 
of the selected assessment viewpoints was undertaken during summer and 
winter (when vegetation gives less screening to the Project Site) in order to: 
 
determine the extent of visibility of existing built structures; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
326 
 
determine the potential visibility of the Project, utilising the results from the 
ZTV plan to guide the field work; 
 
gain further understanding of the components which create the landscape 
fabric and character; and 
 
carry out the assessment of landscape and visual effects. 
11.5.10 The selection of viewpoints was made on the basis of the following types of 
publicly accessible viewpoints: 
 
representative viewpoints (for example representing views of users of a 
particular footpath); 
 
specific viewpoints (for example a key view from a specific visitor 
attraction); 
 
illustrative viewpoints (chosen to demonstrate a particular effect/specific 
issue); and 
 
any important sequential views (for example along key transport routes). 
11.5.11 Potential visual receptors include: 
 
public footpath and cycle route users, pedestrians; 
 
people using public open spaces and parks; 
 
people living in, working in, or visiting the nearby settlements such as 
Ampthill, How End, Marston Moretaine, Millbrook, Stewartby, Lidlington, 
Houghton Conquest and the neighbouring isolated properties and 
farmsteads; and 
 
people using roads or railways. 
11.5.12 Given that the Project was put on hold in 2015 and over two years have passed 
since photomontages were last produced, a further site visit and an additional 
set of photomontages was produced in April 2017. This was in order to capture 
any changes in baseline conditions in the period between 2015 and 2017 in 
order to create accurate visual representations of the Project.  
11.5.13 A Plan showing the location of viewpoints is presented in Figure 11.2 
11.5.14 The viewpoint assessment is informed by and illustrated by a range of tools 
including wireframes, photographs and photomontages (Document Reference 
7.1). The photographs used to produce the photomontages have been taken 
in RAW format using a Canon EOS 5D Mark II Digital SLR camera with a fixed 
50mm lens and provides a focal length that is in accordance with best practice.  
The camera is mounted and levelled at 1.5 m above ground to the centre of 
the lens.  The photographs are taken in landscape format at 20 degree 
intervals giving a 50% overlap between frames, digitally joined to create a fully 
cylindrically projected panorama with a 72-degree field of view.  
11.5.15 Photomontages of the Project have been produced to provide an image of how 
the Project Site might look from a number of specific representative viewpoints 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
327 
within the study area.  For these photomontages the Project Site has been 
modelled in SketchUp Pro 3D software from AutoCAD drawings of the 
indicative layout of the plant, supported with a schedule of the indicative 
dimensions and heights of each component, to provide an accurate impression 
of the likely location and form of each of the development components that 
make up the Project.   
11.5.16 Indicative wireline models of the proposed electrical transmission tower and 
SECs are shown and a 3D model of the adjoining, consented, Covanta scheme 
(as described in Chapter 3) has also been included in the model to provide an 
indication of the cumulative context in which the Project could be seen.  The 
wireline models of the proposed transmission tower, SECs and the consented 
Covanta RRF scheme have been used as the basis for visual modelling of the 
photomontages and the assessment of effects of the Project. 
11.5.17 The 3D model of the Project is positioned accurately in a digital terrain model 
of the study area using visualisation software from which views are exported 
and brought into Adobe Photoshop, where it is positioned and rendered 
against the baseline photograph to create a realistic and accurate 
photomontage image.  Wirelines and photomontages have been produced to 
illustrate the Project with and without the Covanta scheme.   
11.5.18 The location of each photograph has been identified during field survey using 
a hand held GPS device, which allows accurate positioning within the 3D 
model.   
11.5.19 The Covanta scheme has been included in one set of photomontages, as, if 
built, it would be viewed cumulatively with the Project from all viewpoints given 
its proximity to the Generating Equipment.  Photomontages have also been 
produced without Covanta, in the event that it is not constructed. As a result, 
the assessment has taken account of views with and without Covanta.  
11.5.20 In Advice Note 01/11, Photography and Photomontage in Landscape and 
Visual Impact Assessment, The Landscape Institute states on page 2 that it is 
essential to recognise that: 
“Two-dimensional photographic images and photomontages alone cannot 
capture or reflect the complexity underlying the visual experience, and 
should therefore be considered an approximation of the three-dimensional 
visual experiences that an observer would receive in the field;  
As part of a technical process, impact assessment and considered 
judgements using photographs and/or photomontages can only be reached 
by way of a visit to the location from which the photographs were taken”. 
Landscape Assessment 
11.5.21 The assessment of landscape effects assesses how the Project will affect the 
landscape components of the study area (the ‘landscape fabric’, for example: 
landform, land use, hedgerows and trees, public rights of way, ponds or other 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
328 
features), and the key characteristics which contribute to its distinctive 
character (the ‘landscape character’).  
11.5.22 The assessment of landscape receptor sensitivity has combined judgements 
on the value attributed to the landscape receptor and the ‘susceptibility to 
change’ of the receptor to the Project. 
11.5.23 The value of potentially affected landscape receptors has been assessed. 
Landscapes may be valued at community, local, national or international 
levels.  Existing landscape designations have been taken as the starting point 
for the assessment, and the value of undesignated landscapes has also been 
assessed. 
11.5.24 A methodical consideration of each effect upon each identified landscape 
receptor has been undertaken, in order to determine the significance of effects, 
in terms of: 
 
Value and susceptibility to change (sensitivity of the landscape receptor); 
and 
 
Size / scale, extent, duration and reversibility (magnitude of the landscape 
effect). 
11.5.25 Relevant Landscape designations for the Power Generation Plant Site and 
surrounding area are shown on Figure 11.4, and set out in Table 11.2 below:

below, as taken from the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment 3, paras.5.19-5.31.  
Table 11.3: Factors Which Influence Landscape Value  
Attribute 
Criteria 
Landscape Quality 
Intactness or physical condition of the landscape or of the 
individual elements which contribute to landscape character. 
Sense of Place 
Aesthetic and perceptual qualities which create distinctiveness. 
Scenic Quality 
General appeal of the landscape to the senses. 
Rarity 
Rarity of landscape character areas, types or features. 
Representativeness 
Particular characteristic/feature/element considered an 
important example. 
Cultural Interest 
The presence of wildlife or cultural heritage interest which 
contributes positively to the landscape.  
Recreation Value 
Evidence that the landscape experience forms an important part 
of recreational activity, e.g. as established in guidebooks.  
Associations 
Relevant associations with notable figures, such as writers or 
artists, or events in history that contribute to landscape value. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
333 
11.5.27 Susceptibility of landscape receptors to change arising from the Project will be 
based on the criteria set in Table 11.4: 
Table 11.4: Landscape Receptor Susceptibility to Change 
Susceptibility 
Criteria 
High 
Little ability to accommodate the Project without undue consequences 
for the maintenance of the baseline landscape and/or the achievement 
of landscape planning policies and strategies. 
Medium 
Some ability to accommodate the Project without undue consequences 
for the maintenance of the baseline landscape and/or the achievement 
of landscape planning policies and strategies. 
Low 
Substantial ability to accommodate the Project without undue 
consequences for the maintenance of the baseline landscape and/or 
the achievement of landscape planning policies and strategies. 
11.5.28 An overall assessment of sensitivity will be made for each landscape receptor, 
based on a combined judgement of the above value and susceptibility to 
change criteria, using the typical scales set out in Table 11.5. 
Visual Assessment 
11.5.29 The assessment of effects on views and visual amenity has assessed how the 
Project will affect the publicly accessible views available to people and their 
visual amenity (see 11.5.10 for potential visual receptors).  A methodical 
consideration of each visual effect upon each identified visual receptor has 
been undertaken, in order to determine the significance of effects, in terms of: 
 
Value and susceptibility to change (sensitivity of the visual receptor, or 
viewer); and 
 
Size / scale, extent, composition, duration and reversibility (magnitude of 
the visual effect). 
11.5.30 The following terminology has been used to describe the approximate distance 
between the representative viewpoint and the Project: 
 
Local:  
 
 
under 0.5 km; 
 
Medium distance: 
0.5 km – 2 km; and 
 
Long distance:  
beyond 2 km. 
11.5.31 The types of view, and the number of viewers likely to experience the view, are 
described in the following terms: 
 
Glimpsed (i.e. in passing) / Filtered / Oblique / Framed / Open Views; and 
 
Few / Moderate / Many Viewers (see GLVIA3 para.6.15). 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
334 
11.5.32 In line with the GLVIA guidance, viewpoints for the visual impact assessment 
are from publicly accessible places.  However, where appropriate, 
representative viewpoints have been selected from publicly accessible 
locations within or on the edge of main settlements, property groupings or other 
buildings potentially affected by the Project.  
Significance Criteria 
11.5.33 A three-stage assessment process has been adopted for the LVIA, in 
accordance with the GLVIA3.  Firstly, the nature of receptors (sensitivity) is 
being assessed. Secondly the magnitude of impacts likely to result from the 
Project is being assessed. Lastly, the significance of the identified landscape 
and visual effects on receptors is being assessed by a combination of the 
above and the use of professional judgement by assessors who are chartered 
members of the Landscape Institute. 
11.5.34 Effects may be temporary, permanent or reversible over time.  The following 
terminology will be used to describe the duration of landscape and visual 
effects arising as a result of the development of the Project: 
 
Short term: 
 
 
less than 1 year; 
 
Medium term: 
 
 
1-15 years; and 
 
Long term: 
 
 
longer than 15 years. 
11.5.35 The nature of effects may be beneficial or adverse and direct or indirect.  Direct 
effects are those which result directly from the Project; whereas indirect, or 
secondary, effects may arise as a consequential change resulting from the 
Project, for example: changes to offsite and downstream vegetation as a result 
of alterations to a drainage regime. 
Landscape Criteria 
11.5.36 The sensitivity of a particular landscape considers the factors described in 
Tables 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 combining value and susceptibility to change, using 
the following typical criteria set out below in Table 11.5.  
Table 11.5: Landscape Sensitivity

 
an area that is tolerant of substantial change of the type 
proposed; 
 
undesignated landscape; 
 
a degraded landscape; and 


Magnitude of Effects 
11.5.37 The size or scale of change in the landscape relates to the loss or addition of 
features in the landscape which are likely to result from the Project, and takes 
into account: 
 
The extent/proportion of landscape elements that are lost or added; 
 
The contribution of those elements to landscape character and the degree 
to which aesthetic/perceptual aspects are altered; and 
 
Whether the effect is likely to change the key characteristics of the 
landscape, which are critical to its distinctive character. 
11.5.38 The following criteria set out in Table 11.6 have been used to assess the size 
and scale of landscape effects, based on the degree of change that will occur 
as a result of the Project:

Visual Effects Criteria 
11.5.39 The assessment of visual receptor sensitivity has combined judgements on the 
value attributed to the visual receptor and the ‘susceptibility to change’ of the 
receptor to the specific type of development proposed. 
11.5.40 The value assigned to views has had regard to a number of factors, including: 
 
Recognition through planning or heritage assets; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
338 
 
The popularity of the viewpoint, its appearance in guidebooks, literature or 
art, on tourist maps, and the facilities provided to enable enjoyment of the 
view. 
11.5.41 The criteria for the assessment of the value of views is summarised in Table 
11.7 below; note that these are provided for guidance and are not intended to 
be absolute. 
Table 11.7: Value of Views 
Value 
Criteria 
High 
Views from landscapes/viewpoints of national importance, or highly popular 
visitor attractions where the view forms an important part of the experience, or 
with important cultural associations. 
Medium 
Views from landscapes/viewpoints of regional/district importance or 
moderately popular visitor attractions where the view forms part of the 
experience, or with local cultural associations. 
Low 
Views from landscapes/viewpoints with no designations, not particularly 
popular as a viewpoint and with minimal or no cultural associations. 
11.5.42 The susceptibility of people to changes in views is a function of: 
 
The occupation or activity of the viewer at a given location; and 
 
The extent, therefore, to which a person’s attention or interest may be 
focussed on a particular view and the visual amenity experienced. 
11.5.43 For the purposes of the visual impact assessment, visual receptors’ 
susceptibility to change has been based upon the Table 11.8 below: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
339 
Table 11.8: Visual Receptor Susceptibility to Change 
Susceptibility 
Type of Receptor 
High 
 
Residents; 
 
People engaged in outdoor recreation, including users of public 
rights of way, whose attention is likely to be focussed on the 
visual environment of the landscape and on particular views; 
 
Visitors to heritage assets, landmarks or other attractions where 
views of the surroundings are an important part of the experience;  
 
Communities where views contribute to the landscape setting 
enjoyed by residents; and 
 
Travellers on scenic routes. 
Medium 
 
Travellers on road, rail or other transport routes, where the view is 
moderately important to the quality of the journey (e.g. on a scenic 
route); and 
 
People using local parks, open spaces, public realm, or walking 
on streets or local public rights of way, with moderate interest in 
their visual environment. 
Low 
 
People engaged in outdoor sport or recreation, which does not 
involve appreciation of, or focus upon, views; 
 
People at their place of work, where the landscape setting is not 
important to the quality of working life; and  
 
Travellers, where the view is fleeting and incidental to the journey. 
11.5.44 The magnitude of a visual effect has been assessed in terms of its size or 
scale, the geographical extent of the area influenced and its duration and 
degree of reversibility.  
11.5.45 The size or scale of change in the view relates to the degree of contrast to, or 
integration with, the visual composition, which is likely to result from the 
Project; and is influenced by the relative time over which a view is experienced 
and whether it is a full, partial or glimpsed view. 
11.5.46 The following criteria will be used to assess the magnitude of visual impacts, 
based on the degree of change to the view or composition as set out below in 
Table 11.9 below: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
340 
Table 11.9: Visual Effects: Magnitude of Impact 
Magnitude of 
Visual Impact 
Criteria 
Major adverse 
or beneficial 
The proposals will cause a dominant or complete change or contrast to 
the view, resulting from the loss or addition of features in the view and 
will substantially alter (degrade or enhance) the appreciation or 
composition of the view. 
Moderate 
adverse or 
beneficial 
The proposals will cause a clearly noticeable change or contrast to the 
view, which would have some effect on the composition, resulting from the 
loss or addition of features in the view and will noticeably alter (degrade or 
enhance) the appreciation of the view. 
Slight adverse 
or beneficial 
The proposals will cause a perceptible change or contrast to the view, but 
which would not materially affect the composition or the appreciation of 
the view. 
Negligible 
adverse or 
beneficial 
The proposals will cause a barely perceptible change or contrast to the 
view, which would not affect the composition or the appreciation of the 
view. 
No change 
The proposals will maintain the existing view and cause no change to the 
view. 
Neutral 
There will be a change to the composition of the view, but the change will 
be entirely in keeping with the existing elements of the view and maintain 
the composition of the existing view. 
11.5.47 The significance of landscape and visual effects has been determined from a 
combination of the receptor sensitivity and the magnitude of impact, as set out 
in Table 11.10 below.  Effects of moderate significance and above are reported 
as ‘significant’ in EIA terms, and are highlighted in bold in Table 11.10. Minor 
and negligible levels of significance are identified as ‘not significant’.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Context 
11.6.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site is mainly located within Rookery South Pit.  
For the purposes of assessing the baseline it has been assumed that Rookery 
South Pit will be restored to low grade agricultural land with stabilised and re-
profiled pit sides pursuant to the implementation of the LLRS, as described in 
paragraphs 3.1.4-3.1.8 and 4.10.10. The ground level of the pit is 15m below 
the surrounding ground level. 
11.6.2 
The history of extensive clay extraction and brick making in the area is evident 
in the large flooded pits, re-vegetated spoil heaps, the four chimneys 
approximately 70m tall and associated buildings of the former Stewartby 
brickworks and the model village of Stewartby, built in the 1920s for the 
workers of The London Brick Company.   
11.6.3 
Rookery North Pit, to the north of the Generating Equipment Site, is occupied 
by a lake resulting from the flooding of the former pit. To the south, southeast 
and west of the Generating Equipment Site, low ridges rise up to define the 
edge of Marston Vale whilst to the north the floor of the Vale continues to the 
edge of Bedford.  
11.6.4 
The nearest property is South Pillinge Farm, approximately 130m west of the 
Project Site boundary and 390m west of the Generating Equipment Site, 
although it is separated by at least two belts of mature vegetation and an earth 
embankment.  Most settlements and outlying properties are also protected by 
screening vegetation and as the landform is generally level so the vegetation 
is more effective. 
11.6.5 
Recreational receptors include users of:  
 
Open spaces such as the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, Ampthill 
Park and Folly Wood near Lidlington; 
 
Cycle ways across the Marston Vale; 
 
Footpaths and other public rights of way across the Marston Vale and 
surrounding ridges; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
342 
 
Heritage assets such as Houghton House and Ampthill Park.  
11.6.6 
The sensitivity of the receptors is set out in the Visual Effects Table at Appendix 
11.1. 
11.6.7 
Landscape and visual receptors within the study area which are not likely to 
experience a significant effect, due to distance, landform and intervening 
vegetation, have been scoped out of this LVIA and are not considered further. 
These are described in Table 11.2.  
Landscape Features 
11.6.8 
Landscape features of the Project Site include the landform, woodland, 
hedgerows and public rights of way. 
11.6.9 
The landform comprises the sunken area of the Rookery South Pit. To the 
south, south-east and west low ridges rise to define the edge of Marston Vale; 
to the north the floor of the vale continues to the edge of Bedford. 
11.6.10 There are young mixed woodland plantations bordering and partly within the 
Project Site, with a broadleaved woodland area on the western side and a few 
species-poor hedgerows. 
11.6.11 A public right of way crosses the Project Site south of South Pillinge Farm and 
another crosses the gas connection corridor north of Lower Farm (see Table 
11.2).

11.6.12 Published sources describing the landscape character of the area at the 
National, Regional and District level are:

National Landscape Character 
11.6.15 Most of the Project Site lies within National Character Area 88: Bedfordshire 
and Cambridgeshire Claylands but part of the Gas Connection is within 
National Character Area 90: Bedfordshire and Greensand Ridge to the south.  
11.6.16 Key characteristics of National Character Area 88: Bedfordshire and 
Cambridgeshire Claylands, of relevance to the Project Site and locality, 
include: 
 
Gently undulating, lowland plateau divided by shallow river valleys that 
gradually widen as they approach The Fens NCA in the east; 
 
Brickfields of the Marston Vale and Peterborough area form distinctive 
post-industrial landscapes with man-made waterbodies and landfill sites. 
Restoration of sand and gravel workings has left a series of flooded and 
restored waterbodies within the river valleys; 
 
Variable, scattered woodland cover comprising smaller plantations, 
secondary woodland, pollarded willows and poplar along river valleys, and 
clusters of ancient woodland; 
 
Predominantly open, arable landscape of planned and regular fields 
bounded by open ditches and trimmed, often species-poor hedgerows 
which contrast with those fields that are irregular and piecemeal”; 
 
“Wide variety of semi-natural habitats supporting a range of species; 
 
A number of historic parklands, designed landscapes and country 
houses… combine with… brickfields to provide a strong sense of history 
and place;  
 
Settlements cluster around major road and rail corridors, with smaller 
towns, villages and linear settlements widely dispersed throughout, giving 
a more rural feel; and 
 
Recreational assets include… Forest of Marston Vale Community Forest… 
woodland and wetland sites, an extensive rights-of-way network and two 
National Cycle Routes.  
11.6.17 Key characteristics of National Character Area 90: Bedfordshire Greensand 
Ridge, of relevance to the Project Site and locality, include: 
 
Narrow escarpment resulting from the erosion-resistant sediments of the 
Lower Greensand Group, with a distinct scarp slope to the northwest and 
dip slope to the south-east; 
 
The rolling and elevated Ridge provides a north-west-facing wooded 
skyline offering extensive panoramic views across the lower-lying 
Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands and towards the Chilterns; 
 
Substantial blocks of ancient woodland and coniferous plantation are found 
on the Ridge and steeper slopes. Wood pasture and numerous hedgerow 
trees, copses and shelterbelts are associated with the estate farmland and 
parkland trees; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
344 
 
Mixed field and roadside boundaries range from mature shelterbelts to 
gappy, short flailed boundaries to intact evergreen hedgerows; 
 
A patchwork of semi-natural habitats including mire habitats, lowland 
heathland and lowland mixed deciduous woodland species; 
 
Historic parklands and estates associated with grand country houses such 
as Woburn;  
 
Dispersed settlement pattern along the Greensand Ridge, with the majority 
of towns and villages lying along the river valleys and southern dip slopes; 
and 
 
Road and rail links cut north–south through the Ridge. 
County Landscape Character 
11.6.18 The Central Bedfordshire Landscape Character Assessment characterises the 
area encompassing most of the Project Site as landscape character area 5D: 
North Marston Clay Vale. The key characteristics of this character area, which 
are relevant to the Project Site, are: 
 
A large scale, open vale, defined by Oxford Clay geology, located between 
the elevated landscapes of the Wooded Greensand Ridge (6b) and the 
Cranfield to Stagsden Clay Farmland (1a) that provide a sense of 
containment; 
 
An agricultural landscape fragmented by current and former industrial 
activity including brick works, open cast clay pits, landfill, distribution 
centres and industrial estates; 
 
A legacy of clay extraction (for brick making) has resulted in a disturbed 
landscape, currently subject to large scale restoration - evoking a 
landscape in transition; 
 
The establishment of Country Parks and the Forest of Marston Vale with 
its Forest Centre provides valuable ecological, recreational and landscape 
resources; 
 
Flooded clay pits form a series of lakes throughout the vale such as at 
Stewartby Country Park. These have created significant recreational value 
and ecological interest; 
 
Mature woodland is relatively scarce; 
 
Arable farming is the predominant land use of the area typically occurring 
in large, open fields with short-flailed, sparse hedgerow boundaries and 
drainage channels; 
 
A number of busy transport routes cut north south through the landscape - 
including the A421(T) the A6 (forming the eastern boundary of the area) 
and the main railway lines running from Bedford to London and Milton 
Keynes; 
 
Lines of pylons cut across the landscape and are highly visible - extending 
from the Greensand Ridge; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
345 
 
Stewartby – a model village begun in 1926 by the Stewart family, owners 
of the London Brick Company. Characterised by consistent red-brick 
houses set around large areas of green space. The adjacent chimney 
stacks dominate views; and 
 
Numerous public rights of way cut through the landscape and provide 
connections to the recreational routes on the adjacent landscapes - the 
John Bunyan Trail and the Greensand Ridge Walk. 
11.6.19 Landscape character area 6B: Mid Greensand Ridge is located to the south of 
area 5D. The southernmost tip of the Project Site crosses into this area. The 
key characteristics of this character area, which are relevant to the Project Site 
are: 
 
A large scale ridge with a gently undulating ridge top; forming part of the 
prominent band of Greensand that extends SW- NE across the county; 
 
Agricultural land is primarily in arable cultivation but with some variation of 
land use i.e. pockets of pasture and free-range pig farming that bring 
localised variation. There is a greater proportion of pasture on the 
northwest facing slope; 
 
Strong underlying heathland character with fine examples of remnant 
heathland and neutral/acid grassland; 
 
Strong wooded context with extensive areas of deciduous woodland (a 
large proportion of which is ancient), mixed woodland and coniferous 
plantations e.g. Exeter Wood, Maulden Wood and Rowney Warren Wood; 
 
Woodland located along the northwest facing slope and northern half of 
the ridge top forms part of The Forest of Marston Vale - one of 12 
Community Forests in England; 
 
The contrast of arable land and densely wooded areas creates contrasting 
perspectives from open and exposed to enclosed and sheltered; 
 
A large number of historic parks and gardens impart a designed character 
- including the Grade II* listed Southill Park and Old Warden Park and the 
Grade II listed Moggerhanger Park, Ickwell Bury and Ampthill Park; 
 
Parkland is a dominant land use, influencing not just the land within the 
park boundary but also the wider landscape for example through the 
creation or retention of tree clumps as part of significant vistas; 
 
Variable fields and roadside boundaries - ranging from mature shelterbelts 
to gappy, short flailed boundaries to intact holly hedges (surrounding 
Southill Park); 
 
Primary transport routes including the M1 and A6 (T) and Midland Mainline 
railway cross north-south through the ridge and reduce tranquillity although 
large areas of the ridge have a remote character; 
 
Settlements 
comprise 
medium 
to 
small 
villages 
and 
hamlets 
(predominantly linear). Some have a varied character (due to modern 
expansion) e.g. Maulden and Silsoe with others (including estate villages) 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
346 
being consistent in terms of material and style such as Haynes (red bricks, 
clay tiles and timber-framed houses); 
 
The John Bunyan Trail and Greensand Ridge Walk cross significant tracts 
- connecting the ridge with the adjacent area; and 
 
Bordered by the town of Ampthill that brings some urban edge 
characteristics to the landscape. 
District Landscape Character 
11.6.20 The Forest of Marston Vale: Forest Plan (The Forest of Marston Vale, 2000) 
includes a landscape assessment, dividing the forest into four landscape 
zones. The Power Generation Plant Site falls within the Brickfields landscape 
zone, with the Gas and Electrical Connections falling within the Greensand 
Ridge and East Vale landscape zone.  
11.6.21 The Brickfields landscape zone is described as follows: 
“This is the heart of the Forest of Marston Vale and is dominated by clay pits 
and their varying after uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village 
settlements”. 
11.6.22 The assessment of the area states that: 
 
This is the core area of the Vale where there is a need to secure a higher 
level of new planting than elsewhere in the Community Forest. The derelict 
land and pits associated with the brick industry, expanding settlements and 
busy transport links require substantial planting to offer landscape, wildlife, 
recreation and amenity benefits; 
 
The relationship of new woods with open waterbodies such as Stewartby 
and Brogborough lakes will be very important and a mix of waterside 
landuses including open land, wetlands and woodland should be 
developed; 
 
Substantial tree and shrub planting will encourage a sense of place but 
wider views need to be retained particularly where features such as lakes, 
the Greensand Ridge and church towers can be seen; and 
 
Farming is still important in this area and is characterised by large, open 
fields surrounded by ditches and over trimmed, sparse hedges. 
11.6.23 Proposals for the area state that: 
 
The Team will work with landowners to secure a higher proportion of 
woodland planting in this area than the more agriculturally productive land 
to either side of the Vale. All land types will need to be targeted to deliver 
the level of planting needed and landscape impacts of project work will 
need to be assessed from both the Vale floor and elevated positions on 
the ridges; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
347 
 
Poplar belts and other existing tree belts will be managed to develop 
stronger and more natural screens for clay extraction and landfilling 
operations. 
11.6.24 These proposals are reinforced by CBC’s Core Strategy (2009) Policy CS16: 
Landscape and Woodlands, which states that the Council will: 
11.6.25 ‘Continue to support the creation of the Forest of Marston Vale recognising the 
need to regenerate the environmentally damaged landscape through 
woodland creation to achieve the target of 30% woodland cover in the Forest 
area by 2030.’ 
11.6.26 The Greensand Ridge and East Vale is described as follows: 
11.6.27 “The Ridge provides the most wooded area in the Community Forest and the 
east Vale is good agricultural land with much remaining evidence of estate 
management practices. It is quite open in nature, affording excellent views of 
the Cardington Hangars, and settlements located towards the Ouse”. 
11.6.28 The assessment of the area states that: 
 
The Ridge and its scarp provides one of the most wooded areas of the 
Community Forest and is an important backdrop to the work planned for 
the core of the Vale; 
 
Opportunities should be sought to strengthen the existing woodlands, 
improve the hedgerow network and to add features such as copses on 
knolls; 
 
Points of topographical interest such as outcrops of greensand and small 
valleys should not be obscured by planting; 
 
The existing areas of scrub and sites that could be developed as acidic 
grassland could offer much to the diversity of the Ridge landscape and tree 
planting must not detract from this variety. For some sites, management 
will be required to maintain the diversity of habitats that generates such 
landscape interest; and 
 
Villages and infrastructure such as roads can be better assimilated into the 
landscape by the planting of more blocks of trees and the use of screening 
belts, but long distance views of the Greensand Ridge must not be 
obscured. 
11.6.29 Proposals for the area state that: 
 
Different geology and landforms will offer landscape opportunities different 
from those of the clay Vale floor such as stands of copses. Where possible, 
the Team will identify these sites and put forward proposals for diversifying 
the landscape particularly on the Greensand Ridge. Links with features on 
the lower slopes and Vale floor such as Wilstead Wood, will be developed; 
and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
348 
 
The creation of other habitats will be an important feature of project work 
on the Ridge and the landscape value of habitats such as acidic grassland, 
will be assessed along with ecological and other benefits. 
Project Site Character 
11.6.30 The Power Generation Plant will be located in Rookery South Pit, which will 
have been restored in accordance with the LLRS, as set out in Section 4.7.  
11.6.31 The LLRS will include rough grassland, newly planted trees and scrub and a 
network of ditches. However, it has been assumed that the planting will not 
have had time to become established and therefore have any mitigating effects 
prior to construction of the Project.  The defining characteristics are the 
topography and the ditches. 
11.6.32 The Gas and Electrical Connection cross arable farmland on a gently rising 
land form, with a pattern of large fields defined by hedges and plantations, with 
mature plantations to the west.  The fields are crossed by existing electricity 
transmission towers.  The Midland Mainline and Marston Vale Lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the eastern and western edges of The Rookery.  
The relocated transmission tower and the SECs will be to the south-west of 
the LLRS and Rookery South Pit, with a small part within an area of existing 
woodland. All the characteristics of the Project Site have been assessed as 
having low sensitivity as they are common in the area and are readily 
replicated, with the exception of footpaths where the sensitivity is medium 
owing to the effects at diversion in changing the experience for the user. 
Representative Viewpoints 
11.6.33 As a result of reviewing the ZTV and potential visual receptors, the following 
representative viewpoints are considered to have potential to experience 
significant visual effects and therefore have been used for the visual impact 
assessment.  These are set out in Table 11.11 below and shown on Figure 
11.2.

Assessment of Effects   
11.7.1 
The assessment of effects on landscape and visual amenity is presented in 
tables in Appendix 11.1. The following paragraphs provide a summary of this 
assessment. The significant visual effects and landscape effects are 
summarised in Tables 11.13 and 11.14 respectively.  
Power Generation Plant 
Construction 
11.7.2 
The main works associated with the construction / decommissioning phases of 
the Power Generation Plant will be excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations and potential piling (if required) and using cranes to locate the Gas 
Turbine Generator units into position.  Adverse temporary landscape and 
visual effects have the potential to arise from the following activities during 
construction and decommissioning: 
 
Site clearance, removal of vegetation and topsoil stripping; 
 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
 
Construction of an internal road for access to the buildings and Laydown 
Area; 
 
Movement of traffic including delivery and removal of materials to and from 
the Project Site, off-site road traffic including workers travelling to and from 
Project Site; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
351 
 
General construction / decommissioning activities including the movement 
of large scale construction equipment, i.e. tower cranes, smaller cranes, 
batching plants drilling rigs etc.; site compounds; and  
 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months. 
Visual Effects 
11.7.3 
The construction phase is of a limited duration (22 months) and the effects 
listed above will not all occur simultaneously. Furthermore, most of the 
activities will take place within Rookery South Pit and will therefore be 
approximately 15m below the surrounding ground level, so will have limited 
potential for having visual effects on viewpoints listed in Table 11.11.  
11.7.4 
In terms of the Access Road, construction will involve lower vehicles than for 
the Power Generation Plant Site where cranes will be needed (e.g. tipper 
trucks rather than cranes) and the work will be undertaken on the route of the 
existing access track.  
11.7.5 
Landscape Effects 
11.7.6 
Landscape effects during the construction phase will be limited to direct effects 
on the Power Generation Plant Site, and some intervisibility with adjacent 
character areas.   
11.7.7 
Along the Access Road approximately 78 linear metres of roadside hedges 
and trees will be removed in association with the construction of the junction 
and visibility splays for the access from Green Lane, and approximately 690 
linear metres of intermittent trees and scrub along the western side of the 
access past the Rookery North Pit.  
11.7.8 
However, this is a worst case scenario, which assumes that MPL would need 
to construct the entire length of Access Road (i.e. independently of Covanta. 
Should Covanta construct the Rookery RRF project first, MPL would only need 
to construct the Short Access Road, which would not require the removal of 
this vegetation.  
11.7.9 
Operation 
Visual Effects 
11.7.10 Although the Power Generation Plant Site is already well screened as it is 
mainly within Rookery South Pit (which is approximately 15m deep), and by 
surrounding vegetation and landform, the stack is still likely to be visible from 
certain locations close to the Project Site, such as Viewpoints 14 and 15, as 
well as from further afield.  
11.7.11 Therefore, the key potential visual effects arising from the Power Generation 
Plant during the operational phase will be in relation to the 35m high stack.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
352 
11.7.12 Due to the local topography in the area, views are mainly limited to the south 
and south east of the Project Site, along higher ground, particularly around the 
Greensand Ridge as at Ampthill Park (Viewpoints 3 and 6) and local views 
(Viewpoints 14 and 15). 
11.7.13 In most cases however, views of the Power Generation Plant Site will be seen 
in the context of the existing wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park, 
existing railways with gantries, catenary and embankments, the large 
transmission towers associated with the existing 400kV Sundon to Grendon 
line and the four remaining chimneys at the former brickworks at Stewartby. 
Views of the Power Generation Plant Site will also be filtered by intermediate 
hedges and belts of woodland. 
11.7.14 Landscape Effects 
11.7.15 Landscape effects during operation will be limited to direct effects on site 
resulting from the loss of existing vegetation, and indirect effects arising from 
some intervisibility with adjacent character areas. 
11.7.16 Although a substantial amount of new planting will have been implemented, it 
will not provide effective mitigation initially; however, from year 15 onwards the 
planting will provide a landscape benefit.   
Decommissioning 
Visual Effects 
11.7.17 The decommissioning phase is likely to be of a similar duration to the 
construction phase and the effects will not all occur simultaneously. As before, 
most of the activities will take place within Rookery South Pit and will therefore 
be approximately 15m below the surrounding ground level, so will have limited 
potential for having visual effects. 
Landscape Effects 
11.7.18 Landscape effects during the decommissioning phase will be limited to direct 
effects within the Power Generation Plant site, and some intervisibility with 
adjacent character areas. 
11.7.19 All above ground structures will be removed and the Power Generation Plant 
Site will be restored.  
Gas Connection 
Construction  
11.7.20 Construction of the Gas Connection will largely comprise excavating a trench 
across fields, limited hedge removal and the construction of the AGI. The AGI 
and its security fence will be a maximum of 3m high. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
353 
Visual Effects 
11.7.21 Visual effects will include movement of vehicles and plant and construction of 
the AGI. From many of the viewpoints the construction will be screened by 
intervening vegetation and landform. Where there are views, they are often 
filtered by intervening vegetation, with the exception of Viewpoint 16 where 
there will be an open view. 
Landscape Effects 
11.7.22 Landscape effects during the construction phase will be limited to the removal 
of sections of hedgerow crossed by the gas connection and the temporary 
diversion of footpaths (FP7 and FP65).  
11.7.23 Operation 
11.7.24 During operation, the Pipeline will be buried and the ground re-instated.  Gaps 
in the hedges will be replanted. 
Visual Effects 
11.7.25 The AGI, which will be located approximately 120m east of a residential 
property at Lower Farm, will be a relatively modest structure in comparison to 
the Generating Equipment. It will incorporate screen planting on all sides to 
reduce visual effects.  Views will be screened by existing trees and hedges. 
As it matures the perimeter planting will also provide screening. 
11.7.26 Landscape Effects 
11.7.27 The Gas Connection will result in landscape effects where it crosses hedge 
boundaries, but these crossings will be replanted. 
11.7.28 Public rights of way will be reinstated to their original lines and will benefit from 
the addition of new woodland belts and hedgerows. 
11.7.29 Decommissioning 
11.7.30 The Pipeline will remain underground on decommissioning although there will 
be activities associated with the dismantling of the AGI and its security fence, 
which will be short term and localised. 
Visual Effects 
11.7.31 Adverse visual effects will result from the decommissioning activities but none 
will be significant apart from Viewpoint 16 in the vicinity of the AGI.  
Landscape Effects 
11.7.32 All working areas will be reinstated and vegetation will be retained. 
Electrical Connection 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
354 
Construction 
11.7.33 High vehicles including cranes will be required for erecting the temporary and 
permanent transmission towers, dismantling the existing tower and 
constructing the SECs. 
Visual Effects 
11.7.34 Construction activities will result in some adverse visual effects, the most 
severe being on Viewpoint 14, the nearest viewpoint, on Footpath 7 to the 
south. 
Landscape Effects 
11.7.35 Clearance of approximately 2,075m2 of existing woodland and coppicing of 
approximately 1,310m2 of existing woodland will result from the electrical 
connection construction. 
11.7.36 One public right of way, Footpath 14, will need to be temporarily diverted during 
the construction phase. 
Operation  
11.7.37 The SECs will be located partly within existing woodland, which will be cleared, 
and partly within an open field. The new transmission tower will be 
approximately 40m to the south-east of the existing tower, with a maximum 
height from 49m.   
Visual Effects 
11.7.38 From many of the viewpoints the lower part of the tower is screened by 
intervening vegetation and development, but the upper part of the tower is 
visible, often seen against the distant ridge, in the context of existing wind 
turbine, pylons and chimneys within the Vale. However, views of the SECs are 
limited to the local area, such as from Viewpoint 14. 
Landscape Effects 
11.7.39 The loss of the approximately 2,075m2 of woodland will be mitigated by the 
planting of approximately 8,790m2 of new woodland and 3,590m2 of scrub and 
grassland matrix around the compound, as shown in Appendix 2 of the LEMMS 
report (Appendix 11.3). The area of coppiced woodland will have been allowed 
to regrow. 
11.7.40 The public right of way will be reinstated to its original line and will benefit from 
the addition of new woodland belts and hedgerows. 
Decommissioning  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
355 
11.7.41 The removal of the SECs will require similar equipment to that required for its 
construction.  The area will be reinstated to contribute towards the matrix of 
woodland, scrub and grass.  The transmission tower will remain in operation. 
Visual Effects 
11.7.42 Views of the SECs removal will be limited to the local area, such as from 
Viewpoint 14.  
Landscape Effects 
11.7.43 Working areas will be reinstated and the maturing woodland, scrub and 
grassland matrix will continue to be managed.  
Summary of Significant Visual Effects 
11.7.44 The Visual Effects Table at Appendix 11.1 sets out details of the assessed 
visual effects of the Project on each of the 18 viewpoints, taking into account 
the value of views, the susceptibility of the receptor to change and therefore 
the overall sensitivity, the magnitude of effects and proposed mitigation. 
11.7.45 Visual effects are assessed for each of the components of the Project, 
comprising the Power Generation Plant, the Gas Connection and the Electrical 
Connection. In accordance with guidance in GLVIA3, the interaction of 
components is taken into account in assessing the overall significant effects, 
as summarised below for each assessment period.   
11.7.46 Viewpoints likely to experience significant effects are summarised as follows:

Power Generation Plant  
11.7.47 Significant visual effects are predicted at Viewpoints 3, 5, 6, 7, 14 and 15. 
Viewpoints 3 and 6 are sensitive viewpoints to the south-east, and viewpoint 
14 is a local viewpoint to the south where construction activities will be partly 
screened by boundary hoardings at ground level. 
Gas Connection 
11.7.48 Significant visual effects are predicted at Viewpoints 14 and 16.

Summary of Significant Landscape Effects 
11.7.61 The Landscape Effects Table at Appendix 11.1 sets out details of the assessed 
landscape effects of the Project on national, county, district and local character 
areas and on landform, woodland, trees and hedgerows, Public Rights of Way 
(PRoW) and watercourses.  
11.7.62 Landscape effects are assessed for each of the components of the Project, 
comprising the Power Generation Plant, the Gas Connection and the Electrical 
Connection. In accordance with guidance in GLVIA3, the interaction of 
components is taken into account in assessing the overall significant effects, 
as summarised below for each assessment period.   
11.7.63 The assessment shows no overall significant effects in EIA terms for any 
Landscape Character Area. Landscape features likely to experience overall 
significant effects are summarised as follows: 
Construction

Power Generation Plant 
11.7.64 Significant adverse landscape effects are predicted for woodland, trees and 
hedgerows due to the loss of vegetation along the Access Road and entrance 
to the Project Site, as described in 11.7.6-11.7.7. 
Electrical Connection 
11.7.65 Significant adverse landscape effects are predicted for woodland, trees and 
hedgerows due to the loss of vegetation, and Public Rights of Way as one 
footpath (FP14) will be temporarily diverted.

11.7.66 Significant adverse landscape effects are predicted for Public Rights of Way 
as two footpaths (FP7 and FP14) will be temporarily diverted. 
11.7.67 During construction there will be significant adverse landscape effects on

Night Time Lighting 
11.8.1 
An Outline Lighting Strategy has been prepared for the Project (Appendix 11.2) 
and submitted alongside the ES to support the DCO Application. However, the 
overarching philosophy is, as far as possible, to maintain a dark site.   
11.8.2 
Other design parameters are, in summary:  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
360 
 
For the Power Generation Plant Site, a curfew will be implemented for all 
non-critical lighting from 23.00 to 05.00 hrs to reduce the impact of the 
development on the local environment.  
 
External lighting for the Substation and Above Ground Installation (AGI) 
will only be required for infrequent routine and unplanned maintenance 
activity. 
 
For internal lighting, appropriate measures will be included for reducing 
light spill. 
 
The level of lighting within open compounds will be sufficient to allow the 
safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles (using their headlights) about 
the compound in areas that they might reasonably be expected to 
negotiate at night. 
 
All luminaires will completely omit direct upward light emission and peak 
light intensities from any fitting will not unintentionally illuminate any 
building or structure. 
Landscape and Visual Effects of Night Time Lighting 
11.8.3 
The potential visual and landscape effects of lighting will be limited as the 
lighting is designed to avoid upward light spillage and most lighting will only be 
used when required, such as when unplanned maintenance is required at 
night. The scale of the lighting and its infrequent use will not be sufficient to 
have any significant landscape effects.  
11.8.4 
Most views towards the Project Site are from recreational receptors, some with 
high sensitivity, such as Houghton House and Ampthill Park. Very few people 
are likely to be using those receptors at night, additionally, there are sources 
of lighting from settlement and development in the context of the site, such as 
Lidlington, Cranfield, Stewartby and Marston Moretaine as well as from road 
junctions such as the junction at Marston Moretaine and along the Bedford 
Road parallel to the A421, and at railway stations.   As a result, the landscape 
and visual effects of the lighting of the scheme, given the distance from 
receptors and likely lack of recreational users, will not be significant. 
11.8.5 
Of the representative viewpoints considered in the LVIA, most are from 
recreational facilities which are unlikely to be used at night, such as Ampthill 
Park, or that are closed at night such as the Millennium Country Park and 
Houghton House.  
11.8.6 
Representative viewpoints that would be unlikely to have use at night by 
sensitive receptors are as follows:  
11.8.7 
Viewpoints 3 (Ampthill Park), 4 (Houghton House), 6 (Greensand Ridge 
Walk/B530),8 (footpaths at Marston Moretaine), 9 (Marston Vale Trail near 
Lidlington), 12 (Green Lane), 13 (Hill Farm/Bridleway – although Hill Farm is a 
potential residential receptor, views are screened from it by existing 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
361 
vegetation), 14 (footpath near Vehicle Proving Ground), 15 (public footpath on 
the edge of Millennium Country Park) and 16 (public footpath north of the AGI).  
11.8.8 
Representative viewpoints that would be expected to be used at night are all 
residential, and are: 
11.8.9 
Viewpoints 2, (opposite the Chequers pub with patrons as the receptors), 5 
(cottages near Houghton House) and 7 (near to Ampthill Park House and 
representative of a residential receptor).   However, in Viewpoint 2 much of the 
Power Generation Plant is obscured by the railway embankment and only the 
stack is visible so that on the rare occasions that the site is lit, the directional 
nature of the lighting will mean that it is unlikely to be visible.   In viewpoint 5, 
there will be clear views to the Project in the Rookery South Pit, but it will be 
approximately 1.8 km away, and in the context of lighting at Marston Moretaine 
beyond. In viewpoint 7, where views occur from Ampthill Park House, the use 
of lighting will be fleeting and in the context of lighting at Stewartby and Marston 
Moretaine.    
11.8.10 The AGI is separate from the other parts of the Project and 120m from the front 
elevation of Lower Farm. Given that the lighting will only be operated when 
required and that views to the AGI will be filtered by existing vegetation, no 
significant effects will be experienced.   
11.9 
Cumulative Landscape and Visual Effects Assessment (CLVEA)  
Introduction 
11.9.1 
Cumulative landscape and visual effects are the additional landscape and 
visual changes caused by a proposed development in conjunction with other 
similar (cumulative) developments.  
11.9.2 
Definition of cumulative landscape and visual effects was first set out in the 
2002 edition of the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment, 
and since then has been further refined, in terms of windfarm development, by 
guidance produced in Scotland, which is used widely and not only in Scotland. 
The current definitions, as set out in 'Assessing the Cumulative Impact of 
Onshore Wind Energy Developments', Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), 2012, 
are referred to in paragraph 7.3 of the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment, Third Edition, 2013 (Landscape Institute and IEMA), 
(GLVIA3) and comprise: 
 
Cumulative effects - 'the additional changes caused by a proposed 
development in conjunction with other similar developments or as the 
combined effect of a set of developments, taken together'; 
 
Cumulative visual effects - effects caused by combined visibility, which 
'occurs where the observer is able to see two or more developments from 
one viewpoint' and/or sequential effects which 'occur when the observer 
has to move to another viewpoint to see different developments'; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
362 
 
Cumulative landscape effects - effects that 'can impact on either the 
physical fabric or character of the landscape, or any special values 
attached to it'.  
11.9.3 In accordance with the emphasis in EIA, the assessment is required to focus 
on the cumulative landscape and visual effects which are likely to be 
significant, rather than providing a comprehensive listing of every cumulative 
landscape and visual effect that might occur. The approach must be 
reasonable and proportional to the proposed development. 
11.9.4 Paragraph 7.18 of GLVIA3 refers to different focuses of a cumulative effects 
assessment: ‘…the additional effects of the main project under consideration, 
or on the combined effects of all the past, present and future proposals 
together with the new project.’ GLVIA3 recognises some of the limitations of 
assessing combined cumulative effects, noting that ‘…the assessor will not 
have assessed the other schemes and cannot make a fully informed 
judgement.’ 
11.9.5  PINS Advice Note 17: Cumulative Effects Assessment Relevant to Nationally 
Significant Infrastructure (PINS Advice Note 17), sets out an overview of a 
process for cumulative effects assessment (CEA) which ‘…applicants may 
wish to adopt for NSIPs.’. Paragraph 1.4 of PINS17 makes reference to the 
Overarching NPS for Energy (EN-1) paragraph 4.2.5, which states: ‘When 
considering cumulative effects, the ES should provide information on how the 
effects of the applicant’s proposal would combine and interact with the effects 
of other development…’  
11.9.6 PINS Advice Note 17 sets out suggested stages for a CEA process. Stage 4 
Assessment, (PINS Advice Note 17 pages 8 and 9) acknowledges there may 
be limitations or uncertainty to the CEA; and, in paragraph 3.4.5, reminds 
applicants that ‘…the CEA should be proportionate and not be any longer than 
is necessary to identify and assess any likely significant cumulative effects that 
are material to the decision making process, rather than cataloguing every 
conceivable effect.’. 
11.9.7 Taking into account GLVIA3 and PINS Advice Note 17, the Cumulative 
Landscape and Visual Effects Assessment (CLVEA) of this ES seeks to 
provide an understanding of cumulative landscape and visual effects in terms 
of how the Project would both interact and combine with effects of other 
development (hereafter referred to as the “cumulative developments”). 
Accordingly, the CLVEA is formed by two parts: 
 
Incremental cumulative effects; that is, the additional effects of the 
Project in the context of all the cumulative developments being taken into 
account.  So this assessment essentially looks at the contribution of the 
Project to the overall effect of the cumulative developments.  For example, 
Project X results in 0.25ha of woodland removed, and Project Y results in 
9ha of woodland removed – whilst the combined cumulative effects (see 
below) would be 9.25ha of woodland removed and therefore potentially 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
363 
quite significant, the incremental cumulative effect of Project X is 0.25ha 
of woodland; and 
 
Combined cumulative effects: the effects resulting from the combination 
of the Project and cumulative developments. These may be further 
identified as additive effects (a total effect produced by the Project and 
cumulative developments in combination; being the sum of the parts or the 
overall consequence). For example, in simplest terms, Project X results in 
1ha of woodland removed, Project Y results in 2ha of woodland removed, 
resulting in a combined additive cumulative effect of 3ha of woodland 
removed); or synergistic effects (where the combined effect is greater 
than the sum of the separate effects of the cumulative developments, and 
which wouldn’t have occurred from the Project or any of the cumulative 
developments in isolation. For example, the losses of woodland from 
Project X and Project Y combine to have a new effect on a species that is 
not affected by the loss of woodland from either Project X or Project Y in 
isolation).  
11.9.8 It is acknowledged that there are limitations to the assessment of combined 
cumulative effects in this ES, such as: 
 
Limited information that is available; 
 
PBA did not prepare the LVIAs for the cumulative developments. A 
different assessor may have a different professional judgement of 
landscape and visual effects, and use different assessment methodologies 
in LVIAs; 
 
Different baseline dates between the cumulative developments’ original 
LVIA assessments (not prepared by PBA) and the Project’s LVIA 
(prepared by PBA), resulting in a different assessment basis. For example, 
the Covanta LVIA baseline was 2010. Since then the Marston Vale wind 
turbine has been constructed and there will have been growth or removal 
of vegetation. The Covanta 2010 LVIA will have assessed effects upon 
people’s views which did not include the wind turbine in the view 
composition, as it did not exist at that time. Whilst the Project LVIA in 2017, 
assesses visual effects from the same location, which now has the wind 
turbine present within the view. This change of view composition between 
the baselines means that there will inevitably be a degree of difference 
between assessment of changes to the view; and 
 
Assessments of different receptors, that are not comparable. For example, 
in the Covanta LVIA, no effects were assessed on landscape features, only 
landscape character – an approach which differs from the Project LVIA. 
Another example of this limitation, is when there is no Covanta LVIA 
equivalent viewpoint location for the assessment of visual effects. Where 
there is no equivalent receptor, it is noted as such in the combined 
cumulative assessment tables and our judgement of effects is informed by 
the information which is available, our understanding of the Project site and 
its context and, for visual effects, the Project’s cumulative development 
photomontages where they are available.

11.9.9 
Section 4.10 of this ES sets out the criteria and list of projects used for the 
cumulative assessment.  
11.9.10 In regard to the Covanta RRF Project, it is considered that a pragmatic and 
proportionate approach to assessing combined cumulative effects would be to 
take the Covanta RRF Project LVIA findings, which were prepared by LDA 
Design, as a starting point for the combined cumulative assessment; on the 
basis that they have been agreed with key consultees and tested through the 
DCO process. 
11.9.11 There is little detail known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for the Rookery South Pit. At the time of writing this ES, a request 
for a scoping opinion has been submitted by the promoter, although no details 
are provided regarding potential landscape or visual impacts. Should it go 
ahead, then the Integrated Waste Management Facilities scheme will need to 
consider cumulative landscape and visual effects, and therefore the 
development has been scoped out of this assessment, due to insufficient 
information at this stage. 
11.9.12 Land at Warren Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill has also been scoped out 
as the intervening Greensand Ridge, which rises up to 110m AOD will prevent 
any intervisibility and there are unlikely to be any viewpoints in which the 
Project and the Warren Farm schemes will both be visible. 
Incremental Cumulative Visual Effects 
11.9.13 The following is an assessment of the worst-case scenario of cumulative visual 
effects on people’s views during construction and on completion from each of 
the representative assessment viewpoints. The baseline description for each 
is set out in Table 11.11. 
11.9.14 The assessment is informed by the cumulative photomontages in Document 
Reference 7.1, which should be referred to, to aid understanding of this 
assessment. 
Viewpoint 1 
11.9.15 Viewpoint 1 is approximately 1.5km north-east of the Project.  
11.9.16 Owing to intervening vegetation and landform, the only part of the Project that 
would be visible is part of the proposed transmission tower, roughly in the same 
position as the existing tower.  Most of the stack of the Covanta scheme will 
be visible. None of the other cumulative developments would be visible. 
11.9.17 The addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative visual 
effect that has a negligible magnitude of change during the construction period 
and on completion.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
365 
11.9.18 Incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint location 
during the construction period and on completion of the Project, will be not 
significant. 
Viewpoint 2 
11.9.19 The stack is the only part of the Generating Equipment visible; and owing to 
separation distance from, and the relative scale compared to the Covanta 
stack, the addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative 
visual effect that has a negligible magnitude of change during the construction 
period and on completion. 
11.9.20 Other committed developments are not anticipated to be seen in combination 
with the Project from this viewpoint location, as a result of intervening 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.21 Incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint location 
during the construction period and on completion of the Project, will be not 
significant.  
Viewpoint 3 
11.9.22 The Project appears in front of, and is viewed as part of but below, Covanta in 
this view. Covanta dominates the Project and Covanta’s stack breaks the 
skyline. As a result, the addition of the Project would result in incremental 
cumulative visual effect that has a negligible magnitude of change during the 
construction period and on completion. 
11.9.23 Other committed developments are not anticipated to be seen in combination 
with the Project from this viewpoint location, as a result of distance, intervening 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.24 Incremental cumulative visual effect s upon views from this viewpoint location 
during the construction period and on completion of the Project, will be not 
significant.   
Viewpoint 4 
11.9.25 Views of the Project will be filtered by intervening vegetation and it will sit below 
the skyline. Covanta’s stack will break the skyline and Covanta will be a large 
scale built form which is the focus of the view drawing the eye. The addition of 
the Project would result in an incremental cumulative visual effect that has a 
negligible magnitude of change during the construction period and on 
completion. 
11.9.26 The committed development on land at Moreteyne Farm would be barely 
discernible in the distance in the view and seen in association with existing 
development at Marston Moretaine. As a result, it is anticipated that there 
would be very little combined visibility with the Project. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
366 
11.9.27 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location will be not significant during the construction period or on 
completion of the Project.   
Viewpoint 5 
11.9.28 The Covanta scheme will be seen on the valley floor, with its stack breaking 
the skyline; and will be large scale built form which is the focus of the view.  
The Project will be seen in the context of the much larger Covanta scheme and 
the addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative visual 
effect that has a slight magnitude of change during the construction period and 
on completion.   
11.9.29 The committed developments on land at Moreteyne Farm and Broadmead 
Road will be barely discernible in the far distance of the view. 
11.9.30 Incremental cumulative visual effects on views from this viewpoint location 
during the construction period and on completion of the Project will therefore 
be not significant.   
Viewpoint 6 
11.9.31 The Covanta scheme includes a very large mass of structure within the pit, 
seen against the rising landscape in the background and its stack breaks the 
skyline. Covanta is seen as a large scale built form, which draws the eye and 
is the focus of the view. The Project will be seen as additional built form 
adjacent to, and left of, Covanta; but it will be below the skyline and of a much 
smaller scale and mass. Although the Stack of the Generating Equipment is 
an additional vertical feature in the landscape, it does not break the skyline 
and sits below the height of the main mass of the Covanta structure.  As a 
result, the addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative 
visual effect which has a negligible magnitude of change during the 
construction period and on completion.  
11.9.32 The developments at Moreteyne Farm and Stewartby are anticipated to not be 
perceptible in this view. 
11.9.33 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location will not be significant during the construction period or on 
completion of the Project.   
Viewpoint 6a 
11.9.34 Covanta appears as a very large mass of structure, seen through winter trees, 
and its tall vertical stack extends into the skyline. In this view, the upper-most 
part of the stack of the Generating Equipment will be barely perceptible, with 
the rest of the Stack and the Project being filtered by vegetation.  As a result, 
the addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative visual 
effect which has a negligible magnitude of change during the construction 
period and on completion. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
367 
11.9.35 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.36 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location will be not significant during construction or on completion 
of the Project.   
Viewpoint 6b 
11.9.37 Covanta appears as a large and bulky structure which, together with its tall 
vertical stack, rises above vegetation and breaks the skyline. The upper-most 
part of cranes during construction and the stack of the Generating Equipment 
on completion, will be barely discernible, filtered by vegetation. As a result, the 
addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative visual effect 
which has a negligible magnitude of change during the construction period and 
on completion.  
11.9.38 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.39 Incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint location 
during construction and on completion of the Project will be not significant.   
Viewpoint 7 
11.9.40 Partial views of the upper-most parts of cranes during construction and the 
stack of the Generating Equipment on completion are anticipated to be just 
visible above the intervening woodland; whilst Covanta will appear as an a 
large and bulky structure which, together with its tall vertical stack, will break 
the skyline. The addition of the Project would result in an incremental 
cumulative visual effect which has a negligible magnitude of change during the 
construction period and on completion.  
11.9.41 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform.  
11.9.42 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location will be not significant during the construction period and on 
completion of the Project.   
Viewpoint 8 
11.9.43 Covanta will appear as a large structure and mass, seen above vegetation. Its 
stack is a vertical feature punctuating the skyline, to a similar height as pylons 
in the view. 
11.9.44 Construction activities associated with the upper elements of the transmission 
tower will be seen above the rooflines of intervening dwellings.  On completion, 
the transmission tower will be seen on the skyline, but lower than the Covanta 
stack and other pylons. The addition of the transmission tower & SECs 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
368 
therefore will have an incremental cumulative visual effect during the 
construction period and on completion which has a negligible magnitude of 
change.   
11.9.45 The Generating Plant will not be visible from this viewpoint; therefore, will not 
contribute to an incremental cumulative visual effect on completion. 
11.9.46 Other cumulative developments will not be visible as a result of intervening 
vegetation and landform.  
11.9.47 Incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint location, 
during construction and on completion of the Project, will be not significant.   
Viewpoint 9 
11.9.48 Covanta will appear as a large structure, partially filtered by vegetation. Its 
stack forms a vertical feature on the skyline.  
11.9.49 Some construction activities arising from both the Generating Plant and the 
transmission tower are anticipated to be visible above woodland. On 
completion, the transmission tower will be seen on the skyline, but lower than 
the Covanta stack and the Marston Vale wind turbine. As a result, the addition 
of the Project and transmission tower would result in an incremental cumulative 
visual effect during the construction period which has a magnitude of change 
that is negligible.   
11.9.50 Other cumulative developments are not likely to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.51 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location during construction and on completion will be not significant.   
Viewpoint 10 
11.9.52 The upper parts of the stack of the Generating Equipment will be barely 
perceptible on the floor of the valley, some 5.5km away and seen against the 
wide sweep of the landscape of the valley. Covanta is seen as a large scale 
built form in the valley and its stack breaks the skyline in the distant view. The 
transmission tower is barely perceptible in the landscape and sits below the 
skyline. The addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative 
visual effect which has a negligible magnitude of change during construction 
and on completion.   
11.9.53 Other cumulative developments are not likely to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.54 The incremental cumulative visual effects will be not significant during 
construction and on completion of the Project.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
369 
Viewpoint 11 
11.9.55 Some construction activities arising from both the Generating Plant and the 
transmission tower are anticipated to be visible 3km away and above 
intervening vegetation. Covanta is clearly seen as a large scale built form and 
its stack breaks the skyline.  The addition of the Project would result in an 
incremental cumulative visual effect which has a negligible magnitude of 
change during the construction period and on completion. 
11.9.56 Other cumulative developments are not likely to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.57 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects will be not significant during 
construction and on completion of the Project.   
Viewpoint 12 
11.9.58 An access road will have been constructed for the Covanta scheme and which 
will be used for the construction and operation of the Project. The stack of the 
Generating Equipment will visible to the left of Covanta but will sit below the 
skyline of the Greensand Ridge. Although an additional vertical element in the 
view, the stack appears as a smaller element in comparison to the Covanta 
form, mass and stack height. Covanta will be a large scale structure and mass 
which is the focus of and in the centre of the view, with the stack seen partly 
against the Greensand Ridge and extending into the skyline. The addition of 
the Project would result in an incremental cumulative visual effect which has a 
negligible magnitude of change during the construction period and on 
completion.   
11.9.59 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform.  
11.9.60 Therefore, incremental cumulative visual effects will be not significant during 
construction and on completion of the Project.   
Viewpoint 13 
11.9.61 Covanta is not perceptible in this view as a result of the intervening landform.  
11.9.62 Other cumulative developments are not anticipated to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.63 Therefore, there are no incremental cumulative visual effects upon views from 
this viewpoint location. The effects of the Project upon views from this location 
are those as previously reported in the LVIA. 
Viewpoint 14 
11.9.64 Covanta is seen as a large mass and scale of built form in the landscape, in 
the centre of the view; breaking the skyline and forming the focus of the view. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
370 
11.9.65 The Project, the transmission tower and SECs are in the foreground of the 
view, seen in front of Covanta. Construction activities will be clearly seen taking 
place in the middle ground. 
11.9.66  On completion, the Project structures, transmission tower and SECs will be 
seen in context with Covanta. The Generating Equipment and stack are of a 
smaller scale than Covanta; the stack however does not extend into the 
skyline. The addition of the Project, transmission tower and SECs creates 
additional visual complexity in the view, due to contrasts in the scale, mass 
and variety of structures; amplifies visual effects; and results cumulatively in a 
large proportion of the middle ground being occupied by development.  
11.9.67 The incremental cumulative visual effects would therefore result in moderate 
magnitudes of change during construction and also on completion.  
11.9.68 The visual receptor at this viewpoint location is judged to have an overall 
sensitivity of Medium. Therefore, the incremental cumulative visual effects 
during the construction period and on completion will be significant.  
11.9.69 Other cumulative developments are not anticipated to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
Viewpoint 15 
11.9.70 Covanta dominates the view, its scale, mass and bulky form clearly visible 
through winter trees. Covanta’s stack extends into the skyline. 
11.9.71 The Project is clearly visible in the middle ground, to the right of Covanta. Much 
of the Project sits against the backdrop of rising land; however, the stack of the 
Generating Equipment breaks the skyline but is seen as a lower height than 
the pylons on the skyline. The Project forms additional development in the 
view, but appears dwarfed by Covanta which draws the eye and forms the 
main focus of the view. 
11.9.72 The incremental cumulative visual effects would result in slight magnitudes of 
change during construction and also on completion. 
11.9.73 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform.  
11.9.74 Therefore, the incremental cumulative visual effects during the construction 
period and on completion will be not significant.  
Viewpoint 16 
11.9.75 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to the direction of view 
and intervening vegetation and landform. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
371 
11.9.76 Therefore, there are no cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location. The effects of the Project upon views from this location are 
those as previously reported in the LVIA.  
Incremental Cumulative Landscape Effects 
11.9.77 The following is an assessment of the worst-case scenario of incremental 
cumulative landscape visual effects during construction and on completion for 
each Landscape Character Area (LCA) and Landscape Feature.  
National LCA 88: Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands; and LCA 90: 
Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge. 
11.9.78 Due to the changes being in a limited area contained within a much larger 
character area, the magnitude of change of incremental cumulative landscape 
effects is anticipated to be negligible.  No significant incremental cumulative 
landscape effects are anticipated for this NCA. 
County LCA 5D: North Marston Clay Vale  
11.9.79 Due to the changes being in a limited area contained within a much larger 
character area, the magnitude of change of incremental cumulative landscape 
effects is anticipated to be negligible.  No significant incremental cumulative 
landscape effects are anticipated for these LCAs. 
11.9.80 District LCA Forest of Marston Vale Landscape Zones: Greensand Ridge and 
East Vale; Brickfields.   
11.9.81 Due to the changes being in a limited area contained within much larger 
character areas, the magnitude of change of incremental cumulative 
landscape effects is anticipated to be negligible.  No significant incremental 
cumulative landscape effects are anticipated for these LCAs. 
Local Landscape Character of Site and Surrounding Area   
11.9.82 Owing to its size and form, the Covanta scheme fundamentally changes the 
character of the local landscape of the area surrounding the Project Site. The 
addition of the Project would result in an incremental cumulative effect on local 
landscape character which has a slight magnitude of change, and the 
incremental cumulative landscape effect would be not significant.    
11.9.83 The other cumulative developments are remote from the site and can therefore 
have no direct effect.  
Landform  
11.9.84 The addition of the Project to Covanta would result in incremental cumulative 
effects on landform which are of a negligible magnitude of change. The 
incremental cumulative landscape effect therefore would be not significant.      
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
372 
Woodland, Trees and Hedgerows 
11.9.85 The effects on woodland, trees and hedgerows resulting from the Project 
largely arise from the construction of the access road, and the gas and 
electrical connections. With the Covanta scheme in place, a large access road 
will already have been constructed to serve it; which would be utilised by the 
Project. The addition of the Project will, however, require some further 
clearance of vegetation in relation to the access road, as well as for the Gas 
and Electrical Connections. Incremental cumulative landscape effects on 
woodland, trees and hedgerows will result in effects that are of a moderate 
magnitude of change, which would be adverse during construction and on 
completion; changing to beneficial effects 15yrs after planting. These effects 
would be significant.  
Public Rights of Way 
11.9.86 The Covanta scheme does not result in effects on public rights of way within 
the Project Site. Therefore there are no incremental cumulative landscape 
effects on public rights of way. The effects of the Project upon public rights of 
way are those as previously reported in the LVIA 
Watercourses 
11.9.87 The Covanta scheme does not result in effects on watercourses within the 
Project Site. Therefore there is no incremental cumulative landscape effect on 
watercourses.  The effects of the Project upon watercourses are those as 
previously reported in the LVIA.  
Combined Cumulative Visual Effects  
11.9.88 The assessment of combined cumulative visual effects is set out in detail, 
including the assessment of levels of significance, in Table 11.1C of Appendix 
11.1 to this ES. Combined Cumulative Visual Effects Table (note that the 
baseline descriptions of views and assessment of sensitivity are as those set 
out in Table 11.1A of Appendix 11.1 to this ES). The assessment is made of 
the Project in combination with the cumulative developments, assessed 
against the 2017 baseline year (i.e. all developments, combined, assessed 
against baseline) and has been informed by the Project cumulative 
photomontages. 
11.9.89 Figure 11.5: Cumulative ZTV Plan has been prepared to demonstrate the 
combined ZTV of both the Project and the Covanta scheme, formed by the 
(worst case) zone of theoretical visibility of the Project (orange hatch) overlaid 
onto a (worst case) zone of theoretical visibility of the RFF Covanta Project 
(pink solid shading). Both ZTVs have been prepared using the same software 
and parameters, to enable as clear a comparison as possible. Figure 11.5 
illustrates that the Project ZTV sits within the much larger ZTV of Covanta. In 
reality, the extent of the ZTV of each scheme is likely to be less than indicated 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
373 
on the plan, as a result of additional visual barriers on the ground such as 
buildings or trees and hedgerows. 
11.9.90 The assessment of the worst-case scenario of combined cumulative visual 
effects is made in accordance with the methodology used for the Project LVIA, 
previously described, and therefore is consistent with the Project’s LVIA in the 
assessment and definitions of sensitivity, magnitude of impact and level of 
significance. A summary of the combined cumulative visual effects is set out 
below, which should be read together with the Project cumulative 
photomontages in Document Reference 7.1. 
Viewpoint 1 
11.9.91 Owing to intervening vegetation and landform, the only part of the Project that 
would be visible is part of the proposed transmission tower, roughly in the same 
position as the existing tower.  Most of the stack of the Covanta scheme will 
be visible. None of the other cumulative developments would be visible. 
11.9.92 The combination of the Project and Covanta would result in combined 
cumulative visual effects of a slight to moderate magnitude of change during 
the construction period, and of a moderate magnitude of change on completion 
and at 15yrs after planting. The combined cumulative visual effects upon views 
from this viewpoint location are adverse, additive and significant for all 
assessment periods. 
Viewpoint 2 
11.9.93 The stack is the only part of the Generating Equipment visible; and owing to 
separation distance from, and the relative scale compared to the Covanta 
stack, the Project and cumulative developments would result in combined 
cumulative visual effects that have a moderate magnitude of change which is 
adverse, during the construction period. On completion and at 15yrs after 
planting, there would be a combined cumulative visual effect that has a slight 
to moderate magnitude of change which is adverse. 
11.9.94 These combined cumulative visual effects arise from the combination of the 
Project and Covanta, as other committed developments are not anticipated to 
be seen from this viewpoint location, due to intervening vegetation and 
landform. 
11.9.95 Combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint location at 
all assessment periods, are additive effects and will be significant. 
Viewpoint 3 
11.9.96 The Project appears in front of, and is viewed as part of, but below, Covanta 
in this view. Covanta dominates the Project and Covanta’s stack breaks the 
skyline. Other committed developments are not anticipated to be seen in 
combination with the Project from this viewpoint location, due to distance, 
intervening vegetation and landform. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
374 
11.9.97 As a result, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that have a moderate magnitude of change 
that is adverse, during all assessment periods. 
11.9.98 The combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location at all assessment periods, are additive effects and will be significant. 
Viewpoint 4 
11.9.99 Views of the Project will be filtered by intervening vegetation and it will sit below 
the skyline. Covanta’s stack will break the skyline and Covanta will be a large 
scale built form which is the focus of the view drawing the eye. The committed 
development on land at Moreteyne Farm would be barely discernible in the 
distance in the view and seen in association with existing development at 
Marston Moretaine. As a result, it is anticipated that there would be very little 
combined visibility of that cumulative development scheme with the Project. 
11.9.100 The combination of the Project and cumulative developments would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that are of a moderate magnitude of 
change at all periods of assessment. 
11.9.101 The combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location at all assessment periods, are additive effects and will be significant.   
Viewpoint 5 
11.9.102 The Covanta scheme will be seen on the valley floor, with its stack breaking 
the skyline; and will be large scale built form which is the focus of the view.  
The Project will be seen in the context of the much larger Covanta scheme. 
The committed developments on land at Moreteyne Farm and Broadmead 
Road will be barely discernible in the far distance of the view. 
11.9.103 The combination of the Project and cumulative developments would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that are of a moderate magnitude of 
change during all assessment periods.   
11.9.104 The combined cumulative visual effects on views from this viewpoint location 
at all assessment periods will be additive and significant.   
Viewpoint 6 
11.9.105 The Covanta scheme includes a very large mass of structure within the pit, 
seen against the rising landscape in the background and its stack breaks the 
skyline. Covanta is seen as a large scale built form, which draws the eye and 
is the focus of the view. The Project will be seen as built form adjacent to, and 
left of, Covanta; but it will be below the skyline and of a much smaller scale 
and mass. Although the Stack of the Generating Equipment is a vertical feature 
in the landscape, it does not break the skyline and sits below the height of the 
main mass of the Covanta structure.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
375 
11.9.106 The developments at Moreteyne Farm and Stewartby are anticipated to not be 
perceptible in this view. 
11.9.107 Therefore, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that are adverse, additive and of a 
moderate magnitude of change during construction and on completion; and a 
slight to moderate magnitude of change at 15yrs after planting. 
11.9.108 The combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location will be therefore be significant for all assessment periods.   
Viewpoint 6a 
11.9.109 Covanta appears as a very large mass of structure, seen through winter trees, 
and its tall vertical stack extends into the skyline. In this view, the upper-most 
part of the stack of the Generating Equipment will be barely perceptible, with 
the rest of the Project’s stack and extent being well filtered by vegetation.  
Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.110 Therefore, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects which are adverse and additive, of a slight 
to moderate magnitude of change during the construction period and a 
moderate magnitude of change on completion and at 15yrs after planting. 
11.9.111 The combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location will therefore be significant for all assessment periods.   
Viewpoint 6b 
11.9.112 Covanta appears as a large and bulky structure which, together with its tall 
vertical stack, rises above vegetation and breaks the skyline. The upper-most 
part of cranes during construction and the stack of the Generating Equipment 
on completion, will be barely discernible, filtered by vegetation.  
11.9.113 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.114 Therefore, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that have a major magnitude of change 
that is adverse during construction and on completion; and a moderate 
magnitude of change that is adverse at 15yrs after planting. 
11.9.115 The combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location will be additive and significant for all assessment periods.     
Viewpoint 7 
11.9.116 Partial views of the upper-most parts of cranes during construction and the 
stack of the Generating Equipment on completion are anticipated to be just

visible above the intervening woodland; whilst Covanta will appear as an a 
large and bulky structure which, together with its tall vertical stack, will break 
the skyline. Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to 
intervening vegetation and landform.  
11.9.117 The combination of the Project and Covanta would result in combined 
cumulative visual effects which are of a moderate magnitude of change that 
are adverse and additive, during the construction period and on completion. At 
15yrs after planting, the magnitude of change would reduce to slight to 
moderate, and remain as adverse and additive. 
11.9.118 Therefore, combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location will be significant at all assessment periods.   
Viewpoint 8 
11.9.119 Covanta will appear as a large structure and mass, seen above vegetation. Its 
stack is a vertical feature punctuating the skyline, to a similar height as pylons 
in the view. Other cumulative developments will not be visible as a result of 
intervening vegetation and landform.  
11.9.120 Construction activities associated with the upper elements of the Project’s 
transmission tower will be seen above the rooflines of intervening dwellings.  
On completion, the transmission tower will be seen on the skyline, but it will be 
lower than the Covanta stack and other pylons.  
11.9.121  The combination of the Project’s transmission tower & SECs with Covanta 
therefore will have a combined cumulative visual effect which is adverse and 
additive. During the construction period and on completion the combined 
cumulative visual effects will be of a moderate magnitude of change; and at 
15yrs after planting the magnitude of change will reduce to slight to moderate.   
11.9.122 The Project’s Generating Plant will not be visible from this viewpoint; therefore, 
it will not contribute to the combined cumulative visual effects. 
11.9.123 The combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location, at all assessment periods, will be significant.   
Viewpoint 9 
11.9.124 Covanta will appear as a large structure, partially filtered by vegetation. Its 
stack forms a vertical feature on the skyline. Other cumulative developments 
are not likely to be perceptible owing to distance, intervening development, 
vegetation and landform. 
11.9.125 Some construction activities arising from both the Project’s Generating Plant 
and the transmission tower are anticipated to be visible above woodland. On 
completion, the transmission tower will be seen on the skyline, but it will be 
lower than the Covanta stack and the Marston Vale wind turbine.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
377 
11.9.126 Therefore, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that are adverse, additive and of a slight 
magnitude of change during all assessment periods.   
11.9.127 These combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location, during all assessment periods, will be significant, due to the overall 
high sensitivity of the visual receptor.   
Viewpoint 10 
11.9.128 The upper parts of the stack of the Project’s Generating Equipment will be 
barely perceptible on the floor of the valley, some 5.5km away and seen 
against the wide sweep of the landscape of the valley. The transmission tower 
is barely perceptible in the landscape and sits below the skyline.  
11.9.129 Covanta is seen as a large scale built form in the valley and its stack breaks 
the skyline in the distant view. Other cumulative developments are not likely to 
be perceptible owing to distance, intervening development, vegetation and 
landform.  
11.9.130 Therefore, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects which are adverse, additive and of a slight 
magnitude of change for all assessment periods.   
11.9.131 These combined cumulative visual effects upon views from this viewpoint 
location, during all assessment periods, will be significant, due to the high 
sensitivity of the visual receptor.   
Viewpoint 11 
11.9.132 Some construction activities arising from the Project’s Generating Plant and 
the transmission tower are anticipated to be visible 3km away and above 
intervening vegetation.  
11.9.133 Covanta is clearly seen as a large scale built form and its stack breaks the 
skyline.  Other cumulative developments are not likely to be perceptible owing 
to distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.134 Therefore, the combination of the Project and Covanta would result in 
combined cumulative visual effects that are adverse, additive. These would 
have a slight to moderate magnitude of change during construction and at 
15yrs after planting, and a moderate magnitude of change on completion. 
11.9.135 As a result, the combined cumulative visual effects will be significant during all 
assessment periods.  
Viewpoint 12 
11.9.136 An access road will have been constructed for the Covanta scheme, which will 
be used for the construction and operation of the Project. The stack of the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
378 
Generating Equipment will visible to the left of Covanta but will sit below the 
skyline of the Greensand Ridge. Although a vertical element in the view, the 
Project’s stack appears as a smaller element in comparison to the Covanta 
form, mass and stack height. Covanta will be a large scale structure and mass 
which is the focus of, and in the centre of, the view; with the Covanta stack 
seen partly against the Greensand Ridge and extending into the skyline.  
11.9.137 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening 
vegetation and landform.  
11.9.138 The combination of the Project and Covanta would result in combined 
cumulative visual effects which are adverse, additive and are of a major 
magnitude of change during the construction period, and moderate 
magnitudes of change on completion and at 15yrs after planting.   
11.9.139 The combined cumulative visual effects will be significant during all periods of 
assessment.   
Viewpoint 13 
11.9.140 Covanta is not perceptible in this view as a result of the intervening landform.  
Other cumulative developments are not anticipated to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.141 Therefore, there are no combined cumulative visual effects upon views from 
this viewpoint location. The effects of the Project upon views from this location 
are those as previously reported in the LVIA. 
Viewpoint 14 
11.9.142 Covanta is seen as a large mass and scale of built form in the landscape, in 
the centre of the view; breaking the skyline and forming the focus of the view. 
Other cumulative developments are not anticipated to be perceptible owing to 
distance, intervening development, vegetation and landform.  
11.9.143 The Project and the transmission tower and SECs is in the foreground of the 
view, seen in front of Covanta. Construction activities will be clearly seen taking 
place in the middle ground. 
11.9.144  On completion, the Project structures, transmission tower and SECs will be 
seen in context with Covanta. The Generating Equipment and stack are of a 
smaller scale than Covanta; the stack however does not extend into the 
skyline. The Project, transmission tower and SECs create visual complexity in 
the view, due to contrasts in the scale, mass and variety of structures with 
Covanta; amplifying visual effects; and resulting cumulatively in a large 
proportion of the middle ground being occupied by development.  
11.9.145 The combined cumulative visual effects would therefore be adverse and 
additive, and result in major magnitudes of change during construction and on 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
379 
completion, and a moderate to major magnitude of change at 15yrs after 
planting.  
11.9.146 The combination of the Project and Covanta will result in combined cumulative 
visual effects that are considered significant for all assessment periods.  
Viewpoint 15 
11.9.147 Covanta dominates the view; its scale, mass and bulky form clearly visible 
through winter trees. Covanta’s stack extends into the skyline. Other 
cumulative developments will not be visible owing to intervening vegetation 
and landform.  
11.9.148 The Project is clearly visible in the middle ground, to the right of Covanta. Much 
of the Project sits against the backdrop of rising land; and although, the stack 
of the Generating Equipment breaks the skyline, it is seen to be a lower height 
than the pylons on the skyline. In the view, the Project appears dwarfed by 
Covanta. It is Covanta which draws the eye and forms the main focus of the 
view. 
11.9.149 The combined cumulative visual effects would be adverse, additive and result 
in major magnitudes of change during construction and on completion, and a 
moderate to major magnitude of change at 15yrs after planting. 
11.9.150 The combined cumulative visual effects at all assessment periods are 
therefore significant.  
Viewpoint 16 
11.9.151 Other cumulative developments will not be visible owing to the direction of view 
and intervening vegetation and landform. 
11.9.152 Therefore, there are no cumulative visual effects upon views from this 
viewpoint location. The effects of the Project upon views from this location are 
those as previously reported in the LVIA.   
Combined Cumulative Landscape Effects 
11.9.153 The assessment of the worst-case scenario of combined cumulative landscape 
effects is made in accordance with the methodology used for the Project LVIA, 
previously described, and therefore is consistent with the Project’s LVIA in the 
assessment and definitions of sensitivity, magnitude of impact and level of 
significance. The detailed combined cumulative landscape assessment is set 
out in Table 11.1D of Appendix 11.1 of this ES. Baseline descriptions of 
landscape receptors are at Table 11.11. 
11.9.154 The following is a summary of the assessment of combined cumulative 
landscape effects, for each Landscape Character Area (LCA) and Landscape 
Feature, which arise as a result of the Project in combination with the 
cumulative developments.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
380 
National LCA 88: Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands; and LCA 90: 
Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge. 
11.9.155 The changes will occur in a limited area contained within these much larger 
character areas. The combined cumulative landscape effects are anticipated 
to be adverse and additive, but of a magnitude of change that is negligible.  
There are therefore no significant combined cumulative landscape effects 
anticipated for this NCA. 
County LCA 5D: North Marston Clay Vale  
11.9.156 The changes would be in a limited area contained within a much larger 
character area. The combined cumulative landscape effects would be adverse 
and additive, and of a moderate magnitude of change during construction and 
on completion, reducing to slight 15yrs after planting.  The overall sensitivity of 
the LCA is assessed as low; therefore, combined cumulative landscape effects 
upon this LCA will be not significant. 
District LCA Forest of Marston Vale Landscape Zones: Greensand Ridge and 
East Vale; Brickfields.   
11.9.157 The changes would occur in a limited area contained within this larger 
character area. The combined cumulative landscape effects would be adverse 
and additive, having a magnitude of change that is slight.  Therefore, these 
effects will be not significant.  
Local Landscape Character of Project Site and Surrounding Area   
11.9.158 Owing to its size and form, the Covanta scheme fundamentally changes the 
character of the local landscape character of the Project Site’s surrounding 
area. The combination of the Project and Covanta will directly affect the local 
landscape character of the Project Site and immediate surrounding area. Other 
cumulative developments are remote from the Project Site and will have no 
direct effect. 
11.9.159 The combined cumulative landscape effects on the local landscape character 
of the Project Site and surrounding area will be adverse and additive. These 
will be of a major magnitude of change during construction and on completion, 
and have a moderate magnitude of change at 15yrs after planting. These 
effects would not be significant, however, as a result of the receptor’s low 
overall sensitivity.     
Landform  
11.9.160 The combination of the Project with Covanta would result in combined 
cumulative landscape effects on landform that are adverse, additive and of a 
negligible magnitude of change for all assessment periods. The combined 
cumulative landscape effect on landform will therefore be not significant.      
Woodland, Trees and Hedgerows 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
381 
11.9.161 Adverse effects on woodland, trees and hedgerows resulting from the Project 
in combination with Covanta, largely relate to losses as a result of the 
construction of a new access road, which would also be utilised by the Project 
and Covanta. There will also be losses associated with electrical and gas 
connections for the Project. Therefore, there will be adverse, additive 
combined cumulative landscape effects upon woodland, trees and hedgerows 
which are of a moderate magnitude of change during construction and on 
completion, which are significant.  
11.9.162 Mitigation and new planting is proposed which, at 15 years after planting, will 
result in beneficial and additive combined cumulative landscape effects that 
have a moderate magnitude of change, and are therefore significant. 
Public Rights of Way 
11.9.163 The Covanta scheme and other cumulative developments do not have direct 
effects on public rights of way within the Project Site area; therefore, there are 
no direct combined cumulative landscape effects on public rights of way. The 
effects of the Project upon public rights of way are those as previously reported 
in the LVIA. 
Watercourses 
11.9.164 The Covanta scheme and other cumulative developments do not have direct 
effects on watercourses within the Project Site area; therefore, there are no 
direct combined cumulative landscape effects on watercourses. The effects of 
the Project upon watercourses are those as previously reported in the LVIA 
11.10 
Effect Interactions 
11.10.1 In terms of LVIA, the component of the Project most likely to have significant 
effects is the stack of the Generating Equipment. The height of the stack has 
been set by air quality stack height sensitivity analysis, as described in Chapter 
6. The air quality modelling has determined the most appropriate stack height 
based on the need to meet air quality legislative limits. The air quality modelling 
has ensured that that stack height will meet legislative limits, but the stack 
height has not been increased any more, in order to strike an appropriate 
balance with potential effects on landscape and visual receptors.  
11.10.2 It is recognised that there is also a cross-over between LVIA and effects on 
cultural heritage assets, and Chapter 13 deals with potential effects on cultural 
heritage assets and any potential interactions. Photomontages have been 
produced which cover views from cultural heritage assets as well as sensitive 
landscape and visual receptors.  
11.10.3 The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy (Appendix 
11.3) has considered mitigation and management measures which are 
complementary to both landscape screening and enhancement and ecological 
management.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
382 
11.11 
Mitigation and Assessment of Residual Effects 
11.11.1 Additional mitigation is that which is additional to the embedded design 
mitigation measures described in section 3.6 of Chapter 3. Additional 
mitigation is described in the Landscape and Visual Effects Tables (Appendix 
11.1) and below.  
11.11.2 Specific embedded mitigation for the Power Generation Plant includes the 
following: 
 
The location of the generating plant within the Rookery South Pit which 
reduces the potential height of the development by the depth of the pit, 
which is 15m. As a result, the potential adverse visual effects will be 
reduced such that the magnitude of change leads to there being very few 
significant visual effects; 
 
The design of the development such as the selection of materials and 
colours to minimise reflective finishes and maximise recessive colours, 
reducing visibility against the background of the landscape;  
 
The Project Site being amongst existing woodland and hedges, including 
more recent planting undertaken for clay extraction and restoration, such 
as on the ridge between the Rookery North and Rookery South Pits, as 
well as woodland along Marston Road to the west; 
 
Taking advantage of the planting undertaken for the LLRS to provide 
further integration into the landscape especially from the north; and 
 
The adoption of a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) 
(Appendix 3.2)  that controls the construction process to minimise impacts 
on the environment, and which to protect landscape and visual aspects 
would, for instance, include procedures to protect existing trees and 
manage soil as a valuable resource and as a result ensure that existing 
features aid in mitigating the potential effects. 
11.11.3 Specific additional mitigation includes the following:  
 
Woodland and hedge planting along the southern boundary to reinforce 
existing vegetation pattern and provide screening and filtering of views; 
 
Hedge planting to the Green Lane frontage on new lines to replace planting 
lost to the Access Road; 
 
New planting along the access track to replace that lost to highway 
improvements to the track; and 
 
Landscape and Ecological Management Plan to ensure the long term 
management of the landscape and ecological strategy (Appendix 11.3). 
11.11.4 The Landscape Strategy associated with the Covanta RRF has been taken 
into account when designing the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and 
Management Strategy (LEMMS) in Appendix 11.3 of the ES.  All areas of 
planting and habitat creation proposed associated with the Covanta Scheme 
has been taken into account in the context of the Strategy and will not be 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
383 
disturbed by the Project. This will ensure that the biodiversity enhancements 
proposed associated with the Covanta Scheme can still be delivered.  
11.11.5 Embedded mitigation for the gas connection is as follows:   
 
Having the gas supply largely underground to reduce its potential effects; 
and 
 
Application of the CEMP. 
11.11.6 Embedded mitigation for the electrical connection is as follows:   
 
Putting much of the connection underground to reduce both visual and 
landscape effects;  
 
Locating the replacement transmission tower close to the original tower to 
ensure that it is the same broad corridor as the existing, which reduces the 
geographical extent of effects; 
 
Placing the SECs within a wooded setting so that it is only clearly visible in 
the immediate vicinity, largely to the south and south-east from the footpath 
network; and 
 
Application of the CEMP. 
11.11.7 Residual landscape and visual effects, including cumulative landscape and 
visual effects, considering the mitigation set out above are outlined in the 
landscape and visual impact assessment tables in Appendix 11.1 and at 
Sections 11.7 and 11.9 above.  
11.11.8 The cumulative landscape and visual effects assessment has not identified a 
requirement, as a result of incremental or combined cumulative effects, for the 
Project to provide further additional mitigation, over and above that which has 
been outlined for the Project in terms of proposed landscape planting which is 
set out in the outline LEMMS (Appendix 11.3). The planting scheme for the 
Project has taken account of the planting scheme for the Covanta RFF Project, 
so that both mitigation planting schemes can co-exist. The purpose of this is 
to provide an appropriate level of mitigation for the Project, whilst not 
detrimentally affecting the delivery of the original level of mitigation intended 
by the Covanta RFF planting scheme. It is therefore considered that the 
mitigation proposed for the Project provides a sufficient proportion of mitigation 
of effects. 
11.12 
Conclusions   
11.12.1 The Landscape and Visual Assessment has shown that for most Landscape 
and Visual Receptors the Project will not result in likely significant effects as a 
standalone project. 
11.12.2 In terms of Visual Effects, out of 18 viewpoints, only 3, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15 and 16 
show significant effects during construction and only viewpoints 14, 15 and 16 
show significant effects on completion and Viewpoint 14 shows significant 
effects 15 years after planting. Viewpoints 14, 15 and 16 show significant 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
384 
effects on decommissioning, but as a result of the short term dismantling 
process and not any long term effects.  
11.12.3 In terms of Landscape Effects, there are significant effects on some of the 
features of the Project Site and its setting, which are Woodland, Trees and 
Hedgerows; and Public Rights of Way. During construction, significant adverse 
effects arise from the Generating Plant and the Electrical Connection on 
Woodland, Trees and Hedgerows; and arise from the Gas and Electrical 
Connections on the Public Rights of Way. On completion, the significant 
adverse effect on Woodland, Trees and Hedgerows remains from the 
Generating Plant. However, owing to the effective establishment and maturing 
of the mitigation planting, significant benefits arise from year 15 onwards.   
11.12.4 The Cumulative Landscape and Visual Effects Assessment has demonstrated 
that the incremental cumulative visual effects of the Project are not significant, 
with the exception of those upon views from Viewpoint 14. For incremental 
cumulative landscape effects, the only significant effect would be upon 
woodland, trees and hedgerows.  
11.12.5 The Cumulative Landscape and Visual Effects Assessment also determined 
that that the combined cumulative visual effects (those which arise from the 
combination of the Project and cumulative developments) are adverse and 
significant. The detailed assessment has found that the combined cumulative 
visual effects are additive effects as a result of the Project and Covanta; that 
is, the total effect of both projects. However, the detailed assessment indicates 
that the greatest proportions of the combined cumulative visual effects are 
generated as a result of Covanta.  
11.12.6 Combined cumulative landscape effects have been identified as not significant, 
with the exception of significant effects upon woodland, trees and hedgerows. 
These would be adverse and additive as a result of the combination of the 
Project and Covanta. At 15yrs after planting, however, the significant and 
additive effect will become beneficial, due to the maturing mitigation planting 
associated with the Project. 
11.12.7 The cumulative landscape and visual effects assessment has not identified a 
requirement, as a result of incremental or combined cumulative effects, for the 
Project to provide further additional mitigation, over and above that which has 
been outlined for the Project in terms of proposed landscape planting which is 
set out in the outline LEMMS (Appendix 11.3).

2.59  
The SoS considers that 
information regarding site 
access routes for construction 
traffic and any vehicles carrying 
abnormal indivisible loads (AIL) 
should be clearly identified and 
assessed within the ES; 
including any alterations 
required to the existing road 
network to accommodate any 
AIL. The ES should also identify 
whether any alterations to the 
existing road network would be 
retained or reinstated, and 
assess the potential effects 
arising.  
Information relating to 
construction access is 
summarised in section 5.2 of the 
TA (Appendix 12.1) and is 
referred to in Section 3.6 
(Embedded Mitigation) and 
within the following documents 
that would be finalised upon the 
appointment of the contractor:  
i) 
the CEMP, contained in TA 
Appendix 5.1;  
ii) the Construction Traffic 
Management Plan (CTMP), 
an outline of which is 
included in TA Appendix 5.2, 
5.3 and 5.4.  
iii) the framework of a route 
management plan included 
in TA section 5.2;  
iv) the construction routes are 
referred to in section 12.6 
and shown on Figure 12.2 
for the three component 
parts of the Project (the 
Power Generation Plant, the 
Gas Connection, and the 
Electrical Connection); 
v) an abnormal load delivery 
strategy;  
vi) construction movements are 
reported in section 12.7; and 
vii) the construction vehicle 
parking strategy defined in 
TA section 5.2. 
 
 
2.60 
The SoS considers that 
information on construction 
including: …number, 
movements and parking of 
construction vehicles (both 
HGVs and staff) should be 
clearly indicated in the ES. 
2.61 
Information on the operation 
and maintenance of the 
proposed development should 
be included in the ES and 
should cover but not be limited 
to such matters as: … the 
number and types of vehicle 
movements generated during 
the operational stage.

The ES should include 
information relating to transport 
for all phases of the proposed 
development such as estimates 
of traffic movements, and 
vehicle types, including relating 
to abnormal loads, and access 
and delivery routes.  
Details of the operation and 
maintenance of the proposed 
development is considered in 
section 12.7. 
The applicant is referred to the 
comments of Luton Borough 
Council … in relation to traffic 
movements during the 
operational phase, and to 
comments made by Network 
Rail with regard to the level 
crossing on Stewartby Green 
Lane. 
These comments are responded 
to below in the following sections 
with references to Paragraphs 8 
to 10 of Luton Borough Councils 
consultation response. 
A traffic management scheme 
developed to respond to 
Network Rail’s concerns is 
summarised in TA section 5.2 
and included in TA Appendix 
5.2, and referred to in the CTMP 
(TA Appendix 5.3 and 5.4). 
Details of the operation and 
maintenance movements from 
the proposed development are 
considered in section 12.7. 
3.81 
The removal of waste from the 
site for all phases of the 
proposed Project should be 
considered and assessed in 
terms of the likely transport 
routes, the number of journeys, 
and the type of vehicles 
required. Consideration must be 
given to an assessment of 
potential cumulative effects with 
other projects in the area - e.g., 
the LLRS which also has 
potential for a high number of 
HGV movements. 
 
 
This information is contained 
within the framework CEMP, 
summarised in TA section 5.2, 
and contained in the CTMP (TA 
Appendix 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4). 
The LLRS will be completed in 
advance of the Project. As such, 
there will be no vehicle 
movements relating to the 
construction of the LLRS, albeit 
there will be occasional 
maintenance movements.  
Information on cumulative 
effects is referred to within 
section 12.8.

It is highly likely that the 
proposed new access roads off 
Green Lane in Stewartby and 
Station Lane in Millbrook will 
have an impact on the 2 Level 
Crossings located on both 
these roads. The report 
submitted to Network Rail for 
this consultation (the 2017 
PEIR) does not discuss or 
mention the potential impact 
on the level crossings of the 
proposal. 
As detailed above, a series of 
discussions and meetings were 
held with Network Rail during 
2014 to scope the Transport 
Assessment, to discuss all 
outstanding issues, and resolve 
all matters. This process is 
detailed in TA section 2.4, 
copies of the notes of meetings 
are contained in TA Appendix 
2.2. 
Details of the operation and 
maintenance movements from 
the Project are considered in 
ES section 12.7. 
A traffic management scheme -  
developed in 2014 to respond to 
Network Rail’s concerns 
regarding the construction 
movements - is summarised in 
TA section 5.2 and included in 
TA Appendix 5.2, and referred 
to in section 3.6. 
Network Rail has agreed that 
there are unlikely to be any 
concerns during normal 
operation, it has been agreed 
that a temporary traffic signal 
controlled arrangement would 
be implemented during the 
construction period. This is 
reported in section 5.2 of the TA

Network Rail has advised it has 
no objection to the proposal.  
S42-018 
In 2015, the Network Rail 
Level Crossings Manager for 
the area, was consulted on 
initial proposals and raised 
concerns that the entrance to 
the development was 
approximately 150 metres from 
Stewartby Green Lane Level 
Crossing. There was concern 
that the construction traffic 
could cause blocking back at 
the level crossing and 
discussions included traffic 
management control to 
mitigate any impacts from the 
construction phase. There was 
also a proposal to re-model a 
section of Green Lane where 
the new access road would 
join it. 
S42-019 
The developer should continue 
to liaise with Network Rail’s 
Level Crossing Manager to 
ensure that the construction 
works on site do not impact 
upon the safe operation and 
integrity of the Stewartby

A good traffic management 
control scheme must be 
included within the 
construction works phase to 
remove any issues of blocking 
back due to the additional 
traffic and construction traffic 
generated by the proposal. 
S42-021 
The developer should also 
consider the potential impacts 
of the proposal not only during 
construction but also once the 
proposal is up and running 
(should it be granted planning 
consent). 
S42-022 
As the proposal progresses the 
impact of construction works 
on site and impacts from the 
proposal once in operation on 
Network Rail’s level crossings 
should be considered within 
the Transport Assessment. 
Any mitigation measures 
required at the level crossings 
would need to be fully funded 
by the developer and agreed 
with Network Rail. 
S42-023 
Network Rail’s Asset 
Protection Engineer has 
already informed the developer 
that they have reviewed the 
new access road within the 
site, which runs adjacent to the 
railway boundary. The 
developer has been advised 
that there must be no 
disturbance to the operational 
railway infrastructure and that 
the developer will need to 
provide: suitable trespass 
The works are at least 70m 
from the operating rail

Network Rail has been advised 
that the developer may want to 
install an Under Track 
Crossing (UTX) – this would 
need to be agreed with 
Network Rail including any 
wayleaves etc. 
No UTX is being proposed with 
the development. 
S42-025 
As the proposal includes works 
which may impact the existing 
operational railway and in 
order to facilitate the above, a 
BAPA (Basic Asset Protection 
Agreement) will need to be 
agreed between the developer 
and Network Rail. The 
developer will be liable for all 
costs incurred by Network Rail 
in facilitating this proposal, 
including any railway site 
safety costs, possession costs, 
asset protection costs / 
presence, site visits, review 
and agreement of proposal 
documents and any buried 
services searches. The BAPA 
will be in addition to any

I have a concern over the

on both sides of Houghton 
Lane and regular access to the 
AGI site off an existing track 
access, whilst I agree in the 
short term some mitigation can 
be provided I have a concern 
over the longer term if those 
access point were to remain 
and become permanent. 
Noted – The access points will 
only be temporary and not used 
as permanent access points, 
therefore the short-term 
mitigation measures are 
considered sufficient.

Drg 31116/2001/006 shows 
the traffic management on 
Green Lane but I would 
question why the access itself 
would not be constructed prior 
to any commencement on site. 
We would of course need to 
see engineering layout for 
approval. 
It is likely that the access would 
be constructed early in the 
construction programme to 
allow access for construction 
vehicles and to prevent 
compaction of earth and 
transfer of detritus from the 
Project Site to the surrounding 
road network.

here sign closest to the railway

followed up with additional consultations in 2017 which confirmed the earlier 
assessment scope was still valid. The findings of the TA are summarised within 
this Chapter. 
12.5.4 
The TA is supplemented by a Travel Plan which sets out a strategy for reducing 
operational traffic movements to the Project Site. The Travel Plan is included 
as Appendix 5.5 to the TA.  
12.5.5 
An outline CEMP and a CTMP have also been prepared and are included as 
Appendices 5.1-5.4 to the TA. These documents have been prepared to 
minimise all aspects construction impact, including a strategy for reducing 
construction traffic movements. 
Environmental Effects

The transport-related environmental effects of the Project have been assessed 
in accordance with the Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of Road 
Traffic published by IEMA in 1993 (the "IEMA Guidance"), and Volume 11 of 
the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) - Environmental 
Assessment.

pedestrian delay (also considering cyclist delay); 
 
pedestrian amenity (also considering cyclist amenity); 
 
fear and intimidation; 
 
accidents and safety; and 
 
hazardous loads. 
12.5.8 
Full definitions of these potential effects are set out in the IEMA Guidance and 
DMRB Volume 11.  It has been assumed that construction effects are the same 
as decommissioning and have been treated as such. 
Traffic Surveys 
12.5.9 
In order to inform the assessment in the TA and ES, data obtained from traffic 
and pedestrian / cycle surveys undertaken in October and November 2014 and 
May 2017 were used.  These include: 
 
automatic traffic counts on the C94 Bedford Road (the old A421), and 
Green Lane adjacent the Proposed Site Access; 
 
an all-movement part classified turning count survey at the C94 Bedford 
Road / Green Lane priority junction; 
 
an automatic traffic count on Millbrook Road; and 
 
pedestrian and cycle counts on Green Lane. 
Items Scoped out of the Assessment 
12.5.10 No hazardous loads are associated with the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project and therefore have been scoped out of the 
assessment. 
12.5.11 There would be a minimal number of vehicle movements to the Gas 
Connection during the operational phase (possibly in the order of 1 trip per 
week). These movements would be intermittent, and would be limited to 
routine inspection and maintenance operations at the AGI.  
12.5.12 As such, no assessment has been undertaken of any operational phase-
generated traffic movement on Millbrook Road from the Gas Connection, as 
described in section 12.7.  
12.5.13 There would be a minimal number of movements to the Electrical Connection 
during the operational phase (possibly in the order of 1 trip per week). These 
movements would be intermittent, and would be limited to routine inspection 
and maintenance operations.  
12.5.14 As such, no assessment has been undertaken of any operational phase-
generated traffic movement on Millbrook Road from the Electrical Connection, 
as described in section 12.7.

Assumptions and Limitations 
12.5.15 The assumptions and limitations used in this assessment are as per section 
4.8 – particularly that typical construction schedules and traffic movements 
have been taken from a design concept report, prepared specifically for the 
Project and based on experience of other, similar projects.  
Significance Criteria 
12.5.16 The significance criteria derived for this assessment reflect those contained 
within IEMA / DMRB Guidance, together with professional judgement.  
12.5.17 The significance of effect is derived from a combination of the sensitivity (or 
importance) of the receptors affected and magnitude (or scale) of the change 
on the receptors.  
Sensitivity 
12.5.18 For the transport-related effects considered in this section of the ES, 
categories of receptor sensitivity have been defined from the principles set out 
in the IEMA Guidelines and therefore differ slightly from the example sensitivity 
of receptors table set out in Chapter 4. 
Table 12.2 - Sensitivity of Receptors 
Sensitivity 
Receptors 
High 
Schools, colleges and other educational institutions;  
retirement / care homes for the elderly or infirm; 
roads used by pedestrians with no footways; and  
road safety black spots. 
Medium 
hospitals, surgeries and clinics;  
parks and recreation areas; shopping areas; and  
roads used by pedestrians with narrow footways. 
Low 
open space; tourist / visitor attractions;  
historical buildings; and  
churches. 
12.5.19 In addition, although not specifically identified within the IEMA Guidelines as 
being sensitive, it has been assumed that residential areas (including rural 
communities) and employment areas have low sensitivity to these effects as 
they typically experience regular traffic movements on a day to day basis. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
405 
Magnitude of Impact 
12.5.20 The magnitude of impact depends upon the category of traffic effects being 
assessed, and this has been based on the guidance relating to severance (as 
set out below) which suggests that 0%, 30%, 60% and 90% changes in traffic 
levels should be considered as "negligible", "minor", "moderate" and "major" 
impacts respectively.   
12.5.21 IEMA's guidelines set out the broad principles of how to assess the magnitude 
of effect for each category of potential environmental impact.  This is 
summarised below: 
 
Severance - The IEMA guidelines state that "severance is the perceived 
division that can occur within a community when it becomes separated by 
a major traffic artery."  Further, "Changes in traffic flow of 30%, 60% and 
90% are regarded as producing 'slight', 'moderate' and 'substantial' 
changes in severance respectively" (to maintain consistency with this 
assessment, these are referred to as "Minor", "Moderate" and "Major").  
However, the guidance acknowledges that the measurement and prediction 
of severance is extremely difficult. The assessment of severance pays full 
regard to specific local conditions, in particular the location of pedestrian 
routes to key local facilities and whether or not crossing facilities are 
provided. 
Volume 11, Section 3, Part 8, Chapter 6 of the Design Manual for Roads 
and Bridges dated 2006 (the "DMRB") provides further guidance on this 
aspect of Severance in terms of the 2-way Annual Average Daily Traffic 
Flow (AADT) on a link. It states that new severance should be described in 
terms of "Slight", Moderate" or Severe" (to maintain consistency with this 
assessment, these are referred to as "Minor", "Moderate" and "Major") and 
that these categories " … should be coupled with an estimate of the 
numbers of people affected, their location and the community facilities from 
which they are severed". Therefore, for anything less than minor 
significance, no such estimate of the numbers of people affected need be 
made.  (The potential effects as set out later in this section are based on an 
assessment which takes this into account).   Table 12.3 summarises these 
thresholds: 
Table 12.3 – Pedestrian Severance Threshold (DMRB) 
Severance Level 
Traffic Flow (AADT) 
Major 
> 16,000 
Moderate  
8,000 -  16,000 
Minor 
< 8,000 
12.5.22 In addition (with specific reference to relief from existing severance), the DMRB 
Guidelines acknowledge that there is a traffic flow threshold below which 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
406 
changes in Severance are not considered significant where the existing AADT 
(daily) flow is below 8,000 vehicles. 
 
Driver delay – such delays “…are only likely to be significant when the 
traffic on the network surrounding the proposed development is already at, 
or close to, the capacity of the system”; 
 
Pedestrian delay – “Changes in the volume, composition or speed of traffic 
may affect the ability of people to cross roads.”  The guidance suggests that 
assessors “… use their judgement to determine whether pedestrian delay is 
a significant impact”.  For the purposes of this assessment, the pedestrian 
severance threshold levels identified in Table 12.3 above have been applied 
to pedestrian delay; 
 
Pedestrian amenity – this is broadly defined as the relative pleasantness 
of a journey, whether a journey is affected by traffic flow, traffic composition 
and pavement width / separation from traffic.  The guidance suggests a 
tentative threshold for judging the significance of changes in pedestrian 
amenity of where traffic flow (or its lorry component) is halved or doubled; 
 
Fear and intimidation – the impact of this is dependent upon the volume 
of traffic, its heavy vehicle composition, its proximity to people or the lack of 
protection caused by such factors as narrow pavement widths.  The IEMA 
guidelines state that there are no commonly agreed thresholds for 
estimating this from known traffic and physical conditions, but it does 
nevertheless suggest some thresholds which could be used, based on 
previous research, and these are shown in Table 12.4:

Negligible 
   <   600 
   <   1,000 
    <   10 
 
Accidents and safety - the guidance suggests that "Professional 
judgement will be needed to assess the implications of local circumstances, 
or factors, which may elevate or lessen risks of accidents, e.g. junction 
conflicts". 
 
Hazardous loads - the guidance states that the Environmental Assessment 
needs clearly to outline the estimated number and composition of such 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
407 
loads, but that the analysis should reflect the nature of the load in question. 
The IEMA guidelines acknowledge that most developments will not result in 
increases in the number of movements or hazardous / dangerous loads. 
Significance of Effect 
12.5.23 The sensitivity of the receptor and the magnitude of impact are combined to 
give the overall significance of effect, as set out in Table 12.5.  The criteria are 
based on guidance together with professional judgement.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Power Generation Plant  
On-site access (Power Generation Plant) 
12.6.1 
Construction and operational access to the Generating Equipment Site is 
proposed from the north near Stewartby via Green Lane as shown on Figure 
12.2. Green Lane links to C94 Bedford Road to the west, and Stewartby Way 
and the B530 to the east. There is a junction on Green Lane leading to an 
existing access track on the previously unexcavated land on the western side 
of Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery South Pit.  
12.6.2 
An unmetalled access track is already in existence at the Project Site, linking 
Green Lane to Rookery South Pit.  However, this track is only currently suitable 
for use by off-road vehicles. The LLRS, as described in section 3.1 of this ES, 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
408 
includes work to build a new ramp into Rookery South Pit.  This work will be 
carried out prior to construction of the Project.  
12.6.3 
There are two possible options for on-site access at the Generating Equipment 
Site, as described below. 
With Covanta RRF Project: Short Access Road 
12.6.4 
The Covanta RRF Project includes provision to upgrade the existing 
agricultural track to a tarmac road suitable for the delivery of waste by HGV. 
Should this road be upgraded prior to the Project, it would be suitable to meet 
both the needs of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project - the typical 
capacity of this link, assessed in line with the DMRB TA 79/99 (of 1,590 
vehicles per hour in the peak direction), is far higher than the daily traffic 
generation of both the Project and the Covanta RRF Project (as reported in the 
Covanta RRF Transport Assessment submitted in support of the Covanta RRF 
DCO) of approximately 600 vehicles per day.  
12.6.5 
In this instance, there would be a requirement for a short section of new Access 
Road (‘Short Access Road’) of up to 1.4 km in length, effectively extending the 
Covanta RRF road to the Generating Equipment Site within Rookery South Pit. 
The Short Access Road would be constructed from bituminous material 
bordered by a pre-cast concrete kerb and a footway. It would generally be 6m 
wide allowing for two-way traffic.  
Without Covanta RRF Project: Access Road 
12.6.6 
As it is not certain as to when the Covanta RRF Project will be implemented, 
the Applicant has also included, within its Project, provision for a complete 
Access Road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (which 
includes both sections referred to above). If the Covanta RRF Project is not 
built before construction on the Project commences, the complete Access 
Road would be built. The Access Road would be up to 2.2 km long and would 
be constructed from bituminous material bordered by a concrete kerb. It would 
generally be 6m wide with appropriate widening on bends, allowing for two-
way traffic. There would be a footway adjacent to part of the Access Road 
where there is no existing footpath.  
12.6.7 
The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the alignment of 
the access road proposed within the LLRS and Covanta RRF Project, along 
the existing access track which borders Rookery North Pit. On reaching 
Rookery South Pit, the Access Road would use the access ramp (built 
standard as part of the LLRS as described above to enter into the pit and cross 
through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site. 
12.6.8 
Should the Access Road for the Project be constructed first, it would not 
prevent the Covanta RRF Project or other developments from progressing at 
a later date, although it may require the Access Road to be upgraded as part 
of the other scheme(s), as necessary. The upgrade of the Access Road by 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
409 
Covanta in the event that the permission for that scheme is implemented after 
any DCO for the Project is not considered further in this ES as this would be 
the responsibility of the Covanta RRF project and is addressed within the 
Covanta RRF ES.  Potential cumulative effects arising from construction of the 
Covanta RRF Project and the Project are set out in Section 12.9.  
Local and Strategic Highway Network 
12.6.9 
The road network in the vicinity of the Project Site is shown on Figures 12.1 
and 12.2. 
12.6.10 Green Lane is a rural single carriageway road, connecting Stewartby to 
Marston Moretaine on the C94 Bedford Road, at a ghost island priority junction 
1.3km to the north-west of the proposed site access. A level crossing of the 
Marston Vale Rail line is located 70 m to the west of the proposed Access 
Road. The Kimberley College (a Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics Sixth Form College) is located to the north of Green Lane, 400m 
to the west of the proposed Access Road.  The Green Lane carriageway is 
around 6.5 m wide, with lighting and/or footway to the south-east of the 
Kimberley College only. Green Lane is subject to the national speed limit of 60 
mph from Bedford Road to 600 m west of the Access Road on the approach 
to the level crossing, where a 30mph speed limit is applied. 
12.6.11 To the east of the Access Road, Green Lane is around 6.5m to 7.0m wide, with 
a footway in the northern verge. This is present all the way into Stewartby. A 
speed limit of 30 mph is applied on this stretch of road. Green Lane continues 
to the east forming Stewartby Way, before connecting with the B530.   
12.6.12 The C94 Bedford Road, with which Green Lane connects, formed the A421 
before the parallel dual carriageway scheme opened in 2010 between the M1 
Junction 13 and Bedford. Access to the new A421 is provided at a series of 
grade-separated junctions, the closest to the Power Generation Plant Site 
being 3.2 km north and 2 km south of the Access Road.  
12.6.13 The A421 is aligned on a south-west to north-east axis, connecting to M1 
Junction 13 - around 8 km south-west of Green Lane - passing to the south of 
Bedford city centre, to end at the A1, 26 km to the north-east of Green Lane. 
Access is provided to Bedford by a series of five grade-separated junctions on 
the A421. 
12.6.14 The M1, located 8 km to the south-west of the Access Road, forms one of the 
main strategic north-south highway routes through Great Britain, connecting 
some of the major conurbations of the north (Sheffield, Leeds), the Midlands 
(Nottingham, Northampton), Milton Keynes and London. A connection from the 
M1 to the M6 provides a link to Scotland, the major conurbations in the north-
west (Liverpool, Manchester), and Birmingham.

Public Rights of Way 
12.6.15 The Public Rights of Way (PROW) in the vicinity of the Generating Equipment 
Site are shown on the plan in Appendix 2.1 of the TA. 
12.6.16 There are no Public Rights of Way within the Generating Equipment Site, 
although the LLRS is promoting further new permissive recreational footpaths 
in and around the Rookery Pit including: 
 
a footpath connection to Green Lane; 
 
a footpath circling the Rookery North Pit;  
 
a footpath surrounding the attenuation pond in the Rookery South Pit; and 
 
a footpath link to the existing public footpath FP4. 
12.6.17 These are shown on Figure 8.7 of the LLRS Restoration Strategy, included in 
Appendix 2.1 of the TA. 
12.6.18 Footpaths within close proximity to the Power Generation Plant Site are also 
shown in Appendix 2.1 of the TA, and are as follows: 
 
to the north-west of the Power Generation Plant Site FP72 provides a 
leisure footpath around the Stewartby Lake. In order to form an access 
between Stewartby and FP72, there is a footpath link to Green Lane 160m 
west of the railway crossing; and 
 
to the west of Stewartby Lake, there is a footpath link to C94 Bedford Road, 
via FP19. This joins C94 Bedford Road within a national speed limit zone, 
where no footway is present. The speed limit is reduced to 30 mph 90m 
south of the FP19 link: after a further 40m into this zone, a footway is 
formed.  
Footways and Cycleways 
12.6.19 There is a footway in the northern verge of Green Lane linking Stewartby 
village to the east and Kimberley College to the west. The footway commences 
in the centre of Stewartby and is between 1.5m and 2m in width. This footway 
link is 0.8km in length.  Kimberley College has committed to providing a 
crossing patrol during the College opening hours to assist the movements of 
students across Green Lane to the FP72 recreational footpath also linking to 
Marston Moretaine (see below) and the Kimberley College Access. The 
footway in this section is illuminated by the street lighting system. As well as 
accommodating students walking to this facility, the footway would also 
accommodate pedestrians walking from Stewartby to the Stewartby Rail 
Station, and to the FP72 recreational footpath which runs alongside Stewartby 
Lake. 
12.6.20 In the southern verge of Green Lane immediately adjacent to the railway level 
crossing, there is a short section of footway either side of the crossing to 
provide pedestrian access to the platforms. This footway terminates within 20m 
of the crossing. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
411 
12.6.21 On C94 Bedford Road, there is a footway on the eastern verge commencing 
160m south of the junction with Green Lane linking to Marston Moretaine to 
the south. This footway has a width of between 1.5m and 2m, and is illuminated 
by the street lighting system.  
12.6.22 There are no further pedestrian facilities along Green Lane to the north past 
this point.  
12.6.23 On Bedford Road, a footway starts 160 m south of the Access Road, with a 
width between 1.5m and 2m. This section is illuminated by the street lighting 
system.  
12.6.24 No cycleways are present on either Bedford Road, or Green Lane.  
Equestrian  
12.6.25 There are no bridleways or equestrian facilities on the Power Generation Plant 
Site.  
12.6.26 As shown in Appendix 2.1 to the TA, BW84 is the closest bridleway to the 
Power Generation Plant Site, approximately 200m east, joining FP17 and 
FP72, towards the south and south-west of Stewartby Lake respectively.  
Existing Bus Routes and Services 
12.6.27 Existing bus services are summarised in Table 12.6 below  
Table 12.6 – Existing Bus Services 
12.6.28 The closest bus stop served by Service 68 is located outside Stewartby Village 
Hall - approximately 350m east of the existing Rookery Pit access on Green 
Lane. A further four stops are located within Stewartby. 
12.6.29 Further services serve the area to the south of the Project site, but are 
infrequent and have not been considered in any further detail.

Existing Rail Routes and Services 
12.6.30 As shown on Figure 12.1, the nearest rail station to the Power Generation Plant 
Site is Millbrook, approximately 700m south-west. However, practically (due to 
the quality of the access route), the closest station is Stewartby Rail Station to 
the northern side of Green Lane. This station is approximately 90m from the 
junction of Green Lane with the Access Road, and approximately 1.7 km north-
west from the centre of the Generating Equipment Site.  
12.6.31 Both the Stewartby and Millbrook Rail Stations are served by the Marston Vale 
Line that provides an hourly service operated by London Midland in each 
direction between Bedford and Bletchley from Mondays to Saturdays (16 trains 
per day in each direction).  
12.6.32 There are links from Millbrook and Stewartby Rail Stations to Bedford, Bedford 
St Johns, Kempston Hardwick, Lidlington, Ridgmont, Aspley Guise, Woburn 
Sands, Bow Brickhill, Fenny Stratford and Bletchley.  
12.6.33 The Midland Main Line runs to the east of the Project Site providing services 
from Bedford to London St Pancras, the Midlands and northern England.  The 
nearest railway station to the Project Site served by the Midland Main Line is 
Bedford Railway Station also served by the adjacent Marston Vale Line, 
located approximately 9.3 km north-east from the centre of the Project Site. 
Bedford Railway Station is served by East Midlands Trains, London Midlands 
and First Capital Connect, providing direct rail connections northwards - to 
Wellingborough, Kettering, Market Harborough, Leicester, Loughborough and 
Nottingham - and southwards to Luton, St Albans City and London St Pancras.  
12.6.34 There are proposals in the future to reconnect the Bedford Railway Station 
between Oxford and Cambridge through the East West Rail Link project. This 
is being promoted by the East-West Rail Consortium, a consortium of local 
authorities and interested bodies along the route. Phase 1 of the  western 
section of the East West Rail Link project from Oxford to Bedford was approved 
by the Government in November 2011 (committing £270 million to the scheme) 
and has been constructed and is now operational. Discussions have taken 
place with Network Rail and relevant meeting notes are contained within 
Appendix 2.2 of the TA.   
12.6.35 Phase 2 of the western section of the project will connect Bicester to Bedford 
via Bletchley and the Marston Vale branch line which runs along the west side 
of Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit. Statutory consultation was 
conducted between 30th June and 11th August 2017 on Phase 2 of the East 
West Rail Link and a member of the management team for the Project attended 
an event in Marston Moretaine. A meeting was also held with the East West 
Rail Stakeholder Manager on 10th May 2017. The Marston Vale branch line 
between the Millbrook level crossing and the Green Lane level crossing 
(including the level crossings themselves) are not subject to any upgrade 
works or alterations as part of the Phase 2 proposals.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
413 
12.6.36 Discussions have taken place with Network Rail regarding the scheme and 
relevant meeting notes are contained within Appendix 2.2 of the TA.  Network 
Rail have not raised any objections to the Project.      
 
Road Safety 
12.6.37 Personal Injury Collision ((PIC) – formerly known as Personal Injury Accident 
– (PIA)) summary data was obtained from Central Bedfordshire Council for the 
most recent five-year period up to 31st December 2016.  
12.6.38 The TA provides a detailed summary of the PICs (location and nature) for links 
and junctions in the study area, and also provides an estimate of the likely 
anticipated number of PICs for similar types of links and junctions using 
national data, to enable comparison. This is summarised below. 
12.6.39 The assessment has identified that for all the links and junctions close to the 
Power Generation Plant Site, the number of observed PICs is low, and within 
the levels which would be expected based on the highway layout and traffic 
flows.     
12.6.40 No trends appear to be apparent within the PIC data, nor any indication that 
there are any trends relating to vulnerable users. 
12.6.41 As such, there appear to be no existing road safety issues in relation to the 
road links and junctions close to the Power Generation Plant Site. 
Baseline Traffic Flow Information 
12.6.42 Traffic surveys were undertaken as follows: 
 
a peak period turning count at the C94 Bedford Road / Green Lane junction 
– undertaken in May 2017: and 
 
automatic traffic counts on the C94 Bedford Road and Green Lane – 
undertaken in May 2017.      
12.6.43 The Baseline traffic flows from these surveys are shown in Table 12.7 below:

12.6.44 As agreed with the highway authorities (see TA Appendix 2.2.2), a Future Year 
assessment has been undertaken for 2031. These 2031 flows have been 
assessed assuming: 
 
the growth in flows between 2017 to 2031;  
 
the flows from the Covanta RRF development; and 
 
the development at Broadmead Road, Stewartby.   
12.6.45 The 2031 flows are synthesised by applying the following TEMPRO growth

12.6.50 A Pedestrian / Cyclist survey was also undertaken to provide up-to-date flow 
information for Green Lane.  As agreed with the highway authorities, the 
pedestrian / cycle movements were observed on a Saturday, Sunday and 
Monday in May 2017, reflecting the typical weekend and weekday movements.  
As the Kimberley College was open on the Monday, it is assumed that this 
reflects typical conditions. These data are summarised below in Table 12.9.

Receptors 
12.6.53 It is concluded that the only receptor with a high sensitivity likely to be affected 
by the Power Generation Plant is the Kimberley College on Green Lane.  
However, whilst the Kimberley College, an educational establishment, is a high 
sensitivity receptor, as the students attending are sixteen or older they are 
likely to be more risk-aware than primary or secondary school children. 
12.6.54 Receptors with a medium sensitivity are considered to be: 
 
the Water Sports Club on Green Lane, but located 300m south of the road 
itself; 
 
the narrow footway / cycleway across the level crossing;  
 
cyclists on Green Lane; and 
 
users of the permissive recreational footpaths in the Rookery Pit area. 
Gas Connection 
12.6.55 As described in Chapter 3 of this ES, the Gas Connection is approximately 1.8 
km in length, running roughly north – south towards Millbrook Road.  
12.6.56 There are two construction access options for the Gas Connection Site: it is 
likely that both will be used to access different parts of the Gas Connection. 
These two access options are shown on Figure 12.2, and are as follows:  
 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site 
(having accessed the Site from Green Lane and C94 Bedford Road as per 
the Generating Equipment site) for the northern sections of the Gas 
Connection Site; or 
 
for the central and southern sections of the Gas Connection Site - from the 
A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards for 
approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route as 
Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road then Houghton Lane.  
12.6.57 Access will be obtained from the latter Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane option 
at two points: 
 
an existing field access to the east of Houghton Lane to an existing 
agricultural track will be used for both construction and operational access 
to the Above Ground Installation (AGI) and the southern end of the Gas 
Connection Site south of Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane. This track will 
be upgraded as part of the Project; and 
 
from Houghton Lane, to both the east and the west, to the central section 
of the Gas Connection Site north of Millbrook Road / Houghton Lane. This 
will also be used as a crossing point across Houghton Lane during 
construction for those crossing north and south of the Gas Connection.

Local and Strategic Highway Network 
12.6.58 The road network in the vicinity of the Gas Connection is shown on Figures 
12.1 and 12.2.  In addition to the local and strategic highway network described 
for the Power Generation Plant are the following road links: 
 
Millbrook Road, which bisects the Gas Connection on a north-east - south-
west axis, is a single carriageway with a speed limit of 60 mph. The width 
of the road ranges between 5 m to 5.5 m. To the south-west, Millbrook Road 
leads on to Houghton Lane, and on to Station Lane. To the north-east, 
Millbrook Road links to the B530 at a priority junction; 
 
Sandhill Close runs north-south, to the south of the Gas Connection, 
connecting Houghton Lane to the A507 via a roundabout. Sandhill Close 
has a weight restriction of 7.5 tonnes and a width restriction of 6' 6", making 
it suitable only for cars and light vehicles; 
 
the B530 runs on a north to south axis between Bedford to the north and 
Ampthill to the south. The B530 is a single carriageway with a speed limit 
of 60 mph. Stewartby Way also links to the B530, which in turn links to 
Green Lane through Stewartby. As there is a height restriction of 11'3" and 
a 7.5 tonne weight restriction through Stewartby, this route is only suitable 
for cars and light vehicles; and 
 
the A507 provides a single carriageway connection from the M1 Junction 
13 to Ampthill and passes to the south of Millbrook. 
Public Rights of Way 
12.6.59 The Public Rights of Way (PROW) in the vicinity of the proposed Gas 
Connection are shown on the plan in Appendix 2.1 to the TA. 
12.6.60 The northern part of the Gas Connection is bisected east-west by a continuous 
footpath route formed by three individual footpath sections FP14, FP65 and 
FP15, connecting Station Lane to Millbrook Road, crossing the Midland Main 
railway line. There is also a spur, FP4, from FP15 aligned north-south to the 
west of the rail line, crossing it towards FP16 and then via the FP3 towards the 
B530 and towards Stewartby. 
12.6.61 The southern part of the Gas Connection is bisected by FP7 which runs 
between FP14 close to Station Lane, Millbrook Road and across the rail way 
line where it becomes FP13 towards Park Farm Cottage and beyond to the 
south east. 
Footways and Cycleways 
12.6.62 From Stewartby, whilst there is a footpath along Stewartby Way along the 
westbound carriageway, there are no footways on the B530, Millbrook Road 
or Houghton Lane. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
418 
12.6.63 From Millbrook, to the east of the Sandhill Close / Station Lane Junction, there 
is a footway along Sandhill Close in the southern verge of the carriageway up 
until its junction with Houghton Lane and Russell Grove where it ends. To the 
west of the Sandhill Close / Station Lane Junction, there are no footways along 
this derestricted section of Station Lane up until the Millbrook Rail Station. 
12.6.64 From Marston Moretaine, there are footways along Beancroft Road and 
Station Road, then along Station Lane where it terminates at the Millbrook Rail 
Station. There is no footway along the section of Station Lane from the 
Millbrook Rail Station to Sandhill Close in Millbrook. 
12.6.65 No cycle ways are present in the vicinity of the Gas Connection.   
Equestrian 
12.6.66 There are no bridleways in the area of the Gas Connection. 
Existing Bus Routes and Services 
12.6.67 To the north of the Project site, Service 68 operated by Grant Palmer is the 
most frequent operating service in Stewartby. This service runs between 
Bedford, Kempston, Wootton and Stewartby. The route from Bedford routes to 
Stewartby via Bedford Road and Broadmead Road.  
12.6.68 Service 68 provides eight services per day, in each direction between Bedford 
town centre and Stewartby (Monday to Saturday). In the northbound direction, 
the first service of the day to Bedford is at 07:05, the final service of the day at 
17:10. In the southbound direction, the first service from Bedford is at 07:35, 
the final service of the day at 17:50. No services operate on Sundays.  
12.6.69 The closest bus stop to the Project served by this Service 68 is located outside 
Stewartby Village Hall – approximately 350m east of the existing Rookery Pit 
access on Green Lane. A further four stops are located within Stewartby further 
afield.  
12.6.70 Further services serve the area to the south of the Project site (as summarised 
in Table 12.10), but are infrequent and have not been considered in any further 
detail. 
12.6.71 Table 12.10 summarises the bus services in the area – details of the routes, 
stops, and timetables are contained in Appendix 3.2 of the TA:

Existing Rail Routes and Services 
12.6.72 As shown on Figure 12.1, Millbrook Rail Station is located 1 km to the west of 
the Gas Connection. This station is served by the Marston Vale Line services 
reported in paragraphs 12.6.30-33.  
Baseline Traffic Flows 
12.6.73 As part of previous traffic counts undertaken in 2014, an ATC was installed 
along Millbrook Road (50m west of the B530).  These results are shown in 
Table 12.11. As the flows recorded in 2014 were so low, and as there has been 
no local development or infrastructure to affect flows on this link, no repeat 
ATC was commissioned in 2017. 
12.6.74 The 2017 data has been calculated by applying growth factors extracted from 
the growth observed in the ATC results from 2014 and 2017 at Green Lane.:  
2014 – 2017  
-AM:1.179 
 
 - PM: 1.317 
12.6.75 The 2017 AM and PM peak flows on Millbrook Road, derived from the 
observed Green Lane ATC surveys were then combined and factors of 3.88 
and 4.24 were applied to convert into the 18hr and 24hr flows, respectively, 
that are summarised in Table 12.12.

Receptors 
12.6.76 Receptors with a high sensitivity potentially affected by the Gas Connection 
are: 
 
pedestrians and cyclists, due to the lack of footways on the B530; and 
 
pedestrians and cyclists, due to the lack of footways on Millbrook Road. 
12.6.77 Whilst these receptors are of a high sensitivity, the numbers of pedestrians and 
cyclists are considered to be minimal.  
12.6.78 Receptors with a medium sensitivity potentially affected briefly during the 
construction sequence only of the Gas Connection are: 
 
users of footpath FP65 where that pipeline crosses this public right of way; 
and 
 
similarly, users of footpath FP7.   
The numbers of pedestrians using these routes are considered to be minimal. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
421 
12.6.79 The other receptor, with a medium sensitivity, are cyclists on the B530 and 
Millbrook Road – albeit the numbers of cyclists are also considered to be 
minimal given that this is not a formal cycle route and the traffic count data 
from 2014 recorded minimal numbers of cyclists. 
Electrical Connection  
12.6.80 Two access route options are available for the Electrical Connection. They are 
shown on Figure 12.2, and are as follows:  
 
through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site 
(having accessed the Power Generation Plant Site from Green Lane and 
C94 Bedford Road) for the northern section of the Electrical Connection; or 
 
for the southern section of the Electrical Connection - from the A421, 
northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards for approximately 
7km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / 
Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and Station Lane.  
12.6.81 The Substation would be accessed using the first route option through Rookery 
South Pit. The rest of the Electrical Connection would be accessed using a 
combination of both access options listed above. It is assumed that the 
operational access routes would be the same as those for the construction 
phase of the Electrical Connection. 
Local and Strategic Highway Network 
12.6.82 The road network in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection is shown on 
Figures 12.1 and 12.2. In addition to the local and strategic highway network 
described for the Power Generation Plant and the Gas Connection is the 
following road link: 
 
Station Lane runs from the junction of Houghton Lane / Sandhill Close 
junction to Marston Moretaine, crossing the Marston Vale Rail Line at a 
level crossing. It continues through Marston Moretaine to link towards the 
A421.  
Existing Pedestrian, Cyclist and Equestrian Facilities 
12.6.83 The Public Rights of Way (PROW) in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection 
are shown on the plan in Appendix 2.1 of the TA. 
12.6.84 In addition to the Public Rights of Way described for the Power Generation 
Plant and the Gas Connection, the Electrical Connection is also crossed by:  
 
Footpath FP7 which is aligned from north-west to south-east through the 
Electrical Connection, connecting between Millbrook Road and Station 
Lane and; 
 
Footpath FP14, aligned west to east from Station Lane across the Midland 
Mainline Rail to Millbrook Road. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
422 
Existing Bus Routes and Services 
12.6.85 As discussed earlier, the site is served by two regular bus services.  Service 
68 (Bedford – Kempston – Wootton – Stewartby) and Service 42 (Bedford – 
Ampthill – Flitwick). 
Existing Rail Routes and Services 
12.6.86 As shown on Figure 12.1, Millbrook Rail Station is located 0.5km to the west 
of the Electrical Connection. This station is served by the Marston Vale Line 
services reported in paragraphs 12.6.30-33.  
Receptors 
12.6.87 In addition to the receptors with a high sensitivity possibly affected by the 
Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection as referred to above, there is no 
footway on Station Lane.  Whilst this may be considered to be of high 
sensitivity, the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists are from observation, 
minimal.  
12.6.88 In addition, users of footpath FP7 and FP14 are medium sensitivity receptors 
briefly during the installation of the Electrical Connection as the access would 
cross these public rights of way during the construction. Once the Electrical 
Connection has been installed, there would be no further impacts. 
12.7 
Assessment of Effects 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction / Decommissioning 
12.7.1 
Section 6 within the TA looks at the typical average construction trip generation 
of the Power Generation Plant, with reference to the construction traffic flows 
identified for similar projects.  
12.7.2 
In addition, a worst case construction phase has also been tested as part of 
the TA process and considers the likely peak daily construction movements. 
These would typically occur over a short timescale of a day or two in the course 
of construction – and relates to the one major pour of the foundation only. It 
has been assumed that: 
 
this event would arise from deliveries of ready-mixed concrete for the 
casting of the main foundation. To avoid the need for construction joints 
(with the associated impact on long-term durability), it assumed that this 
base would be cast in one operation, during one day; 
 
a typical Generating Equipment plant foundation detail would require 
around 750m3 of concrete; 
 
assuming the typical load is 6m3 of concrete per HGV, this would require 
around 125 deliveries; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
423 
 
due to the time that it takes to process the arriving concrete vehicle, to 
sample the batch, pump it to the correct area, then place and compact the 
concrete, it is likely that the delivery rate would be around one vehicle 
arriving every 5 minutes through the day for ten hours;  
 
this operation would need a total of 30 operatives on site. For the purposes 
of this worst case assessment, it has been assumed that all would have to 
be on site before the AM peak hour, and would work until after the PM peak 
hour had finished; 
 
because of the priority needed to be provided to the concrete delivery, that 
no other construction operation will be ongoing on the Generating 
Equipment site at the same time; and 
 
this work would form one of the earlier work tasks in the project – i.e., it is 
assumed that this would be in the first quarter. 
12.7.3 
The typical average daily and peak construction trip generation in relation to 
the construction and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant is 
summarised below in Table 12.13: 
Table 12.13 – Average Daily and Peak Hour Construction movements 
(Total Vehicles) for Power Generation Plant 
*1 Vehicle = 1 In Movement and 1 Out Movement 
12.7.4 
As the peak construction flow generation is limited to one, possibly two, days 
during the construction sequence, limited further assessment will be reported 
of this scenario on Green Lane only. In terms of the average construction

movements on the road links close to the Power Generation Plant Site, the 
highest flow occurs in Q3.  These movements are shown in Table 12.14 below 
for total vehicles and HGVs, together with the percentage increase. 
12.7.5 
For the purposes of the assessment, we have assumed that there will a roughly 
equal split of vehicles coming from the north and south and from the east and 
west. However, far fewer vehicles are anticipated to come through Stewartby 
(limited to construction workers) as the routes have been planned to avoid 
Stewartby.

These average increases reported above occur during Q3 only – the average 
across all eight quarters of the construction period will be less than this – so 
this average construction movement assessment represents a realistic worst-
case analysis of the average flows during the construction period. 
12.7.7 
For a short duration in Q1 (over a period of one or two days), there would be 
a peak of construction related movement as described in section 12.7.2 and 
shown in Table 12.13.  The traffic flows and percentage increases for this peak 
are shown below in Table 12.15.

12.7.8 
With respect to the minimum environmental impact thresholds identified in 
section 12.5 for Pedestrian Severance (‘Minor’ is below 8,000 additional 
vehicles AADT), Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and Intimidation (‘Negligible’ is 
less than 600 vehicles an hour over an 18 hour day) this assessment shows 
that all of these relatively limited-duration construction movements are 
generally well below the level at which changes can be perceived, and in 
accordance with Table 12.5, the significance of effect is therefore neutral and 
not significant. The exception is for the peak construction movements on 
Green Lane where HGVs are forecast to treble for this short period of time (1 
to 2 days). The significance of these effects are summarised below.   
12.7.9 
In addition, the relatively minor traffic flows associated with construction 
movements forecast are all below the level at which changes in road user delay 
or accidents and safety can be perceived or measured, and in accordance with 
Table 12.5, the significance of effect is therefore neutral and not significant. 
12.7.10 The results of the assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of 
the construction and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant are 
summarised below, with reference to the identified specific sensitive receptors 
and the magnitude of likely impact, as defined in the Significance of Effects 
Matrix in Table 12.5.

highest average construction movement flow):

and intimidation, pedestrian or cyclist amenity, road user or pedestrian 
delay, accidents and safety) is no change.  In accordance with Table 12.5, 
the significance of effect is therefore neutral. As this significance of effect 
is below moderate, with reference to paragraph 4.7.4 this is considered to 
be not significant. The extent would be local, the duration short term and 
there would be a low likelihood of occurrence;

 
Users of the permissive recreational footpath within the Rookery Pit where 
the path is aligned along the Access Road during the construction of this 
road. The sensitivity of the receptor is medium and the magnitude of impact 
for the categories of effect (severance, fear and intimidation, pedestrian or 
cyclist amenity) is considered to be negligible, so without mitigation this 
would give a significance of effect of Slight Adverse. However, this is fully 
mitigated by the embedded mitigation measures detailed in the footpath 
management plan. The mitigated significance of effect is therefore neutral. 
As this significance of effect is below moderate, with reference to paragraph 
4.7.4 this is considered to be not significant. The extent would be local, the 
duration short term and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  
12.7.12 For the peak construction movements over a very short duration (1 to 2 days) 
HGV movements on Green Lane treble.  Although total HGV volumes on 
Green Lane are well below the thresholds given in Section 12.5 (and the high 
percentage increase reflects very low baseline HGV flows on Green Lane) it is 
possible that a change in pedestrian amenity could be perceived.  On that basis 
therefore, for Kimberley College, the sensitivity of the receptor is high, the 
magnitude of impact in terms of pedestrian amenity is negligible, and the 
significance of effect is therefore slight adverse for this short time period (1 to 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

2 days). As this significance of effect is below moderate, with reference to 
paragraph 4.7.4, this is considered to be not significant. The extent would be 
local, the duration short term and there would be a low likelihood of occurrence.  
Operation 
12.7.13 Within the TA, section 7 deals with the normal operation of the Power 
Generation Plant. Up to four members of staff would be working at the Power 
Generation Plant Site at any one time. Three shifts per day are assumed, to 
provide 24-hour coverage. As these shift changes would be timed to avoid the 
highway network peak hour, the highway impact of the operation would 
therefore be minimised. An assessment has been made of the likely mode 
share, based on the local Journey to Work data obtained from the 2011 Census 
- it is assumed that 20 of these daily 24 movements would be made by car. In 
addition, there would be infrequent HGV movements associated with 
maintenance and supply deliveries - to provide a worst case assessment, it 
has been assumed that one HGV movement would be made per day. 
12.7.14 During the annual maintenance of the Generating Equipment, there may be up 
to 40 additional staff on site for a typical maintenance period of one month. It 
is assumed that all these trips would all be made by car, assuming 1.6 
occupants per car, as per the average Journey to Work car occupancy within 
the National Travel Survey. Reflecting the typical working hours on 
construction sites, it is assumed that majority of these movements would be 
made outside of the network peak.  However, to provide a robust assessment 
it has been assumed that 25 percent of the total vehicle movements would be 
during the peak hour. A further five HGV movements per day (none during the 
peak hour) are assumed during maintenance. 
12.7.15 The likely worst case operational trip generation (during the periodic 
maintenance) in connection with the operation of the Power Generation Plant 
is summarised in Table 12.16 below.

12.7.18 With respect to the minimum environmental impact thresholds identified in 
section 12.5, it is clear that even during the higher traffic generating periods, 
all of these operational phase movements are so low that they are well below 
the level at which changes can be perceived, and that they are therefore not 
significant. 
12.7.19 The results of the assessment of the potential environmental effects of the 
Power Generation Plant during operation are summarised below: 
 
Kimberley College – the sensitivity of the receptor is high, and the 
magnitude of impact for the categories of effect considered (severance, fear 
and intimidation, pedestrian or cyclist amenity, road user, or pedestrian 
delay, accidents and safety) is no change.  The significance of effect is 
therefore neutral. The extent would be local, the duration short term and 
there would be a low likelihood of occurrence. As this significance of effect 
is below moderate, with reference to paragraph 4.7.4, this is considered to 
be not significant;

Gas Connection  
Construction/Decommissioning 
12.7.20 Section 6 within the TA reports on the typical average construction and 
decommissioning trip generation of the Gas Connection works, with reference 
to the traffic flows identified for earlier, similar, projects. It is assumed that all 
trips made by car would have 1.6 occupants per car, as per the average 
Journey to Work car occupancy within the National Travel Survey.

12.7.23 With respect to the minimum environmental impact thresholds for Pedestrian 
Severance, Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and Intimidation identified in section 
12.5, this assessment has shown that all of these relatively limited construction 
movements are well below the level at which changes can be perceived, and 
are therefore not significant. 
12.7.24 In addition, the relatively minor traffic flows associated with construction 
movements forecast are all below the level at which changes in road user delay 
or accidents and safety can be perceived/measured and are therefore not 
significant. 
12.7.25 The results of the assessment of the potential environmental impact on the 
construction and decommissioning of the Gas Connection are summarised as 
follows: 
 
lack of footways on the B530 – the sensitivity of the receptor is high and the 
magnitude of impact for the categories of effect considered (severance, fear

mitigation this would give a significance of effect of Slight Adverse. 
However, this is fully mitigated by the embedded mitigation measures of a 
footpath diversion implemented for the few days’ duration of the works, and 
the measures detailed in the footpath management plan. The mitigated 
significance of effect is therefore neutral. As this significance of effect is

Operation 
12.7.26 There would be a minimal number of vehicle movements to the Gas 
Connection during the Operational phase (less than 1 per week). These

movements would be intermittent, and would be limited to routine inspection 
and maintenance operations at the AGI.  
12.7.27 As such, no assessment has been undertaken of these movements, as they 
have been scoped out of the assessment as described in section 12.5.  
Electrical Connection

12.7.31 With respect to the minimum environmental impact thresholds for Pedestrian 
Severance, Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and Intimidation identified in Section 
12.5, this assessment has shown that all of these relatively limited construction 
movements are well below the level at which changes can be perceived, and 
are therefore not significant. 
12.7.32 In addition, the relatively minor traffic flows associated with construction 
movements forecast for all Electrical Connection Options are all below the level 
at which changes in road user delay or accidents and safety can be 
perceived/measured and are therefore not significant.   
12.7.33 The results of the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the 
construction and decommissioning of the Electrical Connection are 
summarised as: 
 
lack of footways on Station Lane – the sensitivity of the receptor is high and 
the magnitude of impact for the categories of effect considered (severance, 
fear and intimidation, pedestrian or cyclist amenity, road user or pedestrian 
delay, accidents and safety) is no change. The significance of effect is 
therefore neutral. As this significance of effect is below moderate, with 
reference to paragraph 4.7.4, this is considered to be not significant. The 
extent would be local, the duration short term and there would be a low 
likelihood of occurrence;  


 
users of footpath FP14 during the installation of the Electrical Connection – 
the sensitivity of the receptor is medium and the magnitude of impact for 
the categories of effect (severance, fear and intimidation, pedestrian or 
cyclist amenity) is considered to be negligible, so without mitigation this 
would give a significance of effect of Slight Adverse. However, this is fully

with reference to paragraph 4.7.4, this is considered to be not significant. 
The extent would be local, the duration short term and there would be a low 
likelihood of occurrence. 
Operation 
12.7.34 There would be a minimal number of movements to the Electrical Connection 
during the operational phase. These movements would be intermittent, and 
would be limited to routine inspection and maintenance operations. 
12.7.35 As any impact from the above would be ephemeral, these movements have 
been scoped out of the assessment as per section 12.5.  
12.8 
Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Cumulative Effects 
12.8.1 
Construction, operation (including maintenance) and decommissioning of the 
Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the 
Project Site.   
12.8.2 
The projects which are considered to be of relevance to the cumulative 
assessment have been agreed with CBC and the traffic numbers generated by 
these developments have been built into their predicted future year growth 
forecasts for 2031 (as described above in section 12.6).  
12.8.3 
The requirement for any further Cumulative Effect assessment of the Project 
is considered in the context of  
 
the minimum environmental impact thresholds identified in section 12.5 for: 
- 
Pedestrian Severance (Minor is below 8,000 additional vehicles 
AADT);  
- 
Pedestrian Amenity and Fear and Intimidation (Negligible is less 
than 600 vehicles an hour over an 18-hour day); and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
437 
 
the significance of effect of the Project being identified as being below 
moderate throughout Section 12.7 and therefore this is considered to be 
not significant. 
 
The level of Project-generated traffic is significantly below these thresholds. 
12.8.4 
It is concluded that there are no effects arising from Project-generated traffic 
with the exception of a very short duration peak in construction over 1 to 2 
days.   
12.8.5 
The total cumulative traffic generation anticipated from projects included in the 
2031 baseline assessment are compared in Table 12.23 to the likely traffic 
generation 
from 
the 
Project 
during 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning. Given that the Covanta RRF Project and Broadmead Road 
developments are adjacent to the Project Site, the construction and operational 
periods may overlap, the access routes used may be the same and the same 
roads on the local network may be affected, a direct comparison with only 
those projects is provided. Other projects listed in section 4.10 do not have the 
same localised impact on the local road network as the Project and are 
therefore not considered below in Table 12.23

12.8.6 
As can be seen from Table 12.23, the trip generation from other developments 
is significantly greater than that from the Project. 
12.8.7 
Although the total cumulative traffic movements are above the thresholds for 
pedestrian amenity and fear and intimidation, the small increase in traffic 
movements generated by the Project, together with the relatively low sensitivity 
of the surrounding road network, mean that the addition of the Project makes 
no difference to the level of effect resulting from the "Total Non-Project 
Development (including Covanta)” and therefore the cumulative effect of the 
Project is not significant.    
12.8.8 
The likely worst case potential cumulative effects would arise from the 
operation of Covanta RRF Project (779 vehicles) with the peak in construction 
of the Project (288 vehicles). The CTMP, included within the TA (Appendix 
12.1) provides for a traffic management scheme at the Green Lane level 
crossing taking into account Covanta RRF traffic which would limit any impacts 
so that they are not significant. Key to this traffic management scheme is timing

of construction movements so they do not coincide with the busiest times of 
waste delivery for the Covanta RRF.   
12.8.9 
The Covanta RRF ES concluded that whilst an increase in vehicle movements 
along the A421 and Green Lane would result in a significant increase in terms 
of percentage change for HGVs, traffic levels would remain relatively low in 
absolute terms and as such the traffic levels were deemed to be at an 
acceptable level.  
12.8.10 In terms of driver delay, the Covanta RRF concluded that that there would be 
only a slight increase in delay to drivers during the network peak periods which 
would not be perceivable against the daily fluctuation in vehicle movements. A 
review of the impact in proximity to the Green Lane level crossing has been 
undertaken for both the construction and operational phases demonstrating 
that there will be limited queuing at the access into the RRF site, with no impact 
to the operation of the level crossing.  
12.8.11 The Covanta RRF ES also concluded that although the impact of traffic 
movements in absolute terms is considered low, measures are proposed to 
mitigate the impact to pedestrian and cycle amenity as a result of the increased 
HGV movements. The provisions include a continuous footway route along the 
southern side of Green Lane from Stewartby to Stewartby Lake and Marston 
Vale Millennium Country Park. Measures are also proposed to assist 
pedestrians across Green Lane through the provision of a centre island refuge 
both on the new RRF access road and on Green Lane. 
12.8.12 The new Covanta RRF access arrangement will include widening Green Lane 
within the proximity of the existing access, to facilitate a ghost right turn lane 
arrangement. 
12.8.13 All of the above measures will assist in improving accessibility for both existing 
residents and staff of the Covanta RRF and improve safety for pedestrians 
crossing Green Lane.  
12.8.14 Further to this, the TA (Appendix 12.1) provides an assessment of potential 
impacts on junction capacity taking into consideration the Project cumulatively 
with other proposed projects in the vicinity, (included in CBC 2031 growth 
factor model). Junctions assessed were Green Lane / Project Access Road 
and Bedford Road / Green Lane. This assessment has concluded that the 
impact on the links is shown to be minimal and that the junctions both operate 
well within capacity with minimal queuing or delay. 
12.8.15 Taking the above into consideration, the Project is not anticipated to give rise 
to any significant cumulative effects with other projects in the vicinity of the 
Project Site.   
Effect Interactions 
12.8.16 The Noise modelling (Chapter 7) has been based upon the traffic movements 
predicted as part of the transport assessment work. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
440 
12.8.17 The Air Quality modelling (Chapter 6) has also been based upon the traffic 
movements predicted as part of the transport assessment work. This has 
allowed an assessment to be made in relation to the pollution levels on roads 
used to access the site during both the construction and operational phases 
12.9 
Mitigation and Assessment of Residual Effects 
12.9.1 
No project-specific mitigation is required in addition to the embedded design 
mitigation described in section 3.6. This includes adherence to a CTMP (an 
outline of which is included in Appendices 5.2-5.4 of the TA) which includes for 
the implementation of a contractor's route management plan as well as a traffic 
management scheme at Station Lane and Houghton Lane.   
12.10 
Summary of Residual Effects 
12.10.1 For a very short duration (one to two days) of peak construction activity 
associated with the Generating Equipment, there would be a slight negative 
significance of effect for Pedestrian Amenity on Green Lane which is not 
significant. Notwithstanding, any increase in vehicles as a consequence of the 
Project is still below the threshold identified in Section 12.5 for Pedestrian 
Amenity and Fear and Intimidation, where negligible is less than 600 vehicles 
an hour over an 18-hour day. As such, the Project will not result in any likely 
significant transport-related environmental effects. 
12.10.2 Although some embedded mitigation is proposed to address this short duration 
effect, this may remain as a residual effect.

Conclusions 
12.12.1 This assessment has shown that, with the exception of a short duration (1 to 2 
days) of peak construction activity for the Generating Equipment, the Project will 
not result in any likely significant environmental effects in relation to traffic. 
During this time, there would be a slight adverse significance of effect for 
pedestrian amenity associated with the high sensitivity receptors on Green Lane 
(Kimberley College) but this is considered to be not significant. 
12.12.2 During normal operation of the Project, up to four members of staff would be 
working at the Generating Equipment Site at any one time. Three shifts per day 
are assumed, to provide 24 hour coverage. These shift changes would be timed 
to avoid the network peak hour i.e. morning and evening rush hours, hence the 
highway impact would be minimised. Additionally, there will be infrequent 
maintenance visits by one or two engineers.  
12.12.3 During the annual maintenance of the Generating Equipment, there may be up 
to 40 additional staff on site for a typical maintenance period of one month. It is 
assumed that all these trips would all be made by car, assuming 1.6 occupants 
per car, as per the average Journey to Work car occupancy within the National 
Travel Survey. Reflecting the typical working hours on construction sites, it is 
assumed that majority of these movements would be made outside of the 
network peak. However, in order to provide a robust assessment, it has been 
assumed that up to 25% of these movements would occur at peak times and a 
further 12 HGV movements per day are assumed during maintenance. 
12.12.4 Neither the Gas Connection, nor Electrical Connection will be manned. They will 
have very infrequent service and maintenance visits (less than 1 per week) and 
therefore consideration of the operation and maintenance of the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection were scoped out of the traffic assessment. 
12.12.5 Even during the higher traffic generating periods in the short-term maintenance 
period, all of these operational phase movements are so low that they are well 
below the level at which changes can be perceived, and that they are therefore 
neutral and not significant. 
12.12.6 Therefore, normal operation of the Project is not anticipated to have any likely 
significant effects on the local road network. 
12.12.7 The Project would not result in or contribute to any likely significant cumulative 
or in-combination effects with other developments in the vicinity of the Project 
Site.

Historic Environment 
13.1 
Introduction 
13.1.1 
This Chapter presents the assessment of likely significant effects on the historic 
environment arising from the construction, operation, maintenance and 
decommissioning of the Project. The historic environment includes a wide range 
of features resulting from human intervention in the landscape, varying in scope 
from buried archaeological remains dating from the Palaeolithic (450,000 BC) 
up to late 20th century industrial structures.  The historic environment can be 
divided into the following two categories: 
 Archaeology 
 Scheduled Monuments (SMs) 
 Non-designated archaeological finds and sites 
 Built Heritage 
 Listed Buildings (Grades I, II*, and II) 
 Registered Parks and Gardens (Grades I, II* and II) 
 Conservation Areas. 
 Historic Battlefields 
 Shipwrecks 
 World Heritage Sites 
13.1.2 
Designated heritage assets are defined in Annex 2 of the NPPF as comprising 
World Heritage Sites, scheduled monuments, listed buildings, conservation 
areas, protected wreck sites. Registered parks and gardens and registered 
battlefields.  All other heritage assets (i.e. non-listed buildings, non-scheduled 
archaeological remains, and non-registered battlefields, parks and gardens and 
shipwrecks) are collectively referred to as non-designated heritage assets. 
13.1.3 
The Project has the potential to affect the historic environment due to direct 
(physical) impacts and indirect (visual, odour and/or noise) impacts on the 
setting of assets.  
13.2 
Legislation and Policy Context 
13.2.1

The SoS would expect the 
potential impacts on 
conservation areas to be 
identified and assessed as part 
of the EIA. 
The SoS notes that the proposed 
development involves some 
working of previously unworked 
areas on the project site, and 
recommends that consideration 
is given to whether further 
assessment of the project site is 
required, in consultation with 
relevant Council officers. 
 
The SoS expects to see a 
comprehensive assessment in 
the ES of potential impacts of the 
proposed development on the 
setting of cultural heritage assets 
in the area.  
The results of this assessment 
are provided in paragraph 
13.6.9.  
 
The assessment throughout 
this Chapter has had regard to 
the unworked area of the 
Project Site. As agreed with 
CBC archaeological officer, 
topsoil stripping and recording 
of any finds would be 
undertaken on previously 
unworked areas of the project 
site prior to construction.  
 
The results of this assessment 
are provided in section 13.7 
and Appendix 13.2.

The EIA should deal with the impact 
of the proposal on the remains of 
the Rookery Pit clay pit.  
An assessment has been 
undertaken on the remains 
of the Rookery South Pit in 
section 13.7. 
It is proposed that the baseline 
information for the EIA should be 
collected by means of a desk-based 
assessment, using the relevant 
Institute for Archaeologists' 
standards and guidance document 
as the basis for the assessment.  
The desk based 
assessment (DBA) forms 
an Appendix to the ES 
(Appendix 13.1) and is 
summarised in section 
13.6. It has been prepared 
in accordance with the 
Chartered Institute for 
Archaeology (CIfA) 
guidelines and Historic 
England (2015) The 
Setting of Heritage Assets 
Historic Environment 
Advice in Planning 3.  
Given the potential for this area to 
contain as yet unidentified 
archaeological remains the CBC 
Archaeological Officer considers 
that the collection of baseline 
information on archaeology for the 
gas and electrical connections 
should include an archaeological 
field evaluation comprising 
geophysical survey and trial 
trenching of the selected connection 
routes.  
Consultations have been 
undertaken with the CBC 
Archaeological Officer who 
has confirmed that instead 
of a programme 
geophysical survey and 
trial trenching of the Gas 
and electrical Connections, 
mitigation in the form of an 
archaeological strip, map 
and sample of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections can 
be undertaken as a pre-
commencement 
Requirement of the DCO 
(Correspondence with the 
CBC Archaeological Officer 
regarding this is included 
as Appendix 13.3). This 
has been included in the 
draft DCO that has is 
submitted with the 
Application.  
The Environmental Statement 
should contain sufficient visual 
information to be able to assess the 
impact on the setting of assets 
including from the monuments and 
into them from a variety of locations, 
including view sites on the 
Greensand Ridge from the northern 
edge of the Marston Vale.  
An assessment of the 
potential effects of the 
Project on the setting of 
cultural heritage assets is 
provided in section 13.7 
and Appendix 13.2. Further 
assessment of visual 
amenity within the Zone of 
Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) 
is provided in Chapter 11.

The wider project area has the 
potential to contain so far 
unidentified archaeological sites and 
features dating from the prehistoric 
period. The proposed development 
site is also located within the setting 
of a number of Scheduled 
Monuments  
In relation to designated heritage 
assets, the need for photomontages 
taken from LVIA locations 3, 4, 5 
and 9 was confirmed.  
 
Construction of the gas and 
electrical connections has the 
potential to affect as yet unrecorded 
archaeological. The Archaeology 
Team’s earlier comments remains 
as was the requirement for 
archaeological field evaluation to 
provide information on the location, 
extent and character of any 
archaeological remains that will be 
affected.  
 
The details of proposed mitigation 
will need to be agreed with the 
Authority 
 
The baseline conditions for 
non-designated heritage 
assets were  assessed for 
a study area of extending 1 
km in radius from the 
Project Site boundary and 
are reported in detail in an 
archaeological desk based 
assessment (see Appendix 
13.1)   The findings of the 
desk based assessment 
are summarised in section 
13.6.   
Scheduled Monuments 
were assessed within a 
study area of 5 km radius 
from the Project Site (see 
section 13.5 and Appendix 
13.2). 
 
Photomontages have been 
produced from viewpoints 
close or at these locations 
and are contained in 
Document Reference 7.2. 
 
Consultations have been 
undertaken with the CBC 
Archaeological Officer who 
has confirmed that instead 
of a programme of 
geophysical survey and 
trial trenching of the Gas 
and Electrical Connections, 
mitigation in the form of an 
archaeological strip, map 
and sample of the Gas and 
Electrical Connection can 
be undertaken as pre-

In response to discussions 
regarding the scope of 
archaeological mitigation work, a 
summary of CBC’s response stated 
that  
“strip map and sample of the 
selected pipeline routes ahead of 
construction may be the most 
effective way of dealing with the 
archaeological impact of the 
pipeline, and indeed the pylon 
bases”. 
  
 
In light of the consultation 
with the CBC 
Archaeological Officer who 
has confirmed that instead 
of a programme of 
geophysical survey and 
trial trenching of the Gas 
and Electrical Connections, 
mitigation in the form of an 
archaeological strip, map 
and sample of the Gas and 
Electrical Connection can 
be undertaken as a pre-
commencement 
Requirement of the DCO.  
This has been included in 
the draft DCO that has is 
submitted with the 
Application.

There is a need for a range of 
heritage specific photomontages, 
and that we would appreciate some 
additional views from those 
presented in the PIER report. 
Primarily it would be the views from 
Houghton House that are likely to be 
most important, but also Ampthill 
Park House which is Grade II* and 
the Scheduled Monument in 
Ampthill Park. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are also potentially some 
views from Millbrook Church, in 
particular from the graveyard at the 
base of the tower 
 
An updated suite of 
photomontages have been 
prepared as part of the 
Landscape and Visual 
Impact assessment and 
are presented in the ES. 
They  cover Houghton 
House (Viewpoints 4 and 
5) and Ampthill Park and 
House (Viewpoints 3 and 
7). These have been 
prepared in consultation 
between the heritage team 
and landscape team to 
ensure that effects can be 
understood from both an 
LVIA and historic setting 
perspective. They have 
been agreed with CBC. An 
assessment of 
photomontages undertaken 
has informed this 
assessment. They are 
presented in Document 
Reference 7.2. 
 
Millbrook Church was 
visited as part of the site 
assessment but it was 
concluded that there were 
no clear views of the 
Project Site to warrant a 
separate photomontage. 
The assessment of 
Millbrook Church is

HE have concerns over the PEIR 
method; the sensitivity matrix (table 
4.1) categorises heritage assets as 
medium sensitivity however, HE 
consider the assessed heritage sites 
to be of high sensitivity 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HE do not agree that the grading of 
a building reflects the contribution of 
setting to its significance.  The 
heritage impact conclusions should 
consider the effects on significance 
of heritage assets as opposed to the 
effects on the setting which makes a 
contribution to the significance of the 
Heritage asset 
  
Effects on heritage assets need to 
be considered in terms of levels of 
harm in accordance with the NPPF. 
 
 
 
Efforts should be made to ensure 
that assets are properly assessed 
including securing private access to 
undertake the assessment if 
required. 
 
 
Table 4.1 is provided in the 
introductory sections of the 
ES to illustrate ‘example’ 
matrices, the type of which 
would be used in the 
technical ES chapters. 
However, Chapter 4 also 
states that these matrices 
would be refined 
accordingly in each topic 
chapter.  Table 13.2 
already categorises 
heritage assets accordingly 
(including those considered 
to be high sensitivity). 
Table 4.1 has also been 
amended to reflect this.  
 
 
 
 
 
The assessment presented 
in Appendix 13.2 has been 
refined and it has now 
been made clearer that 
assessments are based on 
the specific factors and 
attributes of each asset 
and not on their grading 
alone.   
 
 
Effects on heritage assets 
are and will be considered 
in terms of levels of harm 
in accordance with the 
NPPF. 
 
MPL considers that 
following best practice 
guidance (e.g. GLVIA 3) 
and taking views from 
publicly accessible 
locations did not lead to 
any limitations to the 
assessment of the 
designated assets or their 
setting, as a full 
assessment of the 
significance and setting of 
the assets (including how 
setting contributes to the

it is considered that there is likely to 
be notable harm to the significance 
of Ampthill Park, Park House and 
Houghton House through a 
development within their setting. 
 
 
 
 
The cumulative impact of both 
projects (RRF and MPL) on the 
significance of heritage assets, in 
particular Park House, Ampthill Park 
and Houghton House, is likely to be 
harmful. 
 
Photomontages and visualisations 
are of insufficient quality and date

significance of the assets) 
was possible on this basis 
(Appendix 13.2). This is 
therefore considered to be 
a reasonable approach, 
and the views were 
sufficient for undertaking a 
robust assessment of the 
assets. 
 
 
 
A full assessment of these 
assets is provided in 
Appendix 13.2 and 
summarised in section 
13.7. Taking into 
consideration the 
photomontages, and 
landscape, topography and 
intervening vegetation, we 
do not anticipate significant 
harm on these assets.  
 
 
A cumulative assessment 
is presented in section 13.8 
and Appendix 13.2.  
 
 
 
A full suite of 
photomontages is 
presented in Document 
Reference 7.1 which date 
from 2017. A high 
resolution copy has been 
sent to HE.  
 
 
It is considered that 
Viewpoint 4 (Document 
Reference 7.1) provides a 
sufficient view to assess 
effects on Houghton 
House. Marston Moretaine 
Church is outside of the 
ZTV therefore there is no 
scope for intervisibility and

no effects on the church 
are anticipated. A view 
from the eastern edge of 
Marston Moretaine (VP 8 
presented in Document 
Reference 7.1) shows that 
there is no intervisibility 
between the church and 
the Project Site. The view 
from Ampthill Park House 
is recognised and 
acknowledged in the 
assessment in Appendix 
13.2; Viewpoint 7 is taken 
from the Public Right of 
Way at the front of the 
house and is considered to 
provide a sufficient view. 
Photomontages constitute 
tools to illustrate an 
assessment, they do not 
constitute the assessment. 
The assessor has been to 
site, considered the 
position from a number of 
locations and set out a full 
assessment in Appendix 
13.2. The Photomontages 
are provided for context to 
the reader, they are not (in 
themselves) the 
assessment. 
 
The effects of the Project 
taken as a whole (including 
the stack and the SECs 
together) are described in 
in section 13.10.

The terminology used and therefore

This chapter now uses 
terminology which is 
consistent with the NPPF 
(Section 13.7).  
 
in relation to Wootton Cons 
Area, there is no 
intervisibility between the 
Project and the 
CA.  Therefore, there will 
be no visible effect on the 
CA.  The project does lie 
within 2km but the setting 
of the CA does not extend 
as far as the project in 
terms of providing a 
positive or negative 
contribution to the 
significance of the 
CA.  There is likely to have 
been some historic socio-
economic connection 
between the CA and the 
pits as some of the 
village’s population may 
have worked there, but this 
is not affected by the 
project and also is an a 
very minor contributor to 
the CA’s significance.  
In relation to Stewartby, as 
with Wootton, the CA is 
outside of the ZTV so there 
will be no visual change 
within the setting.  The 
element of the scheme that 
could have some 
theoretical impact on the 
significance of the CA (i.e. 
the power generation plant, 
is relatively distant from the 
CA.  As with Wootton, 
there will have been a 
historic socio-economic 
connection with the pits 
within which the generation 
plant is located but 
presence of the project will 
not affect this.  Therefore,

It is also noted that the 12m width of

consideration.

core strategy policies CP23 and 
CP21 are also not consistently 
referred to in both these legislation 
sections. 
there is no effect on the 
significance of the CA.  
 
We consider that we have 
fully assessed the effect on 
the Stewartby chimneys 
and have taken into 
account the height and 
width differential in section 
13.7 and Appendix 13.2. 
Additionally, text in the ES 
has been amended so that 
it no longer suggests that 
the stack would be a 
similar character to the 
chimneys. 
 
This was an omission in 
the PEIR.   The policies 
were used in the 
assessment and have 
been added in to section 
13.2.  
13.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
13.4.1 
In respect of the historic environment, the realistic worst case scenario from 
within the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Chapters 3 and 
5 of this ES) is to assume that the Power Generation Plant will have a 35m high 
stack.  
13.4.2 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case is that a larger stack 
height will increase the magnitude of visual (and therefore setting) effects as the 
Power Generation Plant will be more prominent and will be visible over a larger 
geographical area.

13.5.2 
The following study areas have been chosen for the heritage impact 
assessment.  These study areas have been selected based on professional 
judgment and experience of potential likely significant direct and indirect effects 
likely to arise from the Project. They have been agreed as appropriate with CBC: 
 
The inner study area - A radius of 1 km from the boundary of the Project Site 
which has been used for assessing direct (physical) effects on non-
designated archaeological heritage assets;   
 
The wider study area - A radius of 5 km from the boundary of the Project Site 
which has been used for assessing indirect (primarily visual) effects on 
Scheduled Monuments, Grade I and Grade II* Listed Buildings, Conservation 
Areas and Registered Parks and Gardens.  The Zone of Theoretical Visibility 
defined in Chapter 11 was used to screen out designated assets that will 
have no intervisibility with the Project; and   
 
A radius of 2 km from the boundary of the Project Site which has been used 
for assessing indirect (visual) effects on Grade II Listed Buildings. The ZTV 
for the stack was used to screen out designated assets that will have no 
intervisibility with the Project.  
13.5.3 
The 1 km radius study area for non-designated heritage assets was used so as 
to enable the archaeological background of an area wider than just the Project 
Site to be established so as to better understand the potential for as yet 
unrecorded remains within the Project Site. 
13.5.4 
The majority of grade II listed buildings within the study area are situated within 
villages in the area surrounding the Project Site and, in general, have localised 
settings within the built up areas within which they are located, which do not 
have a strong interaction with the surrounding countryside.  For the purposes of 
this assessment consideration of Grade II listed buildings, where their wider 
setting is generally a less sensitive part of their significance, has been limited to 
2 km.  Beyond this distance, given the nature of the surrounding landscape, it is 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
463 
 
not considered that the presence of the Project would affect the significance of 
these buildings. 
13.5.5 
Beyond a distance of 2 km these factors are considered to reduce the potential 
for impact of the Project on the settings of listed buildings. For the purposes of 
this assessment consideration of Grade II listed buildings, where setting is 
generally a less sensitive part of their significance, has been limited to 2 km.  
Beyond this distance, given the nature of the surrounding landscape, it is not 
considered that the presence of the Project would affect the significance of these 
buildings. 
13.5.6 
Therefore, only those Grade II listed buildings within 2 km have been considered 
in detail. The data for all Grade II listed buildings within 5 km has however been 
collected, plotted and reviewed to identify any buildings of this grade beyond 2 
km that are considered to have a highly sensitive setting.   
13.5.7 
The wider (5km) study area is shown on Figure 13.1.  
 
The following data sources have been used in this assessment: 
 
Central Bedfordshire Historic Environment Record (HER), to provide details 
on known archaeology in the inner study area; 
 
National Monuments Record to provide details on known archaeology in the 
inner study area;  
 
Historic cartographic and documentary sources at the Bedfordshire records 
office;  
 
British Library;  
 
Unpublished material from recent archaeological investigations in the wider 
study area; and  


13.5.8 A desk based assessment was undertaken in accordance with the Chartered 
Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) guidelines (2017) The Setting of Heritage 
Assets Historic Environment Advice in Planning 3, along with site walkovers in 
2014 and 2017. The desk based assessment is included as Appendix 13.1.   
13.5.9 All designated assets within the study areas and also within the ZTV were visited 
in 2014 and 2017 in order to assess both the building/archaeological 
site/structure and also their setting.   This has been supplemented by 
consultations with interested parties, expert advice and professional judgment. 
13.5.10 In order to assess the indirect effects of the Project, the ZTV, together with 
fieldwork observations and professional judgment were used. The results of 
these assessments are presented in Appendix 13.2.  
13.5.11 The factors taken into account in assessing the extent of the setting of each 
heritage asset and whether, how and to what degree the setting makes a 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
464 
 
contribution to the significance of each designated heritage asset are taken from 
Planning Note 3 - The Setting of Heritage Assets (Historic England 2015). 
13.5.12 In all cases, the various levels of predicted effects have been defined in 
accordance with the scales of change provided in Tables 13.2 - 13.4 below.   
Significance Criteria 
Sensitivity 
13.5.13 The sensitivity of each type of heritage asset and its setting is defined using the 
descriptions in Table 13.2, although it is recognised that occasionally sites can 
have a higher level of sensitivity in a local context, and vice versa.  The categories 
have been devised using professional judgement and experience with similar 
Projects. The contribution that the setting of a heritage asset makes to its 
significance may vary within the setting and will also vary between heritage 
assets as laid out in Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 
3 - The Setting of Heritage Assets (Historic England 2015).

Magnitude of impact 
13.5.15 Magnitude of impact is a measure of the degree to which the significance of a 
heritage asset (e.g. national, regional or local significance) will be increased or 
diminished by a proposed development such as the Project. In determining the 
magnitude of impact, the asset’s significance is first established. This allows the 
identification of the key features of the heritage asset and its setting, and provides 
the baseline against which the magnitude of change can be assessed with the 
magnitude of impact being proportional to the degree of change in the asset’s 
baseline significance.  The assessment of magnitude also takes into account the 
contribution that setting makes to the significance of the asset.

Definition  
Major  
 
Total or substantial loss of the significance of a heritage asset. 
 
Substantial harm to a heritage asset's setting, such that the significance of the 
asset would be totally lost or substantially reduced (e.g. the significance of a 
designated heritage asset would be reduced to such a degree that its 
designation would be questionable or the significance of an undesignated 
heritage asset would be reduced to such a degree that its categorisation as a 
heritage asset would be questionable). 
Moderate 
 
Partial loss or alteration of the significance of a heritage asset. 
 
Harm to a heritage asset’s setting, such that the asset's significance would be 
materially affected, but not totally or substantially lost. 
Minor  
 
Slight loss of the significance of a heritage asset.  This could include the removal 
of fabric that forms part of the heritage asset, but that is not integral to its 
significance (e.g. the demolition of later extensions/additions of little intrinsic 
value). 
 
Some harm to the heritage asset’s setting, but not to the degree that it would 
materially compromise the significance of the heritage asset. 
 
Perceivable level of harm, but insubstantial relative to the overall interest of the 
heritage asset.   
Negligible  
 
A very slight change to a heritage asset.  This could include a change to a part of 
a heritage asset that does not materially contribute to its significance. 
 
Very minor change to a heritage asset’s setting such that there is a slight impact 
not materially affecting the heritage asset’s significance. 
No Change 
 
No change to a heritage asset or its setting. 
Significance of Effect 
13.5.16 The sensitivity of the receiving environment, together with the magnitude of 
impact, defines the significance of the effect (Table 13.4).  Where there is scope 
for two levels of impact (e.g. major/moderate), professional judgement has been 
used in the assessment as to the level of impact arising.

13.5.17 Effects of moderate or above are considered significant in terms of the EIA 
Regulations unless otherwise stated. However, professional judgement is also 
used in judging the significance of effects.  
13.5.18 The judgement of the significance of effects takes in to consideration the impact 
on the heritage asset’s significance (as defined in Appendix 2 of the NPPF).  For 
designated assets, it is the magnitude of impact on the heritage significance of 
the asset that is being considered.  As part of this assessment, the impact on 
the contribution that the setting of a heritage asset makes to its significance is 
also considered.  The nature of the contribution that the setting of an assets 
makes to its heritage significance varies from asset to asset (i.e. the setting of 
some assets have a greater contribution to the significance and vice versa).  
Consequently, where there are effects from the Project on the setting of an asset 
that has only a limited contribution to the significance of that asset, the effect on 
the significance of the asset itself may be very limited or even potentially non-
existent.  Where a heritage asset has a setting that has a large contribution to 
the significance of that asset, effects on the significance of the asset itself will 
be greater.

Items scoped out of assessment 
Historic Landscape  
13.5.20 The landscape in the vicinity of the Project Site has been substantially modified 
with the introduction of modern structures such as pylons, a substantial amount 
of new housing development and the Rookery North and South Pits.  
Introduction of the Project will not result in the loss of significant historical 
landscape features. Although partial removal of hedgerows will be required 
during construction of the Gas Connection and some trees will require removal 
during construction of the Electrical Connection, these are not classed as 
‘important’ hedgerows and none of the trees are subject to tree preservation 
orders. The potential effects on historic landscapes has therefore not been 
considered further in this Assessment. However, the historic landscape setting 
of designated assets has been considered where appropriate in section 13.7 
and Appendix 13.2.  
13.6 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
13.6.1 
The locations of designated assets considered in the assessment are presented 
on Figure 13.1. The locations of non-designated heritage assets within the 1km 
inner study area are presented on Figure 13.2. 
13.6.2 
The future baseline (prior to construction of the Project assumes that the LLRS 
works as outlined in section 3.1) have been implemented.   
Power Generation Plant  
13.6.3 
A map regression exercise was undertaken as part of the archaeological desk 
based assessment, (included in Appendix 13.1).  However, in summary, the 
Power Generation Plant is depicted on historic maps as being agricultural fields 
until the 1970s when the Rookery Pits are first shown. The remains of the former 
conveyor lines still survive in the north-west of Rookery North Pit, mainly 
evidenced by concrete plinths along the former route, but also as a conveyor 
bridge crossing over the railway line close to Green Lane in Rookery North Pit.   
By 1988-89 Rookery North and South Pits were both disused.

The descriptions below summarise the archaeological and built heritage assets 
within the inner and wider study areas in the vicinity of the Power Generation 
Plant.  
Non-designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.5 
Crop marks of four circles and oblongs east of Pillinge Farm were noted within 
the Power Generation Plant Site in 1974.  However, when re-examined in 2009, 
there were no traces of these features and they have been discounted as being 
of any archaeological interest.  Furthermore, these features are recorded as 
being within Rookery South Pit and consequently, will have been destroyed 
during clay extraction operations. No other features or structures of 
archaeological or historic interest have been recorded on the Bedfordshire HER 
within the Power Generation Plant Site, representative of the fact that the 
majority of it is located within a former clay extraction pit.  However, it is 
recognised that the Rookery South Pit which, although not recorded on the HER, 
could be considered as a non-designated heritage asset of local significance, 
and has been raised as such by statutory consultees due to its socio-economic 
interest related to the former clay extraction industry of the area.

Designated Assets 
13.6.7 
A review of the National Heritage List for England confirmed that there are no 
designated heritage assets within the Power Generation Plant Site. Tables 13.5-
13.9 list the designated assets within the wider (5km) study area.  All designated 
heritage assets are considered to be of high sensitivity, although their settings 
may not necessarily be as sensitive to change (i.e. direct physical change) as 
the assets themselves.

13.6.8 
Of the designated heritage assets in the wider study area, there is one Grade I 
listed building (1321465 Ruins of Houghton House), one grade II* listed building 
(1137595 Ampthill Park House), eight grade II listed buildings (1158024 South 
Pillinge Farmhouse; 1321648 Millbrook Station; 1392357 Two kilns and four 
chimneys at Stewartby Brickworks; 1113921 16 & 17 How End Road; 1114416 
Statue of hound at Ampthill Park House; 1311682 Lower Roxhill Farmhouse; 
1321647 Roxhill Manor House & 1249331 Wood Farmhouse), three scheduled 
monuments (1013522 Houghton House; 1009630 Ampthill Castle & 1012317 
Long Barrow 350m SE of Bury Farm), one registered park and garden (1000378 
Ampthill Park) and two Conservation Areas (Ampthill and Stewartby).  These 
assets are all within the ZTV and there is therefore the potential for effects 
arising from the Project on the setting of these assets.  Appendix 13.2 presents 
a detailed assessment of the significance and setting of each of these assets 
and effects of the Project upon the significance of the assets.   
13.6.9 
Figure 13.1 shows the designated assets within the study area that are outside 
of the ZTV. As these assets are outside of the ZTV, the Project can have no 
effect upon them, and therefore effects on these assets will not be assessed in 
this Chapter.  One other scheduled monument, Ampthill Castle, is essentially 
outside of the ZTV with only its very northern edge being within the ZTV.  This 
has been included in the assessment but will be considered as part of Ampthill 
Park within which it is located.

13.6.11 There are five Conservation Areas within the wider study area: 
 
Three of these (Millbrook, Maulden & Wootton) are outside of the ZTV. 
Millbrook is located c. 1.8km to the south of the Project.  The setting of the 
Conservation Area in the direction of the Project comprises agricultural fields.  
The way that views open up at the northern part of the Conservation Area is 
an important aspect of its setting.  However, the Conservation Area and the 
area to the north of it are outside of the ZTV and so there would be no effects 
upon it.  Maulden is located 4.7 km to the south east of the Power Generation 
Plant and the lack of intervisibility due to intervening topography and distance 
mean that no aspects of its setting and significance could be impacted upon.  
Furthermore, it is outside of the ZTV.  Wootton Conservation Area lies c. 4.1 
km to the north west of the Project.  The setting of the Conservation Area is 
considered to extend over the surrounding fields and the modern housing to 
the east and north of the area.  It is not considered to extend as far as the 
Power Generation Plant Site. 
 
Stewartby Conservation Area is located 1.4 km to the north east at its nearest 
point to the Power Generation Plant Site.  It has no intervisibility with the 
Project except for a small sliver of the south eastern corner of the 
Conservation Area which is a small area of open space.  It is also separated 
in the direction of the Power Generation Plant by Rookery North Pit and is 
located too far away from the Power Generation Plant for the non-visual 
aspects of its setting to be impacted upon 
13.6.12 Consequently, these four assets have not been assessed in detail as there will 
be no potential for impacts or effects on their settings. 
13.6.13  The majority of Ampthill Conservation Area to the south east is outside of the 
ZTV, with the north western edge that is within Ampthill Park being the only part 
within the ZTV.

Gas Connection  
13.6.15 Land on which the majority of the Gas Connection is situated is agricultural, and 
has remained undeveloped according to the earliest historical mapping data.  
Non-designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.16 A pair of parallel linear crop marks which are crossed by a single linear crop 
mark have been recorded within the Gas Connection.   Archaeological 
investigations (trial trenching) have been undertaken in the vicinity of the Gas 
Connection in relation to an unrelated previous proposed development. The 
archaeological evaluation did not reveal archaeological remains despite the 
results of the crop marks recorded within the area (see Appendix 13.1).    
13.6.17 An archaeological assessment of the Gas Connection has been undertaken 
which considers heritage assets within the Gas Connection and the inner and 
wider study areas in detail.  The archaeological potential of the Gas Connection 
is summarised below.

be of local significance.    
Designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.19 There are no designated heritage assets within the Gas Connection.  
Designated assets in the wider study area are set out in Tables 13.5 – 13.9. 
Electrical Connection 
Non-designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.20 A number of crop marks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the Electrical Connection.  Archaeological investigations have been 
undertaken in the northern part of the Electrical Connection in relation to the 
unrelated previous proposed development. This comprised the excavation of a 
number of trial trenches which revealed the remains of an enclosed late Iron 
Age/Roman settlement and a possible prehistoric settlement either side of a 
former stream channel (Appendix 13.1). The putative line of a Roman road 
crosses north west to south east across the south western part of the Electrical 
Connection. 
13.6.21 A number of crop marks are identified from aerial photographs as representing 
prehistoric and Romano-British settlement sites on the HER within the study 
area (4469 & 9077). However, the recent archaeological evaluation in the 
Electrical Connection did not record any correlation between the plotted crop 
marks and excavated features, suggesting at least some of the crop marks in 
the area are non-archaeological in origin.  
13.6.22 The crop mark of an isolated ring ditch on the top of a small hillock is recorded 
in the south-west edge of the Electrical Connection, adjacent to the Millbrook 
Proving Ground (MNN16566).

Connection (17715).   
13.6.24 A possible medieval moated site is recorded immediately north-west of the study 
site at Pillinge Farm South, represented by a square arrangement of ditches 
surrounding an orchard (3270).

13.6.26 Should any as yet unrecorded archaeological features be present within the 
Electrical Connection, based on the data contained in the Bedford and Central

likely to be of local significance.  The draft DCO proposes a pre-commencement 
archaeological requirement.  
Designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.27 There are no designated heritage assets or assets of demonstrable equivalence 
with designated heritage assets within the Electrical Connection.  Heritage 
assets in the wider study area are set out in Tables 13.5 – 13.9.  
13.7 
Assessment of Effects 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction / Decommissioning 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
475 
 
13.7.1 
The following assessment of effects takes into account the embedded mitigation 
as outlined in Chapter 3 section 3.6. 
13.7.2 
Due to the majority of the Power Generation Plant being located within a former 
clay extraction pit, there are no designated or non-designated archaeological 
heritage assets within the Power Generation Plant site.  Therefore, the Power 
Generation Plant will have no direct physical impacts upon heritage assets as 
there are none present.  The clay extraction processes would have removed any 
heritage assets that may have been located within the area of the Power 
Generation Plant and consequently it is considered that there is no scope for as 
yet undiscovered remains to be encountered. 
13.7.3 
The Generating Equipment, Laydown Area and part of the Access Road is 
located within Rookery South Pit which is a non-designated heritage asset of 
local significance as described in section 13.6.  The Project's construction will 
have a direct impact on Rookery South Pit, although it is considered to be an 
asset of low heritage sensitivity. The majority of Rookery South Pit will be 
unaffected by the construction of the Project and consequently, there will be no 
change outside of the footprint of the Power Generation Plant.  Therefore, there 
is judged to be a minor impact on the Rookery Pit overall resulting in a ‘slight’ 
significance of effect. The attribute importance of the Rookery Pit remaining 
essentially unaffected. 
13.7.4 
The impacts of the construction / decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant on built heritage assets will be of a comparable nature to those occurring 
at the operational and maintenance stage, albeit of a much shorter duration.  
That is, there will be the temporary presence of tall structures such as cranes 
both during construction and during decommissioning. Therefore, the predicted 
effects of construction activities are broadly similar to those assessed in 
operational impacts (see below) and have not been repeated here. 
13.7.5 
South Pillinge Farm Grade II listed building, which is the only designated 
heritage asset located in close proximity to the Project, is therefore, the only 
heritage asset that could theoretically be affected by noise or dust during 
construction.  However, there will be no change resulting from noise and dust 
during construction due to the implementation of measures outlined in the CEMP 
(Appendix 3.2). This will result in a neutral effect. 
Operation (including maintenance) 
13.7.6 
As any non-designated remains that may have been located within the area of 
the Pwer Generation Plant will have been destroyed by the former clay 
ectraction activities, there will be no operational and maintenance impacts on 
non-designated heritage assets. 
13.7.7 
The operation and maintenance of the Power Generation Plant will potentially 
have indirect impacts on the setting of designated assets within the wider study 
area.  That is, the stack of the Generating Equipment may be experienced 
visually within the settings of designated assets and consequently may have an 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
476 
 
effect on the contribution that the settings have to the significance of those 
assets.  The impacts on designated assets as outlined in paragraphs 13.6.8 to 
13.6.12, are considered in detail in Appendix 13.2. However, in summary, the 
stack of the Generating Equipment is considered to have no more than a 
moderate adverse indirect effect on the setting of any of the assets, and for the 
majority of assets, there will be a neutral indirect effect. The designated heritage 
assets which the Power Generation Plant will have a moderate indirect effect 
upon are South Pillinge Farm (II), Park House (II*), Ampthill Park and Houghton 
House (SAM and Grade I). Although utilising the matrices in Tables 13.2 – 13.4, 
the effect of the scheme comes out as being moderate, the effect is not 
considered to be significant in EIA terms.  The reason for this is that in each 
case the core of the significance of the assets is unaffected.  The element of the 
assets that is affected is part of their setting which in each case does have a 
positive contribution to the significance.  However, the Project will be at a relative 
distance from Houghton House and Ampthill Park House and only occupy a 
small section of the setting to the NW of both assets (i.e. a large part of the 
setting is unaffected in any way).  Therefore, when the setting and its 
contribution to the significance of the assets are considered in the round, while 
there is an effect due to the change within the wider landscape setting of the 
assets, this change does not materially reduce the significance of the assets.  
Therefore, once professional judgement is taken into account, the effect on the 
significance of these assets is considered to be minor.   
13.7.8 
The stack is of a similar nature to existing structures in the vicinity (i.e. Marston 
Vale wind turbine, Stewartby chimneys and electricity pylons).  That is, it would 
be a tall industrial structure visible from a distance.  The stack will appear to be 
significantly lower in height and slightly wider than the other tall structures in the 
vicinity as it is located within Rookery South Pit, with only a maximum of 20 m 
visible above ground level.  Consequently, its appearance will be subservient to 
the existing structures and also it will be in keeping both visually and in nature 
and function to the other existing structures in the vicinity.   
13.7.9 
Any effects will be experienced only during the lifetime of the Project and the 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant will remove any effects that the 
stack may have on the settings of designated heritage assets. 
Gas Connection 
Construction / Decommissioning 
13.7.10 The construction / decommissioning of the Gas Connection will have no physical 
impacts on any designated heritage assets.  The construction and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection will be relatively short lived activity.  
Although machinery and construction activity may be possible from some of the 
designated assets, this activity will transitory and also at a distance and 
therefore will have an extremely limited visual effect which will disappear once 
the construction/decommissioning works cease.  Therefore, there will also be no 
impacts on the settings or significance of any designated heritage assets.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
477 
 
13.7.11 In terms of non-designated assets, the Gas Connection lies in an area that is 
considered to have potential to contain the crop marks of a possible Romano-
British settlement (HER4469) and other as yet unrecorded below-ground 
archaeological features that may be present.  The recent archaeological 
evaluation in the vicinity of the Gas Connection referred to in section 13.6 did 
not record any correlation between the plotted crop marks and excavated 
features, suggesting the crop marks were non-archaeological in origin 
(Appendix 13.1).  Consequently, it is considered that any archaeological 
features located within the Gas Connection will be isolated and fragmentary and 
no more than low sensitivity and local significance.  
13.7.12 The excavation for the trench required to install the Pipeline and its easement 
will result in the removal of any archaeological features within the extent of the 
excavation area.  Should archaeological features be present within the Gas 
Connection, they are considered likely to be of no more than low sensitivity and 
local significance and could be more extensive than the width of the excavation 
area required for the Pipeline and its easement. Therefore, as non-designated 
remains within the area will at the worst be only be partially affected, it is 
considered that at worst if archaeological features are present there will be a 
moderate magnitude of impact (i.e. partial loss of significance) resulting in a 
slight adverse effect.   
13.7.13 The decommissioning of the Gas Connection is not anticipated to have any 
effects on designated and non-designated heritage assets as the Pipeline is 
expected to be left in situ and therefore, there will be no ground works that could 
impact on archaeological remains. If any of the structures associated with the 
AGI are removed, there will be no impacts on non-designated assets as the 
mitigation measures outlined below will have resulted in them being fully 
excavated and recorded before construction has begun.  Consequently, there 
will be no archaeological features surviving that could be impacted by 
decommissioning resulting in a neutral effect. 
Operation (including maintenance) 
13.7.14 Operation of the Gas Connection will not impact on any buried non-designated 
heritage assets. Given that the Gas Connection will be mainly buried, it will not 
have any impacts on above ground heritage assets. The AGI will be a relatively 
small structure, screened by vegetation. The Gas Connection is not located 
within the setting of any designated heritage assets.  Consequently, there will 
be no impacts on the significance of any designated or non-designated heritage 
assets resulting in neutral effects.  
Electrical Connection 
Construction / Decommissioning 
13.7.15 The construction / decommissioning of the Electrical Connection will have no 
physical impacts on any designated heritage assets.  The construction and 
decommissioning of the Electrical Connection will be relatively short lived 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
478 
 
activity.  Although machinery and construction activity may be possible from 
some of the designated assets, this activity will transitory and also at a distance 
and therefore will have an extremely limited visual effect which will disappear 
once the construction/decommissioning works cease.  Therefore, there will be 
no impacts on the settings or significance of any designated heritage assets. 
13.7.16 The Electrical Connection is located in an area that is known to contain the 
remains of a Romano-British settlement at the northern end close to the Rookery 
South Pit (Appendix 13.1).  It is also considered to have potential to contain as 
yet unrecorded non-designated assets. As any non-designated heritage assets 
will be of a nature that is relatively common within the area, these remains are 
considered to be of low sensitivity and of local significance.   
13.7.17 The excavation for the trench required to install the Electrical Connection and 
its easement will result in the removal of any archaeological features within the 
extent of the excavation area.  Where archaeological features are known or 
suspected to be present within the Electrical Connection, they are considered 
likely to be of no more than low sensitivity and could be more extensive than the 
width of the required excavation area.  Therefore, as any non-designated 
remains within the area will at the worst be only be partially affected, it is 
considered that there will be a moderate magnitude of impact (i.e. partial loss of 
significance) which will result in a slight adverse effect. 
13.7.18 The decommissioning of the Electrical Connection is not anticipated to have any 
effects on designated and non-designated heritage assets as the underground 
cables are expected to be left in situ and therefore, there will be no ground works 
that could impact on archaeological remains. 
Operation (including maintenance) 
13.7.19 Operation of the Electrical Connection will not impact on any buried non-
designated heritage assets. Given that the Electrical Connection will be mainly 
buried or located within Rookery South Pit, there will not be any impacts on 
above ground heritage assets. Consequently, there will be no impacts on the 
significance of any designated or non-designated heritage assets.  
13.8 
Cumulative and in Combination Effects 
Overview 
13.8.1 
Construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
section 4.10.  However, the majority of these developments are distant from the 
Project Site (greater than 2 km). 
13.8.2 
These developments and any effects arising from them are outside the area for 
this topic within which significant effects could occur during construction (e.g. 
loss of or damage to designated or non-designated assets).  As such it is 
considered that no cumulative or in combination effects are likely to arise on the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
479 
 
historic environment during the construction or decommissioning phases of the 
Project.  
13.8.3 
Furthermore, each of these developments, which have or will have gone through 
the planning system, will be bound by its own CEMP and will apply best practice 
construction methods so as to minimise impacts on the historic environment.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
13.8.4 
The projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects assessment 
for this chapter (taken from section 4.10) are therefore: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
13.8.5 
The construction of both the Project and other projects at the same time 
represents the greatest potential for creating cumulative effects on non-
designated heritage assets is therefore judged to be a realistic worst case 
scenario for cumulatively assessing construction impacts. Any other scenario 
(e.g. operation of one scheme and constriction of the other) would generate less 
direct ground disturbance and therefore lower impacts.  
13.8.6 
Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery South Pit. At present, a request for a 
scoping opinion has been submitted by the promoter of the project although no 
details are provided regarding potential impacts on the historic environment as 
a result of the project. However, it is likely that this development will be bound 
by its own CEMP and best practice construction methods so as to limit impacts 
on the historic environment during construction and decommissioning. Should it 
go ahead, then it will need to consider the Project to ensure that no significant 
cumulative effects will arise between it and the Project. Nevertheless, in order 
to minimise the possibility of cumulative effects arising, a CEMP will be followed 
during construction of the Project, which will ensure best practice construction 
methods are followed and limit, as far as practicable, the possibility of impacts 
occurring to the historic environment, including for example the stopping of work 
immediately if any heritage assets are found. Furthermore, a WSI will be 
submitted prior to construction of the Project so as to reveal and record any 
historic environment assets which may be impacted by the construction of the 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection and preserve by recording. This is 
secured via a requirement in the draft DCO.  
13.8.7 
Furthermore, given the early stage of the Integrated Waste Management 
proposals and the likely time required to achieve planning consent, it is 
considered unlikely that there would be any overlap on the construction periods 
of these two projects, which further mitigates against any potential cumulative 
effects.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
480 
 
13.8.8 
The ES for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site concluded that there was the potential for pre-mitigation impacts resulting 
from construction phase. Given the lack of assets within the Rookery South pit, 
these potential impacts were limited to excavation works required for the 
electrical cable connection and tree planting associated with the landscape 
mitigation proposals.   
13.8.9 
The potential impacts were limited to (as yet) unknown assets. However, the ES 
for the Covanta RRF stated that given the limited footprint of predicted 
disturbance (low adverse), and the likely asset sensitivity of moderate sensitivity 
(based on previous finds in the area) the predicted (pre-mitigation) effects were 
likely to be minor adverse.  
13.8.10 Mitigation has been proposed as part of the Covanta RRF DCO which includes 
a programme of archaeological works to be undertaken in line with a written 
scheme of investigation (WSI). Following the implementation of the WSI there 
are not likely to be any residual construction / decommissioning effects on 
heritage assets as a result of the development of the Covanta RRF Project. 
13.8.11 There are not anticipated to be any significant effects arising from the 
construction and de-commissioning of the Project. Additionally, the areas of 
undisturbed ground which the Covanta RRF Project would be developing would 
be largely different from those being disturbed by the Project. Therefore, there 
are not anticipated to be any cumulative or in combination effects with Covanta 
RRF during construction or decommissioning.   
13.8.12 Following the grant of the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 
2011 for the Covanta RRF project, Requirement 15 was set out relating to 
archaeology. Specifically, it states: 
(1) “No part of the authorised development may commence until a written 
scheme of archaeological investigation has been submitted to and approved in 
writing by the relevant local planning authorities [and] 
(2) The archaeological investigation must be carried out in accordance with the 
approved scheme unless otherwise agreed in writing by the relevant planning 
authorities”. 
13.8.13 In January 2017, Headland Archaeology, on behalf of Covanta and Veolia 
submitted a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) to CBC in order to discharge 
Requirement 15. The WSI sets out a scheme of archaeological investigation to 
be undertaken prior to construction of the Covanta Project, primarily through a 
watching brief of construction and groundworks.  
Operation (including maintenance) 
13.8.14 The operation of both the Project and other projects at the same time represents 
the greatest potential for creating cumulative effects on designated heritage 
assets as this has the greatest potential to introduce large structures to the 
landscape which could affect the setting of designated assets. Therefore this is 
judged to be a realistic worst case scenario for cumulatively assessing 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
481 
 
operational impacts. Any other scenario (e.g. operation of one scheme and 
constriction of the other) would generate less potential for impacts on setting of 
designated assets.  
13.8.15 As above, the projects considered to be of relevance to the cumulative effects 
assessment for the operation of the Project (taken from section 4.10) are: 
 
The Integrated Waste Management Facilities at Rookery South Pit; and  
 
The Covanta RRF Project at Rookery South Pit, immediately north of the 
Generating Equipment Site). 
13.8.16 Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery Pit. At present, only a high level 
scoping opinion has been submitted. No details are proposed regarding 
potential impacts on the historic environment as a result of the project. The 
assessment set out in this Chapter has shown no significant effects on the 
setting of designated assets are anticipated to arise from operation of the 
Project.   
13.8.17 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project considered that there was the potential for 
significant adverse effects on a total of 16 designated assets, as follows:  
 
Ampthill Castle; 
 
Church and Tower of St Mary the Virgin, Marston Moretaine; 
 
Ampthill Park House 
 
Church of St. Michael, Millbrook; 
 
Katherine’s Cross 
 
Stewartby Chimneys and Kilns; 
 
Stewartby; 
 
Millbrook; 
 
Ampthill Park; 
 
Houghton House; 
 
Church of All Saints, Houghton Conquest; 
 
Church of St.  Mary the Virgin, Wootton; 
 
Cardington Sheds; 
 
Wrest Park; and  
 
Woburn Park. 
13.8.18 However, following further assessment, there was deemed to be no potential 
impacts on Cardington Sheds, Church of All Saints, Church of St Mary, Church 
of St Michael, Stewartby, Wrest Park and Woburn Park. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
482 
 
13.8.19 There was deemed to be a ‘negligible’ magnitude of impact on the remainder of 
the assets, other than Ampthill Park House, where the magnitude of impact was 
deemed to be ‘low’.   
13.8.20 The conclusion reached by the Covanta RRF ES was that these impacts 
resulted in effects which were ‘not significant’.   
13.8.21 An assessment has been undertaken of the cumulative operational effects 
between the Project and the Covanta RRF project on designated heritage assets 
(including many of those listed above and assessed in the Covanta RRF ES). 
This is set out in Appendix 13.2 and has predicted only slight adverse effects 
which are not significant. 
13.8.22 The assessment in Appendix 13.2 concludes that the cumulative and combined 
operational impacts with Covanta would largely be the same nature and 
magnitude as the Project on its ow. 
Effect Interactions 
13.8.23 Viewpoints and photomontages selected for the LVIA analysis presented in 
Chapter 11 have been used to inform the assessment of effects on setting of 
cultural heritage assets.  
13.9 
Mitigation and Assessment of Residual Effects 
13.9.1 
In accordance with national and local planning policies, any potential direct and 
indirect effects upon heritage assets have been considered from the outset of 
the Project.  Accordingly, the proximity to and potential for direct and indirect 
effects upon designated and non-designated heritage assets were addressed 
during the development of the layout of the Project as part of the iterative design 
and assessment process.  Therefore, mitigation is inherent within the final 
design proposals in order to prevent or reduce direct and indirect impacts and 
effects on heritage assets.  
Power Generation Plant 
13.9.2 
Due to the lack of impacts and effects on non-designated heritage assets, no 
mitigation measures are proposed for the Power Generation Plant.   
13.9.3 
Apart from the iterative design process mentioned in paragraph 13.9.1, no 
mitigation measures are proposed in relation to the impact on the settings of 
designated heritage assets within the wider study area.  The stack will be 
experienced from designated assets within the ZTV, as part of a landscape that 
already contains a number of significant tall industrial structures in the vicinity of 
the Power Generation Plant (Marston Vale wind turbine and Stewartby 
chimneys).  The height of the stack will appear to be significantly lower than 
these structures and will not be out of keeping with the existing setting of the 
designated heritage assets. 
Gas & Electrical Connections 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
483 
 
13.9.4 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection outside of Rookery South Pit during 
construction, the principles of which have been agreed with the CBC 
Archaeological Officer during consultations (see Appendix 13.3) (secured via 
Requirement 9 of the draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1)).  Should the DCO 
be made, a written scheme of investigation (WSI) will be produced and 
submitted to the CBC Archaeological Officer.  This document will define the 
scope of works and the methods of excavation and recording that will be 
implemented.  The mitigation will comprise of an archaeological strip, map and 
sample operation during the excavation of the trenches required to install the 
Pipeline and underground cables as well as the AGI and their associated 
construction easements.  During this process any archaeological features 
exposed will be hand excavated and recorded according to a sampling strategy 
set out within the WSI and agreed with the CBC Archaeological Officer.  
Following completion of the fieldwork, the findings will be assessed, analysed 
and published in full in an appropriate academic journal.  These works will be 
undertaken in accordance with the CIfA Standards and Guidance for Excavation 
and/or Standards and Guidance for an Archaeological Watching Brief (CIfA 
2014).   
13.10 
Summary of Residual Effects 
13.10.1 Table 13.10 sets out a summary of the significant effects arising from the Project 
during construction, operation and de-commissioning. 
13.10.2 The following elements are reported: 
 
the affected group or receptor; 
 
the sensitivity of the affected group/receptor; 
 
potential effect; 
 
the likely magnitude and duration of the effect; 
 
the likelihood of occurrence; 
 
proposed mitigation or response to ameliorate the effect; and 
 
the significance of the residual effect following the incorporation of mitigation. 
13.10.3 Also reported are any potential effects from the Project as a whole arising on a 
receptor during each phase, as well as any cumulative effects. 
13.10.4 The assessment of the significant effects has used the significance criteria 
matrices laid out above (Tables 13.2-13.4).  This has identified that for a number 
of designated heritage assets, the effects on their setting are moderate and 
therefore are significant effects.  The detail contained in the assessment in 
Appendix 13.2 demonstrates that this effect is based on the contribution that the 
settings make to the significance of the asset in question, rather than the asset’s 
significance itself. In all cases, the significance of the assets themselves are not 
reduced but there is a minor magnitude of impact (as defined in Table 13.3) to 
the contribution that the setting makes to the significance.  Consequently, the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
484 
 
professional judgement of this effect is that as the significance of the assets 
themselves is largely unaffected, the impact is not significant.  Therefore, the 
significance of effects reported in below in Table 13.10 reports what the 
assessor considers is a ‘true’ reflection of the significance of effects taking into 
consideration professional judgement, rather than strictly following a matrix 
based approach which would often result in an overestimate of the true 
significance of effect.

13.11 
Conclusions  
13.11.1 The potential construction, operational, maintenance and decommissioning 
impacts of the Project on historic environment have been assessed. 
13.11.2 The construction of the Gas and Electrical Connections have the potential to 
impact on non-designated archaeological heritage assets. These known and 
potential remains are considered to be of low sensitivity and of local 
significance. Consultations with the CBC Archaeologist have concluded with 
an agreement that no-predetermination archaeological evaluation works are 
necessary and that mitigation strategy that the line of both connections should 
be stripped archaeologically and that all remains exposed will be excavated 
and recorded in full.  The CBC Archaeologist has confirmed that these works 
can be undertaken after the DCO has been made provided a pre-
commencement requirement is imposed on the DCO.  The Applicant is content 
with this.  The decommissioning of the Gas and Electrical Connections will have 
neutral effects on non-designated heritage assets as any effects would have 
been mitigated by pre-construction assessments. Additionally, it is likely that 
large parts of the Gas and Electrical Connections would remain in-situ following 
decommissioning to limit any environmental effects associated with their 
removal. 
13.11.3 The assessment has shown that the construction and operational stages of the 
Power Generation Plant will result in no more than a minor adverse impact 
(once professional judgement is taken into consideration) on the significance 
of designated heritage assets within the study areas. Due to the elevated 
positions of many of the designated assets that are affected by the presence 
of the stack, mitigation measures to reduce this impact, such as landscaping 
and tree planting beyond that included in the LEMMS (Appendix 11.3), are not 
feasible as a way of reducing the impact.  Furthermore, due to the both the 
distance from and the presence of a significant number of tall industrial 
structures in proximity to the Project, the potential effects will be experienced 
within a context where industrial structures such as Marston Vale wind turbine 
and the Stewartby Chimneys are already present in the same area. The 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant will remove any slight adverse 
effects that the earlier stages will have had.     
13.11.4 The assessment has established that there will be no cumulative or combined 
effects on non-designated heritage assets as the known and potential assets 
that the Project may impact upon will not be impacted upon by any of the other 
projects in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
13.11.5  The assessment has established that there will be no more than a minor 
cumulative or combined effect on the significance of designated heritage 
assets.   
13.11.6 The assessment in Appendix 13.2 concludes that the cumulative and combined 
operational impacts with Covanta are the same nature and magnitude as the 
Project on its own.

13.11.7 The conclusions of this Chapter on Historic Environment are that the 
construction, operation and maintenance and decommissioning of the Project 
does not result in any likely significant effects on the historic environment, 
either when considered alone or cumulatively with other developments 
13.12 
Assessment of Effects on Historic Features (APFP Regulations 2009) 
13.12.1 In addition to the assessment of significant effects, it is also necessary to 
consider all potential effects on historic features, not just those effects which 
are significant in EIA terms. This accords with the requirements of Regulation 
5(2)(m) of the APFP Regulations (2009). 
13.12.2 The Historic Environment Impact Assessment process has determined that 
there will be neutral to moderate/slight adverse residual effects on the setting 
of heritage assets within the Study Areas resulting from the construction or 
operation of the Project. However, applying professional judgement, none of 
these effects are considered significant. The assets relating to the assessment 
are presented in Figure 13.1 
13.12.3 There is the potential for residual effects on the buried historic assets within the 
Study Areas. Following a programme of archaeological mitigation prior to 
construction (secured through DCO Requirement 9), there will be no residual 
effects on the buried historic assets within the Study Areas.

Socio-economics 
14.1 
Introduction 
14.1.1 
This Chapter presents the assessment of likely significant effects on the labour 
market, tourism economy and community infrastructure arising from the 
construction, operation maintenance and decommissioning of the Project.   
14.1.2 
The Project has the potential to create socio-economic effects from increased 
investment in the local economy, increased demand for labour and potentially 
increased pressure on the area's community infrastructure.  The area's tourism

Secretary of State (SoS) Scoping Opinion 
3.93 
The SoS recommends that the types of jobs 
generated should be considered in the context 
of the available workforce in the area.  This 
applies equally to the construction and 
operational stages.   
Noted. The types of jobs and 
typical workforce of the area are 
described in section 14.6  
3.94 
The SoS recommends that the assessment 
criteria should be locationally-specific, and 
consider the potential significance of the 
impacts of the proposed development within the 
local and regional context. 
The study area is described in 
section 14.6 and the assessment 
presented in this chapter (Section 
14.7) includes the local and 
regional context.

Response 
Letter 
 
 
Respondent is not convinced that the proposed 
facility will enhance the local economy as only 
15 full time jobs have been identified. 
We consider that this will have 
minor benefits to the local 
economy, as will the number of 
construction jobs, as reported in 
Section 14.7.   
Respondent suggests there will be a 
detrimental effect on existing property prices, 
depressing economic activity and undermine 
the ambition of local communities to develop as 
tourist destinations. 
We do not agree that siting the 
Project in this location would 
detrimentally impact the area such 
that tourists would be put off.  In 
addition, the situation of the 
Project should not have a 
detrimental effect on property 
prices.  The Project is sited largely 
within a former clay pit in order to 
minimise landscape and visual 
effects.  An assessment of 
potential tourist related impacts in 
included in section 14.7 of this 
Chapter.

The proposed methodology is sound.  
However, it would be beneficial to ensure that 
ward data for the affected and neighbouring 
wards is included to ensure that the local 
considerations are taken into account.  
I am particularly keen that you include the 
impact on tourism business and would support 
the survey.  The use of the business survey is 
supported.  There is a need to liaise with 
Experience Bedfordshire (our destination 
management organisation).   
I would also note that the Council has produced 
a range of economic information which should 
be used as a baseline, or at least to allow for 
consistent comparison.   
The socio-economic baseline uses 
30, 45 and 60-minute drive-time 
from the site and therefore takes 
into account the local area (section 
14.6).   
 
The business survey addresses 
the perceived impact on tourism 
businesses.  The survey 
population was compiled using a 
range of local tourism websites 
including the Experience 
Bedfordshire website 
 
The chapter refers to relevant 
economic information from the 
website such as policy documents.  
A range of socio- economic 
baseline information is included on 
a drive-time basis (sections 14.6 
and 14.7).

Generally in agreement with proposals, but felt 
that the following should also be included: .   
1.  A statement about the key role that peak-
power plants play in energy supply for the 
country (and therefore locally too); 
2.  Information about the potential economic 
role (attracting inward investment – e.g.  data 
centres) of the significant out-of-peak-power 
generation capacity of the plant. 
A statement about the role of the 
Power Generation Plant is 
provided in Chapter 1.  Peaking 
plants are required to operate 
when there is a ‘stress event’ on 
the grid. 
The Generating Equipment will be 
limited to running 2250 hours in 
any given year, provided that the 5 
year rolling average does not 
exceed 1,500 hours - so in the 
majority of instances, it will be 
running to service peak demand 
and stress events due to a drop in 
supply for example, a power plant 
outage or sudden drop in wind 
power output.

Sport England does not have any published 
guidance for undertaking such assessments in 
relation to assessing sports facilities. 
The focus of the assessment would be 
expected to be on what, if any, affects there 
would be on existing sports facilities in the local 
area.  The assessment should identify existing 
sports facilities and identify the nature and 
magnitude of any potential impact on the use of 
these facilities (e.g.  traffic, noise, air quality 
etc.).  in a similar way to other community 
infrastructure.  . 
The Project Site does not contain 
any sporting facilities and it will not 
generate a need for sports 
facilities.   
The chapter identifies any outdoor 
sports facilities within 5 km of the 
Power Generation Plant in section 
14.6. 
14.4 
Topic-specific Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
14.4.1 
In respect of socio-economics, the proposed Project parameters (which are 
described in Chapters 3 and 5) have little bearing on the impact to socio-
economics as they will all require the same number of construction, operational 
(including maintenance) and decommissioning staff and will give rise to the 
same impacts in terms of LVIA, noise and other amenities.   
14.5 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
Assessment Methodology  
14.5.1 
The assessment follows UK Government guidelines and best practice 
guidance.  The methodology used to estimate impacts follows guidance set out 
in the HM Treasury’s Green Book33 and Homes and Communities Agency 
(HCA) Additionality Guide,34  as well as taking account of the Department for 
Business Innovation and Skills research on additionality.   
14.5.2 
The proposed socio-economic and tourism study areas35 formed part of the 
consultation on methodology36.  The study areas are as follows:   
 
Socio economic study area - The socio-economic assessment is based on 
drive time catchment areas from the Project.37  The ‘local area’ is defined 
within a 30-minute drive time, ‘wider area’ within a 45-minute drive time, and 
‘wider region’ within a 60-minute drive time (see Figure 14.1).  The 60 
minute drive time catchment is the principle study area for labour market

35 Please note there is no specific socio-economic guidance on methodology.  The Methodology used has been 
developed by PBA over a 10-year period and tested at a number of Public Inquiries for Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Projects.

effects.  This reflects the outer boundary that a typical workforce is willing 
to commute within on a daily basis;   
 
Tourism study area - The tourism/business study area is limited to a 10 km 
radius of the Project Site (see Figure 14.2) which was based on professional 
judgement and agreed with consultees (CBC and BBC Economic 
Development - See Table 14.1).  However, some tourism receptors within 
this radius have been excluded as they are either screened by roads and/or 
situated in an urban area where visual impacts (which would have one of 
the largest effects on tourism) are unlikely to be experienced.  In particular 
tourism receptors within the settlements of Milton Keynes and Bedford have 
been excluded for the following reasons: 
 Milton Keynes:  The presence of the M1 to the south-west of the Project 
Site omits Milton Keynes and settlements such as Aspley Heath as 
valid areas likely to be affected. 
 Bedford:  Bedford is an urbanised environment with significant built 
infrastructure.  Bedford is also severed from the Project Site by the 
A421 and A6.   
 
Community Infrastructure study area – As proximity is likely to be the main 
determinant of impacts and their scale, the status (or catchment) of 
community facility receptors in an area determines the scale and 
significance of any effect.  The community infrastructure assessment is 
focussed on the area defined within an approximate 5 km radius from the 
Project.   
Defining the Baseline 
14.5.3 
Data and information from national, regional and local databases have been 
reviewed, identifying information gaps and requirements for data gathering   
e.g. business, accommodation and other surveys. 
14.5.4 
The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using standard 
indicators.  This provides a baseline from which potential impacts and effects 
can be assessed: 
 
Socio-economic/ labour market: the area has been defined using a 
combination of: standard sources38 and indicators39; research available at 
study area level; and research into the business and labour market structure 
of the local economy (details of the indicators are provided in section 14.6); 
 
Tourism economy: the area’s visitor attraction has been profiled40 including:

visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and value; and 
the local tourism economy (see Figure 14.3); 
 
Community Infrastructure: An audit of community infrastructure including 
GP facilities, education facilities, recreation facilities, pharmacies and 
dentists has been prepared41 (see Figures 14.4-14.7); and 
 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other relevant policy 
has been reviewed to identify related economic, social and regeneration 
objectives which the Project may affect (whether contributing to their 
realisation or otherwise). 
Assessment of Socio-economic Effects 
Employment and Gross Value Added 
14.5.5 
A detailed assessment of likely significant effects on the local, regional and 
national economy during construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project has been prepared.  This assesses the scale of:  
 
Direct economic impacts: jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA)42 that are 
wholly or largely related to construction, operation and decommissioning of 
the Project; 
 
Indirect economic impacts (beneficial and adverse): jobs and GVA 
generated in the study area in the chain of suppliers of goods and services 
to the direct activities; 
 
Induced economic impacts: jobs and GVA created by direct and indirect 
employees’ spending in the study area or in the wider economy; and 
 
Wider economic (catalytic) impacts (beneficial and adverse): employment 
and income generated in the economy related to the wider role of the Project 
in influencing economic activities (including wider socio-economic effects).   
14.5.6 
For economic impacts and effects (including employment), the availability of 
labour and skills is critical in accommodating the demands, needs and 
requirements of the Project.  Adequate capacity results in a low sensitivity while 
a shortfall or constrained capacity results in a high sensitivity.   
14.5.7 
The key socio-economic indicators for the study area include: 
 
The proportion of skilled workforce in the study area relative to national 
averages; 
 
Educational attainment levels compared with national averages;

42 Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or 
sector of an economy 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
501 
 
 
The proportion of employment in relevant sectors (i.e.  manufacturing and 
construction workers) in the study area; 
 
The availability of labour (including the unemployed workforce); and 
 
Relevant education and training provision, including existing and proposed 
programmes provided by institutions serving the study area.   
Absorption and Accommodation Capacity 
14.5.8 
An assessment has been undertaken of accommodation capacity and 
absorption capacity; the methodology differs from the approach taken for the 
above as it does not use sensitivity and magnitude criteria, and therefore 
cannot be categorised in terms of likely significant effects as has been done for 
other aspects of the assessment. 
14.5.9 
The assessment of accommodation capacity and absorption capacity is an 
important indicator of the availability of bedrooms and labour, used to inform 
potential 
effects. 
The 
assessment 
approach 
therefore 
relies 
upon 
demonstrating adequate capacity as opposed to assessing significant effects. 
This is considered to be an appropriate method43 and is consistent with the 
approach used for other consented nationally significant infrastructure projects. 
There is no Guidance for assessing accommodation and absorption capacity 
effects.  PBA has developed this approach as part of our standard assessment 
methodology for DCO projects.  Many of which have been successfully tested 
at public inquires and hearings.   
14.5.10 The assessment of accommodation capacity and absorption capacity is 
presented in section 14.8 alongside the assessment of effects on employment 
and GVA. 
Assessment of Tourism and Recreation 
14.5.11 Tourism and recreational behaviour will only be detrimentally affected where 
the effects of the Project either change the visitor/user pattern in terms of 
numbers, and/or their patterns of expenditure for the worse.  As such, 
opportunities for tourist and visitor expenditure, any potential variation in 
expenditure or visitor numbers, and consequent effects on turnover or 
employment are of key importance.     
14.5.12 A business survey was carried out in late 2014 to gain a more detailed 
understanding of the local tourism economy, its current performance and views 
on the Project's perceived impact on their business and the wider tourism 
economy.   The business survey forms part of a suite of information that 
provides baseline information and provides potential explanations for 
                                                           
 
 
43 Demonstrating adequate capacity (or otherwise) provides a proportionate and comprehensible assessment of 
these factors.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

‘perceived’ business impacts (i.e. visual, noise, traffic, air quality).  The validity 
of these perceived impacts are then investigated using the findings of the 
relevant ES Chapters to determine the assessed effect.               
14.5.13 The baseline assessment undertaken as part of this ES (e.g. review of 
population, age structure, qualifications (see section 14.6)) demonstrates the 
socio-economic and tourism profile are broadly comparable to the conditions 
in 2014.  Therefore, the findings and results of the business survey are still 
considered to be relevant to the assessment of the Project and have been 
included in this ES to provide further evidence on local tourism dynamics, 
performance and the perceived impact of the Project.   
14.5.14 Businesses contacted include key visitor accommodation providers, leisure 
activity providers and other relevant tourism businesses. 
14.5.15 The survey sought respondents’ perceptions of the likely potential impacts of 
the Project on their business performance (turnover/customer base) and on 
tourism in the wider Bedfordshire area.  Impacts were categorised as follows: 
 
Low Impact = <10 %;  
 
Medium Impact = 10-15 %; and 
 
High Impact =>15 %. 
14.5.16 The definitions of perceived impact (both beneficial and adverse) are based on 
market experience.  In tourism related business surveys across the UK, 
respondents have generally stated that reductions in turnover of in excess of 
15% are critical to business sustainability/survival, while reductions of 10%-
15% represent a moderate impact which can be recouped through marketing, 
cost saving and similar market responses.  Reductions of less than 10% are 
seen as being within the parameters of general changes in trading conditions. 
14.5.17 Visitor and recreational facilities in the study area have been identified.  Based 
on the Project’s anticipated visibility, the assessment reports on the likelihood 
of the Project influencing visitor and tourist attitudes and behaviour towards 
them.   
14.5.18 The significance of effects on tourism is assessed by reference to the sensitivity 
of the receptor and the anticipated magnitude of impact. The criteria for 
sensitivity and magnitude of impact are defined in the Significance Criteria 
section below (Tables 14.2 – 14.8). 
14.5.19 In considering the level of tourism sensitivity, the standing of the receptor or 
resource is the defining factor.  This is established against: 
 
Tourism business’ relative attraction to customers from outside the study 
area and the Project’s potential to influence broader perceptions of the area.  
Where a majority of trade is non-local this is more likely to be the case; and 
 
The relative importance of tourism as a business sector.  Where tourism is 
more important relative to other sectors, impacts may have the potential to 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
503 
 
generate broader impacts.  Similarly, where it is of relatively low 
significance, impacts on tourism and related sectors are unlikely to generate 
a high level of adverse impact across the broader economy. 
Assessment of Community Infrastructure Effects 
14.5.20 An assessment of the likely significant effects on local, regional and national 
community receptors during construction, operation and decommissioning of 
the Project have been carried out.  This assessment includes an audit of 
community infrastructure facilities/receptors within the local area and its 
associated effects   
14.5.21 When considering the level of sensitivity of community infrastructure, the 
standing / status of the community receptor is the defining factor.  Facilities with 
a national or international status have the ability to draw in more people from 
outside the study area and hence are more sensitive to impact.  Conversely, 
where the receptor is of relatively low significance i.e.  local facilities, the 
impacts are unlikely to generate a high level of adverse impact across the study 
area.   
Significance Criteria 
14.5.22 The significance of effect is defined by the combination of the sensitivity of 
receptors and the magnitude of impacts upon them.  The criteria set out below 
are specific to socio-economic factors and have been adopted to assess 
receptor sensitivity and impact magnitude.  They therefore differ from those 
listed in Tables 4.1 to 4.3 of this ES.   
Socio-economic significance criteria 
14.5.23 The following criteria have been set to assess the effects on socio-economic 
receptors in relation to employment and GVA. As noted in paragraph 14.5.9 
these criteria have not been used in assessing absorption capacity or 
accommodation capacity as the methodology is not applicable to those 
aspects. 
14.5.24 Table 14.2 identifies the sensitivity of socio-economic receptors.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

Table 14.2 Socio-Economic Sensitivity Criteria 
Sensitivity 
Example 
Very High 
The area has a shortfall of appropriate labour and skills. 
The Project would lead to excessive labour market pressure and 
distortions (i.e.  skills and capacity shortages, import of labour, 
wage inflation). 
High  
The area has constrained supply of labour and skills.   
The Project would lead to labour market pressure and distortions 
(i.e.  skills and capacity shortages, import of labour, wage inflation). 
Medium  
The area has a low/ limited supply of labour and skills.   
The Project could lead to labour market pressure or distortions. 
Low  
The receptor has a readily available labour force.   
The Project is unlikely to lead to labour market pressure or 
distortions.   
Negligible  
The area has a surplus of readily available labour with directly 
relevant and transferable skills.  The Project will not lead to labour 
market pressure or distortions.   
14.5.25 The magnitude of the impact of likely socio-economic impacts is assessed 
against the thresholds shown in Table 14.3.

by the facility or that from which people travel to access it is the defining factor 
(Table 14.6). 
Table 14.6 Community Infrastructure Receptor Sensitivity Criteria 
Sensitivity  
Example 
Very High 
Facility is of international importance e.g.  Major research or 
academic centre 
High  
Facility is of national importance 
e.g.  University, Centre of Excellence for health care 
Medium  
Facility is of regional importance e.g.  hospital. 
Low (or 
lower)/Negligible 
Facility is of local importance e.g. 
GP facility, local schools, community centre

14.5.29 The magnitude of impact on community infrastructure is gauged by estimating 
the amount of change on the receptor arising from the Project.  The magnitude 
of change is evaluated in line with the criteria below (Table 14.7). 
Table 14.7 Community Infrastructure Magnitude of Impact Criteria 
Magnitude 
 
Example 
Major  
Adverse 
A permanent or long term adverse impact on the 
integrity and value of a facility 
Beneficial Large scale or major improvement of the facilities 
quality; extensive restoration or enhancement; major 
improvement of facilities quality. 
Moderate 
Adverse  
An adverse impact on the value of a facility, but 
recovery is possible in the medium term and no 
permanent impacts are predicted. 
Beneficial Benefit to, or addition of, key characteristics, features, 
or elements or improvement of a facilities quality. 
Minor 
Adverse 
An adverse impact on the value of a facility, but 
recovery is expected in the short- term and there 
would be no impact on its integrity.   
Beneficial  Minor benefit to, or addition of key characteristics, 
features or elements; some beneficial impact on 
attribute or a reduction in the risk of a negative impact 
occurring. 
Negligible 
Adverse 
Very minor loss 
Beneficial Very minor benefit 
No Change 
No change would be perceptible, either beneficial or 
adverse.

Significance of Effect 
14.5.30 In line with standard EIA practice, the sensitivity of receptors as defined in the 
tables above (Table 14.2, Table 14.4 and Table 14.6) are considered against 
the magnitude of impact (Table 14.3, Table 14.5 and Table 14.7) to determine 
the significance of effect (Table 14.8).

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Socio-economic Baseline 
14.6.1 
This socio-economic profile examines the key indicators and measures of 
socio-economic activity in the Study Area which is divided into the following 
tiers:  
 
‘Local area’ defined within a 30-minute drive time; 
 
‘Wider area’ defined within a 45-minute drive time; and  
 
‘Wider region’ defined within a 60-minute drive time (Main Labour Market 
Study Area).    
14.6.2 
A 60-minute drive time catchment is considered to be a reasonably accurate 
reflection of the areas labour market based on the distance that commuters are 
typically willing to travel on a daily basis.  It is likely the majority of operational 
and construction employment will be sourced from this ‘wider region 60-minute 
drive time catchment.’   
14.6.3 
Smaller local and wider area catchments are provided to ensure more localised 
issues are reflected in the baseline.  These smaller study areas are also used 
in the impact assessment to model the effects of sourcing the projects labour 
supply from smaller labour market areas.

Population 
14.6.4 
The local area, wider area and wider region has experienced relatively 
significant population increases since 2001, a trend which is expected to 
continue over the coming years to 2035.  Over the same period the population 
of the UK has increased and is also projected to increase but at a lesser rate.

Age Structure 
14.6.6 
The local area has a declining proportion of working age people and an 
increasing dependency ratio45 which is likely to put additional pressure on 
services in the area.  By 2035 over a fifth of the local area's population is 
expected to be of retirement age.  This is greater than the projected UK 
averages.

14.6.9 The local area is characterised by marginally higher levels of unemployment 
compared to the wider area and region.  The level of unemployment is however 
broadly comparable to the UK average.  The local area, wider area and wider 
region have slightly higher proportions of self-employed people which may 
indicate a more dynamic entrepreneurial workforce.  This is summarised in 
Table 14.12.   
                                                           
 
 
46 The economic activity rate measures the percentage of the population, both in employment and unemployed 
that represent the labour supply regardless of their labour status.   The figure represents the degree of success of 
the area in engaging people in productive activity.

Social Grade/ Skills 
14.6.11 National Readership Survey (NRS) social grades are a system of demographic 
classification widely used in market research47.  Compared to the UK average 
the local area has a higher proportion of people in the highest social grades 
(AB) and second highest (C1) grade.  It also has a lower proportion of people 
in lowest social grades (DE) compared to the national average.  The wider area 
and wider region have higher proportions of people in the highest social grade 
(AB), than that of the local area and UK average.  This is summarised in Table

14.6.14 The socio-economic study area exhibits some characteristics consistent with a 
low sensitivity labour market (i.e.  readily available skilled labour, increasing 
population, above average economic activity, high educational attainment).  
This suggests that the Project will not lead to any undue labour market pressure 
or distortions (i.e.  wage inflation, skills and capacity shortages, import of 
labour). 
14.6.15 The overall sensitivity of the labour market is assessed as low.50  
Tourism Baseline 
Tourism 
14.6.16 Tourism volume and value indicators such as domestic tourist trips, bed-nights 
and spending in Central Bedfordshire have generally mirrored regional and 
national trends since 2006.  Central Bedfordshire has however experienced 
much greater variation between periods.     
14.6.17 Tourism volume and value in Central Bedfordshire recovered strongly during 
the period 2011-13 but has decreased slightly to 2013-2015.  It now accounts 
for approximately one third of Bedfordshire’s tourism economy.  Previously 
Central Bedfordshire accounted for approximately a quarter of Bedfordshire’s 
tourism volume and value.  Tourist trips and bed-nights are now just above 
2006 levels.

14.6.20 Visitor trips, bed-nights, spending and visitor numbers to key attractions are 
increasing.  The Marston Vale Millennium Country Park is located within close 
proximity of the Project Site and was the top free attraction in Bedfordshire in 
2013 (see Table 14.17 above).  In addition, another visitor attraction - Houghton 
House (operated by English Heritage) is located approximately 1 km from the 
Project Site which is also included in the business survey.  National Cycle 
Route 51 runs to the east of the Project Site.  It is a long distance route (214 
miles) which connects major cities in the south of England.  The tourist 
attractions below are also shown on Figure 14.8.   
14.6.21 Tourism and recreation receptors have been identified in the study area.

Findings of the Business Survey 
14.6.23 This following analysis summarises the key findings from the local tourism 
business survey carried out during November and December 2014 to identify 
baseline information and the perceived impact of the project.  The baseline 
assessment above indicates little change in the areas socio-economic and 
tourism and economy since 2014.   The business survey results are therefore 
considered to remain relevant to include within this ES. 
14.6.24 The survey population included all businesses which could be considered to 
derive a large part or all of their trade from tourism within the defined study

area53. This primarily included businesses in accommodation & food services 
and leisure activities.  The study area was selected as it was considered 
unlikely that tourism businesses located outside this would experience either 
beneficial or adverse impacts.  The analysis provides a detailed understanding 
of the likely potential impacts perceived by businesses as a result of the Project.  
Businesses were identified through internet searches of local business listings, 
council websites and destination management organisations.   
14.6.25 The survey had a response rate of 26%.54  
Location of respondents 
14.6.26 There was a wide geographical range of respondents throughout the Study 
Area as shown in Insert 14.1.  Around 30% of respondents were from either 
Ampthill or Barton-Le-Clay.

Number of bed spaces 
14.6.28 Seven of the accommodation providers gave details of the number of bed 
spaces, with over half of respondents having between 10-35 bed spaces.  This 
indicates that a number of accommodation respondents are small/medium 
scale accommodation providers.   
Number of Employees 
14.6.29 Of the eight businesses that responded to this question five had 20 employees 
or more.  The average number of employees was 28, indicating the majority of 
businesses are small/medium scale.   
Customer base 
14.6.30 Nearly half of the respondents' trade comes from local customers.  A high 
proportion of trade (30%) is from business visitors.  The smallest proportion of 
trade comes from tourists and leisure visitors.  This is summarised in Insert 
14.3.  This suggests that businesses are less reliant on tourist/visitor trade 
within the study area.

Occupancy rate  
14.6.37 Accommodation business respondents were asked about their occupancy rate 
during the peak and off peak season.  The average peak season occupancy 
rate was 85% and the average off-peak was 72%.  This is higher than the 
English peak (76%) and off-peak average (63%)55. 
Business Survey: Baseline conclusion 
14.6.38 Of the 84 businesses surveyed, 22 responded to the tourism business survey 
questionnaire, giving a 26% response rate.56  
14.6.39 A high proportion of responses were from businesses located in Ampthill or 
Barton-Le-Clay.   A number of the businesses were small/medium in size. 
14.6.40 The highest proportion of responses were from bars and pubs as shown at 14.2 
above.  The survey identified that a high proportion of trade were from local 
customers.  The origins tourist/visitor customers were mainly from the UK.   
14.6.41 The main activities customers participated in when visiting the area were going 
on long and short walks, as well as visiting country parks and stately homes. 
14.6.42 The majority of businesses considered that their business performance had 
been increasing over the last three years.  Current levels of satisfaction were 
high, with a number of respondents reporting trade as being fair or good.  
Respondents were also optimistic that their future business performance will 
improve and level of business increase. 
14.6.43 Reputation, product and price and value for money were deemed to be the 
most influential factors impacting upon business trends. 
14.6.44 Occupancy rates reported by respondents were higher than the English 
average.   
Community Infrastructure Audit  
14.6.45 Demand for community infrastructure facilities could arise from the in-migration 
of construction workers and their families during the temporary construction 
phase.  However, based the number of construction workers and professional

judgement and experience of other projects, this requirement is likely to be 
minimal.   An audit of community facilities also shows there is sufficient capacity 
to accommodate additional demand.   
14.6.46 The community infrastructure audit has identified:  
 
17 schools within approximately 5km of the Project Site (capacity for 1,027 
pupils);  
 
Six GP surgeries (all accepting new patients);  
 
One hospital (7.5 km northeast in Bedford); 
 
Five pharmacies; and 
 
One library (4km southwest in Ampthill).   
14.6.47 An audit of outdoor recreation facilities has identified: 
 
2 public parks, including Marston Vale Millennium Country Park (<100m 
west) and Ampthill Park;  
 
1 water sports club (c.1km north); 
 
1 activity centre (Centre Parcs) (c. 2 km south) and 
 
1 golf club (3km south west). 
14.6.48 The overall sensitivity of the local area’s community infrastructure is assessed 
as low as most of the facilities identified above are of local importance. The 
exception to this is Centre Parcs which is assessed as medium sensitivity due 
to its regional significance.

Employment and GVA 
14.7.1 
A detailed schedule of the level of employment and skills required to build the 
Project was provided to PBA by WSP, based on relevant project experience.57   
14.7.2 
The construction period is estimated to last 22 months from 2020-2022.   The 
number of construction workers onsite per month ranges from 25 to 122 during 
the peak construction period58.   
14.7.3 
Table 14.20 below shows the average number of construction workers and full 
time equivalent permanent construction jobs on site for years 1 to 2.  Project

Gross value added (GVA) is a measure of the value of goods and services 
produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy.  Annual construction 
GVA per head in the East of England is £69,625.  The construction phase could 
therefore deliver up to £6.4 million GVA60 to the wider economy.   
Significance of Construction Effect 
14.7.5 
The study area for the labour market is assessed to be of low sensitivity in 
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14.2.   The Project as a whole 
would provide a minor beneficial construction employment magnitude of impact 
in accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14.7. 
14.7.6 
The low sensitivity and minor beneficial impact results in a likely slight 
beneficial effect on employment, in accordance with the criteria provided in 
Table 14.8, and therefore construction effects on employment and GVA are 
considered to be not significant.    
Accommodation Capacity  
14.7.7 
The study area accommodation capacity assessment is based on hotel and 
bed & breakfast accommodation i.e.  it assumes that construction based 
                                                           
 
 
59 It is generally accepted in economic appraisals that 10 years of continuous employment is equivalent to 1 FTE 
60 £69,625x 92 person years= £6.4m (note this is the same as 9.2 FTEs x 10 years continuous employment x 
£69,625 = £6.4m) 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
528 
 
demand will be directed towards these sectors rather than other types of 
accommodation61. 
14.7.8 
Average occupancy rates identified in the business survey have been used to 
estimate the number of available bedrooms.62  The Project programme 
indicates the estimated number of construction staff on site on a monthly basis 
during the construction programme.  The Project construction programme 
indicates that 122 workers would be on site at the peak of the construction 
period. 
14.7.9 
The extent to which construction workers use accommodation in the study area 
is influenced by: site proximity or ease of access to it; availability, quality and 
price of accommodation; the range of leisure and other services in the 
immediate area; and other factors.   
14.7.10 There are 631 bedrooms available in hotel or bed and breakfast 
accommodation within a 10 km radius of the Project Site.63  Table  14.21 
demonstrates 100% of construction workers could be accommodated each 
month within a 10 km radius of the Project.  The figures in the table assume 
that existing sources of trade are maintained at their current levels (as reflected 
in occupancy rates).  Critically, it then shows the effect of construction-related 
accommodation demand on the residual capacity.  The impact of construction 
labour on accommodation is assessed against the likely capacity during peak 
seasons when demand is high.  This tests the sensitivity of labour market 
requirements and constrained availability. 
14.7.11 In reality a large proportion of unspecialised jobs will be provided locally and 
will not require accommodation.   However, Table 14.21 demonstrates that a 
worst case scenario involving 100% of workers requiring accommodation could 
be accommodated without causing any shortages or pressures.

Absorption Capacity  
14.7.12 The labour market data from the baseline is used to show the extent to which 
the study area can supply relevant skills and labour for the construction and 
operation of the Project.   
14.7.13 As set out above, labour market data is expressed at drive time level i.e.  a 
catchment reflecting travel to work patterns.  The ‘local area’ is defined within 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

a 30-minute drive time; the ‘wider area’ within a 45-minute drive time and the 
‘wider region’ within a 60-minute drive time.     
14.7.14 Table 14.22 shows that the required construction labour force would also 
account for 0.6% of the employed construction workforce or 0.5% of 
manufacturing workers within a 30-minute drive time. 
14.7.15 If the demand for construction labour were fully sourced from the ‘potentially 
available labour pool’ (i.e. unemployed) it would account for 0.7% of 
unemployed workers within a 30-minute drive time.     
14.7.16 The demand for construction labour arising from the Project’s development 
would not therefore result in any pressure on labour market capacity (i.e.  
requiring more than 15% 64 of existing capacity).

Operation 
Employment and GVA 
14.7.17 Best practice principles outlined in HM Treasury Green Book Appraisal 
Guidance65 have been applied to assess the effect of permanent operational 
employment.   
14.7.18 An Economic Impact Model was developed to measure net additional 
employment and GVA.  The Guidance has been used along with professional 
judgment to estimate values for: 
 
Deadweight - what would happen in the absence of the Project; 
 
Leakage - the proportion of employment opportunities accessed by people 
living outside the study area; 
 
Displacement – the proportion of Project benefit accounted for by a 
reduction in benefit elsewhere; 
 
Substitution - when a firm substitutes one activity for another to take 
advantage of public sector assistances; and 
 
Multipliers –to estimate further economic activity associated with additional 
income and supplier purchases. 
14.7.19 Table 14.23 shows the values used in the model.  Explanatory comments are 
given for each value.

14.7.20 Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) has provided a methodology for 
calculating additionality through a ‘net additionality framework’.  This is 
represented in Insert 14.9 and can be described as: ‘Impact of intervention 
option’ less ‘impact of reference case’ (deadweight) equals ‘net additional 
impact’

14.7.21 The operational phase of the Project would provide an estimated 10 FTE direct 
jobs.  The net effect, taking account of the leakage, displacement and multiplier 
effects shown above, would be 9.4 additional regional FTE jobs and 5.5 
national FTE jobs.  67 Average GVA per utility employee in East of England is 
£90,071.  Assuming Project related employment generated average levels of 
GVA, the Project’s operation would provide approximately £0.85m GVA68 and 
£0.50m GVA69 per annum to the local and national economy respectively.   
Significance of Operational Effect 
14.7.22 The study area for the labour market is assessed to be of low sensitivity in 
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14.2.   The Project as a whole 
would provide a minor beneficial operation employment magnitude of impact in 
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14.3. 
                                                           
 
 
67 The assumptions in Table 14.23 are applied to the 10 Gross FTE Operational jobs created by the Project.   This 
is done in an Excel Economic Impact Model created using HM Treasury Green Book Appraisal Guidance.   
68 9.4 net additional local jobs x £90,071= £849,319 
69 8.3 net additional national jobs x £90,071= £746,472 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
534 
 
14.7.23 The low sensitivity and minor beneficial impact results in a likely slight 
beneficial effect on employment, in accordance with the criteria provided in 
Table 14.8, and is therefore operational effects on employment and GVA are 
considered to be not significant.   
Absorption Capacity  
14.7.24 The labour market data from the baseline is used to show the extent to which 
the study area can supply relevant skills and labour for the construction and 
operation of the Project.   
14.7.25 Labour market data is expressed at drive time level i.e.  a catchment reflecting 
travel to work patterns.    
14.7.26 Operational impacts have been assessed against the current labour market.  
The operational workforce requirement accounts for less than 2% of the 
electricity and gas workers and less than 1% of the working age, economically 
active and highly skilled, skilled and unskilled labour force.   
14.7.27 Demand for operational employment would not therefore result in any 
noticeable labour market pressure on the 30, 45 or 60-minute drive time areas 
and would not exert negative pressure through labour shortages and wage 
increases. 
14.7.28 The labour requirement during the operational phase would provide a benefit 
and in reality would be sourced from a number of economically active 
categories including workers in directly relevant industries, workers with 
transferable skills and unemployed workers.

Decommissioning  
14.7.29 As noted in Chapter 3, this assessment has (in order to carry out an 
assessment of decommissioning effects) made an assumption regarding a 
possible date for decommissioning based on the operational lifespan of similar 
projects (25 years).  However, it is possible that the Project will continue to 
operate for longer than the assumed period.  The labour requirement for the 
decommissioning programme is unknown but is not expected to exceed that of 
the construction phase.   
14.7.30 Decommissioning effects are therefore considered to be likely to be similar to 
the construction impacts.  The Project’s decommissioning phase will therefore 
provide an overall ‘slight’ beneficial employment impact (in accordance with 
criteria in Table 14.8), which is considered to be not significant.

Assessment of Effects: Tourism and Recreation 
Tourism Business Survey – Perceived Impact Analysis 
14.8.1 
The survey sought respondents’ perceptions of the potential impacts of the 
Project on their business performance and on tourism in the wider Bedfordshire 
area. 
14.8.2 
All 22 respondents provided an answer as to what impact they felt the Project 
would have on their business.  41% of respondents considered that it would 
have no impact on their business as they considered that the Project was either 
too far away from their business to affect them directly or that they wouldn’t be 
able to see the Project.  Results are summarised in Insert 14.10.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
536 
 
Insert 14.10 Perceived Impacts of Project on business performance  
 
14.8.3 
41% of respondents suggested that the Project could have varying degrees of 
beneficial impact on trading and the local economy.  The main reason cited 
was the potential for the Project to attract workers to the area during the 
construction period.  Businesses felt they may benefit from providing services 
such as accommodation, and food and drink. 
14.8.4 
18% of respondents (four respondents) considered the Project would have 
either a low or medium adverse impact on their business.  Three businesses 
identified the likelihood of medium adverse impacts on their business while 
another identified a possible low adverse impact.  The main reason given for 
potential adverse impacts were visual impacts.  Several of the businesses rely 
on the countryside views for their business to operate successfully.  In addition, 
one respondent stated that they had concerns over the environmental impact 
of a gas fired power station.  Further detailed assessment of landscape and 
visual impacts is provided in Chapter 11.   
14.8.5 
Businesses were also asked to indicate what they expected the impact might 
be on Bedfordshire tourism in general.  The results are summarised in Insert 
14.11.

Insert 14.1 Perceived Impacts of Project on Bedfordshire Tourism 
 
14.8.6 
Over a third of respondents considered that it would have no impact on tourism 
and visitor numbers, with a further 30% considering any adverse impact to be 
low or minimal.  18% of respondents considered there to be a medium adverse 
impact on Bedfordshire tourism. 
14.8.7 
Three respondents perceived there to be medium adverse impacts.  The 
reasons were again primarily related to visual impacts.   
Duration of Adverse Impacts 
14.8.8 
Of those respondents who considered there to be adverse impacts over half 
felt the impacts would last for the life of the Project.  Nearly a third of 
respondents felt that adverse impacts would be experienced during both the 
construction and operation of the Project.   
Duration of Beneficial Impacts 
14.8.9 
Of those respondents who considered there to be beneficial impacts the 
majority felt the impacts would be during the construction phase only.  A quarter 
of respondents felt that beneficial impacts would be for the life of the Project.   
Potential Benefits 
14.8.10 Respondents were asked to consider how the Project could benefit their 
business.  The majority of these responses related to provision of 
accommodation, and food and drink, particularly during the construction phase.   
Conclusion  
14.8.11 In terms of impact, the vast majority of respondents felt that the Project would 
have either no or beneficial impacts on business performance.  Some

businesses felt that they would be able to capitalise on construction workers 
coming to area by providing services such as accommodation and food and 
drink.    
14.8.12 Only a small proportion of respondents predicted a medium adverse impact on 
business performance based mainly on perceived adverse visual impact. 
14.8.13 The majority of respondents felt that the Project would have either no or low 
adverse impact on tourism in Bedfordshire.  Less than a fifth of respondents 
expected the impact to be moderately adverse, with visual impact again being 
cited as the main factor.   
14.8.14 Overall, the business survey analysis has shown that a number of 
tourism/recreation related businesses within the study area are not reliant on 
tourism trade and are reporting high/increasing business confidence.  A fifth of 
trade is said to come from tourists and the majority from locals and business 
visitors.  The majority of respondents do not predict any significantly adverse 
impacts on either their own business performance or the wider Bedfordshire 
tourism offer.   
Tourism and Recreation Receptors – Magnitude of Impact Analysis 
Factors influencing impact  
14.8.15 Tourism and recreation receptors within the study area may experience the 
following impacts: 
 
Visual; 
 
Noise; 
 
Traffic/accessibility; and 
 
Air quality. 
Structure of Assessment  
14.8.16 The tourism and recreation assessment assesses the potential impacts on four 
distinct components during three distinct phases. 
14.8.17 The four distinct components include the:   
 
Power Generator Plant only;  
 
Gas Connection;  
 
Electrical Connection; and   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
539 
 
 
The Project as a whole (above components combined)70  
14.8.18 The three district phases of the Project include the:  
 
Construction phase; 
 
Operational; and  
 
Decommissioning phase.  
14.8.19 The structure of this section ensures potential visual, noise, traffic and air 
quality impacts on each component during each phase are individually 
assessed. 
14.8.20 The magnitude of impact is then combined with assessed sensitivity and 
embedded mitigation to derive overall residual effect in Section 14.1271.  
Power Generation Plant  
Construction – Visual 
14.8.21 The ZTV shows that the stack is likely to be visible over a proportion of the 
study area.  The ZTV analysis used to determine visual impact is based on the 
topography of the land and does not take into account physical or natural 
aspects such as buildings and trees.  Visual impact is likely to be reduced due 
to the screening effect of buildings and woodland.  The Landscape and Visual 
chapter (Chapter 11) notes that ZTV mapping tends to over-estimate the extent 
of visibility.  The photomontages from key viewpoints produced to support 
Chapter 11 (Appendix 11.2) reinforce this assertion.   
14.8.22 The likelihood of significant impact reduces with distance.  Chapter 11 assumes 
that the visual effects of the Project will reduce as viewing distance increases.  
There is already industrialisation in nearby countryside in the form of two former 
clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South) and the remaining former 
brickworks buildings and chimneys of the Stewartby Brickworks to the north of 
the Project.   
14.8.23 Any operational impacts on walking routes during the construction phase will 
be short term and footpath diversions will be put in place. 
Construction – Noise 
14.8.24 Section 3.6, Chapter 3, lists a series of embedded mitigation measures to 
minimise noise impacts including the implementation of a CEMP during the 
construction period.  As a result, the assessment of noise effects states that 
                                                           
 
 
70 Please note the Project as a whole is summarised in Section 14.10 (along with socio-economics and 
community infrastructure).

Construction – Traffic/ accessibility  
14.8.25 Section 3.6 provides some embedded mitigation measures including the 
implementation of a CTMP.  The implementation of a CTMP during the 
construction phase should ensure that no tourism or recreational related 
businesses/receptors are affected significantly by traffic.   
Construction – Air quality 
14.8.26 Any air quality impacts are expected to be primarily restricted to the immediate 
local area around the Project Site.   
14.8.27 Section 3.6 provides some embedded mitigation measures including 
adherence to a CEMP which will limit dust emissions during construction. 
14.8.28 The adherence to these measures should ensure that no tourism or 
recreational related businesses or receptors are affected significantly during 
construction or operation. 
Construction - Summary 
14.8.29 A summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Power Generation Plant 
during construction on tourism and recreation receptors is provided below in 
Table 14.25. Taking into consideration the magnitude of change identified 
below, together with the sensitivity of receptor (as defined in Table 14.18) the 
significance of effect on all tourism and recreational receptors would be no 
greater than ‘slight’ in all cases and therefore not significant.

Operation – Visual 
14.8.30 Chapter 11 Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment confirmed that the 
Power Generation Plant would sit within a context where industrialisation of the 
countryside has already taken place.  Examples include the existing wind farm 
at the Millennium Country Park, existing railways with gantries and 
embankments, pylons associated with the existing 400 kV Sundon to Grendon 
line and the four remaining chimneys at the former brickworks at Stewartby.   
Operation – Noise 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
542 
 
14.8.31 The noise impacts of the Project will be localised and will not affect 
tourism/recreation receptors within the Study Area.   
Operation – Traffic/ accessibility 
14.8.32 The assessment of traffic impacts presented in Chapter 12 anticipates there 
will be negligible effects on the surrounding transport network during the 
operational phase as traffic to the Power Generation Plant would be limited to 
occasional maintenance vehicles, deliveries and visitor access to the Power 
Generation Plant.   
Operation – Air quality 
14.8.33 The assessment of air quality effects in Chapter 6 concludes that there are not 
anticipated to be any likely significant effects on air quality receptors.   
Operation - Summary 
14.8.34 A summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Power Generation Plant 
on tourism and recreation receptors is provided below in Table 14.26. Taking 
into consideration the magnitude of change identified below, together with the 
sensitivity of receptor (as defined in Table 14.18) the significance of effect on 
all tourism and recreational receptors would be no greater than ‘slight’ in all 
cases and therefore not significant.

Decommissioning 
14.8.35 The magnitude of impact noted in the construction sections above for the 
Power Generation Plant are anticipated to be the same for the 
decommissioning phase.   
Gas Connection 
Construction – Visual 
14.8.36 Any visual impacts would be predominately restricted to the construction phase 
of the connection.  Any impacts on walkers during the construction phase will 
be short term. These would be temporary and through the adoption of the 
mitigation measures mentioned in Chapter 11 (e.g.  a landscape and ecology 
mitigation and management strategy) there should be no significant adverse 
visual effects on tourism and recreation receptors within the study area. 
Construction – Noise 
14.8.37 As noise impacts assessed in Chapter 7 will be primarily limited to the 
construction phase, they would be temporary.  The mitigation measures noted 
in Section 3.6 should ensure that no tourism or recreational related businesses 
or receptors are affected significantly during construction or operation. 
Construction – Traffic/ accessibility   
14.8.38 Chapter 12 confirms that construction vehicle movements will not lead to 
significant impacts.  Therefore, no tourism or recreational related 
businesses/receptors will be affected significantly.   
Construction – Air quality 
14.8.39 Any air quality impacts are expected to be primarily restricted to the immediate 
local area around the proposed Project Site.  As stated above there are two 
tourist attractions and one promoted path in close proximity to the Project Site.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
544 
 
The adoption of the mitigation measures mentioned in Section 3.6 should 
ensure that no tourism or recreational related businesses or receptors are 
affected significantly during construction.   
Construction - Summary 
14.8.40 A summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Gas Connection during 
construction on tourism and recreation receptors is provided below in Table 
14.27. Taking into consideration the magnitude of change identified below, 
together with the sensitivity of receptor (as defined in Table 14.18) the 
significance of effect on all tourism and recreational receptors would be no 
greater than ‘slight’ in all cases and therefore not significant.

Operation – Visual 
14.8.41 The assessment of landscape and visual effects (Chapter 11) has suggested 
that there are not considered to be any impacts arising from visual amenity as 
a result of operation of the Gas Connection.   
Operation – Noise   
14.8.42 The assessment of noise effects (Chapter 7) confirmed that the operational 
noise and vibration effects of the Gas Connection will be negligible adverse.   
Operation – Traffic 
14.8.43 The assessment of traffic effects (Chapter 12) has confirmed a minimal number 
of movements to the Gas Connection during the Operational phase (less than 
1 per week).  Therefore, there are not anticipated to be any effects on tourism 
and recreational receptors.   
Operation – Air quality  
14.8.44 The assessment of air quality effects (Chapter 6) confirmed that the Gas 
Connection is unlikely to result in impacts on air quality and was has therefore 
been scoped out of the assessment.   
Operation - Summary 
14.8.45 A Summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Gas Connection during 
operation on tourism and recreation receptors is provided below in Table 14.28 
which confirms no significant effects. Taking into consideration the magnitude 
of change identified below, together with the sensitivity of receptor (as defined 
in Table 14.18) the significance of effect on all tourism and recreational 
receptors would be no greater than ‘slight’ in all cases and therefore not 
significant.

Electrical Connection  
Construction – Visual 
14.8.46 The Electrical Connection is not in the immediate proximity of any visitor 
attractions. Any impacts on walkers during the construction phase will be short 
term.  Through the adoption of the mitigation measures mentioned in Chapter 
11 (e.g. landscape and ecology mitigation and management strategy) there 
should be no significant adverse visual effects on tourism and recreation 
receptors within the Study Area. 
Construction – Noise 
14.8.47 Any noise impacts associated with the construction phase would be temporary.  
The mitigation measures noted in Section 3.6 should ensure that no tourism or 
recreational related businesses or receptors are affected significantly during 
construction or operation. 
Construction – Traffic/ accessibility  
14.8.48 Users of the road network may be affected by additional construction 
work/workers travelling to the area.  However, the construction phase of the 
Gas Connection is not anticipated to generate an amount of traffic movements 
which would have a likely significant detrimental effect on tourism or 
recreational related businesses/receptors.

Operation – Visual 
14.8.51 The assessment of landscape and visual impacts (Chapter 11) states that 
views of the Electrical Connection will be generally not significant given that the 
majority of it will be underground.  It will be seen within a context of existing 
industrialisation of countryside and existing hedges and belts of woodland will 
also provide some screening.   
Operation – Noise   
14.8.52 The assessment of noise (Chapter 7) confirm that the residual noise and 
vibration effects of the Electrical Connection are not anticipated to be 
significant.   
Operation – Traffic 
14.8.53 The assessment of traffic movements during the operational phase of the 
Electrical Connection are not anticipated to be significant (of the order of 1 per 
week) and therefore no likely significant effects are anticipated on tourism or 
recreational receptors.

Decommissioning 
14.8.56 The effects noted in the construction sections above for the Electrical 
Connection will be the same for the decommissioning phase. 
14.9 
Assessment of Effects: Community Infrastructure Receptors 
Power Generation Plant 
14.9.1 
Community Infrastructure receptors within the study area may experience the 
following effects: 
 
Visual; 
 
Noise; 
 
Traffic/accessibility; and  
 
Air quality 
Construction/Decommissioning – Visual 
14.9.2 
It is considered unlikely that the operation or effectiveness of community 
facilities would be affected by the appearance of the Power Generation Plant 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
550 
 
during construction.  Patronage of community facilities and recreational 
facilities is primarily driven by demand for the activity they host.  As long as 
services or facilities can be provided from the receptor the visual appearance 
of the development should not affect levels of patronage or its operation.   
14.9.3 
The ZTV analysis used to determine visual impact is based on the topography 
of the land and does not take into account physical or natural aspects such as 
buildings and trees.  Visual impact is likely to be reduced due to the screening 
effect of buildings and woodland.  The Landscape and visual chapter (Chapter 
11) notes that a ZTV map does not account for views such as buildings, trees 
and hedgerows.  This means that ZTV mapping tends to over-estimate the 
extent of visibility.   
14.9.4 
The anticipated magnitude of visual impact on community infrastructure is 
anticipated to be in the worst case minor adverse.  Taking into consideration 
the low/medium sensitivity and minor adverse impact, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Construction/ Decommissioning – Noise 
14.9.5 
Any noise impacts during construction are expected to be restricted to the 
immediate area of the Power Generation Plant.  As there are no community 
facilities in the immediate vicinity of the Project, noise is not therefore expected 
to be a significant issue for community infrastructure.  The magnitude of the 
impact is considered negligible adverse.  Taking into consideration the 
low/medium sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Construction/ Decommissioning – Traffic/ accessibility 
14.9.6 
Whilst there may be some occasional, temporary and short term delays on the 
local road network during the construction phase as a result of additional 
construction traffic, the implementation of an appropriate CTMP during the 
construction phase should ensure that no community facilities are significantly 
affected.   
14.9.7 
The magnitude of the impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and minor adverse impact, the likely 
effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Construction/ Decommissioning – Air quality 
14.9.8 
Any air quality impacts are expected to be restricted to the immediate local area 
around the proposed Project Site.  As stated above there are no community 
facilities situated within the Project Site or within close proximity.   
14.9.9 
There will be no permanent residual risks associated with the construction of 
the Project as confirmed in Chapter 6 (air quality).  Therefore, air quality is not 
expected to be a significant issue for community facilities in the area. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
551 
 
14.9.10 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the 
likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Operation – Visual 
14.9.11 The assessment of landscape and visual effects (Chapter 11) states that the 
Power Generation Plant would sit within a context where industrialisation of 
countryside has already taken place.  Examples include the existing wind farm 
at the Millennium Country Park, existing railways with gantries and 
embankments, pylons associated with the existing 400 kV Sundon to Grendon 
line and the four remaining chimneys at the former brickworks at Stewartby.   
14.9.12 The magnitude of impact is considered to be minor adverse on community 
infrastructure.  Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity and the 
minor adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore 
not significant.    
Operation –Noise 
14.9.13 The assessment of noise effects (Chapter 7) anticipates that any operational 
noise effects are predominately localised to the immediate area and given that 
there are no community infrastructure receptors within close proximity of the 
Project, the overall magnitude of impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking 
into consideration the low/medium sensitivity and minor adverse impact, the 
likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Operation –Traffic/ accessibility 
14.9.14 The assessment of traffic and transport related effects (Chapter 12) assesses 
that there will be negligible effects on the surrounding transport network during 
the operational phase as traffic to the Power Generation Plant would be limited 
to occasional maintenance vehicles, deliveries and visitor access.   Therefore, 
the magnitude of the impact on community infrastructure receptors is 
considered negligible adverse.  Taking into consideration the low/medium 
sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant.    
Operation –Air quality 
14.9.15 The assessment of air quality effects (Chapter 6) concludes that the effects of 
operational air quality are not anticipated to be significant.  Therefore, the 
magnitude of the impact on community infrastructure receptors is considered 
negligible adverse.  Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity and 
negligible adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight adverse and 
therefore not significant.    
Gas Connection 
Construction/ Decommissioning – Visual 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
552 
 
14.9.16 Any visual effects during the construction phase of the Gas Connection   would 
be temporary.  The Gas Connection is not in the immediate proximity of any 
community infrastructure receptors.  Through the adoption of the embedded 
mitigation measures outlined in Section 3.6 (e.g. planting around the AGI) there 
should be no significant adverse visual effects on community infrastructure 
receptors within the Study Area.   
14.9.17 The magnitude of the impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity of community infrastructure receptors 
and minor adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight adverse and 
therefore not significant.    
Construction/ Decommissioning – Noise 
14.9.18 Any noise impacts associated with the construction phase would be temporary. 
There are no community facilities sufficiently close to experience noise 
impacts.   The mitigation measures noted in Section 3.6 should ensure that no 
community 
infrastructure 
receptors 
are 
affected 
significantly 
during 
construction or operation. 
14.9.19 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible.  Taking into

14.9.20 Users of the road network may also be affected by additional construction 
work/workers travelling to the area.  However, the implementation of the

ensure that no community infrastructure receptors are affected significantly.

14.9.22 The adherence to the mitigation measures set out in Section 3.6 should ensure 
that no community infrastructure receptors are affected significantly during 
construction or operation.   
14.9.23 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the 
likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Operation – Visual 
14.9.24 The assessment of landscape and visual impacts (Chapter 11) anticipates no 
significant impacts arising as a result of operation of the Gas Connection.  The 
magnitude of the impact on community infrastructure receptors is considered 
negligible adverse.  Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
553 
 
negligible adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight adverse and 
therefore not significant.    
Operation – Noise 
14.9.25 The assessment of noise effects (Chapter 7) anticipates that the noise and 
vibration effects from operation of the Gas Connection will be negligible.  
Accordingly, the magnitude of the impact is considered negligible adverse for 
community infrastructure receptors.  Taking into consideration the low/medium 
sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant.    
Operation – Traffic/ accessibility 
14.9.26 The assessment of traffic and transport effects (Chapter 12) anticipates a 
minimal number of movements to the Gas Connection during the operational 
phase (less than 1 per week).  The magnitude of impact on community 
infrastructure receptors therefore is negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the 
likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Operation – Air quality 
14.9.27 The assessment of air quality effects (Chapter 6) confirm that the operation of 
the Gas Connection is unlikely to result in impacts on air quality and was 
therefore scoped out of the assessment.  The impact on community 
infrastructure receptors therefore is negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the 
likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Electrical Connection 
Construction/ Decommissioning – Visual 
14.9.28 The Electrical Connection is not in the immediate proximity of any community 
infrastructure receptors.  Through the adoption of the embedded mitigation 
measures outlined in Section 3.6 there should be no significant adverse visual 
effects on community infrastructure receptors within the Study Area, 
particularly as the majority of the Electrical Connection will be underground. 
14.9.29 The magnitude of the impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and minor adverse impact, the likely 
effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Construction/ Decommissioning – Noise 
14.9.30 Any noise impacts during the construction phase would be temporary and not 
considered significant.  As stated above there are no community infrastructure 
receptors sufficiently close to experience noise impacts.   The embedded 
mitigation measures outlined in Section 3.6 should ensure that no community

infrastructure receptors are affected significantly during construction or 
operation.   
14.9.31 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and negligible adverse impact, the 
likely effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
Construction/ Decommissioning – Traffic/ accessibility 
14.9.32 Users of the road network may be affected by additional construction 
work/workers travelling to the area.  However, the implementation of the 
embedded mitigation measures stated in Section 3.6 during the construction 
phase should ensure that no community infrastructure receptors are affected 
significantly.   
14.9.33 The magnitude of the impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and minor adverse impact, the likely 
effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.    
 
 
Construction/ Decommissioning – Air quality 
14.9.34 Any air quality impacts are expected to be restricted to the immediate local area 
around the Project Site.  As stated above there is not a significant cluster of 
community facilities around the Project Site.  Therefore, air quality is not 
expected to be a significant issue for community infrastructure receptors in the 
area. 
14.9.35 The adoption of the mitigation measures mentioned in Chapter 6 should ensure 
that no community infrastructure receptors are affected significantly during 
construction or operation. 
14.9.36 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible.  Taking into

Operation – Noise 
14.9.38 The assessment of noise effects (Chapter 7) anticipates that the residual noise 
and vibration effects of the Electrical Connection are likely to be of minor 
significance.  Accordingly, the magnitude of the impact is considered minor 
adverse for community infrastructure receptors.  Taking into consideration the 
low/medium sensitivity and minor impact, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant.

14.9.39 The assessment of traffic effects (Chapter 12) anticipates that there would be

is negligible adverse.  Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity and 
negligible adverse impact, the likely effect would be slight adverse and

Operation – Air quality 
14.9.40 The assessment of air quality effects (Chapter 6) confirms that there are 
unlikely to be any air quality effects arising from operation of the Electrical 
Connection and was therefore scoped out of the assessment.  The impact on 
community infrastructure receptors therefore is negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity and negligible impact, the likely effect 
would be slight adverse and therefore not significant.

Project as a Whole  
Socio-economics

pressure is considered in section 14.76.72   
Tourism and Recreation  
Construction – Visual 
14.10.2 During construction, some visual effects will be created.  However, given the 
lack of tourism/recreation receptors within close proximity of the Project, the 
overall impact is not significant on tourism.  The siting of the Project and the 
adoption of the mitigation measures noted in Chapter 11 (e.g. landscape and 
ecology mitigation strategy) will reduce the visual affect further.  There are also

examples of other energy infrastructure in the area which will lessen the visual 
effect further. 
14.10.3 The anticipated magnitude of visual impact is anticipated to be minor adverse.  
Taking into consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Construction – Noise 
14.10.4 Any noise impacts are expected to be predominately restricted to the 
immediate area of the Project.  There is not a significant cluster of tourism-
related activity in this area.  Noise is not therefore expected to be a significant 
issue for tourism activity. 
14.10.5 Adherence to the mitigation measures noted in Section 3.6 will ensure that 
there will be no significant adverse noise effects.   
14.10.6 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be slight adverse 
and therefore not significant. 
Construction – Traffic/ accessibility  
14.10.7 There will be some disruption on the road network as a result of construction 
traffic coming and going from the Project Site.  However, the implementation of 
the embedded mitigation measures outlined in Section 3.6 should ensure that 
no tourism or recreational related businesses/receptors are affected 
significantly.    
14.10.8 The magnitude of the impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be slight adverse 
and therefore not significant. 
Construction – Air quality 
14.10.9 Any air quality impacts are expected to be primarily restricted to the immediate 
local area around the proposed Project Site.  As stated above there is not a 
significant cluster of tourism-related activity around the proposed Project Site.  
Therefore, air quality is not expected to be a significant issue for tourism in the 
area. 
14.10.10 Adoption of the embedded mitigation measures noted in Section 3.6 should 
ensure that no tourism or recreational related businesses or receptors are 
affected significantly during construction or operation. 
14.10.11 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible.  Taking into

and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Visual 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

14.10.12 Views will be restricted to receptors with distant partial views. As stated above, 
the Project will sit within a context where industrialisation of the countryside 
has already taken place.   
14.10.13 The impact on tourism and recreational receptors therefore is minor adverse.  
Taking into consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Noise   
14.10.14 The noise impacts of the Project will be predominately localised and will not 
affect tourism/recreation receptors within the Study Area.   The magnitude of 
the impact is therefore considered minor adverse for tourism and recreational 
receptors.  Taking into consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely effect 
would be slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Traffic 
14.10.15 An assessment of traffic and transport related effects (Chapter 12) anticipates 
that traffic to the Project Site will be infrequent during the operational phase.  
The magnitude of impact on tourism and recreational receptors therefore is 
negligible adverse.  Taking into consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely 
effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Air quality  
14.10.16 The assessment of air quality effects (Chapter 6) anticipates that the Project 
as a whole is unlikely to result in impacts on air quality during the operational 
phase.  The impact on tourism and recreational receptors therefore is negligible 
adverse.  Taking into consideration the medium sensitivity, the likely effect 
would be slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Decommissioning  
14.10.17 The effects noted in the construction sections above for the Project as a whole 
are anticipated to be the same for the decommissioning phase. 
Community Infrastructure 
Construction – Visual 
14.10.18 During construction, some visual effects will be created.  However, given the 
lack of community infrastructure receptors within close proximity of the Project, 
the overall impact is not significant.  The siting of the Project and the adoption 
of the embedded mitigation measures outlined in Section 3.6 will reduce the 
visual affect further.  There are also examples of other energy infrastructure in 
the area which will lessen the visual effect further. 
14.10.19 The anticipated magnitude of visual impact is anticipated to be minor adverse.  
Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant.

14.10.20 Any noise impacts are expected to be primarily restricted to the immediate area

area.  Noise is not therefore expected to be a significant issue for community 
infrastructure receptors. 
14.10.21 Adherence to the mitigation measures noted in Section 3.6 will ensure that 
there will be no significantly adverse noise impacts.   
14.10.22 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant. 
Construction – Traffic/ accessibility 
14.10.23 There will be some disruption on the road network as a result of construction 
traffic coming and going from the Project Site.  However, the implementation of 
the embedded mitigation measures outlined in Section 3.6 should ensure that 
no community infrastructure receptors are affected significantly.   
14.10.24 The magnitude of the impact is considered minor adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant. 
Construction – Air quality 
14.10.25 Any air quality impacts are expected to be predominately restricted to the 
immediate local area around the Project Site.  As stated above there is not a 
significant cluster of community infrastructure receptors around the Project 
Site.  Therefore, air quality is not expected to be a significant issue in the area. 
14.10.26 Adoption of the mitigation measures noted in Section 3.6 should ensure that 
no community infrastructure receptors are affected significantly during 
construction or operation. 
14.10.27 The magnitude of the impact is considered negligible.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Visual 
14.10.28 As previously discussed there are no community infrastructure receptors within 
immediate proximity of the Project.  Views will therefore be restricted to 
receptors with distant partial views.  As stated in the Construction section, any 
visual impact should be reduced if the mitigation measures mentioned in 
Chapter 11 (landscape and visual assessment) are adopted.  Moreover, the 
Project will sit within a context where industrialisation of the countryside has 
already taken place.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

14.10.29 The impact on community infrastructure receptors therefore is minor adverse.  
Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Noise 
14.10.30 The noise impacts of the Project will be primarily localised and will not affect 
community infrastructure receptors within the Study Area.   The magnitude of 
the impact is therefore considered negligible for community infrastructure 
receptors.   Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely 
effect would be slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Traffic/ accessibility 
14.10.31 The assessment of traffic and transport related effects (Chapter 12) anticipates 
that traffic to the Project Site will be infrequent during the operational phase.  
The impact on community infrastructure receptors therefore is negligible.  
Taking into consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be 
slight adverse and therefore not significant. 
Operation – Air quality 
14.10.32 The Air Quality Chapter confirmed that the Project as a whole is unlikely to 
result in impacts on air quality during the operational phase.  The impact on 
community infrastructure receptors therefore is negligible adverse.  Taking into 
consideration the low/medium sensitivity, the likely effect would be slight 
adverse and therefore not significant. 
Decommissioning 
14.10.33 The effects noted in the construction sections above for the Project as a whole 
are anticipated to be the same for the decommissioning phase.

14.11.4 The Absorption Capacity Table 14.32 below demonstrates sufficient labour in 
within the wider area & region drive time of the Project to build all of the 
cumulative projects (i.e. the total requirement does not exceed 15% for any 
category).  The wider area (45- minute drive time) and region (60-minute drive 
time) have been considered for construction employment impacts since 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
563 
 
construction labour is more likely to come from these areas than from the local 
labour market74.The cumulative projects could therefore be built using labour 
from the Project labour market area without creating any minor labour market 
distortions.  In reality the labour market for the cumulative projects will be much 
wider than the Project labour market area providing access to a wider labour 
pool.

14.11.5 The Absorption Capacity analysis assumes a worst case scenario (i.e. all 
cumulative projects will be constructed at the same time.)  In practice this is 
unlikely to occur for a number of reasons:   
 
Some of the projects may not be consented or developed;    
 
The construction of the noted schemes is unlikely to take place concurrently.  
Some involve construction over a more extended period than the Project 
(further diluting absorption effects);  
                                                           
 
 
74 The Construction Industry Training Board research document (2015) suggests that about 50% of construction 
workers in the East of England regularly travel more than 50 miles to their place of work. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
564 
 
 
The labour market catchments for a number of the noted projects will differ 
from that of the Project;  
 
A number of the projects are likely to require more specialist construction 
skills.  It is unlikely that the construction needs for all of the projects noted 
can be met from within localised catchments;  
 
Construction labour is highly mobile and flexible.  Should capacity 
bottlenecks emerge, labour can generally be brought in from further afield; 
and  
 
A proportion of specialist labour would be sourced from across the UK.    
14.11.6 It is therefore considered based on this assessment that there will be no 
cumulative impact on the wider labour market area, as the total projects are 
anticipated to constitute below 15% of total construction labour in the wider 
area.  Combined, the cumulative projects will provide a positive stimulus to the 
study area economy through the provision of construction related training and 
employment 
opportunities, 
supply 
chain 
linkages 
and 
demand 
for 
accommodation, food and drink services.  
Cumulative 
effects: 
Tourism 
and 
Recreation 
and 
Community 
Infrastructure 
14.11.7 Construction and decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects located in the vicinity of the Project Site.  The Air Quality, 
Noise, LVIA and Traffic Chapters all conclude that there would be no significant 
adverse cumulative effects.  Therefore, it can be assumed that cumulative 
impacts on tourism and recreation receptors and community infrastructure 
receptors 
would 
also 
be 
not 
significant 
during 
the 
construction/decommissioning process given the distance of these receptors 
from the Project Site (all further away than the closest sensitive receptors 
assessed in those respective chapters).   
14.11.8 As with the construction/decommissioning phases, the Air Quality, Noise and 
Traffic Chapters all confirm that during operation there will not be significant 
cumulative effects.  As a result, it is not envisaged that there will be adverse 
impacts on tourism and recreation receptors and community infrastructure 
receptors during the operation phase given the distance of these receptors 
from the Project Site (all further away than the closest sensitive receptors 
assessed in those respective chapters).     
14.12 
Mitigation and Assessment of Residual Effects 
Socio economics 
14.12.1 Mitigation is not required for slight adverse impacts. Therefore, no additional 
mitigation is provided.   
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement 
 
565 
 
Tourism 
14.12.2 The tourism receptors will not be significantly affected and mitigation will not 
be required for these slight adverse impacts.   
Community Infrastructure 
14.12.3 The community infrastructure assessment shows that there are a limited 
number of community facilities in close proximity to the Project.   
14.12.4 Therefore no mitigation is required because no significant effects are identified.   
14.13 
Summary of Residual Effects 
14.13.1 Table 14.33, Table 14.34 and Table 14.35 set out a summary of the significant 
effects arising from the Project during construction, operation and de-
commissioning for socio-economics, tourism and recreation and community 
infrastructure assessments.  
14.13.2 The assessment uses the receptor sensitivity and magnitude of impact criteria 
in Tables 14.2 -14.7 and the Significance of effect criteria in Table 14.8.

Conclusions  
14.14.1 This chapter assessed the Project’s potential to create socio-economic effects 
from increased investment in the local economy, increased demand for labour 
and increased pressure on the areas community infrastructure.  Effects on the 
area's tourism economy and recreational assets were also assessed.  Potential 
effects were considered for during the construction, operational and 
decommissioning phases.   
Baseline   
14.14.2 The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using standard 
indicators.  This provides a baseline from which potential impacts and effects 
can be assessed.   
14.14.3 The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the Project 
is characterised by a pattern of population increase which is expected to 
continue until 2021.  The area has a declining work age population with more 
than one fifth of the population expected to be at retirement age by 2021.  This 
is also coupled with high economic activity which is higher than the UK average.  
Retail work is the main employment category in the local area, and is above 
the national average.  Tourism volume and value in Central Bedfordshire 
recovered strongly during the period 2011-13 but has decreased slightly to 
2013-2015.  It now accounts for approximately one third of Bedfordshire’s 
tourism 
economy. 
 
Previously 
Central 
Bedfordshire 
accounted 
for 
approximately a quarter of Bedfordshire’s tourism volume and value.  Tourist 
trips and bed-nights are now just above 2006 levels.   
14.14.4 The tourism audit and community infrastructure audit have identified receptors 
within the study areas. This has allowed potential impacts and effects to be 
assessed.   
Construction Phase  
14.14.5 The Project will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of the 
area through both employment creation and capital expenditure and worker 
spending in the local economy.  It is anticipated that up to 122 construction 
workers would be required at the Project Site during peak periods at any one 
time.  Project construction would support up to nine permanent full time 
equivalent construction jobs and deliver £6.4 million GVA to the wider 
economy.   
14.14.6 These workers would not only benefit the economy directly, but would also 
have knock on effects on other businesses (e.g. slight positive impact to 
accommodation providers in providing accommodation for temporary workers). 
14.14.7 No likely significant impacts are predicted on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of the Project from visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts, given that assessments in Chapters 11, 7, 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
594 
 
12 and 6 respectively have concluded that there will be no likely significant 
effects arising from these areas.   
14.14.8 A total of 6,826 temporary construction jobs would be required to build nearby 
projects.  The assessment shows that there is sufficient labour in a 60-minute 
drive time of the Project to build all of the cumulative projects.  The cumulative 
projects could therefore be built using labour from the Project labour market 
area without creating any minor labour market distortions.  The projects would 
therefore contribute to an overall slight benefit in terms of job creation.   
Operational Phase 
14.14.9 During operation, there will be 10 FTE jobs created at the Project Site.  This is 
anticipated to bring minor beneficial effects to the area in the vicinity of the 
Project Site through the generation of jobs, supply chain linkages and 
employee spending.   The Project’s operation would provide approximately 
£0.85m GVA and £0.50m GVA per annum to the local and national economy 
respectively.   
14.14.10 No likely significant impacts are predicted on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of operation of the Project from visual, noise, traffic 
and accessibility and air quality impacts, given that assessments in Chapters 
7, 12 and 6 respectively have concluded that there will be no likely significant 
effects arising from these areas on tourism or community assets.   
Decommissioning Phase  
14.14.11 The labour requirement for the decommissioning programme is unknown but 
is not expected to exceed that of the construction phase.  Decommissioning 
effects are therefore considered to be likely to be similar to the construction 
impacts.  The Project’s decommissioning phase will therefore provide an 
overall ‘slight’ beneficial employment impact.   
14.14.12 The conclusions of this socio-economic assessment are that the construction, 
operation and maintenance and decommissioning of the Project does not result 
in any likely significant effects on socio-economic matters, either when 
considered alone or cumulatively with other developments.

Other Issues Considered 
15.1 
Introduction 
15.1.1 
It is recognised that during the EIA process, some of the statutory consultees 
have raised concerns that the Project may give rise to likely significant 
environmental effects over and above those described in Chapters 6-14 of this 
ES. Specifically, the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 1.2) requests that the ES 
describes the likely significant environmental impacts of the types of waste 
generated by the Project at all stages and the method/s of removing it, including 
identifying potential transport routes, as well as the impact of the Project on 
human health with specific focus on the Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) arising 
from operation of the Electrical Connection.  
15.1.2 
This chapter presents an assessment of the likely significant environmental 
effects of waste generated by the Project and the likely significant effects of the 
Project on human health (including focussing on EMF). It also considers 
residential amenity, together with the mitigation measures envisaged in order 
to avoid, reduce and, if possible, offset significant adverse effects.   
15.2 
Waste 
Construction and Decommissioning 
15.2.1 
As part of the construction works for the Project, there is likely to be limited 
potential for the generation of waste associated with the Power Generation 
Plant. This is mainly due to the fact that the LLRS will ensure that a level 
platform is created in the base of the Rookery South Pit suitable for siting the 
Generating Equipment. There are therefore not anticipated to be large 
quantities of earth moving required for site levelling which can sometimes be 
required for this type of construction project.  
15.2.2 
There may however be small amounts of waste spoil produced from 
excavations for foundations of the Generating Equipment and for levelling of 
the Access Road.  
15.2.3 
There may also be small amounts of waste spoil produced from excavations 
for the Gas Connection (e.g. pipeline trench and ground preparation works) for 
the AGI and for the cable trench and SECs associated with the Electrical 
Connection. 
15.2.4 
The construction and decommissioning phases of the Project will operate in full 
accordance with the Waste Framework Directive and the Waste (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2011 (where relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the 
Project, will seek to apply the waste hierarchy as part of their waste prevention 
and management policy as part of the CEMP – an outline of which is presented 
in Appendix 3.2.  
15.2.5 
The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
596 
 
 
Prevention; 
 
Re-use; 
 
Recycling; 
 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
 
Disposal. 
 
15.2.6 
Therefore, in the first instance, waste will be minimised as far as reasonably 
practical. It is envisaged that where possible the small amounts of waste spoil, 
detailed above, will be re-used on the Project Site for e.g. landscaping. This is 
likely to be a practical use of waste spoil as an assessment of the ground 
conditions at the Project Site, presented in Chapter 10 of the ES, has 
suggested that there is a low risk of contaminated materials being present.  
15.2.7 
An Outline CEMP has been prepared and is presented in Appendix 3.2. This 
forms the framework upon which the final CEMP will be produced by the 
principal construction contractor. The Outline CEMP provides for the 
submission of construction method statements for approval by the local 
authority prior to commencement of construction as well as provision for a site 
waste management strategy. 
15.2.8 
Measures would include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil 
and testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria75, to determine whether it can be re-
used on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water 
from de-watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
15.2.9 
In order to facilitate the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive 
during decommissioning, much of the structures and equipment for the Project 
will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far as is practicable. For 
example, of the use of pre-fabricated steel which would be of interest to scrap 
metal merchants. 
15.2.10 It is likely that some underground structures, including the cables associated 
with the Electrical Connection and Pipeline associated with the Gas 
Connection, may be left in situ to avoid any adverse environmental impacts 
associated with their removal. Due regard would be paid to all best practice 
guidelines on the decommissioning of projects which are relevant at the time. 
Where possible, items of plant would be re-cycled or re-used.  
15.2.11 The CEMP would ensure that all types of waste generated during the 
construction stage of the Project will be dealt with in a manner that complies

Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
597 
 
with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project Site) waste will be 
treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors.  
15.2.12 The routes used for construction traffic entering and leaving the Project Site 
are described in section 12.6. These routes would also be used during 
construction and decommissioning for the removal of any waste materials.  
Operation 
15.2.13 During operation a feature of the Gas Turbine Generator technology to be 
incorporated in the Project (as described in Chapters 3 and 5) is that waste 
generated should be minimal and will be restricted to the following: 
 
General office waste; 
 
Used air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
15.2.14 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the 
Project Site at any time, comprising e.g. lubricating oils for continued 
maintenance of the Generating Equipment. Any such substances will be held 
in secured containers to prevent contaminant migration (e.g. bunded to 110% 
of the capacity of any tank). These substances will be used up during operation 
of the Generating Equipment, and so large quantities of waste substances are 
not anticipated. Closed storage facilities or suitable dampening techniques will 
be utilised within the Project where emissions of dust etc. from waste are 
possible.  
15.2.15 Where waste does require removal from site during maintenance (e.g. 
substances set out above) this will be via a dedicated contractor licensed to 
handle and treat, recycle or dispose of such wastes. Routes for waste removal 
would be as per operational access requirements described in section 12.6.  
15.2.16 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that the Project will not result in 
any likely significant environmental effects with respect to waste.  
15.3 
Human Health 
Introduction 
15.3.1 
The potential for likely significant effects of the Project on human health relate 
primarily, to exposure to excessive levels of noise, pollutants released during 
construction or operation of the Project (to the air, water or land) as well as 
effects relating to EMFs.  
15.3.2 
An assessment of the likely significant environmental effects from noise and 
pollution are described in more detail in Chapters 6 (Air Quality), 7 (Noise and 
Vibration), 9 (Water Quality and Resources) and 10 (Ground Conditions) of this 
ES and effects on Socio-economics (e.g. wellbeing) have been covered in 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
598 
 
Chapter 14. It is therefore not the aim of this section to repeat these 
assessments, but rather to highlight the conclusions of these Chapters relating 
specifically to human health as well as to outline the findings of a separate EMF 
report.  
Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) 
15.3.3 
EMF can be generated from high voltage electrical equipment under certain 
weather conditions. The resultant impact may be a crackle or loud hum noise. 
The potential effects relate only to the operational phase of the Electrical 
Connection for the Project as EMF is only generated through electrical 
infrastructure which is live and operational.  
15.3.4 
An EMF report has been prepared for the Project and is presented in Appendix 
15.1 A summary of this report is presented below: 
15.3.5 
UK power developers (such as the Applicant) rely on national guidelines in 
accordance with Government advice to ensure that new installations consider 
health risks based on current knowledge. The UK’s Health Protection Agency, 
previously the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), provides 
independent recommendations to the Government based on reviews of 
international study results. 
15.3.6 
In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to power-
frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) are 
adopted in the UK as recommended by the NRPB. 
15.3.7 
The electric fields due to the Substation would be inherently compliant with the 
public exposure limits as discussed above. The proposed Substation would be 
surrounded by an earthed metal fence and consequently the electric field 
outside of this fence due to the substation equipment it encloses would comply 
with ICNIRP exposure guidelines for the public. 
15.3.8 
There are no external electric fields associated with underground cables. 
Electric fields associated with underground cables are contained by the sheath 
of the cable itself. The public would thus not be exposed to electric fields from 
the proposed underground cables.  
15.3.9 
Some equipment within the Substation would produce magnetic fields, but 
these fields tend to diminish rapidly with increasing distance from the 
equipment. Magnetic fields outside the Substation due to these items of 
equipment are inherently compliant with public exposure limits, as discussed 
above.  
15.3.10 The prospective magnetic field strength due to the proposed underground 
cables is calculated to remain below the public exposure basic restriction 
levels. 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
599 
 
15.3.11 There will be a magnetic field due to the underground cables from the SECs 
beside the existing overhead line to the proposed Substation.  However, this 
will be a relatively short length of cable and given the conclusions above, there 
will be no impacts arising from this which could give rise to public health issues.   
Air Quality 
Construction and Decommissioning 
15.3.12 The results of the air quality assessment are set out in Chapter 6 of this ES.  
15.3.13 The likely significant effects on human health regarding air quality from 
construction and decommissioning of the Project relate to dust generated from 
construction activities (e.g. excavation for new foundations associated with the 
Substation and Generating Equipment, excavation of the Pipeline route and 
excavation for the Electrical Connection) and exhaust emissions from 
construction traffic. 
15.3.14 However, it is considered unlikely that levels of atmospheric dust would be 
generated which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to local people 
in the vicinity of the Project Site (Chapter 6, section 6.7). The limited numbers 
of vehicle movements associated with the Project means that significant effects 
on human health from exhaust emissions are not anticipated.  
15.3.15 Any significant adverse effects on human health arising from the dust 
generated during construction and decommissioning would be remedied 
through implementation of a CEMP, which would incorporate appropriate dust 
mitigation measures for low risk sites from IAQM guidance such as damping 
down or covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather. 
Additionally, 
the 
majority 
of 
particulates 
from 
construction 
and 
decommissioning activities settle within a very short distance of any 
construction site (approximately 200m). Therefore, effects on receptors further 
afield from the Project Site will be negligible and not significant.  
Operation 
15.3.16 The main likely significant effects on human health in relation to air quality 
arising from operation of the Project are associated with the stack emissions 
from combustion of natural gas in the Generating Equipment releasing 
emissions of NOx. 
15.3.17 However, modern gas fired power plant are inherently clean and produce far 
fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. coal) when compared 
on an energy output basis. Emissions of NOx are strictly limited under national 
and international guidelines such as the IED. Operation of the Generating 
Equipment will also be regulated by the EA under an Environmental Permit, 
which will limit emissions in line with national guidelines.  
15.3.18 Air quality modelling has shown that the stack height selected for the Project 
of 32.5 – 35 m will achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
600 
 
and prevent any impacts to identified receptors. It is concluded, therefore, that 
there will not be any likely significant effects on human health as a result of 
NOx emissions during the operational phase of the Project.   
15.3.19 During the operational phase of the Gas Connection, there may be some 
emissions from vehicles accessing the AGI for maintenance reasons. However, 
these will be so insignificant that they will not have a significant impact on 
human health.  
15.3.20 In terms of the Electrical Connection, very infrequent maintenance visits will 
also take place (up to two days a week for routine maintenance, and four weeks 
per year for annual maintenance).  In light of the above, there will not be any 
likely significant effects on human health as a result of maintenance vehicle 
emissions.   
Noise and Vibration 
Construction and Decommissioning 
15.3.21 Excavation for foundations for buildings across the Project Site, delivery of 
plant and excavation for laying the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
during construction and decommissioning could lead to increases in noise in 
the surrounding area. This will however be a temporary source of noise. The 
noise assessment is presented in Chapter 7. A numerical model has been 
created which assesses likely construction related noise in comparison to 
measured background levels of noise at the Project Site. Based on a 
conservative, realistic worst case assessment, where numerous large 
construction plant items are operating simultaneously, the likely significance of 
the overall effect of construction and decommissioning noise from the Power 
Generation Plant is predicted to be neutral at all receptor locations and 
therefore not significant following the implementation of embedded mitigation 
measures which include:  
 
A 10 dB reduction in construction noise due to use of an appropriately 
placed acoustic screen, which is typical of this type of construction / 
decommissioning activity; 
 
Implementation of a CEMP; and 
 
Use of appropriately maintained plant and equipment during construction 
and decommissioning.  
15.3.22 Additionally, further noise mitigation is available in the form of programming of 
the noisiest construction activities not to occur simultaneously, utilising a 
temporary noise bund and using quieter equipment. Such mitigation measures 
will be set out in the outline CEMP which will accompany the ES and be 
submitted with the DCO Application. 
15.3.23 The above mitigation means that there are not anticipated to be any likely 
significant effects on human health in relation to noise levels during 
construction and decommissioning.  
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
601 
 
Operation 
15.3.24 During operation, noise could occur from the rotating components of the 
Generating Equipment (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator), stack and Fin-Fan 
coolers when operational. There may also be a limited amount of noise from 
the Access Road from the small number of vehicles accessing the Generating 
Equipment Site, although the likely impact of this on human health will not be 
significant when compared to the existing traffic noise.  
15.3.25 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken 
at nearest noise sensitive receptors were modelled alongside noise levels 
predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the 
Project. 
15.3.26 This assessment has shown that at South Pillinge Farm (the nearest residential 
receptor), the predicted noise impact is 38 dB.  
15.3.27 The predicted noise levels are therefore below the proposed significant 
observed adverse effect level (SOAEL). This is defined as the level at which 
significant health effects on receptors is likely to occur or when noise causes a 
material change in behaviour and/or attitude, e.g. having to keep windows 
closed most of the time; avoiding certain activities during periods of intrusion; 
potential for sleep disturbance resulting in difficulty in getting back to sleep; or 
quality of life diminished due to change in acoustic character of the area.  
15.3.28 The predicted noise levels from the Generating Equipment fall within the 
proposed lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) and SOAEL for a 24 
hour operation as shown below: 
 
Proposed LOAEL – 44 dB LAeq,T,  
 
Predicted noise impact at Pillinge Cottages - 38 dB LAeq,T, 
 
Predicted noise impact at South Pillinge Farm - 38 dB LAeq,T, 
 
Proposed SOAEL – 49 dB LAeq,T  
15.3.29 The levels above for LOAEL and SOAEL are based on professional judgement 
and are specific to the Project, taking into consideration a number of factors 
such as the likely operating regime of the Generating Equipment and 
background noise sources. They also represent external noise levels, rather 
than inside the property of the nearest sensitive receptors.  
15.3.30 Therefore, there are not predicted to be any significant noise effects on human 
health at the nearest noise sensitive receptors.  
15.3.31 During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the AGI. 
This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the AGI regulates the 
flow of gas from the NTS to the Power Generation Plant. 
15.3.32 This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to the AGI. 
Given that there are no residential properties in close proximity to the current 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

preferred location for the AGI, it is considered that the operational noise from 
the Gas Connection is not likely to have a significant effect on human health. 
15.3.33 No significant effects on human health are considered likely from operation of 
the Electrical Connection, given that the underground connection will not 
generate any audible noise during operation.  
Pollution and Contamination 
15.3.34 A desk based assessment, together with targeted ground water sampling has 
been carried out to assess the baseline geology and ground conditions 
underlying the Project Site. The assessment studied information regarding 
previous land uses of the Project Site and the surrounding area, the soils and 
geology present at the Project Site, and any potential contamination issues 
resulting from former site uses. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
15.3.35 During construction of the Project, the main potential impacts to human health 
are from; 
 
Disturbance of any existing contamination and therefore causing effects to 
receptors through the creation of pollution pathways; and 
 
Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages or mobilisation of existing 
contamination. 
15.3.36 However, mitigation measures such as working within and adhering to a 
detailed CEMP will be employed to prevent any contamination or pollution 
incidents impacting on ground conditions. This will include having an 
appropriate spill response plan, correct re-fuelling of vehicles and plant on 
hardstanding and the correct storage of potentially hazardous substances in 
bunded storage tanks. These mitigation measures will ensure that there will be 
no likely significant effects from pollution and contamination on human health.  
Operation 
15.3.37 During the operational phase, there is the potential for the contamination of 
surface water resulting from the flushing of silts and hydrocarbons from areas 
of hardstanding within the Project Site.  However, such impacts would be 
controlled by the embedded mitigation measures implicit within the Project, 
comprising industry standard/best practice and measures required to ensure 
legislative compliance, contained within an operational environmental 
management plan secured through the EP.  On this basis, the impact is 
considered to be Negligible and is therefore not significant. 
15.4 
Cumulative Effects on Human Health 
15.4.1 
The section below presents an assessment of the likely significant cumulative 
effects on human health as a result of construction, decommissioning and 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement

operation of the Project together with other projects. Cumulative assessments 
are also provided in Chapters 6-14.  
15.4.2 
Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in Chapter 4, 
section 4.10.  However, the majority of these developments are all a significant 
distance from the Project Site and outside of the study areas of the topics listed 
above so as not to cause any cumulative impacts. Furthermore, none of these 
developments have predicted any likely significant impacts on human health 
and will be bound by their own CEMP and best practice construction methods 
so as to limit the potential for impacts on human health.  
 
15.4.3 
The assessment set out in this Chapter has shown no likely significant effects 
are anticipated to arise from construction of the Project on human health.   
15.4.4 
Little detail is known about the ‘Integrated Waste Management Facilities’ 
proposed for development in the Rookery Pit. At present, only a high level 
scoping opinion has been submitted. No details are proposed regarding 
potential impacts on human health as a result of the project. However, it is likely 
that this development will be bound by its own CEMP and best practice 
construction methods so as to limit impacts on human health. The assessment 
set out in this Chapter has shown no significant effects on human health are 
anticipated to arise from construction of the Project.  Accordingly, given that 
the Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects it is anticipated 
that no cumulative impacts will occur with these developments during 
construction. 
15.4.5 
The DCO for the Covanta RRF Project to the north of the Generating 
Equipment Site included a health impact assessment (HIA). The HIA concluded 
that although there were potential impacts arising from construction and 
decommissioning of the project on human health from air quality, noise, socio-
economics, traffic and visual effects, the implementation of mitigation 
measures precluded any impacts from the construction of the Rookery RRF. A 
summary of the possible cumulative effects is provided below by topic: 
Air Quality (including traffic) 
15.4.6 
The construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, as listed in 
section 4.10. However, most of the proposed developments are greater than 5 
km from the Project Site and outside of the study area for this topic within which 
potentially significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no 
cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of 
air quality.  
15.4.7 
The only projects listed in 4.10 which are considered relevant to the cumulative 
effects assessment for air quality are the Integrated Waste Management 
Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta RRF Project at 
Rookery South Pit.  
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
604 
 
15.4.8 
The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts 
on air quality as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would 
be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process 
for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
15.4.9 
The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that although there were 
potential 
impacts 
arising 
from 
air 
quality 
during 
construction 
or 
decommissioning, the implementation of embedded mitigation measures such 
as adhering to a CEMP for both projects will negate any effects on air quality. 
15.4.10 The proposed Covanta RRF project to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site will release both oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide from the 
combustion process.  However, the exhaust stack for the Covanta RRF will be 
much higher than the stack for the Project (105 m compared to 35 m) and 
therefore the location of maximum ground level concentrations will be different 
from those associated with the Project.   
15.4.11 Modelling has been undertaken of the emissions from the Covanta RRF and 
the Generating Equipment together and the results are contained in Appendix 
6.1.  There are no predicted exceedances of the assessment levels for human 
health impacts for the two plants operating together and therefore the 
cumulative effect will be negligible and not significant. 
15.4.12 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation along with the embedded mitigation in the Covanta 
RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects will arise between the 
Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other developments referred to in 
4.10. 
Noise and Vibration 
15.4.13 As for air quality, the only projects listed in 4.10 which are considered relevant 
to the cumulative effects assessment for noise and vibration are the Integrated 
Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
15.4.14 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts 
on air quality as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have to 
consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise 
between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future in 
relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would 
be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process 
for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development.

15.4.15 Cumulative noise modelling has been undertaken with the Project and the 
Covanta RRF project for construction and operation, assuming that the 
construction and operational phases 
of the 
projects 
would occur 
simultaneously. The results of the modelling are presented in Chapter 7. The 
modelling has predicted no likely significant effects arising from simultaneous 
construction and or operation of the two projects and therefore no likely 
significant cumulative effects.   
Pollution and Contamination 
15.4.16 As for air quality, the only projects listed in 4.10 which are considered relevant 
to the cumulative effects assessment for ground conditions are the Integrated 
Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Covanta 
RRF Project at Rookery South Pit.  
15.4.17 The proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and very little information is available regarding potential impacts 
on ground conditions as a result of this project. Should it go ahead it will have 
to consider the Project to ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will 
arise between it and the Project. As such, any mitigation that is needed in future 
in relation to cumulative effects as between this scheme and the Project would 
be assessed as part of (and could be secured through) the permission process 
for the proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development. 
15.4.18 The ES for the Covanta RRF Project concluded that there were no potential 
impacts arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on ground conditions.  
15.4.19 It is considered that, based on professional judgement, with the implementation 
of the embedded mitigation described in the ES along with the embedded 
mitigation in the Covanta RRF Project, no likely significant cumulative effects 
will arise as between the Project, the Covanta RRF Project and the other 
developments referred to in 4.10 in respect of ground conditions. 
15.5 
Residential Amenity  
15.5.1 
The amenity of a property can be affected by various factors including local 
changes in views from the property, external noise and changes in local air 
quality. 
15.5.2 
A consideration of these potential impacts on amenity at each property lying 
within 0.75 km of the Project was made from the nearest public vantage point. 
In the case of visual effects, this included a review of aerial photography to 
understand the orientation of windows and gardens towards the Project Site 
and the degree of screening from intervening vegetation that could be taken 
into account when assessing the magnitude and degree of visual effect. 
15.5.3 
Although there is no published guidance that sets out the criteria for 
establishing whether or not the visual presence of a development impacts 
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
606 
 
unacceptably on living conditions, the distance of 0.75 km for the consideration 
of potential effects has been examined at several public inquiries. 
15.5.4 
The visual element of the assessment identified temporary significant visual 
impacts would occur during construction at six viewpoints. Of these, four 
viewpoints (VP5, VP6, VP7 and VP15) are considered representative of 
residential receptors. However, only one of these were from properties within 
0.75 km of the Project Site (VP15 on a publicly accessible footpath near to 
South Pillinge Farm). No other residential receptors lie sufficiently close to the 
Project Site to experience potentially overbearing visual amenity impacts.  
15.5.5 
In the longer term, visual effects would be mitigated by screen planting which 
would take approximately 15 years.  
15.5.6 
For properties where a significant visual impact would be likely to occur (in EIA 
terms), it was concluded that the potential impact on living conditions from 
views would be acceptable without the benefits of mitigation planting, and 
would not be overbearing or oppressive. The conclusion was based on the 
intervening distance, the extent of screening from existing vegetation, and the 
orientation of views from the properties.  
15.5.7 
Visual impacts would be further mitigated by the proposed screen planting 
which would have a noticeable affect approximately five years after planting 
and achieve its full effect after around 15 years. 
15.5.8 
In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken 
at nearest noise sensitive receptors were modelled alongside noise levels 
predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the 
Project. 
15.5.9 
This assessment has shown that at South Pillinge Farm (the nearest residential 
receptor), the predicted noise impact is 38 dBA.  
15.5.10 The predicted noise levels are therefore below the proposed significant 
observed adverse effect level (SOAEL). This is defined as the level at which 
significant health effects on receptors is likely to occur or when noise causes a 
material change in behaviour and/or attitude, e.g. having to keep windows 
closed most of the time, avoiding certain activities during periods of intrusion. 
Potential for sleep disturbance resulting in difficulty in getting back to sleep. 
Quality of life diminished due to change in acoustic character of the area).  
15.5.11 The predicted noise levels from the Generating Equipment fall within the 
proposed LOAEL and SOAEL for a 24hour operation as shown below: 
 
Proposed LOAEL – 39 dB LAeq,T,  
 
Predicted noise impact at Pillinge Cottages - 38 dB LAeq,T, 
 
Predicted noise impact at South Pillinge Farm - 38 dB LAeq,T, 
 
Proposed SOAEL – 49 dB LAeq,T  
 
 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Environmental Statement  
 
607 
 
15.5.12 The levels above for LOAEL and SOAEL are based on professional judgement 
and are specific to the Project, taken into consideration a number of factors 
such as the likely operating regime of the Generating Equipment and 
background noise sources. They also represent external noise levels, rather 
than inside the property of the nearest sensitive receptors.  
15.5.13 As such, predicted noise levels from the Project to external amenity areas of 
residential dwellings are considered unlikely to cause annoyance. 
15.5.14 Finally, in terms of Air Quality, the risk of a loss of amenity during construction 
at residential properties will be low due to the embedded site mitigation 
measures inbuilt into the Project, and the distance from residential areas. In 
most cases, significant impacts are generally only seen within 20 – 50 m of 
construction activities. 
15.5.15 During operation of the Project, the impacts of the emissions will be 
imperceptible. Gas combustion does not produce any odorous compounds or 
particulate matter that would be visible, and will thus have no impact on local 
amenity. 
15.6 
Conclusions 
15.6.1 
The conclusions of this Chapter are that the construction, operation and 
maintenance and decommissioning of the Project does not result in any likely 
significant effects on human health (including focussing on EMF) or as a result 
of waste generated by the Project, either when considered alone or 
cumulatively with other developments.
