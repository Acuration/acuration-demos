A circuit is a collection of connected devices that allows electricity to flow from a 
power source, typically a battery. 
A battery has a positive point (+) and a negative point (-), and the electricity flows 
from one point to the other. The electrical flow travels through a wire and can 
power components such as a bulb, motor, or buzzer. 
For a circuit to work, it must be complete and have no gaps. We can use a switch to 
create a point where it’s possible to control the flow of electricity. The switch can be 
open (so the circuit’s incomplete) or closed (to complete the circuit and make  
it work).
We can represent all the components in a circuit with a unique symbol:
Close up!   
Look at the battery’s negative and positive points and see 
how they’re represented in the symbol.
