CCTV Privacy Notice
•  To increase the personal safety of our staff and visitors to our
sites;
•  To support our health and safety measures;
•  To assist in identifying, apprehending and prosecuting any
offenders on our sites;
•  To protect our buildings and assets and those of its staff from
intrusion, theft, vandalism, damage or disruption.
The legal basis for our use of any personal data which is 
captured by the CCTV system is that the processing is 
necessary for the legitimate interests set out in this paragraph 
(provided that those interests are not overridden by individuals’ 
rights and interests). The Company may also need to use this 
personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend against 
legal claims.
OPERATION
CCTV cameras are located at strategic points on our sites, 
primarily access points, such as the gates to the sites, in office 
areas and in certain production areas. Signs are displayed 
prominently around the sites to inform staff and visitors that 
CCTV cameras are in operation and who to contact for further 
information.
The cameras are in operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 
they will be monitored from the Security Control Room based 
at the Drax Power Station near Selby in the UK. In addition, 
the cameras can be monitored by security staff at the relevant 
site. We also use a third party provider who will regularly 
check and confirm the efficiency of the system, including 
that the equipment is properly recording, that the cameras are 
functional, that the time and date are correct and that that 
footage is being deleted or retained in accordance with this 
document.
The CCTV system is regularly maintained in accordance with 
the manufacturer’s instructions.
SECURITY
Physical protective measures: The Security Control Room can 
only be accessed with the correct access control privilege, 
which is primarily limited to security staff. A record is kept of all 
those who are given access to the Control Room. 
Technical protective measures: We have put in place 
appropriate security measures to prevent personal data from 
being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised 
way, altered or disclosed. This includes ensuring CCTV hard 
drives are located in a secured server room and access to this 
room is only via a formal approval process. Password protection, 
technical access control and the use of encryption are also 
technical protection measures that we use.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
personal data breach and will notify any affected individuals 
and/or the regulator where appropriate.
ACCESS AND DISCLOSURE
Access to recorded CCTV footage is restricted to a limited 
number of security staff as authorised by the Security 
Operations Manager from time to time (“Authorised Persons”) 
and all requests for disclosure of CCTV footage must be 
submitted to one of these Authorised Persons.
CCTV footage may only be accessed or disclosed to the extent 
necessary in order to deal with an incident which falls within 
the purpose identified above or in order to respond to a request 
made by an individual under the law (see further below). CCTV 
footage will not be accessed or used for any other purpose.
CCTV footage will be viewed in a secure office and any access 
to and any disclosures of recorded footage will be recorded 
in the CCTV log. This process is overseen by the Security 
Operations Manager and as appropriate, with reference to the 
relevant member of our Data Protection team.
External disclosure of CCTV footage will usually not be 
permitted other than to law enforcement agencies or to

required to notify you of the information contained in this 
notice. It is important that you read this notice so that you are 
aware of how and why we are using your personal information 
and how we will treat it. Depending on the circumstances, we 
may on occasion provide you with a shorter privacy notice to 
cover specific types of processing that will be supplemented by 
this notice. We may update this notice at any time, so you are 
advised to review this notice at regular intervals.
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your 
personal information. Our Group Data Protection
Officer is responsible for overseeing questions in relation
to this notice. If you have any questions about this notice, 
please use the contact details set out at the end of this notice

TRAINING
All staff who may be involved in the management or operation 
of the CCTV system will be trained in how to comply with this

COVERT RECORDING
Covert recording will only be carried out in very limited 
circumstances and with the authorisation of our Director of 
Security and/or Group Data Protection Officer.
Covert surveillance will only be carried out where specific 
criminal activity is suspected and where informing the relevant 
individuals would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime 
and/or apprehension/prosecution of the offender.
Any authorisation to use covert recording will be documented 
in writing and include confirmation that it is required to obtain 
evidence of suspected criminal activity in a specific case, 
an assessment of the alternative methods of obtaining the 
evidence and the permitted duration of the covert recording. 
The authorisation will be regularly reviewed, for example, every 
28 days, to assess whether it is continued to be required or 
should cease
CHANGE OF PURPOSE 
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for 
which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we 
need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible 
with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal 
information for an unrelated purpose, we will usually notify you 
and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

set out below for the purposes described above: 
•  service providers such as those who provide IT and system 
administration services  
•  other companies in our Group of companies who provide

share your personal information with to respect the privacy 
and security of your personal information and to treat it in

purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 
INFORMATION RETENTION
The images captured by the CCTV System will not be stored 
for any longer than is required in order to achieve the 
purposes identified above. CCTV footage will automatically 
be deleted on a 30-day rolling basis, unless specific images 
are required in order to deal with an incident or in order to 
respond to a request by an individual made under the law (see 
further below).
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, 
AND RESTRICTION 
Your duty to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal information we hold about 
you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if 
your personal information changes during your working 
relationship with us.
Your rights in connection with personal information
Data protection laws provide you with rights when your 
data is processed in the UK and Canada. Where you are not 
entitled to exercise a right, we will consider your request and 
feedback accordingly.
•  Request information about how and with who your 
personal information is being used or shared (UK and 
British Columbia)
•  Request access to your personal information. This enables 
you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold 
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it 
(UK and Canada);
•  Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected 
(UK and Canada);
•  Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good 
reason for us continuing to process it. You also have 
the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal 
information where you have exercised your right to object 
to processing (see below). However, this is not an absolute 
right and there will be circumstances where we are 
required to retain your personal information even if you are 
no-longer an employee of ours, for example, to administer 
pension benefit (UK only); 
•  Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to 
ask us to suspend the processing of personal information 
about you, for example if you want us to establish its 
4
CCTV Privacy Notice
accuracy or the reason for processing (UK only);
• Request the transfer of your personal information to yourself
or another party (UK only).
You also have a Right to Object to the processing of your 
personal information where we are relying on a legitimate 
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about 
your particular situation which makes you want to object to 
processing on this ground (UK only). 
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this notice.
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any time 
to the regulator for data protection issues as follows:
UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for 
British Columbia
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner 
for Alberta
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your  
concerns before you approach the regulator, so please contact  
us in the first instance using the contact details set out below.
You also have a right to request a file review by the regulator 
(Canada only)
No fee usually required
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we 
may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly 
unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply 
with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it.
Timing of our response
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 
days. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your 
request is particularly complex or you have made a number of 
requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided 
your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your 
personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right 
to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any 
time (UK and Canada). 
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details 
in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this notice. Once 
we have received notification that you have withdrawn your 
consent, we will no longer process your information for the 
purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have 
another legitimate basis for doing so in law.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE 
We reserve the right to update this Notice at any time, and we 
will provide you with a new Notice when we make any material 
updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time 
about the processing of your personal information.

enforcement or government organisation wishing to make an 
enquiry, please visit our secure portal.
