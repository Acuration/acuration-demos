SUMMARY
Background
Parsons Brinckerhoff was commissioned by Hirwaun Power
Limited to prepare a site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
for a simple cycle gas turbine (SCGT) power station at Hirwaun
Industrial Estate, near Aberdare, South Wales. The FRA was
conducted in accordance with the Overarching National Policy
Statement for Energy and other relevant planning guidance and
provides a predominantly qualitative assessment of flood risk to
the development proposals and people and property elsewhere
as a result of the planned Project.
Existing flood
risk
The existing flood risk to the site from fluvial, tidal, groundwater,
overland flow and artificial sources has been assessed.
The site is located in the low risk Flood Zone 1 / Development
Zone A and is at low risk of fluvial flooding.
Indicative Environment Agency mapping shows a raised risk of
surface water flooding. This mapping does not take accurate
account of surface water drainage or the culverted Nant Yr
Ochain watercourse which flows around the outside of the site.
As a result, the risk of surface water flooding is considered to be
low.
No significant risks have been identified from groundwater,
overland flow or artificial sources and the risk of flooding at the
site is assessed to be low.
Post
development
flood risk and
surface water
management
proposals
The surface water management of the site will be designed to
ensure no surface water flooding within the site for all storms up
to the 1 in 30 year return period storm and no increased risk to
people or property elsewhere in all events up to and including the
1 in 100 year return period storm and allowing for the predicted
impacts of climate change over the life of the development.
As a result of the proposed measures, the development will
cause no increase to flood risk within the site or to people and
property elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Project Background
1.1.1
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd has been appointed by Hirwaun Power
Limited (HPL) to prepare a site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
and Drainage Statement to support the Hirwaun Power Project.
1.1.2
The FRA will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) and
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 15: Development and Flood Risk and will
provide a predominantly qualitative analysis of flood risk to support the
Environmental Statement. The assessment will include the following:
· 
Confirmation of the sources of flooding which may affect the site;
· 
A qualitative assessment of the risk of flooding to the site and to
adjacent sites as a result of proposed Project;
· 
Review of the availability and adequacy of existing information; and
· 
Identification of possible measures which could reduce flood risk to
acceptable levels.
1.1.3
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project
(NSIP) under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 and as such a
Development Consent Order (DCO) is required. This FRA has been
prepared to support the DCO application and forms an Appendix to the
Environmental Statement (ES).
Nomenclature
1.1.4
This document has been titled a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance
with the phrasing used in EN-1. This document also meets the
requirements of a Flood Consequence Assessment in accordance with
TAN15 and Planning Policy Wales.
1.2
Development Proposals
1.2.1
The Project comprises a new simple cycle gas turbine (SCGT) Power
Station and integral connections on land at and near the Hirwaun
Industrial Estate near Aberdare in South Wales.
1.2.2
The Project consists of three main elements: the Power Generation
Plant, the Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection.
· 
The Power Generation Plant will be located entirely within the
existing industrial estate, covering an area of 7.5 hectares (ha). The
Hirwaun Power Project Flood Risk
Assessment

footprint of the Plant is approximately 5 ha within wider site and is
to be located within an area of existing impermeable surface;
· 
The Gas Connection comprises a new underground gas pipeline
connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from
the existing high pressure gas network NTS in the vicinity of the
proposed Project Site including the above ground infrastructure
(AGI) for the gas pipeline at the point of connection to the NTS, as
well as a new permanent access to the AGI (Works No. 3 & 4 in the
Draft DCO);
· 
The Electrical Connection comprises a new underground electrical
cable connection to export electricity from the Power Generation
Plant into the national electricity transmission system at the Rhigos
Substation (Work No. 5 in the Draft DCO); [
1.2.3
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are predominantly
below ground and it is considered that they will not have a significant
impact on flood risk. The AGI for the gas pipeline is less than 1 hectare
and located in Flood Zone 1. As a result this assessment will focus on
the Power Generation Plant.
1.3
Consultation
1.3.1
A Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) was submitted
in May 2013 and statutory responses were received from key
stakeholders including the Planning Inspectorate, Natural Resources
Wales (NRW) and Dwr Cymru Welsh Water (DCWW). These
responses are included in Appendix A of the ES.
Rhonda Cynon Taf Borough Council (RCTBC)
1.3.2
A meeting was held with RCTBC in January 2014 to discuss the
culverted River Camnant / Nant yr Ochain watercourse and the
requirements for surface water drainage. In summary, the guidance
from RCTBC was as follows:
· 
Historical mapping and other records indicate there may be a
culverted watercourse running beneath the site. RCTBC advise
against building over the existing culvert due to the risk of
damaging the culvert, the difficulty of inspecting the culvert and the
residual flood risk should the culvert become blocked.
· 
RCTBC are aware that opening up the existing culvert or diverting
the culvert may not be feasible for the Power Generation Project.
RCTCBC would seek that regard is had to their culverting policy
whether within the application or prior to construction through an
appropriate strategy document.

· 
RCTBC require a drainage strategy setting out the proposals for
surface water management for the Power Generation Project.
Whilst RCTBC accept that the site is brownfield, they would expect
to see the consideration of the use of SUDs and increased
infiltration.

ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
2.1
Overview
2.1.1
The assessment has been prepared to meet the requirements of
TAN15 and the flood risk requirements of EN-1.
2.1.2
The minimum requirements of a FRA under EN-1 are that it should:
· 
Be proportionate to the risk and appropriate to the scale, nature
and location of the project;
· 
Consider the risk of flooding arising from the project in addition to
the risk of flooding to the project;
· 
Take the impacts of climate change into account, clearly stating the
development lifetime over which the assessment has been made;
· 
Be undertaken by competent people, as early as possible in the
process of preparing the proposal;
· 
Consider both the potential adverse and beneficial effects of flood
risk management infrastructure, including raised defences, flow
channels, flood storage areas and other artificial features, together
with the consequences of their failure;
· 
Consider the vulnerability of those using the site, including
arrangements for safe access;
· 
Consider and quantify the different types of flooding (whether from
natural and human sources and including joint and cumulative
effects) and identify flood risk reduction measures, so that
assessments are fit for the purpose of the decisions being made;
· 
Consider the effects of a range of flooding events including extreme
events on people, property, the natural and historical environment
and river and coastal processes;
· 
Include the assessment of the remaining (known as ‘residual’) risk
after risk reduction measures have been taken into account and
demonstrate that this is acceptable for the particular project;
· 
Consider how the ability of water to soak into the ground may
change with development, along with how the proposed layout of
the project may affect drainage systems;
· 
Consider if there is a need to be safe and remain operational during
a worst case flood event over the development’s lifetime; and
· 
Be supported by appropriate data and information, including
historical information on previous events.
2.1.3
The methodology adopted in this FRA comprises:

for Hirwaun Power Ltd
- 13 -
· 
Review of available flood risk data to identify existing flood risk from
fluvial, tidal, groundwater, overland flow and artificial sources;
· 
Consideration of existing ground conditions on-site to determine
groundwater levels,  soil permeability and contamination risks
through review of previous land use and information available from
NRW, the British Geological Survey (BGS) and National Soil
Resources Institute (NSRI) Soils Site Report;
· 
Review of the development proposals in terms of flood risk
vulnerability and flood zone compatibility, in accordance with the
methodology defined in the TAN15;
· 
Consideration of how the development proposals may affect flood
risk to the site and surrounding land; and
· 
Proposals for the appropriate management of flood risks to
facilitate development whilst not increasing risks elsewhere.
2.1.4
Data regarding flood risk relevant to the Project and surrounding area
has been obtained from the following sources:
· 
EA indicative flood risk maps and groundwater maps;
· 
NRW / TAN15 Development Advice Map;
· 
Rhonda Cynon Taff Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment

· 
Rhonda Cynon Taff Local Flood Risk Management Strategy
(LFRMS), October 2012 (draft for consultation);
· 
Direct consultation with NRW, RCTBC and DCWW as discussed in
Section 1.3.
2.2
Definition of Flood Risk
2.2.1
Flood risk is the product of the likelihood or chance of a flood occurring
(flood frequency) and the consequence or impact of the flooding (flood
consequence).
Flood Frequency
2.2.2
Flood frequency is identified in terms of the return period and annual
probability. For example, a 1 in 100 year flood event has a 1% annual
probability of occurring. Table 1 below provides a conversion between
return periods and annual flood probabilities.

Flood Consequences
2.2.4
The consequence of a flood event describes the potential damage,
danger and disruption caused by flooding. This is dependent on the
mechanism and characteristics of the flood event and the vulnerability
of the affected land and land use.
2.2.5
TAN15 identifies three classifications of flood risk vulnerability and
provides recommendations on the compatibility of each vulnerability
classification with the Development Advice Zones, as shown in Table 3.

Potential Sources of Flooding
2.3.1
The following sources of flooding will be considered in this assessment:
· 
Fluvial flood risk from nearby watercourses;
· 
Overland surface water flooding from adjacent sites;
· 
Site generated surface water runoff;
· 
Surcharging of sewers;
· 
Groundwater flooding; and

· 
Tidal flooding.
2.4
Potential Effects of Climate Change
2.4.1
Scientific consensus is that the global climate is changing as a result of
human activity. While there remain uncertainties in how a changing
climate will affect areas already vulnerable to flooding, it is expected to
increase risk significantly over time.
2.4.2
As highlighted in TAN15, the UK Climate Impacts Programme
(UKCIP02) climate change scenarios for the UK suggest that winters
will become wetter by as much as 20% by 2050. Rainfall patterns are
also predicted to change, with summers and autumn becoming much
drier, but the number of rain-days and average intensity of rainfall is
expected to increase.
2.4.3
In accordance with TAN15, the potential impact of climate change will
be assessed by increasing rainfall intensity by 20% in the 100 year
event.
2.5
The Flood and Water Management Act 2010
2.5.1
The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (FWMA) introduces new
responsibilities for flood risk management for local authorities and sets
out new requirements for the management of sustainable drainage.
2.5.2
The FWMA Act is still being implemented and this report provides
guidance on how its implementation will impact on the management of
surface water and flood risk for the Project.
Lead Local Flood Authorities
2.5.3
Under the FWMA the unitary authority or county council for an area is
designated the  ‘Lead Local Flood Authority’ (LLFA), with responsibility
for managing flood risk from surface water, ground water and ordinary
watercourses within their area. The LLFA are also the consenting
authority for works near or within ordinary watercourses. Rhonda
Cynon Taff Borough Council is the LLFA for the Project area.
Sustainable Drainage
2.5.4
Schedule 3 of the FWMA introduces new National Standards for
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) against which proposed
drainage systems should comply.  Under Schedule 3 of the FWMA,
LLFAs will become the SUDS Approving Body (SAB) for surface water
drainage systems for new development. Approval from the SAB for
drainage proposals must be agreed prior to construction.  For drainage
systems that serve more than one property, the SAB will have

- 17 -
responsibility for maintenance of adopted SUDS schemes that meet
SAB requirements.
2.5.5
These standards are currently in draft and will be implemented
following consultation.
2.5.6
The draft standards introduce the SUDS hierarchy that states that the
following methods of surface water disposal must be considered in
order of preference:
· 
Discharge into the ground;
· 
Discharge to a surface water body;
· 
Discharge to a surface water sewer;
· 
Discharge to a combined sewer.
2.5.7
The draft standards also promote the management of surface water
runoff at source, on the surface and integrated with public open space
where it is reasonably practicable to do so.

SITE DESCRIPTION
3.1
Power Generation Plant Site Description and Location
3.1.1
The Power Generation Plant site is located at Hirwaun Industrial
Estate, approximately 2km west of Hirwaun and 5km west of Aberdare
at National Grid Reference (NGR) SN938061.
3.1.2
The site location is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 – Site location showing project redline boundary
3.1.3
The site covers an area of approximately 7.5 hectares (ha), with the
footprint covering approximately 5 ha of the site.
3.1.4
The site is at approximately 210m AOD, with a shallow gradient from
south to north across the site and comprises an area of land currently
occupied by a large industrial building used for storage and distribution.
3.1.5
The A465 trunk road lies runs near to the northern boundary of the site.
Hydrology and Surface Water Features
3.1.6
The site lies at the watershed of two major river catchments. The land
to the west of the site drains to the River Neath, which flows south-west
Hirwaun Power Project Flood Risk
Assessment

- 19 -
to discharge to the Bristol Channel in Swansea Bay. The land to the
east of the site drains to the River Cynon, which flows south-east and
joins the River Taff at Abercynon. The River Cynon flows through the
centre of Hirwaun approximately 1km to the east of the Project Site.
3.1.7
Review of OS mapping and the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH)
database indicates that the site is in the hydraulic catchment of the
River Camnant. The upstream reaches of this watercourse are labelled
on OS mapping and historical maps as the Nant yr Ochain and the
distinction between these two watercourses is not clear. Downstream of
the site the River Camnant passes beneath the A465 and flows in a
westerly direction to join the Afon Sychryd which flows north-west to
join the Afon Melte, discharging to the River Neath at Pontneddfechan.
3.1.8
Historical mapping indicates that the Nant yr Ochain / River Camnant
historically flowed through the site and has been subject to numerous
diversions, as detailed below:

the shallow Hirwaun Ponds and forms part of the Hirwaun Industrial
Estate Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC);
· 
A small fishing pond is located approximately 200m south of the
site;
· 
The agricultural land to the south of the site is drained by a network
of small ditches and land drains.
3.1.11
The DCWW drinking water reservoir Penderyn Reservoir is
approximately 250m to north of site.
Geology and Hydrogeology
3.1.12
With reference to Table 10.5 from Section 10 of the Environmental
Statement, the bedrock and superficial geology underlying the site is
summarised in Table 4.
Table 4 – Geological make-up at the site
Geological
Deposit
Description
Topsoil
Brown Sandy Clay. Range in depth from 0.15-0.61 m
below ground level (BGL)
Peat
Soft, dark brown / black fibrous peat ranging in depth
from 1.37 – 5.33m BGL.
Glacial Till
Mixture of sand, silt, gravel, cobbles and boulders.
Ranging in depth from 7-9m BGL.
Coal Measures
Not proven by boreholes
3.1.13
The coal measures are classified as Secondary A aquifer, described as
permeable layers capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather
than strategic scale, and in some cases forming an important source of
base flow to rivers. These are generally aquifers formerly classified as
minor aquifers;
3.1.14
The Cranfield University / National Soils Resources Institute Soilscape
website (www.landis.org.uk) identifies that the soil across the majority
of the Project Site is a slowly permeable wet and very acid upland soil
with a peaty surface.  The soil is described as having impeded
drainage.
3.2
Existing Drainage
3.2.1
The following existing foul and surface water drainage has been
identified within the Project Site and immediate surrounding area:

Public Infrastructure
3.2.2
Public sewer records for the site have been supplied by DCWW and
show:
· 
Surface water drains to a culvert which runs in an anti-clockwise
direction before discharging into the Nant yr Ochain watercourse
downstream. This culvert appears to collect flows from the Nant yr
Ochain upstream of the site;
· 
A combined foul and surface water sewer network is shown,
ultimately discharging to the DCWW Hirwaun Sewage Treatment
Works immediately to the north of the site.
3.2.3
It is unclear from the sewer records or from site records where the
existing infrastructure on the Power Generation Plant Site connects into
the public sewer network.

EXISTING FLOOD RISK
4.1
Tidal and Fluvial Flooding
4.1.1
Figure 6 is an extract from the TAN15 Development Advice Map,
showing flood risk from tidal and fluvial sources.  The mapping shows
the site to be Zone A, with a low risk of fluvial and tidal flooding.

Blue = Zone C2, Yellow = Zone B)
Flood Risk from Nant yr Ochain Culvert
4.1.2
The indicative mapping from the EA and NRW shows no raised flood
risk from the culverted Nant yr Ochain. However, the indicative
mapping does not take into account the risk from potential blockage of
the culvert. This risk is considered further in the section below on flood
risk from overland flow.
4.2
Other Sources of Flooding
Groundwater Flood Risk
4.2.2
Groundwater flooding occurs when water stored below ground reaches
the surface. It is commonly associated with porous underlying geology,
such as chalk, limestone and gravels.
4.2.3
The BGS Susceptibility to Groundwater map was obtained for the site
by Argyll Environmental. This map (shown in Figure 7) shows areas of
High and Very High risk of groundwater flooding at the Power
Generation Plant site.

4.2.4
However, while the bedrock geology beneath the site is classified as a
Secondary Aquifer and will contain groundwater, the bedrock is
overlain by a layer of low permeability glacial till and peat, which would
impede the emergence of groundwater at the site. The risk of
significant groundwater emergence at the site is therefore considered
to be low.
4.2.5
There are no known incidents of groundwater flooding at the site and
the risk of groundwater flooding is assessed to be low.
Overland Flow
4.2.6
For the purpose of this FRA, flood risk from overland flow includes
flooding from surface water runoff, surcharging of the sewerage
network and overland flow from artificial sources such as canals or
reservoirs.
4.2.7
Figure 8 shows the EA surface water flood risk map for the Project Site.
As discussed in paragraph 4.1.2, the map shows surface water flooding
following the route of the Nant yr Ochain culvert. Areas of the Project

Site are shown to be at risk in a Medium Risk (1 in 100 yr) and High
Risk (1 in 30 year) flood extent. This mapping does not take full
account of existing drainage or culverts, so can be considered to
represent the flooding of the Project Site in the event of complete
blockage of the Nant yr Ochain culvert. This culvert is indicated on the
DCWW asset plan, and it is assumed that DCWW hold responsibility
for its maintenance. If this is the case, the risk of blockage and
subsequent risk of surface water flooding would be greatly reduced.
There are no known incidents of surface water flooding at the site.

yr, Medium risk = 1 in 100 yr, Low risk = 1 in 1000 yr. Very low = less than 1
in 1000 yr.
4.2.8
As shown in Figure 9, the Project Site is not assessed to be at risk of
flooding from the Penderyn Reservoir.

POST DEVELOPMENT FLOOD RISK & DRAINAGE STATEMENT
5.1
Post Development Flood Risk
5.1.1
The Project is located entirely within the low risk Zone A on the TAN15
Development Advice Map and the low risk Flood Zone 1 on the EA
indicative flood zone mapping.  The Project will have no impact on
fluvial flood risk at the Project Site or to people and property
downstream.
5.2
Surface Water Drainage Proposals
5.2.1
The Project is being constructed on a brownfield site, which remains in
economic use by International Greetings UK and comprises of large
areas of impermeable concrete surface. The development does not
increase the impermeable area of the site and as a result will not result
in an increase in surface water run-off from the site.
5.2.2
Detailed proposals for the surface water drainage of the new buildings
and hardstanding are yet to be confirmed, however the proposed
approach is to utilise the existing drainage infrastructure serving the
existing site. Review of DCWW mapping indicates that surface water
from the site is likely to discharge to the culverted Nant yr Ochain which
flows around the outside of the site to join the River Camnant
downstream.
5.2.3
It is proposed that the site will continue to discharge surface water to
the culverted Nant yr Ochain watercourse at an unattenuated rate.
Review of the downstream catchment shows no raised flood risk in the
downstream River Camnant up to its confluence with the Afon Melte,
which has a large and steep catchment. Surface water falling on the
Project site forms a very small part of this catchment and attenuating
surface water flows would have no impact on flood risk.
5.2.4
Surface water drainage will be designed to ensure no surface water
flooding within the site up to the 1 in 30 year event.  Site levels will be
designed to ensure no increased risk of flooding to people and
properties elsewhere in the event of rainfall events greater than the 1 in
30 year event up to the 100 year plus 20% climate change event.
5.3
Summary of Post Development Flood Risk
5.3.1
The Project will result in no increased flood risk to the site or people
and properties outside of the site. Surface water drainage will be
designed to ensure no surface water flooding within the site up to the 1
in 30 year event and no increased risk of flooding to people and

SEQUENTIAL / JUSTIFICATION TEST
6.1
Sequential Test / Justification Test
6.1.1
The site is located within TAN15 Zone A / EA Flood Zone 1 and is
therefore considered to meet the requirements of the Sequential Test /
Justification Test.
6.2
The Exception Test
6.2.1
Due to the low flood risk the Exception Test does not need to be
applied to this development.

CONCLUSION
7.1
Introduction
7.1.1
Proposals have been prepared for the development of a new SCGT
Power Station and integral connections on land at and near Hirwaun
Industrial Estate. The Project proposals comprise three elements: the
Power Generation Plant, a new Gas Connection and a new Electricity
Connection. This FRA focuses on the Power Generation Plant due to
the small extent of above ground permanent works for the Gas
Connection and Electrical Connections.
7.1.2
This FRA has been prepared to consider the flood risk to the Power
Generation Plant from external sources and the impact that the Project
will have on flood risk within the site and elsewhere.
7.2
Summary of Existing Flood Risk
7.2.1
Through review of indicative flood maps and the SFCA it was identified
that the site is located within the low risk EA Flood Zone 1 / TAN15
Zone A with an annual probability of tidal and fluvial flooding of less
than 0.1% (1 in 1000).
7.2.2
The EA indicative surface water flood map shows a raised risk of
surface water flooding at the site. However, this mapping does not fully
take into account surface water drainage or the culverted Nant yr
Ochain which flows around the eastern boundary of the Project Site.
7.2.3
There are no known significant flood risks to the site from groundwater
or overland flow and no known records of historical flooding within the
site.
7.2.4
The Project Site is assessed to be at low risk of flooding.
7.3
Summary of Post Development Flood Risk
7.3.1
The Project will be designed to ensure there will be no increase in the
volume or rate of surface water discharge from the site and hence will
have no significant impact on flood risk either within the site or to
people and property elsewhere.
