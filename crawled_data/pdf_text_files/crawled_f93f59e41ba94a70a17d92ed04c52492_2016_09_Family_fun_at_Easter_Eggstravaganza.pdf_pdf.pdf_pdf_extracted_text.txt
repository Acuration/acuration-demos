Family fun at Easter 
Eggstravaganza 
 
07 April 2015 
 
Record numbers turned up to support the fifth annual Easter 
Eggstravaganza at Drax Nature Reserve and Skylark Centre on Easter 
Sunday. 
 
Over 1,200 children and parents joined the giant woodland egg hunt - with help 
from a life-sized Easter Bunny and Rooster - and enjoyed a range of fun-filled 
activities while raising money for Selby Hands of Hope. 
 
The event, organised by Drax, included an arts and crafts workshop with flower-
making and face painting. Rare breed sheep and goats and an animal petting 
area also provided education and entertainment for all. 
 
Drax community campaign coordinator Ann Gray was there to join in the fun.  
 
She said: “It’s great to see the Drax Easter Eggstravaganza becoming such a 
well-supported annual event on the community calendar. Everyone was having a 
brilliant time and together we raised over £1,600 for local charity Selby Hands of 
Hope which will go to support a variety of projects in the area.”
