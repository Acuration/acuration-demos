Introduction
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
This Outline Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) has been
prepared as part of the Environmental Statement (ES) for Abergelli Power Station
(hereafter referred to as the ‘Project’). This Outline CEMP has been prepared by
AECOM on behalf of the applicant, Abergelli Power Limited (APL).
1.1.2
The Project comprises of an Open Gas Cycle Turbine (OGCT) peaking power
generating station and supporting infrastructure. The Project is described in detail
in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description and its location provided in Figure 1.1
and Figure 1.2 of the ES.
1.2
Purpose of this Document
1.2.1
The purpose of this Outline CEMP is to set out the approach towards, and
framework for, environmental management during the construction phase (including
site preparation) and to provide mitigation against potentially adverse construction
impacts on environmental resources, local residents and businesses. The Outline
CEMP will provide assurance to the decision maker and stakeholders that
appropriate measures for preventing and reducing environmental effects will be
adopted during the construction of the Project and secured via this document. Both
standard environmental good practice and project specific mitigation, as committed
to within the ES are included within this Outline CEMP.
1.2.2
This Outline CEMP covers all elements of the Project as described in Chapter 3:
Project and Site Description of the ES, although some measures will only be
relevant to particular project elements or specific works, and this will be made clear
in the text of the document.
The principles of this Outline CEMP set out the
standards, environmental management and good practice that will also be
consistently applied to the construction of the Gas and Electrical Connections.
1.2.3
Post-consent, this CEMP will require updating in accordance with a Development
Consent Order (DCO) Requirement and will be approved by CCS (in consultation
with Natural Resources Wales) prior to any construction commencing on the
Project Site. The approved CEMP will be used as an environmental management
and monitoring tool for the duration of the construction phase. The CEMP will be
kept on site as a live document, being updated as and when required (for example
to recognise changes in regulations, good practice guidance, actions from on site
audits or a change in situation onsite).
1.2.4
The approved CEMP will fall within the scope of the main contractor’s externally
certified environmental management systems, and as such will be subject to
independent audits by the relevant certification bodies.
1.2.5
Measures set out in this document and the approved CEMP will have regard to the
Welsh Government document ‘Construction and Demolition Sector Plan’ (Ref. 1.1)
Abergelli ES 2018 – Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limtied
AECOM
2
which seeks to move towards zero waste by detailing outcomes, policies and
delivery actions for organisations, companies and individuals involved with the
construction and demolition sector in Wales.
a)
Decommissioning
1.2.6
It is anticipated that the environmental effects of the decommissioning of the
Project will be similar in size and nature to those associated with construction. A
detailed decommissioning methodology cannot be finalised until immediately prior
to decommissioning. However the measures and procedures are anticipated to be
similar to those set out within this Outline CEMP and updated to align with industry
good practice guidance at the time of writing.

Community Liaison
2.2.1
The following steps will be taken by APL/the main contactor to make the public
aware of the activities onsite and the available lines of communication with the
Project:
·
Neighbouring residents and occupiers will be notified of the start of construction
activities, the likely duration of the construction phase, of any changes to the
working hours as agreed with CCS and of periods when higher levels of noise
may be expected;
·
There will be a community liaison group (CLG) established for facilitation two-
way communication between the public and the Project, which will meet on a
regular basis.
·
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published local to the
Project Site. There will be a dedicated person responsible for dealing with any
complaints, which could be the Environmental Manager.  This person will have
the appropriate authority to resolve complaints. An ‘out of hours’ telephone
number will be made available if required. A Welsh speaker can be available at
request;
·
Liaison will be maintained with CCS’s Environmental Health Officer (EHO) for
the duration of the construction phase;
·
Should any complaints regarding dust or noise be received the details will be
passed to the EHO for verification purposes; and
·
Should any unforeseen event occur on the Project Site that has the potential to
cause pollution then the relevant regulatory bodies will be notified immediately.
As far as possible, notice will be issued to the EHO for dealing with an
unforeseen activity that may give rise to a particular nuisance problem.
b)
Environmental Site Meetings
2.2.2
To ensure dissemination of environmental information, environmental meetings will
be held throughout the duration of the Project construction. The frequency of
meetings will be determined by the main contractor(s), but will not be less than

once per month. These meetings will be held for all site personnel and will be
attended by the ECoW or similar environmental expert (if required).
2.2.3
Any environmental issues or lessons learnt will be reported at these meetings along
with any updates or changes to environmental management plans. A “Look Ahead”
at relevant environmental management or special requirements linked to specific
upcoming tasks or seasonality will also be provided.
c)
Site Signage and Notice Boards
2.2.4
Working areas will be clearly marked with appropriate signage and warnings to
ensure that they are avoided by members of the public.
2.2.5
Site notice boards for disseminating information to Site personnel will be positioned
either within individual work stations or in a centralised location. Site notice boards
will display method statements, emergency contacts, and relevant statutory and
non-statutory advice and guidance.
d)
Site Inductions
2.2.6
The main contractor(s) will ensure all employees, sub-contractors, suppliers, and
other visitors to the Project Site receive induction training.  The Site Induction will
include a summary of environmental risks associated with the Project and the
onsite environmental methods and standards. Any environmental methods and
standards specifically relevant to the inductee’s role or task will be highlighted.

toolbox talks may be presented by an ECoW (or equivalent suitably trained
specialist).
2.2.10 A programme of relevant toolbox talks will be drawn up by the Environmental
Manager
or main
contractor(s)
based on upcoming construction activities.
Additional toolbox talks may be required outside of this based on circumstances
such as unforeseen risks, repeated observation of bad practices, perceived lack of
awareness, or a pollution event. A record of all toolbox talks reporting highlights of
the meeting and attendees will be maintained.
2.3
Register of Mitigation
2.3.1
A register of embedded and additional mitigation measures committed to within the
ES has been attached in Appendix A: Mitigation Register to this Outline CEMP. The
Register has been updated in response to consultee comments and updated EIA
technical assessments. This
Register
will
be used to inform the
onsite
environmental management and provide a tool for aiding the preparation of method
statements or environmental standards. The register covers several environmental
topic areas and will be regularly updated to reflect any additional risks resulting
from the main contractors selected methods of working, changing site conditions
etc. Mitigation measures have been identified under the following general headings:
·
General;
·
Air Quality;
·
Noise and Vibration;
·
Ecology;
·
Water Quality and Resources;
·
Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology;
·
Landscape and Visual;
·
Traffic, Transport and Access; and
·
Historic Environment.
2.4
Method Statements and Site Environmental Standards
2.4.1
The main contractor(s) will prepare Method Statements for specific construction
activities and Site Environmental Standards for day-to-day Project Site operations
such as housekeeping, material storage and waste management. These will be
based on standard good practice measures (as set out within relevant management
plans in Section 3 of this Outline CEMP), statutory requirements, environmental
sensitivities and any Requirements of the DCO.
2.4.2
Site Environmental Standards will be printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice
boards and used as a briefing tool onsite. They will also form the basis of toolbox
talks on the relevant Project Site operations.
2.4.3
The method statement will be communicated to all or task specific personnel ahead
of the commencement of the relevant activities using an agreed instruction format
(e.g. toolbox talks).

Monthly Complaint Reporting; and
·
Ongoing Environmental Monitoring.
2.5.2
Particular notice will be taken during and following extreme weather events (high
rainfall, high winds, snowfall etc.), when working in areas of known contamination,
and when particularly hazardous activities are being carried out. Additional Method
Statements or Site Environmental Standards will be produced where significant risk
to the environment is identified.
2.5.3
An Audit Close-out Schedule will be maintained by the main contractor(s). This is a
document to record any observations, corrective action requests or non-compliance
notices identified through inspections. Progress against corrective and preventative
actions logged in the Schedule will be reported to APL on a regular basis.
i.
Daily Inspections
2.5.4
The nominated site personnel or the Environmental Manager will conduct daily
checks against environmental requirements. This could be done against a pro
forma or similar, based on the measures outlined within method statements and
Environmental Standards relevant to activities being conducted on that day.
2.5.5
Daily inspections will include visual inspections of dust emissions as described in
Section 4.3.
ii.
Weekly Inspections
2.5.6
Weekly Project Site inspections will be carried out by the Environmental Manager,
which will assess the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation on the Project
Site.
iii.
Monthly Audits

receiving and taking action on complaints is set out in the Community Liaison
(paragraph 2.2.1).
v.
Environmental Monitoring
2.5.9
Any requirements for specific monitoring programmes as determined through the
DCO or pre-construction surveys (i.e. ground investigations) will be conducted at
appropriate intervals by a suitably qualified individual.
b)
Incidents and Near Misses
2.5.10 An indicative environmental Emergency Response Plan is detailed in Section
Error! Reference source not found. of this Outline CEMP.  This will be finalised
by the main contractor(s). The plan in the approved CEMP will follow the stop –
contain – notify protocol and will detail responsible personnel and contacts for
reporting. All personnel will be briefed on the notification protocol for alerting the
main contractor(s) and Environmental Manager of an environmental emergency as
part of their Site Induction. Environmental emergency response training and toolbox
talks will also be conducted at regular intervals by a suitably qualified person.
2.5.11 The main contractor(s) will maintain a register of all environmental incidents,
dangerous occurrences and/or near misses, each supported by an Environmental
Incident Report Form. This will document the nature, date and time of the incident,
corrective action(s) taken, and details of any contact with regulatory agencies. All
incidents will be reported to the appropriate regulatory body and APL on the day
that they occur or within 24 hours.
2.5.12 All environmental incidents, dangerous occurrences and near misses will be
reviewed by the Environmental Manager and where necessary changes to working
practices/procedures will be implemented. Lessons learnt, along with any updates
to method statements, sections of the approved CEMP and toolbox talk will be
communicated to all personnel at Environmental Site Meetings.

3.1.1
The main contractor(s) will have the day to day responsibility for maintaining Health
and Safety throughout the construction phase. A risk assessment and method
statement (RAMS) will be produced and detail how risk will be minimised through
an approved procedure, which will:
·
Identify the significant Health and Safety impacts that can be anticipated;
·
Assess the risks from these impacts;
·
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; and
·
Report where an inappropriate level of residual risk is identified so that action
can be taken.
3.1.2
There will be no access to construction areas by the general public. The Project
Site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access including where permissive
routes cross the construction areas.
3.1.3
Traffic safety should be promoted by all project personnel to prevention and control
traffic related injuries. Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite. This will also
minimise disturbance of bare surfaces.
3.1.4
The following good practice measures will be implemented
by the main
contractor(s) to ensure the safety of site personnel:
·
The provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including
footwear, masks, protective clothing and goggles where required;
·
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ area of the
Project Site;
·
Welfare facilities will be made available;
·
All
site
personnel
will be required to wash their hands and remove
overalls/boots when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the Project Site;
·
Any soils excavated that are considered by the main contractor(s) to be
potentially contaminated will be reported, left in situ and fenced off until their
appropriate treatment (in line with Section Error! Reference source not
found.: Emergency Response Plan); and
·
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage and
construction materials in order to prevent the contamination of ground water.
3.1.5
The main contractor(s) will ensure that qualified first-aid can be provided at all
times. Appropriately equipped first-aid stations will be easily accessible throughout
the Project Site.
3.2
Security
3.2.1
During site preparation the perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site will be
cleared of undergrowth and a permanent or temporary security fence placed with
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
13
locked gates for main and emergency exits (capable of being opened in an
emergency).
3.3
Construction Site Housekeeping
3.3.1
Good construction site housekeeping practice will be applied at all times. As far as
reasonably practicable the construction working areas for the Project Site will be
designed using the following principles:
·
All work areas will be secured;
·
Any fuels or liquid materials will be stored and bunded in compliance with the
relevant regulation;
·
Signage and boundary fences will be regularly inspected, repaired and
replaced as necessary;
·
All working areas will be kept in a clean and tidy condition;
·
Wheel washing and dust suppression facilities will be provided when and where
required;
·
Waste will be removed at frequent intervals; and
·
Construction waste susceptible to spreading by wind or liable to cause litter will
be stored in secure containers.
3.4
Storage of Fuels and Chemicals
3.4.1
The main contractor(s) will ensure that fuels and chemicals are stored appropriately
and the measures are in place to prevent pollution of ground and water. Fuel will be
stored:
·
In areas where potential for contamination of water bodies is low i.e. outside 50
m of a spring, well or borehole and 10 m of an open watercourse;
·
In areas that are low risk of flooding;
·
In tanks that meet the manufacturing standards appropriate for the type of oil
stored and comply with BS EN ISO 9001;
·
With contents clearly marked on the storage containers;
·
With secure and appropriately sized bunds being suitable to contain 110% of
the contents (single tank).  If there is more than one storage container, the
bund will be capable of containing 110% of the largest tank, or 25% of the total
aggregate capacity, whichever is the greatest;
·
Tanks/ storage containers will be protected against vehicle collision; and
·
All deliveries will be overseen by site personnel with emergency response
training.
3.4.2
A Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) store will be set up in the
site compound. COSHH assessments and Material Safety Data Sheets will be held
with the COSHH materials. A COSHH register will be created and maintained
onsite.
3.4.3
All site personnel and sub-contractors will be made aware of the COSHH
requirements through site inductions and specific toolbox talks. Daily site
inspections will be used to review and monitor the storage and issue of COSHH
materials.

3.5
Welfare Facilities
3.5.1
Welfare cabins, toilets and drying facilities, in line with The Construction (Design
and Management) Regulations 2015 (Ref. 3.1) will be provided within the Project
Site for the use of site personnel. Grey and foul water from welfare facilities will not
be discharged directly into ditches or watercourse, but will be collected through a
foul water drainage system that will either drain to a septic tank or a package
treatment plant within the Project Site. It is likely that the latter will be the preferred
option for ease of maintenance and environmental criteria. The processed water
will then discharge onsite or to a nearby watercourse.
3.5.2
Where portable generators are used, industry good practice will be followed to
minimise noise and pollution from such generators.
3.5.3
The risk of infestation by pests or vermin will be minimised by the appropriate
collection, storage and regular collection of waste, the prompt treatment of any pest
infestation and effective preventative pest control measures.
3.6
Public Right of Ways
3.6.1
There are three Public Right of Ways (PRoW) that cross the Project Site. Specific
mitigation measures for the management of these PRoWs is contained within the
Outline Construction Traffic Management Plan, which will be finalised post-consent,
in consultation with the PRoW officer at CCS.
3.6.2
It is not proposed to permanently divert any PRoWs although measures will be
implemented during the construction phase to maintain safety to users from
construction traffic and also from any excavations which may be present. Any
temporary closures, required for public safety, will be advertised in advance and
diversions or directions to alternate routes will be provided where practicable.
3.6.3
Appropriate signage will be placed prior to the construction area to ensure users
are aware of the works prior to arriving. Should works be undertaken in the
immediate location of the crossing, banksman will be employed to avoid any
potential adverse effects from construction traffic. In addition, suitable fencing will
be implemented to ensure users of the permissive routes are segregated from
construction traffic appropriately and safely if required.
3.7
Timing of Works
3.7.1
Construction will be programmed in such a way as to ensure that construction
activities are undertaken in a timely manner while minimising environmental risk as
far as possible, e.g. seasonal sensitivities or inclement weather will be considered.
Construction activities may be undertaken simultaneously at more than one area of
the Project Site.  The work programme will be agreed with CCS prior to
construction commencing onsite. In the event that the programme changes
significantly, the changes will be communicated to CCS.
3.7.2
Construction activities will be scheduled so that works that have the potential to
impact upon ecological receptors are conducted outside key periods of seasonal
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
15
activity, for instance, vegetation clearance will be conducted outside of the breeding
bird season.
3.7.3
Construction activities will also be scheduled, where possible to reduce the risk of
pollution. Measures include:
·
Minimising the periods for which soils are exposed and stockpiled thereby
reducing the risk of generating silt laden runoff;
·
Avoiding, where possible, undertaking specific activities such as earthworks
during prolonged and heavy rainfall thereby reducing the risk of sediment or
pollutants becoming entrained in excess runoff; and
·
Avoiding, where possible, undertaking
activities
in closer proximity to
watercourses when water levels are higher and adjacent land is at risk of
flooding.
3.8
Working Hours
3.8.1
Construction activities will not take place outside the hours of 08:00-18:00 Monday
to Friday and 08.00-13.00 on Saturday and public holidays, unless otherwise
agreed with CCS. These limits will not apply during commissioning and completion
of the Project, as defined in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description of the ES.
Local residents will be notified, as detailed in Section 2.2 Community Liaison, of
any agreed changes to the working hours. Lighting
3.8.2
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to provide a safe
working environment during hours of darkness. Artificial lighting can be a nuisance
to any nearby residence and can disrupt nocturnal species.
3.8.3
All artificial lighting used at the Project Site will be in accordance with the Institute
of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Guidelines (Ref. 3.2) and the Bat Conservation
Trust’s (BCT) interim guidance on artificial lighting and wildlife (Ref. 3.3).
3.8.4
In order to minimise light disturbance to ecological receptors:
·
There will be no more than 1 lux beyond the boundary of the proposed Project
Site, particularly within the Lletty-Morfil
Site of Importance for Nature
Conservation (SINC) to the north and east of the Generating Equipment Site,
which is a habitat that supports bats; and
3.8.5
The general design objectives that will be used to ensure that adverse effects of
lighting (through adding light to a darker rural landscape) associated with
construction of the Project are minimised are listed below:
·
Luminaires will be appropriately designed for the required task;
·
Louvres and shields will be used to prevent undesirable light break-out;
·
Construction lighting will be directed away from all sensitive receptors;
·
For the illumination of large areas, in order to limit light trespass, glare and
sky glow from the plant, preference will be given to several, lower lighting
units rather than tall, wide beam lighting units;
·
Vehicle lights will be properly directed (conforming to MOT requirements) and
lenses will be intact to prevent un-necessary glare and light intrusion;
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
16
·
Lighting will be reduced or switched off when not required for safety purposes;
·
Security lighting will be kept at the minimum level needed for visual and
security protection;
·
Dark corridors will be maintained along hedgerows and watercourses and any
other linear features by avoiding light encroaching on these areas. This will
avoid the fragmentation of habitat used by species such as bats and also
otters that use these features to move at night-time; and
·
If appropriate, the use of infra-red floodlighting and CCTV systems will be
considered for security to reduce the need for visible lighting outside working
hours.

Environmental Management Plans
4.1
Overview
4.1.1
The following sections outline the likely contents of the topic specific Management
Plans that will be developed to be submitted to discharge a DCO Requirement
post-consent.
4.1.2
Other than the Emergency Response Plan which is integral to the CEMP, these
plans will be subject to their own separate Requirement in the DCO and finalised as
required via standalone documents.
4.2
Emergency Response Plan
4.2.1
This plan provides response measures for potential environmental emergencies
that could arise during the construction of the Project. These include; discovery of
unknown contaminated ‘hotspots’; spills of contaminants such as chemicals, fuels
or waste materials; and entry of contaminants into watercourses during flood
events.
4.2.2
This Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed by the main contractor(s) and
finalised in the approved CEMP. The main contractor(s) will also supply emergency
contact details for nominated site personnel, relevant regulatory bodies and
emergency services. These details will be available on site notice boards
(paragraph 2.2.5) and will be displayed along with a plan of the Project Site that
displays safe storage areas and the location of response equipment, such as spill
kits.
4.2.3
The emergency plan and contact details will be shown to all site personnel as part
of the Site Induction. Nominated site personnel will be provided with emergency
response training. There will be regular toolbox talks on emergency response
procedures and all site personnel will be informed of the notification procedure in
the event of discovering contamination or a spill as part of the Site Induction.
4.2.4
All incidents where the Emergency Response Plan is implemented will be reported
in line with the Incident Response Procedure detailed in Section 2.5: Monitoring
and Auditing (starting paragraph 2.5.10).
a)
Contaminated Hotspots Plan
4.2.5
Ground investigations will be conducted to identify any potentially existing
contaminated land within the Project Site. In the case where a contaminant is
identified, a contaminant specific management plan will be produced.
4.2.6
As such, the procedure below is proposed to be followed in the eventuality that an
unidentified contaminant “hotspot” showing visual or olfactory evidence of
contamination is discovered during construction:
·
Relevant construction activities will be stopped immediately;
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
18
·
The discovery will be reported to the Environmental Manager or appropriate
personnel as identified by the main contractor(s);
·
The area will be sealed off in order to contain the spread of contaminants;
·
The area will be cleared to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or
explosion;
·
The relevant regulator and/or CCS will be contacted once it is confirmed that
contamination has been found;
·
Testing will be arranged; and
·
Details of the incident will be recorded, including photos and relevant
information on the Environmental Incident Report Form.
b)
Emergency Spill Response Plan
4.2.7
Appropriate spill response materials for the chemicals, fuels and oils stored onsite
will be provided throughout the Project Site. Spill kits will be made available at fuel
storage and refuelling locations and in individual plant and vehicles. Use of plant
and hazardous materials will be done in the presence of at least one operative
trained in emergency response.
4.2.8
The main contractor(s) will produce an emergency response plan that will follow the
STOP – CONTAIN – NOTIFY – CLEAN UP – REPORT procedure. An indicative
procedure is set out below:
·
STOP
o
Relevant Construction activities will be stopped immediately;
o
Spilt substance will be identified and any information available (i.e.
COSHH material sheet) obtained along with the correct PPE;
o
If safe to do so, the spill will be stopped to prevent more material spilling,
e.g. oil drums will be righted or valves closed; and
o
Sources of ignition will be switched off.
·
CONTAIN
o
The spillage will be immediately contained using bunds of earth or sand,
drip trays, boom and or spill materials;
o
Drains and watercourses will be checked to see if the spill has reached
them. Where possible, spills will be diverted and drains will be bunded to
stop the spill entering the drainage network;
o
Spillage and runoff will not be washed into the drainage system.
·
NOTIFY
o
The Environmental Manager will be notified;
o
The Environmental manger will then notify the relevant regulator, CCS
and APL.
·
CLEAN UP
o
The spill will be cleaned up using appropriate spill materials OR by an
expert/ specialist clean-up contractor;
o
Contaminated soil, ground and water will be disposed of as hazardous
waste (Section 4.5.11).
·
REPORT
o
An Environmental Incident Report will be completed in line with the
Incident Response Procedure (Section 2.5.10).

c)
Flood Risk Management Plan
4.2.9
The following provides an outline of the measures to be implemented to minimise
flood risk:
·
The main contractor(s) will sign up to receive NRW flood warnings or flood
alerts for the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw;
·
The main contractor(s) will sign up to receive high rainfall alerts provided by the
MET office as flood warning for the Project Site;
·
Weather forecasts will be checked regularly;
·
Plant, machinery and stockpiles will be stored away from watercourses, ditches
and low lying areas that could flood;
·
If flooding of the Project Site is expected, vehicles and plant machinery that
pose a hazard will be moved to higher ground or off-site if appropriate;
·
If flooding of the Project Site occurs, plant machinery and vehicles will be
checked to ensure they are safe before use; and
4.2.10 Where possible, temporary works (including stockpiles and drains) will be set to
direct overland flows away from the main Project Site and access routes.
4.3
Dust Management Plan
4.3.1
This plan contains a proposed dust monitoring plan and standard good practice
measures for reducing dust and emissions from vehicles.
4.3.2
Guidance relevant to the implementation of air quality measures include;
·
BS 6031: 2009: Code of Practice for Earth Works (Ref. 4.1);
·
HSE Vehicle at Work Guidance (Ref. 4.2); and
·
Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) Guidance on Air Quality Monitoring
in the Vicinity of Demolition and Construction Sites (Ref. 4.3).
a)
Contents of Plan
4.3.3
In line with IAQM guidance (Ref. 4.3) on monitoring air quality at construction sites;
daily visual inspections of dust emissions (and weekly recording) will be made in
conjunction with dust emissions monitoring at locations to be agreed with NRW.
This data will be used to ensure that mitigation measures are appropriate and being
applied rigorously and to provide early warning of increased dust emissions to
inform the cessation or modification of activities prior to impacts occurring.
4.3.4
Monitoring will be undertaken in the vicinity of the Lletty-Morfil SINC. Since the risk
for ecosystems relates to dust deposition, a real time monitor for total suspended
particulate matter will be installed. Trigger levels for the instrument, which would
suggest increasing risk/emissions,
will
be agreed with NRW prior to the
commencement of construction. The monitoring stations will be mobile and will be
moved around the Project Site as the principal activities move.
4.3.5
The following are general good practice measures that will be implemented onsite
to control dust and vehicle emissions. If inspections and monitoring find that plumes
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

vi. Emissions Management
·
Plant and equipment will be operated as far as possible away from residential
areas or sensitive receptors near to the Project Site;
·
An onsite speed limit will be implemented by the main contractor(s) that will be
appropriate to the types of construction plant utilised and the Project Site
hazards in line with Vehicles at Work guidance from the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) (Ref. 4.2);
·
Onsite vehicle movement will be kept to a minimum and restricted to
adequately compacted internal roads;
·
All plant utilised on Project Site should be regularly inspected.  Monitoring of
plant will include:
o
Ensuring no black smoke is emitted other than during ignition;
o
Ensuring exhaust emissions are maintained to comply with the
appropriate limits;

Vehicle exhausts will be directed away from the ground and other surfaces and
preferably upwards to avoid road dust being re-suspended to the air; and
·
Exhausts will be positioned at a sufficient height to ensure adequate dispersal
of emissions.
4.4
Pollution Prevention Management Plan
4.4.1
This plan covers measures to minimise the risk of pollution to ground and water
from the storage and use of potentially polluting materials onsite. The sections
below detail the storage of fuels and oil, management of non-oil chemicals,
potential pollution from construction vehicles, plant and machinery and the use of
cement and concrete.
4.4.2
An Emergency Spill Response Plan is set out within Section Error! Reference

Refuelling of construction plant and vehicles will be undertaken on an
impermeable surface at a temporary construction compound only.
·
All refuelling activities will be supervised by site personnel with emergency
response training.
ii.
Cement and Concrete
4.4.6
Concrete and cement are alkaline and corrosive, and can have a highly polluting
impact in water and on land and are harmful to human flesh.
4.4.7
Due to the size of the Project Site it is likely that concrete batching will occur onsite.
The equipment used for concrete batching should be operated in accordance with
Process Guidance Note 3/01(12) (Ref. 4.5).
4.4.8
Mixing and washing of concrete will not take place within 10 m of any watercourse
or swale and waste waters will not be discharged into the water environment. All
site personnel will receive training on concrete washout as part of their Site

·
4.5
Waste and Material Management Plan
4.5.1
To ensure efficiency of resource use, prevention of litter nuisance and compliance
with waste legislation, this sections sets out good practice waste and material
management measures.
4.5.2
Construction activities associated with materials and/or waste generation include:
·
Site clearance
will remove vegetation and undergrowth in work areas
generating organic materials and waste;
·
Excavation; it is estimated that the overall quantity of excavated material (solid)
from the construction is to be approximately 19,000 m3m3. This figure is a
measure of excavated material in the ground and bulk material. The worst case
scenario assessed in Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access of the ES
assumes that none of this excavated material can be reused within the Project
Site. However the worst case is not anticipated; and
·
General day-to-day construction operations such as use of welfare facilities and
deliveries generating packaging, domestic waste and sewage.
4.5.3
Waste likely to be generated during construction includes:
·
Topsoil and subsoil;
·
Excess concrete, mortar and grout;
·
Wood off cuts and used wood (crates and concrete formwork);
·
Bricks, pavers and concrete block off cuts;
·
Roofing materials;
·
Metal including steel reinforcement off cuts;
·
Plastic wrapping and packaging;

·
Miscellaneous materials
4.5.4
The EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (Ref. 4.6) provides the overarching
legislative framework for the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste,
and includes a common definition of waste. The Project will operate in accordance
with the WFD, together with the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales)
Regulations 2016 (Ref.4.7) and the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales)
Regulations 2005 (as amended by the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales)
Amendment Regulations 2009 and 2016) (Ref. 4.8).
4.5.5
Other guidance referred to within the CEMP includes:
·
The Waste Classification Technical Guidance WM3 (Ref. 4.9), which sets out a
standardised classification of waste based on material properties;
·
Welsh Government Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy (Ref. 4.10); and
·
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s (DEFRA) Waste Duty
of Care Code of Practice (Ref. 4.11).
a)
Contents of Plan
i.
Waste Hierarchy
4.5.6
Onsite waste management will align with the Waste Hierarchy, which promotes
efficient resource use and minimisation of waste through the priority ordering of the
following measures:
·
Prevention;
·
Preparing for re-use;
·
Recycle;
·
Other recovery; and
·
Dispose (Ref. 4.11).
4.5.7
The priority order may be deviated from if a better overall environmental outcome is
recognised for a particular resource or waste.
ii.
Waste Prevention
4.5.8
The following preventative measures will be adopted:
·
Building materials ordered will be the correct size so as not to be wasted due to
being obsolete;
·
The appropriate volume of material will be ordered to avoid excess;
·
Ordering of new materials will be avoided if there are existing materials
available or able to be adapted to the task within the Project Site;
·
Deliveries will be timely and directly placed in secure storage areas, double
handling will be kept to a minimum;
·
Re-usable materials will be identified onsite and removed for storage and re-
sale;
·
Excess materials will be returned to the supplier if possible; and

24
·
General information on site waste management will be provided in Site
Inductions and toolbox talks with feedback welcomed.
iii.
Classification of Waste
4.5.9
APL and/ or the main contractor(s) will identify and classify all Project Site waste
streams in line with the categories and methods set out in the Waste Classification
Technical Guidance WM3 (Ref. 4.9).
iv. Storing Waste
4.5.10 Where resources are earmarked for recycling, recovery or disposal the following
method of storage will be implemented to minimise the risk of waste escaping, litter
and/ or pollution:
·
All waste will be stored at the location in which it is generated, or within a
designated central waste storage area;
·
These designated waste storage areas will be isolated from surface water
drains and areas that discharge directly to the water environment;
·
Waste will be stored in suitable containers of sufficient capacity to avoid loss,
overflow or spillage;
·
Storage of liquid wastes will be on impermeable bunds that hold the capacity of
the container;
·
Waste will be segregated by waste stream and storage containers will be
clearly signed with the waste that they will hold e.g. wood, metal, plastics or
other appropriate waste stream;
·
Storage containers will be secure, covered or enclosed;
·
There will be separate containers for hazardous waste (see Paragraph 4.5.11);
·
Skips will be monitored and action taken if waste levels are too high; and
·
Burning of waste is prohibited.
v.
Hazardous Waste
4.5.11 “Hazardous waste” is any waste which contains properties that might make it
harmful to human health or the environment (Ref. 4.8).
4.5.12 Hazardous waste could arise during construction from the following sources:
·
Maintenance of plant and machinery;
·
Oily water waste;
·
Oily rags;
·
Oil absorbent pads etc.; and
·
Environmental Spill recovery (small amounts only; larger volumes taken away
directly for disposal).

4.5.14 The waste wood and foliage material resulting from site clearance will be managed
in-line with the Waste Hierarchy (as detailed within paragraph 4.5.6), thus helping
to minimise potential environmental issues pertaining to this process.
4.5.15 Wherever feasible, the generation of tree and foliage waste will be prevented and
these features will be retained in-situ. However, the retention of trees and foliage
will not always be possible; therefore the reuse of material onsite will be explored
wherever practicable, with wood material either reused in construction, or within
landscaping aspects such as the use of wood chippings, or as mulch to enhance
soil quality to aid the reinstatement of the Project Site.
4.5.16 Should this not prove to be a viable option for all generated material, then excess
wood waste will be stored under cover, such as tarpaulin, to protect wood from the
weather so that it may be re-used wherever possible off-site e.g. as carpentry
material or offered to the local community for fire wood and biomass.
4.5.17 Attention will also be paid to the proximity principle, with local uses for waste
materials considered where this represents the best practicable environmental
option. For all material that cannot be re-used on- or off- site, or recycled, then
elements of the wood and foliage material can be converted into wood-chip. By
following this process, it will be possible to limit the volume of tree and foliage
waste sent for disposal as far as practicably possible.
4.5.18
Any topsoil or subsoil generated will remain onsite to be reused for any
landscaping.
vii. Transporting Waste
·
Waste contractors will be checked periodically (bi-annually) to ensure they
have valid licences;  and
·
All waste leaving the Project Site will be accompanied by a Waste Transfer
Note (WTN) for non-hazardous waste or a Special Waste Consignment Note
(SWCN) for hazardous waste.  A copy of which will be retained for 2 (WTN) or
3 years (SWCN).

A CEMP will be prepared and then implemented during construction to
mitigate any adverse environmental effects. An Outline CEMP for the
Project is provided in Appendix 3.1 of the ES. It includes measures
relating to the environmental topics assessed in this ES which will
mitigate the effects of construction. The CEMP will be finalised and
followed by the Contractor on site, once the content has been agreed
with CCS. The Outline CEMP includes the following information:
·
Community liaison;
·
Complaints procedures;
·
Nuisance management including measures to avoid or minimise
the impacts of construction works (covering dust, noise, vibration
and lighting);
·
Dust management measures;

Institute of Air Quality Managers (IAQM) guidance on monitoring air
quality at construction sites (Ref A.1) recommends that, in addition to
visual inspections, ambient air monitoring is undertaken in the vicinity of
high risk sites. This data is required for two reasons: the first relates to
ensuring that mitigation measures are appropriate and being applied
rigorously; the second is to provide early warning of increased dust
emissions which allows for the cessation or modification of activities
prior to impacts occurring.

needs to be an ‘indicative instrument’ only. Trigger levels for the
instrument, which would suggest increasing risk/emissions, should be

·
Abiding by any construction noise limits at nearby NSRs;
·
Ensuring that all processes are in place to minimise noise before
works begin and ensuring that best practicable measures (BPM)
are being achieved throughout the construction programme,
including the use of localised screening around significant noise
producing plant and activities;
·
Ensuring that modern plant is used, complying with the latest
European noise emission requirements.  Selection of inherently
quiet plant where possible;
·
Hydraulic techniques for breaking to be used in preference to
percussive techniques where practical;
·
Use of lower noise piling (such as rotary bored or hydraulic
jacking) rather the driven piling techniques (if required), where
possible;
·
Off-site pre-fabrication, where practical;
·
All plant and equipment being used for the works to be properly
maintained, silenced where appropriate, operated to prevent
excessive noise, and switched off when not in use;
·
All contractors to be made familiar with current legislation and the
guidance in BS 5228 (Parts 1 and 2), which should form a
prerequisite of their appointment;
·
Loading and unloading of vehicles, dismantling of site equipment
such as scaffolding or moving equipment or materials around the
Project Site, to be conducted in such a manner as to minimise
noise generation;
·
Appropriate routing of construction traffic on public roads and
along access tracks;
·
Consultation with CCC and local residents to advise of potential
noisy works that are due to take place; and
·
Monitoring of noise complaints, and reporting to the main
contractor for immediate investigation.

The preferred approach for controlling construction noise and vibration
is to reduce levels at source where possible, but with due regard to

Monitoring
During operation, monitoring is considered appropriate in order to track
the success of delivery of proposed mitigation. Ideally this monitoring
would be based on regular or fixed measurements close to the Project
Site boundary to give consistency by minimising the impact of weather
and extraneous sources.  The measured levels at these locations must
be calibrated against the levels at the receptors as part of the plant
commissioning sound test procedure.  Any change in Project Site
boundary levels can then be related directly to changes at the
receptors.

Hydrological protection measures have been included in the Outline
Surface Water Management Plan (Appendix 3.2) to prevent pollution
events, with particular reference to the Gas Connection and section of
new Access Road. The Surface Water Management Plan includes
details of silt traps and / or sedimats to reduce flow of suspended
solids, suitable phasing to reduce the need for unprotected slopes and
avoidance of stockpiled materials.

The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul
water drainage system. The Project Site is remote and it is believed it
will be unfeasible to connect to a public sewer. Therefore, a foul water
drainage system will either drain to a septic tank or a package
treatment plant within the Project Site but outside any area at risk of
flooding. It is likely that the latter would be the preferred option for ease
of maintenance and environmental criteria. The processed water would
then discharge on site or to a nearby watercourse in accordance with
Environmental Permit conditions, if required.

To prevent inundation of the Project Site from surface runoff cut off
drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill site perimeter. These

It is not expected that it will be possible to connect the surface water
drainage system to an
infiltration basin due to the presumed
predominantly clayey ground and high groundwater level in places.
This will be confirmed when the Ground Investigation surveys are
carried out post-consent. Instead the discharged flow of water at the
Generating Equipment Site boundary from the surface water drainage
system will be attenuated in order to maintain the equivalent greenfield
runoff flow for a range of events up to the 1 in 100 year event (with
climate change allowance). The flow will be attenuated using suitably
sized attenuation ponds with restricted discharge pipes to the existing
greenfield runoff rates. An emergency overflow will be provided to the
attenuation ponds to prevent site flooding in the event of an extreme
rainfall event with suitable pollution prevention measures installed if
possible to avoid a pollution event, although priority must be given to
site security and resilience.

dB(A) Sound Pressure Level at 1 m.
·
Gas turbine air inlet filter and ventilation apertures are to be

receptors benefit from screening and/or directivity corrections.
·
Silencers are to be fitted in the exhaust stack. Due to the
impracticality of screening stack noise, discharge noise will be
controlled using these silencers, which will be tuned to
attenuate low frequencies from the Gas Turbine Generator
exhausts.
·
All plant items will be controlled to minimise noise of an
impulsive or tonal nature.

Outline Surface Water Management Plan
1.1 
Introduction
1.1.1 
The objective of the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) is to detail the water 
management principles and procedures to be implemented throughout the 
construction period of the Abergelli Power Project (the ‘Project’). The SWMP is 
designed to ensure compliance with surface water protection legislative 
requirements, Environmental Statement (ES) commitments and environmental 
permits conditions during construction. 
1.1.2 
This Outline SWMP has been developed by the applicant, Abergelli Power Limited 
(APL), and will be adopted and implemented by the main contractor upon 
appointment. It will be the responsibility of APL to ensure the Project is executed in 
a manner that demonstrates commitment to the care and protection of the aquatic 
environment. 
1.1.3 
After appointment of the main contractor, this Outline SWMP will be reviewed to 
include any additional requirements of the main contractor’s own environmental 
policies. The measures and procedures set out in the SWMP will feed-in to the 
detailed design process and the development of Construction Method Statements 
(CMS). This will include the selection and design of surface water drainage for the 
construction phase. The CMS will be submitted to the City and County of Swansea 
Council (CCS) and Natural Resource Wales (NRW) for approval as part of 
applications for temporary works environmental permits. On approval of the CMS, 
the SWMP will then be updated to include the finalised details for the construction 
surface water drainage.  
1.1.4 
The SWMP will be a ‘live’ document, which will be kept under continuous review by 
the main contractor. This is to take into account any additional environmental 
information obtained during the detailed design and construction phases, changes 
in legislation, policy and best practice, and any lessons learned on the Project. It 
will also allow for the inclusion of any further conditions and amendments that arise 
from the granting of any temporary works environmental permits, a review of 
environmental monitoring results or the legitimate concerns of Third Parties.  
1.1.5 
In implementing this plan, the main contractor will ensure that the measures and 
procedures are followed in accordance with the Outline Construction Environment 
Management Plan (CEMP) (Appendix 3.1).  
1.2 
Project Site Surface Water Features 
1.2.1 
The Project Site lies within the Afon Llan River catchment. The Afon Llan flows in a 
south-westerly direction past the southern boundary of the Project Site and links 
with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, before discharging into Carmarthen Bay.

1.2.2 
Within the Project Site itself, there are a number of small drainage ditches and land 
drains, as well as springs and spring-drainage rivulets that drain into the Afon Llan. 
There are two heavily vegetated ponds located within the Generating Equipment 
Site. These are of unverified extent owing to vegetation cover but are thought to 
have a radius of approximately 5 m.

1.4 
Water Management Measures 
a) 
Drainage Management  
1.4.1 
Information on the proposed design of the drainage system for the Project Site 
during the construction phase is available in Chapter 3: Project and Site 
Description of the ES and the Flood Consequence Assessment in Appendix 9.1 of 
the ES.  Surface water, foul water and water potentially contaminated with oil (oily 
water) will have separated drainage systems on the Project Site. Foul water and 
oily water will not be directly discharged into drains or watercourse, but collected 
and treated. These details will be finalised by the main contractor as part of the 
detailed design. 
1.4.2 
Details of the proposed permanent drainage system to be implemented through the 
operational phase are available in the Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E of the 
Flood Consequences Assessment).   
1.4.3 
The following measures will be implemented within the design of the construction 
drainage to safeguard water quality:  
 
All Project Site drainage measures will be developed in consultation with NRW 
prior to the commencement of construction;   
 
Sequencing of work will be such that proposed drainage measures, including 
flow controls and attenuation storage will be in place prior to erection of 
buildings and hardstanding;  
 
The construction oily water drainage will be designed in accordance with NGTS 
2.20 ‘Oil Containment at Electricity Substations and Other Operational Sites’ 
(Ref 1.3) Oil Storage Regulations 2016 (Ref 1.7) and Pollution Prevention 
Outline Surface Water Management Plan 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
3 
 
Guidance 3: Use and Design of Oil Separators in Surface Water Drainage 
Systems (Ref 1.8) or similar approved guidelines; 
 
The construction surface water drainage system will adopt the principles of the 
SuDs Manual (Ref 1.4) to adequately drain the Project Site and prevent 
ponding; and 
 
Any artificial drainage will only be installed where necessary. The individual 
lengths, depths and gradients of these drains will be minimised to avoid 
intercepting large volumes of diffuse overland flow and generating high velocity 
flows during storm events.   
b) 
Control of Runoff  
1.4.4 
During construction and site preparation, there will be a requirement for temporary 
measures to ensure controlled management of runoff draining from the Project Site. 
Runoff from the Project Site will not be allowed to drain directly into any water 
bodies untreated and will be collected, treated and attenuated using a range of 
control measures. These will include combinations of: 
 
Cut off drainage ditches; 
 
Infiltration drains; 
 
Suitably sized attenuation ponds with restricted discharge pipes;  
 
Road side swales; and 
 
Pollution control measures such as silt fencing, straw bales, sedimats and 
sediment traps.  
1.4.5 
The arrangements of such drainage infrastructure will be set out in the detailed 
design and, where appropriate, agreed with NRW prior to construction in 
accordance with the requirements of any temporary works discharge environmental 
permits.  
1.4.6 
The above measures will ensure that any sediment or other pollutants dissolved or 
carried in suspension in the surface water runoff from the Project Site will have 
been treated, filtered or settled out to an acceptable level before being discharged 
to a water body. Limits on the concentration of relevant physico-chemical 
parameters will be agreed with NRW as part of the process of determining a 
temporary works environmental permit from NRW. 
1.4.7 
All earthworks will be undertaken in accordance with BS6031:1981 Code of 
Practice for Earth Works (Ref 1.1).  Land disturbance will be kept to a minimum and 
disturbed areas will be stabilised as soon as possible after construction. 
c) 
Proximity to Water 
1.4.8 
The following good practice measures will be implemented to minimise the potential 
of direct pollution to water: 
 
A 10 m buffer will be applied to all Project Site watercourses. Where possible, 
this buffer will not be entered by plant and machinery;   
Outline Surface Water Management Plan 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4 
 
 
Stockpiles of excavated soils/peat will be located away from surface 
watercourses and away from known surface drainage pathways as much as 
possible; 
 
Laydown areas and plant and machinery will be stored at least 10 m from 
watercourses and where possible, in low flood risk areas; and  
 
Oil storage will comply with the measures set out in the Pollution Prevention 
Plan within the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) including, where possible being 
located at least 50 m from an open watercourse.   
d) 
Silt and Sediment 
1.4.9 
The following measures will be implemented in order to reduce the potential 
generation of silt laden runoff:  
 
The Project Site will be laid out to prevent runoff from stockpiles entering 
watercourses. Stockpiles of soils and excavated solid material will be 
surrounded at their bases by silt fencing that will be implemented as per 
manufacturer guidelines to prevent contaminated run-off being generated 
during inclement weather and where damping is used to prohibit dust;  
 
Bare ground exposure will be minimised by only removing vegetation from 
areas that require to be exposed in the near future and completing 
reinstatement as soon as practicably possible; 
 
Project Site roads will be regularly maintained and kept free from sediment 
deposits in order to reduce the volume of silt becoming entrained in surface 
runoff and entering any watercourse or drain;   
 
Mitigation will be implemented as required (silt fencing, placement of straw 
bales into ditches, sedimats or similar commercially available products and 
sediment traps) to intercept and collect silt, reduce runoff velocity and 
encourage deposition of suspended sediment; and   
 
Care will be taken during felling operations to reduce the risk of sedimentation 
and erosion into the watercourses. 
e) 
Control of Pumped Water 
1.4.10 Water pumped from excavations may contain a moderate level of suspended 
solids, which if left to drain untreated, could carry sediment into Afon Llan. As noted 
above, runoff from the Project Site will not be allowed to drain directly into any 
watercourse and will be filtered and attenuated using a variety of methods including 
silt traps and settlement lagoons. 
1.4.11 If pumping is required, disposal of water pumped from excavations will be in 
accordance with the following requirements: 
 
APL and the main contractor will ensure that all necessary consents, permits 
and licences will be obtained from NRW prior to any pumping; and  
 
No discharges will be made directly to watercourses or land unless agreed with 
NRW and a discharge licence will be sought.

Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This Outline Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) has been 
prepared by AECOM on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited (APL) in respect of 
the Abergelli Power Project (referred to as 'the Project' from herein). 
1.1.2 
This document supports the Environmental Statement (ES) which is 
submitted as part of the DCO Application. A Transport Assessment (TA) has 
also been undertaken and can be found in ES Chapter 12: Traffic, 
Transport and Access. 
1.2 
The Project 
1.2.1 
The Project is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km 
north of Junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of the City and 
County of Swansea Council (CCS), approximately 1 km southeast of 
Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
1.2.2 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which is required 
for construction of the Project, is referred to as the 'Project Site'. The 
approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 201431. 
The Project Site covers an area of up to approximately 30 ha. 
1.2.3 
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse 
grazing. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses the existing 
Access Road leading to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station from the B4489. 
1.2.4 
The components of the Project are summarised in Table 1.1.

1.3 
Structure of Construction Traffic Management Plan 
1.3.1 
The CTMP provides a framework for addressing the transport issues 
associated with the movement of construction traffic to serve the 
construction of the Project, including movements to/from the local and 
strategic highway network, along the existing Access Road (that serves the 
National Grid premises), the new section of Access Road that will be 
constructed to serve the Power Generation Plant and the new access to the 
proposed  AGI. These will be considered with regard to routeing, signage, 
HGVs and Abnormal Indivisible Loads (AILs). 
1.3.2 
The purpose of this document is to set out the principles that APL and the 
contractor will follow to manage construction traffic during the construction of 
the Project. 
1.3.3 
The CTMP is structured as follows: 
 
Section 2 - Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility: Sets out the local 
transport conditions in the vicinity of the site and access to non-car 
modes of transport; 
 
Section 3 - Access Arrangements and Management Measures: Details 
the access arrangements to the Project Site during construction of the 
Project and the management measures to minimise the disruption on the 
highway network and internal access roads; and

2. 
Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility 
2.1 
Local Highway Network 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is served by a privately maintained Access Road from the 
B4489. The Access Road is unlit. The width of the Access Road varies along 
its length between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered by trees and 
intermittent hedgerows. The Access Road connects to the B4489 via a 
simple priority junction. This is characterised by large radii on the minor arm 
(the Access Road) to accommodate HGV movements. 
2.1.2 
The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately 
2.3 km from the Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south 
(approximately 1.8 km from the Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 40 
mph speed limit at its junction with the Access Road. At this location, the 
road has a 5.5 m wide carriageway and is unlit. Approximately 330 m to the 
north of the Access Road, the B4489 becomes subject to the national speed 
limit. The B4489 continues a further 1.7 km north where it connects to Rhyd-
y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This section of the B4489 is unlit and 
ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places. 
The junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its approaches are subject to a 30 
mph speed limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east for 1.6 km where it passes 
the northern extent of the Project Boundary. This section of Rhyd-y-Pandy 
Road is unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous 
passing places. It is subject to a 30 mph speed limit, increasing to the 
national speed limit around 900 m east of its junction with the B4489. It also 
serves the Felindre Water Treatment Works. 
2.1.3 
Approximately 475 m to the south of the Access Road, the B4489 is street lit. 
A further 75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm 
roundabout with the access to the Felindre Park and Share. 
2.1.4 
On an average weekday, the B4489 carries approximately 130 vehicles 
during the AM peak hour, 90 vehicles during the PM peak hour, and 1,000 
vehicles over the 24-hour period. HGVs account for no more than 2% of total 
traffic. 
2.1.5 
The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The 
northern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489 
and the eastbound on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout 
junction comprises six arms; the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea 
Road, and the westbound on/off-slips of the M4. The south-eastern arm of 
the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction with Pant Lasau Road 
approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell roundabout. These 
junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit.

2.2 
Walking and Cycling 
2.2.1 
The walking and cycling facilities and Public Rights of Way (PROW) are 
shown on Figure 2.1. 
2.2.2 
There are no footways that serve the Project Site. The nearest footways are 
on the B4489, approximately 475m south of the Access Road (on the 
approach to the junction with the Felindre Park and Share). This footway 
continues to the M4 Junction 46. The 500 m section of the footway to the 
north of the M4 Junction 46 is separated from the carriageway edge by a 
barrier. At the M4 Junction 46 the footways continues south along the east 
side of the carriageway, serving the southern arms of the southern dumbbell 
roundabout, with dropped kerbs and tactile paving to facilitate crossing 
movements across entry arms. 
2.2.3 
There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Project Site. Part of 
the B4489 is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle 
map. This covers the section of the B4489 that routes north from the Access 
Road to Felindre and to a point approximately 475 m south of the Access 
Road. 
2.2.4 
There are numerous PROW crossing/in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of 
Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. 
Footpath LC35B passes through the northern part of the Project Site, 
connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road in the vicinity of the AGI Access. 
2.3 
Public Transport 
2.3.1 
The nearest bus stop to the Project Site is the 'Lliw Reservoirs' stop located 
on Rhyd-y-Pandy Road. This is situated to the east of Felindre and 
approximately 500 m to the northwest of the northern extent of the Project 
Site boundary. There is no footway between the Project Site and this bus 
stop. It provides access to Service 142, which routes between Morriston and 
Garnswllt. This service is operated by DANSA, a community transport 
organisation. There are three to four services per day in each direction, 
although these can generally only be pre-booked. 
2.3.2 
Service 141 passes to the south of the Project Site, routeing between 
Gorseinon and Morriston. The nearest stop that provides access to this 
service is the 'Pant Lasau Cross' stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad 
Road. It is situated approximately 750 m to the southeast of the southern 
extent of the Project Site boundary and can be accessed via Footpath 
LC117.

2.3.3 
There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Project Site. Llansamlet 
railway station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Project Site, 
accessible by car via the A48 (from M4 Junction 44 and 46). Swansea 
railway station is a further 7 km from the Project Site; this is a key local 
transport hub and is more easily accessible by public transport. Swansea 
railway station is managed by Arriva Trains Wales. There are four services 
daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly service from Swansea to 
Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and a total of two to 
three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great Western 
Railway also provides services from Swansea to London Paddington, calling 
at Bristol Parkway. 
2.3.4 
Overall, the opportunities to access the Project Site by public transport are 
limited, and it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this 
assessment, no trips by construction, maintenance and permanent staff will 
be undertaken by these modes. 
2.4 
Parking 
2.4.1 
Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m 
south of the Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre 
Business Park. It has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for 
employees of the DVLA HQ in Clase. A shuttle bus service runs between the 
Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. The Felindre Park and Share is 
understood to be managed by the DVLA and will not be available for use by 
the Project. 
2.4.2 
A layby is located adjacent to the northbound carriageway of the B4489, 
approximately 800 m from the M4 Junction 46, and 950 m from the Access 
Road. The layby measures approximately 50 m in length.

Access Arrangements and Management Measures 
3.1 
Construction Access Routes 
3.1.1 
The access route to the Project Site comprises four parts. These and the 
associated management measures along the route are set out under the 
following sub-headings and shown on Figure 3.1. 
Local/Strategic Highway Network to Existing Access Road 
3.1.2 
Access to the Project Site (from the public highway) will be from the B4489. 
Construction traffic will route to/from the M4 Junction 46, located 
approximately 1.8 km from the Access Road. This section of the route is 
approximately 2 km in length. This route would be used during both the 
construction and operational phases of the Project. 
3.1.3 
A layby is located adjacent to the northbound carriageway of the B4489, 
approximately 950 m from the Access Road. The layby measures 
approximately 50 m in length, which is sufficient storage capacity for two 
HGVs, as shown on Figure 3.2. HGVs travelling to the Project Site will be 
instructed to enter the layby before proceeding to the Access Road. On 
arrival at the layby, HGVs will contact a Site Representative (Site 
Representative A) to be stationed at a holding area located approximately 40 
m along the Access Road (east of the gates to the Access Road). Site 
Representative A will advise whether the holding area has capacity to 
accommodate HGVs, instructing HGVs to wait at the layby/proceed to the 
site as appropriate. The layby will be subject to a Temporary Traffic 
Regulation Order (TTRO) for closure to non-construction traffic during the 
construction phase to ensure that the layby has capacity to accommodate 
HGVs. 
Existing Access Road (B4489 to National Grid) 
3.1.4 
The second part of the construction access route is along the existing 
Access Road which currently serves the National Grid premises. This is 
approximately 1 km in length between the B4489 at the western extent and 
the National Grid car park in the east. There are also additional adjoining 
accesses to National Grid areas along this route. A new section of Access 
Road will be constructed to serve the Project Site off the existing Access 
Road (discussed at Paragraph 3.1.6).

3.1.5 
HGV movements along the existing Access Road will be managed by 
construction staff so that no two-way traffic movements are undertaken along 
the affected section of Access Road while an HGV is routeing along the 
Access Road. This will be managed by Site Representative A and a site 
representative (Site Representative B) located near the access to the new 
section of Access Road and in close proximity to the bend immediately after 
the existing height restricting frame, who will be in contact via radio. Traffic 
associated with the construction activities will be held at these locations and 
priority will be given to all National Grid vehicles and employees. 
New Section of Access Road 
3.1.6 
A new section of Access Road will be constructed between the existing 
Access Road and the Laydown Area within the Project Site. This will 
commence at a point around 850 m along the existing Access Road. 
3.1.7 
HGV movements along the new section of Access Road will be managed by 
construction staff so that no resultant two-way traffic movements are 
experienced along the existing Access Road or at the junction of the two 
routes. This will be managed by Site Representative B and, if found to be 
required, a further site representative (Site Representative C) will be located 
within the Project Site (at the Laydown Area), who will be in contact via radio. 
Any HGV movements will be managed out of the new section of Access 
Road as appropriate. This will ensure priority is given to National Grid 
vehicles and employees on the existing Access Road. 
AGI Access 
3.1.8 
The construction route to the AGI will result in the use of a section of the 
B4489 to the north of the existing Access Road. This continues 
approximately 2.1 km north before continuing east along Rhyd-y-Pandy 
Road for approximately 1.5 km. Much of the AGI access route is constrained 
in terms of two-way movement. Construction activities associated with the 
AGI will be undertaken over two quarterly periods, with up to 30 HGV 
movements per day. 
3.1.9 
The HGVs associated with the AGI will continue to the site without the need 
for being held. The AGI access will be managed by the construction team 
and will not be in use by third parties, as is the case for the existing National 
Grid access. 
3.1.10 An alternative route via Rhyd-y-Pandy Road has been considered. This 
suffers from similar constraints to the route proposed, but would involve 
routeing via Pant-Lasau. Experience of this route gives us knowledge of the 
Local Highway Authority's (LHA’s) concerns of the local roads being beyond 
theoretical vehicular capacity in the peak hour periods. In addition to this, the 
route passes through more residential areas and there could be issues with 
Morriston Hospital traffic. On this basis, it is considered more appropriate for 
the AGI construction traffic to access the north of the site using the B4489.

3.2 
AIL Routeing 
3.2.1 
An AIL is a vehicle that has any of the following: 
 
A weight of more than 44 tonnes; 
 
An axle load of more than 10 tonnes for a single non-driving axle  and 
11.5 tonnes for a single driving axle; 
 
A width of more than 2.9m; and 
 
A length of more than 18.65m. 
3.2.2 
The shape and scale of these loads will be refined as the construction 
process develops in more detail. At this stage, we have taken instruction 
from the current design and from previous experience from within the 
Applicant team. There are expected to be two AILs; these are likely to be 
around 5 m in width, potentially 6.5 m in height and up to around 50 m in 
length. The total vehicle weight could be up to 400 tonnes per vehicle. The 
new section of Access Road has been designed to accommodate these 
vehicles, and provision will made along the Access Road through widening 
as appropriate. These loads will be travelling with a full complement of 
technical operators, mobile safety entourage and police escort. It is assumed 
that the heavy and large equipment will arrive via water transport to either 
Swansea or Port Talbot Docks. The route to the Project Site will be confined 
to the strategic highway network wherever possible and will take as direct a 
route as available given the local circumstances. The pre-planning and lead 
up time required for the transportation of such loads will ensure that all 
appropriate measures are in place and relevant authorities are notified. 
3.2.3 
Once the Contractor has been appointed, and prior to transportation of the 
first AIL, an access route survey report will be produced by the haulage 
company to identify any pinch-points requiring mitigation (such as temporary 
removal of road traffic signs). The access route survey report will detail: 
 
Preferred ports of entry; 
 
Delivery routes; 
 
Potential pinch-points and any street furniture removal/temporary 
highway alterations required; and 
 
Delivery vehicles. 
3.3 
Haulage Responsibilities for AILs 
3.3.1 
The following requirements will be the responsibility of the haulage 
companies during the delivery of AIL components: 
 
The tendering process for the construction of the site will ensure that AIL 
drivers and their convoy are fully aware of the access route and do not 
deviate from this; 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
14 
 
 
Deliveries should only take place during the hours agreed with the 
Police, LHA (CCS) and South Wales Trunk Road Agent (SWTRA); 
 
Peak traffic periods and school run periods will be avoided when timing 
deliveries to and from the Project Site; 
 
Deliveries on a Saturday between 08.00 and 13.00 may be undertaken if 
this is acceptable to the Police, LHA and SWTRA; 
 
Written notification of the commencement of the delivery period(s) 
should be given to the Police, LHA and SWTRA, within an agreed 
timescale, to allow for the safe coordination of the work; and 
 
Further temporary warning signs may be provided on the AIL delivery 
route in accordance with the requirements of the various Highway 
Authorities along the route. 
3.3.2 
For the delivery of AIL, it will be the responsibility of the haulage company to 
contact and inform the following stakeholders to inform them of delivery 
dates and likely impact of delivery. 
Emergency Services 
3.3.3 
The Police, Fire and Ambulance service will be given written notice of the AIL 
deliveries. 
Highway Authorities 
3.3.4 
The Highway Authorities will be given written notice of the AIL deliveries. The 
relevant authorities will include the LHA (CCS) and SWTRA. 
3.3.5 
Authorities can be notified using the Highways England Electronic Service 
Delivery for Abnormal Loads (ESDAL) system. 
3.3.6 
Any request for an AIL movement must include an indemnity to ensure that 
the cost of repairing any damage to the highway causing by transporting the 
AIL can be recovered. 
Local Residents 
3.3.7 
Local residents affected by AIL deliveries will be notified prior to 
commencement of the deliveries. The method of communicating information 
will be agreed with the LHA (CCS), but could include the use of leaflet drops 
and information in the local media. The timing of the notification will be 
subject to the appointment of the AIL operator and handler who will be able 
to provide more information on the time and duration of the expected load 
delivery. Notification will be made in advance and as part of the consultation 
process and once the necessary agreements are obtained from the Highway 
Authorities detailed above. The communication should include the following 
information: 
 
Name and number of the Construction Site Manager; 
 
Commencement date for deliveries; 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
15 
 
 
Duration of delivery period; 
 
Estimated time of deliveries; 
 
Request to keep the highway clear of parked cars during the delivery 
period; and 
 
Emergency number of Local Police and LHA Helpdesk. 
Local Business 
3.3.8 
Local businesses should be approached directly to ensure the effect on their 
businesses is minimised. This will be carried out in a similar timeframe and 
manner to that set out for local residents, detailed above. 
Local Services 
3.3.9 
The contractor and haulage company will make all reasonable efforts to work 
with local service providers to ensure disruption caused by deliveries is 
avoided. Services of particular relevance include but are not limited to: 
 
Royal Mail for postal delivery services and distribution vehicles; 
 
Local buses; 
 
Refuse collection; and 
 
Regular good deliveries. 
Planned Engineering Works 
3.3.10 The contractor and haulage company will work with CCS to identify any 
planned engineering works that could cause conflict with the proposed 
delivery route times. Discussions will then be made to minimise disruption to 
the local community and the planned engineering works. 
Local Community Events 
3.3.11 The contractor and haulage company will work with CCS to identify any 
conflicts with school and nursery drop off and pick up locations and times. 
Where possible, construction deliveries will be scheduled to avoid these 
busy periods. The chosen routes have also been selected ensuring that the 
journey of construction traffic is direct and contained, using higher 
classification of roads, wherever possible. 
3.3.12 Planned and notified community events will also be considered by the 
contractor and haulage company when scheduling deliveries. The 
Construction Site Manager will contact event organisers to ensure any 
issues are considered.

Highway Conditions Survey 
3.3.13 A highway condition survey of the public highway along the access route will 
be undertaken by the haulage company prior to the first AIL and following the 
final AIL. Any road maintenance issues directly caused by the AIL will be 
notified and approved through the normal process by CCS Highway 
Inspectors. 
3.4 
Construction Signage 
3.4.1 
Signage will be provided along the construction routes to direct construction 
traffic to/from the Project Site and to warn other road users construction 
traffic movements in key locations, e.g. the B4489/Access Road junction. 
The location and form of signage will be agreed with the LHA. Signage will 
also be provided within the Project Site to guide construction traffic in and 
out of the Laydown Area and the Generating Equipment Site, and to the 
construction parking bays. The location of the signage will be developed as 
the Project progresses and in discussion with the LHA and National Grid. 
3.5 
Monitoring of Construction Traffic 
3.5.1 
AIL and HGV deliveries to site will be monitored to check compliance with 
the proposed routeing strategy. The final measures will be agreed with the 
LHA and the contractor, as either the use of one or a number of measures 
could be utilised to achieve compliance. An example of a possible monitoring 
measure is a sticker system thereby all HGVs delivering to the Project Site 
would be required to display a sticker in the front window. This would allow 
HGVs to be visually assessed for compliance with the proposed routes. 
3.5.2 
The haulage companies may be able to offer more advanced compliance 
measures depending on the type of tracking/monitoring system they employ 
on their vehicles. 
3.6 
Construction Laydown Area 
3.6.1 
A temporary Laydown Area during construction will be provided for the 
storage of materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking and temporary 
fencing. The Laydown Area will be provided adjacent to the Generating 
Equipment Site. A small permanent area within the Laydown Area is required 
for maintenance during the operational phase of the Project. 
3.6.2 
Sufficient car parking will be provided within the Laydown Area. During 
operation car parking for operational and maintenance staff would be 
provided within the Generating Equipment Site. The Project will take into 
account CCS's policy on parking standards during the operational phase of 
the Project and implement sustainable transport methods through travel 
planning measures, where possible.

3.7 
Scheduling of Deliveries 
3.7.1 
A booking system will be used to log vehicles entering and leaving the 
Project Site. Where possible, deliveries will be spread across the day to 
minimise the impact of HGV traffic during the peak periods. 
3.7.2 
The transport of AILs will be timed to be undertaken at night or outside of the 
peak hours on the highway network to minimise disruption. These deliveries 
will be pre-arranged with local authorities and the police. 
3.8 
Cleansing of Vehicles Prior to Exiting the Site 
3.8.1 
All vehicles exiting the Project Site will be required to undertake effective 
vehicle cleaning and wheel-washing to minimise the amount of debris which 
is transferred to the Access Road and the local highway network. There will 
be specialised water tanks, hosing equipment, water collection and 
treatment tanks to undertake the cleaning process. The location of the wheel 
cleaning facility within the Project Site would be determined by the contractor 
in agreement with National Grid. 
3.9 
Highway Conditions Survey 
3.9.1 
A pre-construction condition survey, including road and verge condition at the 
junction of the Access Road and the B4489 and PROW (where directly 
affected) within the boundary of the Project Site would be undertaken prior to 
the commencement of the construction programme. 
3.9.2 
Three PROWs crossing the Project Site will be reinstated to their pre-
construction condition upon completion of works (where any damage is 
attributable to contractors working on behalf of APL) or permanently diverted 
as appropriate. These PROW will be stopped up or diverted temporarily 
during construction to ensure public safety. 
3.10 
PROW 
3.10.1 Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of 
Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. 
Footpath LC35B passes through the northern part of the Project Site. There 
will be further consultation to develop measures in respect of the PROW. 
Where possible, connectivity will be maintained by the use of temporary 
diversions and working methods to allow the PROWs to remain open for the 
majority of the construction period. Potential measures include fencing to 
ensure separation between movements along the PROW and construction 
activities (for PROW within the Project Site), and signage/management of 
movements where PROW cross construction traffic routes.

3.11 
Construction Staff Travel Plan 
3.11.1 Staff will be encouraged, where possible, to car share to the Project Site. It is 
recognised that using sustainable modes of transport may not be suitable 
due to working hours or the site location. However, car sharing would reduce 
the total number of trips to the Project Site. The Contractor will also be 
encouraged to lay on crew vehicles. 
3.12 
Measures relating to National Grid 
3.12.1 The measures set out in this plan largely relate to the public highway 
network. In this case the Access Road to the construction site will, in part, 
require use of the existing Access Road which is currently operated by 
National Grid. Therefore, there will be a number of measures which will 
relate to National Grid as a business and as a provider of utilities. The 
measures below have been developed following ongoing discussions with 
and input from National Grid representatives. 
 
Works planned by National Grid in relation to the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the Substation will be taken into consideration 
when finalising the Project construction plan. At the time of this report it 
has been determined that any future works planned by National Grid 
would not occur within the Project’s construction period. Liaison will 
continue prior and during construction with appropriate management 
measures implemented if needed; 
 
National Grid operational staff at Felindre currently comprises four site-
based staff in attendance 0800 hours to 1600 hours. The site entrance 
gate is locked outside of these times. There are also instances where 
weekend work is required. The contractor appointed for the Project 
construction will manage the gate security if working outside of these 
hours and ensure the National Grid access is not obstructed; 
 
To assist with the above and also with the construction communication 
process, National Grid will be provided with a named APL contact, the 
construction site manager or an appropriate project manager. Either the 
nominated construction manager will ensure that key communication is 
continually fed to National Grid operatives and will be the point of contact 
for all queries; 
 
Height clearance for overhead cables has been discussed with National 
Grid and the project team will ensure that all available information is 
considered and that HGV loads are able to safely pass below the cable 
lines; 
 
The existing height restriction gate will be temporarily removed to 
accommodate the width of any AILs, and only for these loads, it will be 
fully reinstated immediately after this work. In the interim period a height 
safety bunting gateway will be erected to ensure height limits are in 
place; 
 
There are a number of cable burials beneath the existing Access Road. 
The location of these is the subject of discussion at the time of writing 
this document. Location plans will be provided by National Grid and the 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited

AECOM 
19 
 
APL construction team will record and manage these appropriately. 
Liaison will continue through the planning and pre-construction period to 
understand if further works are required to protect or reroute cables; 
 
National Grid will be kept informed of the planning for AILs with 
measures put into place to use the existing access outside of National 
Grid’s key required access times. 
 
A highway condition survey of the existing Access Road will be 
undertaken by the APL construction team and National Grid, recording 
the condition of the route prior to work commencement. Following 
completion of the construction period, a final inspection will be carried 
out and any defects which have occurred since the first inspection will be 
recorded; and 
 
A highway condition survey of the existing Access Road will be 
undertaken by the haulage company prior to the first AIL and following 
the final AIL as a separate measure and in conjunction with the wider 
highway inspection.

Traffic Generation and Impacts 
4.1.1 
The TA sets out the level of traffic generation of the Project and considered 
the impacts on the highway network. 
4.1.2 
The peak traffic during construction is expected to result in approximately 
270 car or van trips per day and around 130 HGV deliveries per day. This 
assumes a 22-month construction period, with the peak of HGV deliveries 
occurring during the first three months of the period and the peak of car and 
van trips occurring during months 13 to 15. The car or van trips would be 
limited to the start and end of the working day whilst HGV trips would be 
spread across the day. 
4.1.3 
Construction traffic generated by both staff and deliveries would arrive at the 
site from 08:00 and depart the site by 18:00 Mondays to Fridays. On 
Saturday and public holidays staff and deliveries would arrive at the site from 
08:00 and depart the site by 13:00. AILs will be transported outside peak 
hours.

Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This Construction Staff Travel Plan (CSTP) has been prepared by AECOM 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited (APL) in respect of the Abergelli Power 
Project (hereafter referred to as 'the Project’). 
1.1.2 
This document supports the Environmental Statement (ES) which is 
submitted as part of the DCO Application.  
1.2 
The Project 
1.2.1 
The Project is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km 
north of Junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of the City and 
County of Swansea Council (CCS), approximately 1 km southeast of 
Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
1.2.2 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which is required 
for construction of the Project, is referred to as the 'Project Site'. The 
approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 201431. 
The Project Site covers an area of up to approximately 30 ha. 
1.2.3 
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse 
grazing. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses the existing 
Access Road leading to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station from the B4489. 
1.2.4 
A detailed description of the Project and Project components are 
summarised in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. 
1.2.5 
The core working hours during construction are between 08:00 and 18:00hrs 
(Monday to Friday) and 08:00 to 13:00hrs (Saturdays and Bank Holidays). 
For the assessment in the ES, it has been assumed that all construction staff 
will arrive between 07:45 and 08:45hrs, and depart between 16:30 and 
17:30hrs. Temporary parking spaces for staff will be made available within 
the Laydown Area during construction. 
1.2.6 
The construction of the Power Generation Plant is estimated to take 22 
months. The new section of Access Road will be constructed as part of the 
Power Generation Plant and is expected to take around six months. The 
construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection is expected to 
take place alongside and within the period of construction of the Power 
Generation Plant.

1.3 
Purpose and Scope of Construction Staff Travel Plan 
1.3.1 
Travel Plans (TPs) are a way of promoting sustainable travel behaviour 
through a range of mechanisms, initiatives and targets that when combined 
can help to reduce unnecessary travel and encourage journeys to be 
undertaken in a more environmentally sustainable way. For new 
developments, it is important that sustainable travel measures are in place 
prior to occupation of a new development as travel habits in favour of 
walking, cycling and public transport are more readily established from the 
outset. 
1.3.2 
Benefits of implementing a TP can include: 
 
Increased travel choice: TPs can increase personal travel choice by 
promoting existing and providing additional sustainable travel options; 
 
Health benefits: Many alternative forms of travel involve an element of 
physical activity that can help improve the physical health and mental 
wellbeing of users of a development. For employers, this can also 
reduce the number of days lost to staff illness; 
 
Public/environmental responsibility: A decrease in the number of vehicle 
trips results in cleaner air and eases congestion both in the development 
and on the local highway network; 
 
Positive publicity: TPs can generate positive publicity and improve the 
environmental image of an organisation, an area or a development. It 
demonstrates to residents living in the surrounding areas that the 
organisation is committed to limiting single occupancy car trips and 
promoting sustainable travel options; and 
 
Financial savings: Users of a development can make savings by 
switching to or encouraging travel by non-car modes. For staff employed 
on a site, this is primarily related to reduced fuel consumption and 
vehicle depreciation. 
1.3.3 
It is recognised that construction staff will exhibit travel behaviours and have 
certain requirements that differ from staff that would be traditionally targeted 
by a workplace TP. Factors can include: 
 
Requirement to carry and transfer of specialist equipment, tools and 
personal protective equipment; 
 
Start and finish times that are generally outside of periods when public 
transport is available or in periods when services are not as frequent; 
 
Requirement to undertake physically demanding tasks during the 
working day which makes the use of active modes such as 
walking/cycling for commuting purposes less attractive; 
 
Working on sites that are in remote locations where provision for non-car 
modes is limited; and 
 
Variation in the workforce due to the construction schedule, making the 
establishment of standard travel routines more difficult.

1.3.4 
These factors have been taken into consideration in identifying measures in 
this CSTP. 
1.4 
Policy and Guidance 
1.4.1 
This CSTP has been prepared with reference to Technical Advice Note 
(TAN) 18: Transport, published by the Welsh Government (WG). TAN 18 sets 
out technical guidance for the transport related elements of development and 
also confirms the WG’s commitment to sustainable travel via the 
implementation of TPs for new developments. 
1.4.2 
TAN 18 states that the WG “wishes to promote the widespread adoption of 
travel plans by businesses, schools, hospitals, tourist attractions and other 
significant travel-generating uses”. It is also acknowledged that “travel plans 
may be prepared, individually or jointly, by the owners and operators of 
existing or proposed developments”. 
1.5 
Report Structure 
1.5.1 
The TP is structured as follows: 
 
Section 2 – Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility: Sets out the local 
transport conditions in the vicinity of the site and access to non-car 
modes of transport 
 
Section 3 – Trip Generation: Provides details of the trip generation of 
staff associated with each of the Project components; and 
 
Section 4 – Travel Plan Measures: Sets out the key measures and 
initiatives relating to the reduction in single-occupancy car trips to/from 
the site. 
2. 
Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility 
2.1 
Local Highway Network 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is served by a privately maintained Access Road from the 
B4489. The Access Road is unlit. The width of the Access Road varies along 
its length between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered by trees and 
intermittent hedgerows. The Access Road connects to the B4489 via a 
simple priority junction. This is characterised by large radii on the minor arm 
(the Access Road) to accommodate HGV movements.

2.1.2 
The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately 
2.3 km from the Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south 
(approximately 1.8 km from the Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 40 
mph speed limit at its junction with the Access Road. At this location, the 
road has a 5.5 m wide carriageway and is unlit. Approximately 330 m to the 
north of the Access Road, the B4489 becomes subject to the national speed 
limit. The B4489 continues a further 1.7 km north where it connects to Rhyd-
y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This section of the B4489 is unlit and 
ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places.  
2.1.3 
The junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its approaches are subject to a 30 
mph speed limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east for 1.6 km where it passes 
the northern extent of the Project Boundary. This section of Rhyd-y-Pandy 
Road is unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous 
passing places. It is subject to a 30 mph speed limit, increasing to the 
national speed limit around 900 m east of its junction with the B4489. It also 
serves the Felindre Water Treatment Works. 
2.1.4 
Approximately 475 m to the south of the Access Road, the B4489 is street lit. 
A further 75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm 
roundabout with the access to the Felindre Park and Share. 
2.1.5 
On an average weekday, the B4489 carries approximately 130 vehicles 
during the AM peak hour, 90 vehicles during the PM peak hour, and 1,000 
vehicles over the 24-hour period. HGVs account for no more than 2% of total 
traffic. 
2.1.6 
The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The 
northern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489 
and the eastbound on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout 
junction comprises six arms; the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea 
Road, and the westbound on/off-slips of the M4. The south-eastern arm of 
the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction with Pant Lasau Road 
approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell roundabout. These 
junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit. 
2.1.7 
The walking and cycling facilities and Public Rights of Way (PROW) are 
shown on Figure 2.1. 
2.1.8 
There are no footways that serve the Project Site. The nearest footways are 
on the B4489, approximately 475 m south of the Access Road (on the 
approach to the junction with the Felindre Park and Share). This footway 
continues to the M4 Junction 46. The 500 m section of the footway to the 
north of the M4 Junction 46 is separated from the carriageway edge by a 
barrier. At the M4 Junction 46 the footways continues south along the east 
side of the carriageway, serving the southern arms of the southern dumbbell 
roundabout, with dropped kerbs and tactile paving to facilitate crossing 
movements across entry arms.

2.1.9 
There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Project Site. Part of 
the B4489 is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle 
map. This covers the section of the B4489 that routes north from the Access 
Road to Felindre and to a point approximately 475 m south of the Access 
Road. 
2.1.10 There are numerous PRoW crossing/in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of 
Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. 
Footpath LC35B passes through the northern part of the Project Site, 
connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road in the vicinity of the AGI Access. 
2.2 
Public Transport 
2.2.1 
The nearest bus stop to the Project Site is the 'Lliw Reservoirs' stop located 
on Rhyd-y-Pandy Road. This is situated to the east of Felindre and 
approximately 500 m to the northwest of the northern extent of the Project 
Site boundary. There is no footway between the Project Site and this bus 
stop. It provides access to Service 142, which routes between Morriston and 
Garnswllt. This service is operated by DANSA, a community transport 
organisation. There are three to four services per day in each direction, 
although these can generally only be pre-booked. 
2.2.2 
Service 141 passes to the south of the Project Site, routeing between 
Gorseinon and Morriston. The nearest stop that provides access to this 
service is the 'Pant Lasau Cross' stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad 
Road. It is situated approximately 750 m to the southeast of the southern 
extent of the Project Site boundary and can be accessed via Footpath 
LC117. 
2.2.3 
There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Project Site. Llansamlet 
railway station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Project Site, 
accessible by car via the A48 (from M4 Junction 44 and 46). Swansea 
railway station is a further 7 km from the Project Site; this is a key local 
transport hub and is more easily accessible by public transport. Swansea 
railway station is managed by Arriva Trains Wales. There are four services 
daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly service from Swansea to 
Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and a total of two to 
three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great Western 
Railway also provides services from Swansea to London Paddington, calling 
at Bristol Parkway. 
2.2.4 
Overall, the opportunities to access the Project Site by public transport are 
limited, and it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this 
assessment, no trips by construction staff will be undertaken by these 
modes.

Parking 
2.3.1 
Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m 
south of the Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre 
Business Park. It has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for 
employees of the DVLA HQ in Clase. A shuttle bus service runs between the 
Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. The Felindre Park and Share is 
understood to be managed by the DVLA and will not be available for use by 
the Project. 
2.3.2 
A layby is located adjacent to the northbound carriageway of the B4489, 
approximately 800 m from the M4 Junction 46, and 950 m from the Access 
Road. The layby measures approximately 50 m in length.

3. 
Trip Generation 
3.1.1 
The traffic generated by staff associated with the Project during the 
construction period has been quantified using a first principles approach. 
This assumes that all construction staff will arrive at and depart the Project 
Site in private cars or vans at average vehicle occupancy of 1.6. Due to the 
limitations of public transport provision, no staff are expected to arrive or 
depart by public transport. 
3.1.2 
The forecast vehicle trip generation associated with staff is set out for the 
individual Project components and full Project in Table 3.1.

Travel Plan Measures 
4.1 
Aims and Objectives 
4.1.1 
The principal aim of this CSTP is to reduce the impact associated with the 
vehicle trip generation of the Project during the construction phases. In view 
of the development type, location and limited potential for non-car modes, it 
is considered appropriate and realistic for efforts to be focused on increasing 
occupancy levels of vehicles travelling to/from the site. 
4.2 
Travel Plan Implementation and Monitoring 
4.2.1 
The construction of the Project will be carried out by a contractor who will be 
responsible for complying with the selected measures described in the 
CSTP. The contractor will also be responsible for ensuring that all sub-
contractors are both aware of, and comply with, the requirements of the 
CSTP. 
4.2.2 
A member of staff, typically the Site Manager, will be identified to perform the 
role of Travel Plan Coordinator (TPC). The TPC will be responsible for the 
management and delivery of the CSTP for the duration of the construction 
phase, working with senior site management and stakeholders. 
4.2.3 
The TPC will be required to monitor travel on a regular basis (e.g. every six 
months) throughout the construction period. This will involve car occupancy 
surveys at the accesses to the Project Site. 
4.3 
Car Sharing 
4.3.1 
The key measure to increase the occupancy levels of vehicles will be to 
increase car sharing. This will be achieved through the establishment of a 
staff car sharing database, which will contain the home postcodes of staff 
and details of their shift patterns so that staff can be ’matched’. This could be 
a bespoke database or could make use of online resources such as ‘Share 
Cymru’. 
4.3.2 
Where practically possible, the contractor will lay on crew transport such as 
minibuses, between their place of business and the Project Site. 
4.4 
Marketing and Communication 
4.4.1 
This CSTP is exclusively focused on car sharing and all staff will be provided 
with: 
 
Details of and access to the car sharing database. As staff will work shift 
patterns, these timings will be reviewed to see where the optimum 
opportunities for car sharing can be achieved; 
 
Car sharing/site routeing policies; 
Abergelli Power Project

 
Information on local traffic-related congestion concerns for the purposes 
of raising awareness; and 
 
A map showing the location of the Project in relation to the local area, 
highlighting the designated routes to use to access the Project Site to 
reduce congestion/conflict. 
4.4.2 
Sustained and specific marketing of car sharing will be undertaken during 
the construction phase to ensure staff are aware of and understand the 
CSTP. This will include the provision of information to staff during the 
induction process, and regular communication through staff briefings and the 
staff notice board. As part of the induction process, all construction staff will 
be required to register on a car sharing database and encouraged to 
participate in car sharing to site with other staff members.

1. 
Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
 
This document describes the landscape and biodiversity impact mitigation 
1.1.1
measures that will be implemented prior to and during the construction phase of the 
Project, as well as the mitigation, management and monitoring measures to be 
implemented once the Project is operational.  
 
This document should be read in conjunction with ES Chapter 8: Ecology, 
1.1.2
Chapter 11: Landscape and Visual Assessment and the Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Plan (LEMP) (ES Figure 3.6a-e).  This strategy also refers to the 
following plans: Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP), Surface 
Water Management Plan (SWMP) and an Outline Lighting Strategy to demonstrate 
a holistic approach. 
 
The proposed landscape and biodiversity mitigation measures are summarised 
1.1.3
below. These proposals have been designed to be delivered within the Project Site 
Boundary, as well as to retain where possible the existing planting within the 
Project Site Boundary. New habitat creation and landscaping have been 
accommodated, alongside the protection and enhancement of existing habitats 
where feasible.  
 
The key measures proposed are: 
1.1.4
 biodiversity mitigation by the provision of newly created replacement habitats; 
 woodland structure planting within the Project Site Boundary to partially screen 
structures; and 
 management of newly created replacement habitats. 
 
The proposed landscape and ecological mitigation measures are illustrated in ES 
1.1.5
Figures 3.6a-e which graphically demonstrate the primary mitigation measures 
embedded into the project design as well as the new habitat creation. Combined 
with this document they outline the proposed mitigation measures for the Project in 
relation to landscape and ecology using a holistic and integrated approach, and 
have been produced to support the DCO Application.  
 
The landscape and ecological mitigation measures described in this document will 
1.1.6
be subject to a 25 year management period running concurrently with the 
operational design lifetime of the Project. The execution of these works will be the 
responsibility of the operator of the Site. The planting operations in association with 
the Above Ground Installation (AGI) will be undertaken by National Grid. 
1.2 
The Purpose and Structure of this Document 
 
The purpose of this document is to set out the proposed strategy to mitigate 
1.2.1
potentially adverse effects of the Project on the biodiversity features within the 
Project Site Boundary and on the landscape and visual resource.  It provides a 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
3 
 
clear landscape and ecological rationale, which responds to the Project Site and 
the assessments prepared in ES Chapter 8: Ecology and Chapter 11: 
Landscape and Visual.  
 
The Project has been designed, as far as is practicable, to avoid or reduce effects 
1.2.2
on landscape and biodiversity features through design development and impact 
avoidance. Opportunities to secure net gains for landscape and biodiversity as a 
consequence of the Project have also been considered. 
 
The document has been structured as follows:  
1.2.3
 Baseline Conditions; 
 Construction Mitigation;  
 Landscape and Ecological mitigation proposals; and   
 Management and Maintenance.  
 
Outline species specific method statements are provided in Appendices A-G.  
1.2.4
2. 
Baseline Conditions  
 
The Project Site is located within a valley with ground rising to the north, east and 
2.1.1
west which provides visual containment. Ground levels vary across the Project Site 
from approximately 146 m Above Ordinance Datum (AOD) in the north-west corner 
to 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter. Ground levels generally fall in a 
southerly and south easterly direction.  
 
The Project Site is predominantly covered with pasture which is currently used for 
2.1.2
sheep and horse grazing as well as a band of broadleaf woodland to the east. A 
soft surface horse training track, known as 'The Gallops', crosses the Project Site 
and runs diagonally north-west to south-east. Broadleaf woodland which is 
classified in part as Ancient Woodland lies to the east of the Project Site as well as 
around the Access Road to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
Fields across the Project Site support a mix of improved grassland, semi-improved 
grassland (acid/neutral) and wet grassland (marshy grassland) which are 
subdivided by ditches, post and wire fencing, remnant hedgerows (forming rows of 
mature trees) and are interspersed with scrub vegetation. The habitats are heavily 
grazed and as such support a limited range of floristic species.  
 
The western part of the Project Site encompasses part of the Substation, adjacent 
2.1.3
to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. Both the Substation and the Felindre Gas 
Compressor 
Station 
comprise 
large 
scale 
power 
infrastructure 
facilities 
characterised by tall industrial structures enclosed by security fencing and set 
within woodland planting. Pylons are prominent across the landscape and converge 
at the Substation. 
Generating Equipment Site  
 
Pre-construction, the Generating Equipment Site is dominated by an area of 
2.1.4
marshy grassland surrounded by broadleaf woodland and semi-improved neutral 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM

grassland. There are five ditches running through the centre of the Generating 
Equipment Site of which two pairs run parallel to each other and are wooded. Part 
of the broadleaf woodland and marshy grassland is designated as a Site of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) (Lletty-Morfil SINC), the boundary of 
which extends beyond the Project Site Boundary.  
 
The construction of the Generating Equipment Site will require the creation of a 
2.1.5
temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and equipment 
as well as containing site accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car 
parking and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area). A small area within the 
Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the Maintenance Compound). The 
area is dominated by marshy grassland and a small area of improved grassland 
and semi-improved neutral grassland.  
 
Habitats within the Generating Equipment Site are known to support or are suitable 
2.1.6
for supporting the following protected and priority species:  
 Priority species of butterfly and moth;  
 Common toad (priority species);  
 Common lizard and grass snake (protected species); 
 Breeding birds (protected species);  
 Bats (protected species); 
 Water vole (protected species);  
 Otter (protected species); 
 Brown hare (priority species); and,  
 Badger (protected species).  
 
The Generating Equipment Site also supports invasive non-native species (INNS) 
2.1.7
of plants – Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and floating pennywort.  
Access Road 
 
The Access Road runs from the B4489, which lies to the west, to the Generating 
2.1.8
Equipment Site. The Access Road will be formed by upgrading an existing access 
road between the B4489 junction and the Substation and constructing a new 
section of Access Road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site.  
 
Pre-construction, the Access Road comprises hard standing, improved grassland, 
2.1.9
semi-improved neutral grassland, row of trees and marshy grassland. The new 
section of Access Road crosses two watercourses, and has been rerouted to avoid 
an area of Ancient Woodland.   
 Habitats within the Access Road are known to support or are suitable for supporting 
2.1.10
the following protected and priority species:  
 Common toad (priority species);  
 Common lizard and grass snake (protected species); 
 Breeding birds (protected species);  
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
5 
 
 Bats (protected species); 
 Otter (protected species); 
 Brown hare (priority species); and,  
 Badger (protected species).  
 The Access Road also supports INNS plants, namely Japanese knotweed.  
2.1.11
Electrical Connection 
 The Electrical Connection is an underground electrical cable to export power from 
2.1.12
the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS). For the first 160 m (approx.) the route runs from the NETS through an area 
of semi-improved neutral grassland, a ditch and row of trees, after which it runs 
alongside the Access Road.  
Gas Connection  
 The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new AGI and underground Gas 
2.1.13
Pipeline. This is to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Gas Transmission System. The Gas Pipeline will follow an approximate north-south 
route corridor, between the National Gas Transmission System south of Rhyd-y-
pandy Road and the Generating Equipment Site.  
 The Gas Connection is dominated by improved grassland, with boundary features 
2.1.14
including one hedgerow, two rows of trees and post and wire fences.  
 Habitats within the Gas Connection are known to support or are suitable for 
2.1.15
supporting the following protected and priority species:  
 Priority species of butterfly and moth;  
 Common toad (priority species);  
 Common lizard and grass snake (protected species); 
 Breeding birds (protected species);  
 Bats (protected species); 
 Otter (protected species); 
 Brown hare (priority species); and,  
 Badger (protected species).  
 The Gas Connection also supports INNS plants.  
2.1.16
3. 
Construction Mitigation 
3.1 
Landscape Working Methods 
 
Mitigation measures will be implemented during the construction in order to limit 
3.1.1
impacts on the landscape and visual resource. These are summarised below: 
 
Land and vegetation clearance and occupation will be limited to the minimum 
area necessary for the works; 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6 
 
 
Good housekeeping measures will minimise unsightly waste and secure 
storage will be provided for materials at risk from displacement by wind; 
 
Temporary stockpiles will be located in defined storage areas, away from 
sensitive visual receptors; 
 
No advertisements or fly posting will be permitted on any fence and all graffiti 
will be removed and made good as soon as reasonably practicable; 
 
All boundary fences will be maintained in a neat and tidy condition; 
 
Any temporary fencing will be removed as soon as reasonably practicable after 
completion of the works; and 
 
Temporary lighting will be selected and sited so as to minimise visual intrusion 
to residents, whilst maintaining the safe and efficient operation of the work site.  
At night and during periods of darkness, directional security lighting will be used 
where required.  
 
The following good practice measures will be adopted and implemented for the 
3.1.2
protection of trees retained onsite: 
 
A Root Protection Area (RPA) will be set up around trees to be retained onsite 
prior to commencement of construction; 
 
The RPA will be demarcated by 'Netlon' fluorescent mesh fencing or similar 
physical barrier. The protective fencing will be maintained for the duration of the 
construction phase and checked on a regular basis;  
 
In the event that an RPA cannot be maintained at 12 times the diameter at 
breast height (DBH) mitigation such as bog matting, flotation tyres and hand 
digging will be utilised;  
 
No machinery or material will be stored within the RPA; 
 
To ensure retained trees do not become hazardous, the condition of trees will 
be checked by the Environmental Manager or Ecological Clerk of Works 
(ECoW) at an appropriate frequency and following storm events where there 
may be damage from wind throw;  
 
Where a tree is damaged or diseased advice will be sought from an 
Arboriculturalist (unless the ECoW is appropriately qualified) for appropriate 
treatment measures;  
 
Where hazardous branches or trees require to be felled this will be done by a 
qualified tree surgeon in line with BS 3998: 2010;  
 
Before felling trees, surveys for potential bird nest or bat roosts will be 
undertaken by the ECoW; and 
4. 
Landscape and Ecological Mitigation Proposals  
4.1 
Overview 
 
The primary focus of the landscape and ecology mitigation is habitat creation and 
4.1.1
landscape planting which will be accommodated within the Project Site Boundary 
alongside the protection and enhancement of existing habitats. It is anticipated that 
existing planting within the Project Site would be retained and protected where 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
7 
 
possible. ES Figure 3.6 identifies the woodland and trees to be retained and the 
areas of new habitat and planting.  
 
The overall construction working methods to be implemented during the 
4.1.2
construction phase are outlined in the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1), outline SWMP 
(Appendix 3.2) and Outline Lighting Strategy (Appendix 3.5) and are secured via 
corresponding Requirements in schedule 2 of the DCO (Document Reference 3.1). 
Therefore these are not repeated here but are referred to where necessary for 
completeness.  
4.2 
Habitats and Protection  
 
Existing habitats will be retained where possible. Where this is not possible those 
4.2.1
habitats removed with conservation value will be compensated for through the 
provision of newly created habitats or enhancement of existing habitats. Mitigation 
to help avoid injury or killing of protected and priority species will be implemented.  
 
Newly created habitats will be designed to be of value to those protected and 
4.2.2
priority species known to be present within the Project Site Boundary.  
 
Lighting has been designed to limit the effects on wildlife (refer to outline Lighting 
4.2.3
Strategy (Appendix 3.5).  
4.3 
Habitat Replacement 
 
The total area of habitat with conservation value (i.e. not improved grassland or 
4.3.1
hard standing) permanently removed during construction is estimated to be 2.9 ha. 
An area of land approximately 3 ha in size within the Project Site boundary has 
been identified as suitable for habitat enhancement and will mitigate for the loss of 
habitats including a proportion of Lletty-Morfil SINC. The habitat enhancement 
measures will also provide valuable habitats for a range of species including 
invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, breeding and foraging birds, brown hare and 
badger, commuting and foraging bats and, once trees mature, roosting bats. This 
area is known as the Ecological Mitigation Area  and will be implemented by the 
end of construction (ES Figure 3.6c).  
 
During construction there will be no night time illumination of hedgerows, woodland 
4.3.2
or mature tree lines. Operational external lighting has been designed to reduce 
trespass and configured to avoid glare and spillage, and otherwise in accordance 
with the Outline Lighting Strategy undertaken in accordance with the Institution of 
Lighting Professionals guidelines. The strategy will seek to limit effects of lighting 
on habitats (and therefore species) adjacent to the Project Site.  During the hours 
of darkness, only critical light sources will remain in operation,  
 
The sensitivity of the infrared motion detectors will be set so as not to be activated 
4.3.3
by the movement of large mammals such as badgers and otters. The lighting 
strategy will ensure that all lighting columns will be fitted with cowls to reduce light 
spill and will be directed away from boundary features. A ‘dark corridor’ (as shown 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
8 
 
in ES Figure 3.6) has been designed to keep lighting to no more than 1 lux along 
adjacent woodland edges and watercourses that are likely to be used by nocturnal 
species such as bats, badgers, water vole and otters. The Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection will not be lit.  
4.4 
Tree Management and Root Protection 
 
The following good practice measures will be adopted and implemented as part of 
4.4.1
this Strategy for the protection of trees retained onsite, including Ancient Woodland: 
 A Root Protection Area (RPA) will be set up around trees to be retained onsite 
prior to commencement of construction; 
 The RPA will be demarcated by 'Netlon' fluorescent mesh fencing or similar 
physical barrier. The protective fencing will be maintained for the duration of the 
construction phase and checked on a regular basis;  
 In the event that an RPA cannot be maintained at 12 times the diameter at 
breast height (DBH) mitigation such as bog matting, flotation tyres and hand 
digging will be utilised;  
 No machinery or material will be stored within the RPA; 
 To ensure retained trees do not become hazardous, the condition of trees will 
be checked by the Environmental Manager or Ecological Clerk of Works 
(ECoW) at an appropriate frequency and following storm events where there 
may be damage from wind throw;  
 Where a tree is damaged or diseased advice will be sought from an 
Arboriculturalist (unless the ECoW is appropriately qualified) for appropriate 
treatment measures;  
 Where hazardous branches or trees require to be felled this will be done by a 
qualified tree surgeon in line with BS 3998: 2010;  
 Before felling trees, surveys for potential bird nest or bat roosts will be 
undertaken by the ECoW; and 
 The waste hierarchy will be applied to vegetation and biomass arisings and 
alternate onsite uses will be sought before disposal is considered. 
4.5 
Species-Specific Measures 
 
Measures have been specified to help avoid injury or killing of protected and priority 
4.5.1
species, and control the spread of INNS plants and have been incorporated into the 
management strategy. These are outlined in Appendices A-G.  
 Reptile (Appendix A); 
 Breeding Birds (Appendix B); 
 Bats (Appendix C); 
 Otter and Water Vole (Appendix D); 
 Badger (Appendix E); 
 Invasive Non-Native Species (Appendix F); and 
 Hedgerows (Appendix G).

4.6 
Planting Proposals 
i. 
Overview  
 
A palette of native tree and shrub planting has been compiled to meet the various 
4.6.1
planting proposals identified below. The function of the planting is primarily to help 
integrate the various components of the Project into the local landscape and views 
whilst providing biodiversity value by enhancing existing habitats and creating new 
habitats. 
ii. Woodland Planting 
 
Woodland structure planting is proposed adjacent to the Generating Equipment 
4.6.2
Site to assist in screening lower level structures from view and to assist in 
integrating the Project Site within the immediate landscape (refer to ES Figure 
3.6c). Woodland planting is also proposed along the western edge of the Ecological 
Mitigation Area (refer to ES Figure 3.6c).  
 
The western edge of the Ecological Mitigation Area will be planted with a row of 
4.6.3
trees native to the local area. The trees will be allowed to mature and will create a 
linkage between a row of trees in the north and the watercourse in the south (Afon 
Llan). A mixture of standards and feathered will be used. This area compensates 
for the loss of the woodland habitat within Lletty-Morfil SINC.  
 
Indicative typical species will include the following: 
4.6.4
 Betula pendula (silver birch); 
 Betula pubescens (downy birch); 
 Quercus robur (pedunculate oak); 
 Salix alba (white willow); 
 Alnus glutinosa (Alder)  
 Ilex aquifolium (holly); and 
 Corylus avellana (hazel). 
iii. Woodland Edge Scrub Planting 
 
The Woodland Planting above will grade into an area of scrub habitat within the 
4.6.5
Ecological Mitigation Area refer to ES Figure 3.6c). Species will comprise those 
native to the local area and include species capable of thriving in a wetter 
environment. The scrub will be allowed to mature and be managed to have a 
scalloped edge. This area compensates for the loss of the scrub habitat.  
 
Indicative typical species will include the following: 
4.6.6
 Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn); 
 Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) and, 
 Sorbus aucuparia (rowan); and, 
 Eupatorium cannabinum (hemp agrimony; and  
 Filipendula ulmaria (meadowsweet). 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
10 
 
 
It is anticipated that willow species and bramble will develop naturally and will not 
4.6.7
require planting. 
iv. Hedgerow and Hedgerow Trees 
 
Hedgerow and hedgerow tree planting is proposed along the Access Road (refer to 
4.6.8
ES Figure 3.6e) and to the west of the AGI as well as to reinstate any hedgerow 
planting removed during construction of the Gas Connection (refer to ES Figure 
3.6d). 
 
Mixed hedgerow and tree planting will provide vegetation structure and commuting 
4.6.9
corridors for bats as well as integrating the new Access Road into the immediate 
landscape structure. Reinstatement hedgerow planting is also proposed along the 
Gas Connection corridor where hedgerows are removed and also to the west of the 
AGI along an existing field boundary to provide partial screening of the AGI and 
local landscape enhancement, providing continuity of hedgerow boundary planting. 
 Indicative typical species will include the following: 
4.6.10
 Acer campestre (field maple) Corylus avellana (hazel); 
 Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn); 
 Rosa canina (dog rose); 
 Viburnum opulus (guelder rose); 
 Prunus spinosa (blackthorn);  
 Sorbus aucuparia (rowan);  
 Ilex aquifolium (holly); and, 
 Lonicera periclymenum (honeysuckle)  
 
v. Wet Meadow and Acid Grassland 
 Wet meadow and acid grassland is proposed to the south of the Generating 
4.6.11
Equipment Site within the Ecological Mitigation Area (refer to ES Figure 3.6c). 
 The Woodland Edge Planting will grade into a mosaic of marshy grassland and 
4.6.12
acid grassland within the . Ecological Mitigation Area. The area currently supports 
degraded versions of these habitat types, and a relaxation of the grazing regime 
(grazed less intensively) and therefore reduction in nutrient inputs will allow a 
greater botanical species diversity to develop without the need for seeding or plant 
plugs. The enhancements in this area compensate for the loss of the marshy 
grassland habitat within Lletty-Morfil SINC within the Generating Equipment Site. 
vi. Wetland Habitat and New Drainage Routes 
 Two new ponds will be created within the Wet Meadow and Acid Grassland of the  
4.6.13
Ecological Mitigation Area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site. The 
ponds will be at least 2 m x 2 m and have shallow sides to allow animals to 
enter/exit the pond freely and should taper to a depth of at least 0.5 m in the centre. 
The pond will be planted with native plant species and will not be stocked with fish. 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
11 
 
This will give native amphibians and invertebrates the best chance of colonising the 
pond. The creation of two ponds for wildlife compensates for the loss of the ponds 
within the Project Site. 
 Within the Generating Equipment Site (ES Figure 3.6c), adjacent to the Access 
4.6.14
Road (ES Figure 3.6c) and AGI (ES Figure 3.6d) the attenuation ponds will be 
planted with emergent native wetland species and where possible maintained as 
wetland features.  
 New ditches and rerouted ditches (Generating Equipment Site – ES Figure 3.6b) 
4.6.15
will be planted with emergent native wetland species and where possible 
maintained as wetland features.  
 Typical species will be determined at detailed design stage, as the species 
4.6.16
proposed will likely differ between waterbodies, depending on the aspect of the 
waterbody, substrate, the profile of the water body and potential water depth.  
4.7 
Management and Maintenance  
vii. Management Aims  
 
This section sets out the management and maintenance objectives for the 
4.7.1
protection and enhancement of the landscape and biodiversity fabric of the Project 
Site. A detailed landscape management and maintenance plan will be developed 
alongside the detailed landscape and ecological design. The maintenance and 
management plan will cover a 25 year period covering the operational design 
lifetime of the Project.  Within the first five years after planting, all plants found to be 
dead or dying will be replaced within the first available planting season. 
 
In general terms the landscape and ecological management aims for the Project 
4.7.2
Site are to: 
 Secure the long-term future of the landscape; 
 Enhance local landscape character; 
 Integrate the Site into the surrounding landscape and local views; 
 Retain and manage existing woodland/hedgerow and scrub planting and 
provide additional supplementary planting to provide links for wildlife across the 
site; 
 Create, maintain and enhance habitats of value to wildlife to provide benefits 
for the local environment and biodiversity; 
 Create marshy habitats in conjunction with the attenuation areas for 
amphibians and aquatic invertebrates; and, 
 Establish a flexible management and maintenance regime able to respond to 
changing needs or objectives. 
 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
12 
 
i. 
New Tree and Shrub Planting 
 
Tree and shrub planting shall be subject to routine maintenance operations that 
4.7.3
include pruning, litter picking, prevention of weeds and invasive species. The 
maintenance regime will seek to:  
 To create and maintain a vegetation structure, horticultural interest and to 
partially screen the built structures and movement within the Project Site; and 
 To extend and enhance habitat diversity in a variety of different areas, including 
corridors for commuter bats. 
ii. Management Aims – Grassland 
 
Both wet meadow grassland and acid grassland areas will be subject to a similar 
4.7.4
maintenance regime. Both areas shall ensure a healthy sward of native wildflowers 
and grasses which will increase biodiversity as well as create visual interest. The 
maintenance regime will seek to: 
 Maintain the quality and integrity of the ditches, such that they are free of litter, 
tree roots and invasive species; 
 To establish and maintain species-rich swards of wet meadow and species rich 
swards, including wildflowers that support invertebrate larvae and flowers that 
attract pollinating bees, butterflies, moths and other invertebrates; and 
 Sward management to ensure the sward is longest in the summer and shorter 
in the spring and autumn will allow flowering species to set seed and 
germinate. 
4.8 
Roles and Responsibilities 
 
Roles and responsibilities for implementation of the landscape and ecological 
4.8.1
mitigation measures during the construction phase are identified in the outline 
CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
 
Management of habitat enhancement measures during the operational phase will 
4.8.2
be secured via landowner agreements. .  [APL is currently investigating securing 
the involvement of the current landowners in the management of ecological areas 
including via grazing and management agreements].  
4.9 
Reinstatement 
 
Reinstatement of temporary construction areas and working widths will be 
4.9.1
undertaken as soon as reasonably practical once construction has ceased. Prompt 
implementation of reinstatement and restoration measures aim to reduce the 
effects of: 
 
Compaction of subsoil, which can lead to inhibited drainage and root growth; 
 
Exposed ground, which can cause loss of topsoil, dust and water pollution 
through wind blow and erosion; and  
 
Visual intrusion.  
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
13 
 
 
Planned reinstatement at the Project Site includes the following considerations and 
4.9.2
measures:  
 
Land reinstatement should normally take place in the autumn following the 
construction phase. The length of the Gas Pipeline route will be reinstated to its 
original condition and returned to its previous use;  
 
Where compaction may have occurred a ‘sub-soiler’, which lifts and shatters 
the subsoil will be used before the topsoil is reinstated; 
 
Topsoil that has been stored in the Laydown Area will be spread and levelled 
across the width of the strip, using hydraulic excavators or bulldozers. In areas 
where stones have been brought to the surface, stone picking will be carried 
out mechanically; 
 
The finish in which the soil is left will be agreed with the relevant land occupier. 
Land to be reinstated as grassland will either be reseeded in the autumn or the 
following spring. Reptile fences will remain in place until the grass crop is 
established; 
 
Temporary construction fences will be removed once agreement has been 
reached with the landowners that the land over which temporary possession 
powers have been exercised has been reinstated and can be handed back to 
the landowner, and no later than three months from completion of construction 
and 
 
Hedgerows will be reinstated in the first planting season following the 
completion of construction and land reinstatement work. 
 
The following general reinstatement good practice measures that will be adopted: 
4.9.3
 
Reinstatement will be carried out as soon as possible following any vegetation 
stripping to ensure integrity is maintained;  
 
The reinstatement of the construction areas will be undertaken to the standard 
to be agreed with CCS, using the existing soil and vegetation wherever 
possible; 
 
Stripped soil will be reinstated as close to where it was removed as possible;  
 
Subsoil, topsoil and turf will be replaced in the same order as removed;  
 
Restoration works will be carried out in suitable weather conditions noting that 
wet ground conditions can be difficult, as can hot, dry and windy spells; and  
 
Natural regeneration of habitats will be promoted in all appropriate areas as 
advised by the Environmental Manager or ECoW.

These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:  
 Generating Equipment Site; 
 Access Road;  
 Electrical Connection; and 
 Gas Connection.  
2. 
The risk of reptiles and the mitigation measures discussed below will be included in 
the site induction package and prior to any site clearance and construction tasks.  
3. 
The trapping and translocation programme has been designed following the 
guidance set out in Herpetofauna Groups of Britain and Ireland 1998 publication 
(HGBI, 1998).  
4. 
Due to the ‘Good’ population of common lizard and the presence of low numbers of 
grass snakes within the survey area a trapping and translocation programme will be 
undertaken to help protect any reptiles from being injured or killed.  Due to the 
presence of suitable habitat for adder, the programme includes measures for this 
species.  The actions involved in the proposed trapping and translocation are 
detailed below.  
Fencing 
5. 
Any construction areas suitable or known to support reptiles, including any routes in 
and out, areas for site compounds, offices or storage of materials/waste, will be 
fenced off using suitable fencing to limit reptiles attempting to enter the site from 
the adjacent land.  
6. 
Fencing should remain in situ for the duration of construction to help limit the re-
colonisation of the Project Site by reptiles. Depending on the construction duration 
it may be suitable to use recycled HDPE plastic semi-permanent, rigid reptile 
fencing with a 50 mm return folded and welded into the top edge forming an 
overlap to comply with EN guidelines and 100 mm underground return. It provides 
a reptile barrier that is highly resistant to vandalism and general site damage. Drift 
fencing can be used for construction duration lasting 18 months or less.  
7. 
Fencing will be installed by a suitable contractor under the supervision of an 
ecologist. Contractors will be given a toolbox talk prior to works commencing, and 
advised on the identification of reptiles, what reptiles were expected on site, the 
legal protection afforded by reptiles, and how to safely move reptiles to avoid injury 
or killing.  
8. 
Any areas subject to machines tracking over or repeated foot traffic, as well as the 
route of the fence line, will be hand searched by an ecologist for the presence of 
reptiles. Reptiles encountered will be captured by hand and moved out of the way 
into suitable habitat (see ‘Translocation Area’ below). The routes will then be mown

to a height of less than 150 mm and maintained as such for the duration of the 
fencing installation.  
9. 
No vehicles, machinery or materials will be stored in areas suitable for supporting 
reptiles without first being checked by an ecologist; preference will be given to 
those areas not suitable for supporting reptiles.  
10. 
No construction activities, including pedestrian access will be allowed outside of the 
fenced areas in habitat suitable for supporting reptiles.  
Trapping and Translocation 
11. 
Artificial refugia comprising approximately 1 m x 0.5 m square sheets of heavy-duty 
mineral roofing felt, corrugated iron and carpet tiles will be placed at a density of 
50/ha in suitable habitat within the fenced area to attract reptiles.  
12. 
The refugia will be left to ‘bed-in’ and will remain undisturbed for a period of at least 
fourteen days. After the ‘bedding-in’ period, each day, up to twice a day for a 
minimum of 60 days, an ecologist will check the refugia for the presence of reptiles. 
Any reptiles or amphibians found will be captured for relocation into suitable habitat 
outside of the fenced areas. After 60 days, the trapping can cease once there have 
been five consecutive days where no reptiles have been found.  
13. 
After the fenced area has been cleared of reptiles and prior to soil stripping the 
vegetation can undergo a process of habitat management and hand searches for 
reptiles. Supervision of the soil strip during construction work by a suitably qualified 
ecologist will be required to help protect injury or killing of reptiles.  
14. 
Any litter or rubble piles will be removed by hand under the supervision of an 
ecologist to avoid injuring or killing any reptiles. If the material is too heavy to be 
removed by hand it will be done so using a mini excavator carefully and slowly 
removing the material, under the supervision of an ecologist.  
15. 
Any amphibians captured during the reptile trapping programme will be moved to a 
suitable location within the Project Site Boundary.  
Translocation Area  
16. 
During the reptile survey, very few numbers of reptiles were found within the 
footprint of the Project; the majority of reptiles were found along the Gallops. Due to 
the relatively low numbers of reptiles likely to be present within the fenced area it is 
considered appropriate to move any captured reptiles to the areas of habitat 
suitable for supporting reptiles that are to be retained outside of the fenced area.   
Habitat Manipulation and Destructive Search 
17. 
Once capture rates decrease significantly habitat manipulation will be used to 
enhance the process. This involves reducing the amount of suitable vegetation 
cover by strimming the vegetation between the refugia mats (leaving a 10cm buffer 
around the edge of each refugia mat) to a height of no less than 100mm, after 48 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
18 
 
hours the cut will be repeated to ground level, concentrating the remaining reptiles 
to the retained vegetation and refugia. Naturally occurring refugia (stones, rocks, 
litter etc) will be hand searched by and ecologist before being removed and located 
within the receptor area. After which the final remaining areas of vegetation and 
refugia will be cut to ground level and removed following a final check for reptiles by 
an ecologist; any reptiles found will be removed and located within the receptor 
area.  
18. 
Contractors will be given a toolbox talk prior to habitat manipulation works 
commencing, and will be advised on the identification of reptiles, what reptiles are 
expected on site, the legal protection afforded by reptiles, and how to safely move 
reptiles to avoid injury or killing. Any that reptiles identified during the strimming 
works will be moved by hand into suitable habitat outside of the fenced area. An 
ecologist will provide ecological support and advice during the works.  
Timing 
19. 
A method statement detailing the location and specification of fencing, timing and 
methodology for the management of reptiles will be submitted to CCS (in 
conjunction with NRW) for approval.

Appendix B Breeding Birds  
1. 
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:  
 Generating Equipment Site; 
 Access Road; 
 Electrical Connection; and 
 Gas Connection.  
2. 
To avoid destruction of active bird nests or eggs, vegetation clearance works 
should be undertaken between September – February inclusive. Should works be 
required from 1 March – end August then an ecologist should inspect the area to be 
cleared no more than 48 hours prior to works. Should any active nests be found, 
works will have to halt in this area until the chicks have fledged and no longer 
return to the nest, which can take up to eight weeks. Should a nest be found a 
species-specific buffer should be implemented.

Appendix C Bats 
1. 
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:  
 Generating Equipment Site; 
 Access Road; 
 Electrical Connection; and 
 Gas Connection.  
Roosting Bats 
2. 
Pre-construction checks will be undertaken on trees and any hedgerows prior to 
their removal for their current suitability for supporting roosting bats.  
3. 
Checks will be undertaken to allow time for any follow up (emergence and re-entry) 
surveys to be undertaken and an application for a European Protected Species 
License (EPSL) should any works require a confirmed roost to be destroyed.   
4. 
The survey results will be used to inform any further mitigation to seek to avoid 
impacts on roosting bats.  
Commuting and Foraging Bats 
5. 
New planting will include wooded linear features to create new commuting and 
foraging routes linking existing rows of trees to the Afon Llan.  
6. 
To allow bats to continue to use commuting and foraging routes during 
construction, the connectivity of tree lines and hedgerows along the Gas 
Connection, Access Road and Electrical Connection routes will be maintained 
utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash. At least one hour before sunset key linear 
features as identified in ES Figure 3.6e  will be reinstated utilising brash.  
Access Road 
7. 
To maintain connectivity post-construction, replacement planting of trees removed 
to facilitate the construction of the Access Road (including the new section of 
Access Road) should be undertaken. Using standards of the same species as 
those trees removed, trees will be planted along the existing boundary tree lines up 
to the edge of the Access Road. Over time the canopies will grow closer together 
thereby creating a linear feature than can be used by bats to cross the new section 
of Access Road.

Appendix D Otter and Water Vole  
1. 
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:  
 Generating Equipment Site; 
 Access Road; and 
 Electrical Connection.  
Water Vole 
2. 
A pre-construction check for water vole burrows and activity will be undertaken 
where construction is present within 100 m of watercourses identified as suitable 
for supporting the species during the 2017 field surveys, as identified in ES 
Appendix 8.10 Figure 1.  
3. 
Should the pre-construction check return a negative result, habitat management will 
be undertaken to help reduce the quality of the habitats for burrow creation in the 
period leading up to, and for the duration of construction in that area.  
4. 
Should water vole be confirmed as present on watercourses within 100 m of 
construction works during the pre-construction check, a Water Vole Conservation 
License from Natural Resources Wales (NRW) may be required to allow works to 
proceed and additional mitigation may be required.  
Otter 
 
A pre-construction check for otter holts/couches and activity will be undertaken 
5.1.1
where construction is present within 100 m of watercourses identified as suitable 
for supporting the species during the 2017 field surveys, as identified in ES

Appendix F Invasive Non Native Species 
1. 
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:  
 Generating Equipment Site; 
 Access Road; 
 Electrical Connection; and 
 Gas Connection.  
2. 
An updated INNS survey (Invasive Species Assessment – ISA) will be undertaken 
to accurately assess INNS and extents within the Project Site boundary prior to the 
implementation of control measures and a site specific Invasive Non Native 
Species Protocol will be produced that elaborates on the outline recommendations 
provided below.  
3. 
Many remediation options are available for the management of invasive species. All 
control options will be considered to identify appropriate management actions 
relevant in the context of controlling Schedule 9 species on land impacted by the 
proposed works.  
4. 
The optimal control measures for the proposed works will involve a combination of 
biosecurity precautions (i.e. good site hygiene) and mechanical and/or chemical 
treatment.  
Biosecurity Precautions 
5. 
At a minimum, the following biosecurity measures will be implemented when 
working within the Project Site: 
 All appropriate staff members will be made aware of the locations of INNS and 
will be informed of the necessary precautions required to prevent spread. This 
will include informing personnel who might come into contact with any of the 
species of the requirements to prevent spread (e.g. during vegetation 
clearance, and vegetation management).  
 A toolbox talk will be provided by a suitably qualified Ecological Clerk of Works 
(ECoW) at the onset of works, providing details on identification and the 
required biosecurity precautions. An ECoW will be present during all works to 
help implement biosecurity measures.  
 Clearance works should avoid the period when Himalayan balsam has ripe 
seeds. When seeds ripen is dependent on the weather that year, but typically 
the period is from July until the end of October.  
 Vegetation clearance works will be undertaken methodically; commencing in 
areas with no presence of INNS, then working through areas with increasing 
levels of infestation. This will help prevent works spreading seeds and 
contaminated soils to areas onsite that are not currently infested.  
 Clearance works will avoid the area with INNS if the infestation is outside the 
treatment area or until treatment on the species has been completed. Before 
any treatment commences, if there is risk of vehicular or pedestrian incursion 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited

24 
 
into the area where INNS are growing then the plant stems will be fenced with 
temporary orange mesh fencing. Default stand-off distances are provided 
below. It may be possible to reduce these distances following the ISA, based 
on the data collected. 
 Vehicular and people movements will be restricted to specific routes within the 
Project Site thereby helping to limit the spread of seeds and contaminated soils 
around Site.  
 Cleaning stations will be set up at designated entry/exit points to demarcated 
areas. A jet wash should be available for vehicles and brushes and buckets of 
water should be available for clothing and equipment. 
 No plant, equipment or personnel should leave a demarcated area without 
ensuring that all mud and/or plant material has been removed from vehicles, 
equipment and clothing/footwear. 
 Any soil within demarcated areas will be considered to potentially contain INNS 
material (seeds etc.). When soils potentially containing viable INNS material 
seeds are taken off Site, such soils are classified as controlled waste and there 
is a duty of care for their proper disposal, i.e. the soil must be transported by an 
appropriately licensed carrier and disposed of at an appropriately licensed 
waste disposal facility. 
 Personnel will be reminded of biosecurity requirements at the start of each 
work day and should be updated on any changes to management plans, i.e. 
information on the locations of any newly identified stands. 
 Following the ISA, where additional biosecurity hazards are identified, they will 
be incorporated into the Invasive and Non Native Species Protocol. 
Control 
6. 
Potential control measures have been provided for each species identified within 
the Project Site Boundary below. Following the ISA a single actionable option will 
be specified for each stand, based on the recommendations below, in combination 
with a review of site development plans and activities. 
Himalayan Balsam 
7. 
Away from watercourses, depending on development plans, stands within working 
areas or stands within 6 m of a working area will be controlled by a combination of: 
 Herbicide treatment (potentially followed by hand removal once the quantity of 
plants has been reduced): 
 excavation and (i) burial or (ii) offsite disposal; and  
 raising the soil profile above existing stands, thus preventing future growth  
8. 
Any herbicide treatments will use appropriate herbicide, which will be applied by an 
appropriately qualified contractor.  
9. 
Seeds from Himalayan balsam typically remain viable for 18 months in soil. Follow-
up monitoring of the treated stands will confirm treatment has been successful 
when no new seeds have germinated; after which the soil is considered inert 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
25 
 
(assuming no other contaminates are present). Typical treatment periods are for 2 
years of control action followed by at least a 1 year monitoring period. Herbicide 
should be applied three times in the year.  
10. 
Where excavation is required, the recommended excavation area is 6 m radius to a 
30 cm depth, although through the commissioning of soil core analysis it may be 
possible to reduce the depth at which soil needs to be removed. The excavated 
material will need to be disposed of as controlled waste or buried within the Project 
Site.  
11. 
Where the soil profile is raised, 30 cm soil is sufficient to prevent regrowth.  
12. 
Where Himalayan balsam is growing next to a watercourse control will not be 
effective in the long term, since new seeds will travel from further up the catchment 
(where Himalayan balsam is abundant) and re-colonise the area. In such areas, 
management will focus on containment (i.e. implementation of biosecurity 
protocols). 
Japanese Knotweed 
13. 
In areas where there is a risk of spreading Japanese knotweed (stands within 7 m 
of access routes and storage compounds – following the ISA and through risk 
assessment is may be possible to reduce this distance to 4 m), the stands will be 
managed appropriately. A single actionable option for each stand will be determined 
for each stand with takes account of development plans. Options include: 
 Herbicide treatment; 
 Rhizome fragmentation and cultivation (e.g. soil rotation) to stimulate growth 
and reduce herbicide treatment time requirements; 
 excavation and (i) stockpiling, (ii) burial or (ii) offsite disposal; and  
 raising the soil profile above existing stands, thus preventing future growth. 
14. 
Any soil containing Japanese knotweed material will be removed from the Project 
Site following the appropriate duty of care, or buried within the Project Site.  
15. 
To reduce the risk of spread and future growth, a herbicide treatment programme 
will commence as far in advance of construction works as is practical. Typical 
treatment periods are for 3 years followed by a 2 year monitoring period. However, 
mature stands can take significantly longer to successfully treat. The presence of 
mature stands will be identified as part of the ISA. Herbicide should be applied 
once in the year.  
16. 
Where herbicide treatment is used in isolation there is a risk that dormant but viable 
rhizomatous material remains underground after treatment appears successful 
above ground, and as such the soil in such areas should not be disturbed and if it is 
subsequently removed, it remains classified as controlled waste moving forward.  
17. 
Where the soil profile is to be raised above Japanese knotweed, the plants should 
first be treated with herbicide in advance for as long as possible. Depending of 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
26 
 
maturity and time scales, it may be beneficial to lay a geomembrane in the area 
prior to raising the soil level. 
Floating Pennywort 
18. 
There is one pond recorded as supporting floating pennywort in 2014. The pond is 
under the footprint of the proposed Power Generation Plant and is not 
hydrologically connected to any other waterbodies or watercourses. As such, the 
pond can be infilled with inert soil and then built on. No material or water will be 
removed from the pond.  
Rhododendron and Montbretia 
19. 
The ISA will be used to confirm locations and extents.  
20. 
Montbretia is located on the edge of the Access Road, and should be treated by 
herbicide at the same time as the other species. The corms react well to herbicide 
treatment, and since the plant does not produce viable seed, this course of action 
will be effective at controlling the plant.  
21. 
Rhododendron is present within the woodland which is not being disturbed during 
the construction of the Project. As such, there is no risk of causing the spread of 
rhododendron as the seeds produced by rhododendron will not establish in the 
disturbed soils of a development site (such seeds require very specific conditions to 
germinate AND establish).

Appendix G Hedgerows 
1. 
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:  
 Access Road; 
 Electrical Connection; and 
 Gas Connection.  
2. 
To allow bats to continue to use commuting and foraging routes during 
construction, the connectivity of tree lines and hedgerows along the Gas 
Connection, Access Road and Electrical Connection routes will be maintained 
utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash. At least one hour before sunset key linear 
features as identified in ES Figure 3.6 will be reinstated utilising brash.  
3. 
On completion of construction works the hedgerow gaps will be reinstated by 
planting species typical of the hedgerow as whips of four per metre in a double 
staggered row. Shrubs will be bare rooted and comprise 1.5 m size class. Spiral 
guards will be used to help prevent damage from rabbits. Some brash can be left in 
situ to help maintain the linear feature whilst the whips are establishing.  
4. 
In the two winters following planting, any dead shrubs should be replaced with the 
same species mix as the original planted. 
5. 
The grass around the base of the trees/shrubs (0.5 m diameter) should be killed at 
least once annually using an approved non residual herbicide for three years 
following planting.  
6. 
Additional hedgerow planting is covered in Planting Proposals Section 4.6.

INTRODUCTION 
2.1 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF REPORT 
2.1.1. 
This Outline Lighting Strategy provides guidance and professional recommendations for the design and 
operation of the permanent external lighting design of Abergelli Power Station. This does not address the 
lighting requirements during the construction of the power stations lighting installation and it does not address 
the emergency lighting requirements. 
2.1.2. 
The purpose of this report is to ensure that the permanent external lighting meets the necessary standards 
required for its purpose and that the impact of the lighting on the surrounding area is mitigated as far as 
reasonably practicable without detriment to the safe operation of the site. It is advised that following the 
guidance within this report will assist in obtaining planning permission for the site from a lighting perspective. 
2.2 
PROJECT LOCATION 
2.2.1. 
The Project site is located north of Junction 46 of the M4, approximately 8.15km north of Swansea. The site is 
adjacent to the Swansea North Substation and the Felindre Gas Compressor Station.  At present, it mainly 
consists of farmland and rural roads, with no current sources of artificial light, with the exception of security 
lighting at the Substation and Gas Compressor Station as well as the nearby Abergelli Fach Farm. The site 
resides within the area maintained by City and County of Swansea Council (CCS) who will require consultation 
on appropriate planning applications for the lighting.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE  
3.1 
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 
3.1.1. 
Maintaining  a ‘dark site’ and minimising the level of light spill as far as reasonably practicable, are the 
underpinning factors that will be sought in the design of the lighting for the Project. During the hours of 
darkness, only critical light sources will remain in operation, these include emergency exit illumination and site 
security lighting at a low level. Whilst the site Access Road shall not be lit to avoid impacting the local 
environment including wildlife and adjacent residents as much as is reasonably practicable.  
3.1.2. 
A curfew will be implemented for all non-critical lighting from 23.00 to 05.00 hrs to reduce the impact of the 
development on the local environment. This means that all non-critical lighting will be switched off during these 
hours via a time clock. Routes and entrances not in constant use will be controlled via a movement detector or 
manual switch, ensuring that lighting in these areas will be switched off the vast majority of the time. The 
sensitivity of the motion detectors will be set so as not to be activated by the movement of large mammals 
such as badgers and otters. 
3.1.3. 
The site internal road lighting will be controlled with the utilisation of a time clock or a photocell to ensure the 
only hours of operation are during darkness. All other site lighting, with the exception of Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) (lighting, will be controlled via group switching from the control room and only used when 
necessary for tasks in that specific area to avoid unnecessary light emission.  
3.1.4. 
The general lighting control philosophy is for the lighting to be controlled by a combination of both time clock 
and photocell arrangements with additional local control for open compound lighting, perimeter lighting around 
buildings and external stairs and platforms with automatic delayed off controls where appropriate.  
3.1.5. 
It is noted that the site may at times be unmanned, therefore road lighting and site lighting may not be required 
at all times. The final lighting design will take into consideration the planned operation times of the site and will 
reduce the amount of lighting required when the site is unmanned. System operators will have the ability to 
override any lighting circuit and, where necessary, individual luminaires from the control room. The use of 
digital dimming will be considered to minimise energy consumption even further. 
3.1.6. 
All luminaires will have the necessary optical control and will be appropriately aimed to completely omit direct 
upward light emission. Luminaires shall also be positioned and aimed so that so that peak light intensities from 
any fitting do not unintentionally illuminate any building or structural façade. All luminaires shall be a minimum 
of IP65 rated, whilst in areas deemed hazardous explosive proof fittings shall be utilised. 
3.1.7. 
The main drivers for the design are as follows: 
 The health and safety of all employees performing their working duties as well as all visitors attending site 
 To provide the safe movement of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic around the site during the hours of 
darkness. 
 To reduce light pollution in the forms of light trespass, glare and sky glow. 
 To aid the security of both the site and its occupants with the inclusion of lighting with a cooler colour 
temperature should be used throughout the site to improve CCTV images. 
3.1.8. 
The lighting design for the operation of the power station will be developed to comply with the Institution of 
Lighting Professionals publication: Guidance Notes for the Reduction of Obtrusive Light: a recognised best 
practice guide for the reduction of light pollution.

LIGHTING DESIGN 
4.1 
LIGHTING BY ZONE DEFINITION 
4.1.1. 
For the purposes of this indicative lighting design, Abergelli Power station has been split into four zones. 
 Zone 1: Comprising of internal roads and car parks 
 Zone 2: Comprising of the gas turbine generator and electrical plant areas 
 Zone 3: Comprising of the electrical and gas connection points, gas receiving facility ,Water and fuel 
storage areas and maintenance compound 
 Zone 4: AGI  
 
4.1.2. 
The AGI is required to be lit only during necessary maintenance inspections and visits. 
4.1.3. 
Please note the Access Road will not be illuminated.  
 
4.2 
ZONE 1: ALL SITE ROADS AND CAR PARKING 
4.2.1. 
The internal road and car park(s) will be lit by column mounted luminaires, mounted at a nominal height of 6m.  
4.2.2. 
The road lighting will only operate during the hours of darkness with the use of either a timeclock or a 
photocell. 
4.2.3. 
The site Access Road will not be illuminated. 
 
4.3 
ZONE 2: GAS TURBINE GENERATOR AND ELECTRICAL PLANT AREAS 
4.3.1. 
The gas turbine generator will be lit by building/wall mounted equipment. The lighting for the area and 
associated plant and equipment will be provided in the form of floodlights.  
4.3.2. 
The lighting in this area will be grouped switched from the control room to ensure the lighting is operated only 
when performing necessary working duties or when required. 
4.3.3. 
Where required, column mounted luminaires and equipment at 8m above the working plane will be utilised. 
4.3.4. 
Lighting columns will be fitted with cowls to reduce light spill. 
 
4.4 
ZONE 3: GAS AND ELECTRICAL CONNECTION POINTS ,WATER TANK 
AND FUEL STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE COMPOUND 
4.4.1. 
The lighting of these open areas will utilise column mounted luminaires, mounted at 8m above the working 
plane. 
4.4.2. 
Lighting columns will be fitted with cowls to reduce light spill. 
4.4.3. 
The lighting in this area will be grouped switched from the control room to ensure the lighting is in operation 
only when performing necessary working duties or when required. 
4.4.4. 
Areas in which equipment is mounted on columns, the columns will be mid-hinged to raise and lower, for 
maintenance purposes. 
4.4.5. 
The level of lighting within open areas and compound will be sufficient enough to allow the safe movement of 
pedestrians and vehicles in areas that they might reasonably be expected to negotiate during hours of 
darkness.  
4.5 
ZONE 4: AGI 
4.5.1. 
The AGI will only be lit during routine maintenance visits. 
4.5.2. 
The lighting of the AGI will utilise column mounted equipment at 8m above the working plane.

4.5.3. 
The lighting design will be developed to comply with National Grid standard T/PM/EL/1. 
4.5.4. 
The lighting in this area will be operated via a manual switch from the control room to ensure the lighting is in 
operation only when performing necessary working duties or when required.

LIGHTING EQUIPMENT 
 
5.1 
GENERIC EQUIPMENT AND INSTALLATION 
 
5.1.1. 
All luminaires utilised are designed to minimise upward light spill and are adjustable in elevation to allow for re-
alignment so that light can be directed to avoid light spill above the horizontal plane. 
5.1.2. 
Luminaires will employ high efficiency integral control gear to minimise circuit parasitic losses and, where 
appropriate, will be controlled by a site wide lighting control system to minimise waste light output. 
5.1.3. 
All external luminaires will be ingress protected to a minimum standard of IP65 and shall be suitable for use in 
hazardous areas as identified during detailed design. 
5.1.4. 
Lighting buildings will have a significant impact on the level of light spill produced. Equally important is the 
choice of lighting equipment and lighting techniques. This general guidance will be followed when selecting 
equipment and lighting techniques. 
 
 
Fixed head lanterns will not emit any direct light above horizontal 
 
Movable luminaries will be tilted so that no light is being emitted above horizontal

Lantern heights will be increased where feasible to reduce tilt angles 
 
Quality luminaire optics will be used which accurately control light distribution and do not spill 
light into the atmosphere

LIGHTING CONTROLS 
 
6.1 
LUMINAIRE OPERATION 
 
6.1.1. 
External lighting control will form part of the overall lighting control system. System operators will have the 
ability to override any lighting circuit and, where necessary, individual luminaires from the control room. The 
general lighting control philosophy is for the lighting to be controlled by a combination of both time clock and 
photocell arrangements with additional local control for open compound lighting, perimeter lighting around 
buildings and external stairs and platforms with automatic delayed off controls where appropriate. The use of 
digital dimming will be considered to minimise energy consumption even further. 
6.1.2. 
The site internal road lighting will be controlled with the utilisation of a time clock or a photocell to ensure the 
only hours of operation are during darkness. All other site lighting, with the exception of AGI lighting, will be 
controlled via group switching from the control room and only used when necessary for tasks in that specific 
area to avoid unnecessary light emission. 
6.1.3. 
It is noted that the site may, at times but not all times, be unmanned, therefore road lighting and site lighting 
may not be required at all times. The final lighting design will take into consideration the planned operation 
times of the site and will reduce the amount of lighting for an unmanned site.
