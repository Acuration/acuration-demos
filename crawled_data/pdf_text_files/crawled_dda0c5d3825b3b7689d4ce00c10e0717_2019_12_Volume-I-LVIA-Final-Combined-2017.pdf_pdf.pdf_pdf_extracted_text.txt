General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

General Comment on Baseline Views and Visual Envelope: 
The area is dominated by clay pits and their after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village settlements. 
To the north of the Power Generation Plant Site. Rookery North Pit is occupied by a large lake and the floor of the 
vale continues to the edge of Bedford. To the south, south-east and west low ridges rise up to define the edge of 
Marston Vale and the area is characterised by gently rolling, large, open arable fields, with hedge boundaries and 
belts of relatively recent woodland plantations. Some fields are crossed by electricity pylons. Railway lines form 
strong linear boundaries to the east and west.   
General Comment on the Development Proposals and Visual Effects: 
The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV - Figure 11.1) has been produced on a ‘worst case’ basis with a spot location representing 
the top of the stack at a height of 35m above the floor of the Rookery South Pit. Key visual barriers have been plotted, including 
existing areas of residential settlement, industrial development and visually significant woodland. The resultant ZTV shows the 
theoretical visibility. However, in reality, visibility of the development proposals will be less than the ZTV shows, as other features 
such as hedgerows or isolated properties are likely to provide additional filtering of views.

Key characteristics of relevance to the Project 
Site and locality, include: 
 
Gently undulating, lowland plateau divided 
by shallow river valleys that gradually 
widen as they approach The Fens NCA in 
the east; 
 
Brickfields of the Marston Vale and 
Peterborough area form distinctive post-
industrial landscapes with man-made 
waterbodies and landfill sites. Restoration 
of sand and gravel workings has left a 
series of flooded and restored waterbodies 
within the river valleys; 
 
Variable, 
scattered 
woodland 
cover 
comprising smaller plantations, secondary 
woodland, pollarded willows and poplar 
along river valleys, and clusters of ancient 
woodland; 
 
Predominantly open, arable landscape of 
planned and regular fields bounded by 
open ditches and trimmed, often species-
poor hedgerows which contrast with those 
fields that are irregular and piecemeal;

Natural England 
Landscape Character Area 
90: Bedfordshire 
Greensand Ridge  
 
Key characteristics of relevance to the Project 
Site and locality, include: 
 
Narrow escarpment resulting from the 
erosion-resistant sediments of the Lower 
Greensand Group, with a distinct scarp 
slope to the northwest and dip slope to the 
south-east; 
 
The rolling and elevated Ridge provides a 
north-west-facing wooded skyline offering 
extensive panoramic views across the 
lower-lying 
Bedfordshire 
and 
Cambridgeshire Claylands and towards 
the Chilterns; 
 
Substantial blocks of ancient woodland 
and coniferous plantation are found on the 
Ridge and steeper slopes. Wood pasture 
and numerous hedgerow trees, copses 
and shelterbelts are associated with the 
estate farmland and parkland trees; 
Value of LCA: Medium as the LCA covers 
an extensive area and has a wide range of 
commonly occurring characteristics. 
 
Susceptibility to Change: Medium (as 
views across the Claylands are a key 
characteristic)

County 
Central Bedfordshire 
Landscape Character Area 
5D: North Marston Clay 
Vale 
The key characteristics of this character area, 
which are relevant to the Project Site, are: 
 
A large scale, open vale, defined by 
Oxford Clay geology, located between the 
elevated landscapes of the Wooded 
Greensand Ridge (6b) and the Cranfield to 
Stagsden Clay Farmland (1a) that provide 
a sense of containment; 
 
An agricultural landscape fragmented by 
current and former industrial activity 
including brick works, open cast clay pits, 
landfill, distribution centres and industrial 
estates; 
 
A legacy of clay extraction (for brick 
making) has resulted in a disturbed 
landscape, currently subject to large scale 
restoration - evoking a landscape in 
transition;  
 
The establishment of Country Parks and 
the Forest of Marston Vale with its Forest 
Centre 
provides 
valuable 
ecological, 
recreational and landscape resources; 
 
Flooded clay pits form a series of lakes 
throughout the vale such as at Stewartby 
Country 
Park. 
These 
have 
created 
significant 
recreational 
value 
and 
ecological interest; 
 
Mature woodland is relatively scarce; 
 
Arable farming is the predominant land 
use of the area typically occurring in large, 
open fields with short-flailed, sparse 
hedgerow 
boundaries 
and 
drainage 
channels; 
 
A number of busy transport routes cut 
north south through the landscape - 
including the A421(T) the A6 (forming the 
eastern boundary of the area) and the 
main railway lines running from Bedford to 
London and Milton Keynes; 
 
Lines of pylons cut across the landscape 
and are highly visible - extending from the 
Greensand Ridge; 
 
Stewartby – a model village begun in 1926 
by the Stewart family, owners of the 
London Brick Company. Characterised by 
consistent red-brick houses set around 
large areas of green space. The adjacent 
chimney stacks dominate views; and 
 
Numerous public rights of way cut through 
the landscape and provide connections to 
the recreational routes on the adjacent 
landscapes - the John Bunyan Trail and 
the Greensand Ridge Walk. 
 
Value of LCA: Low (as has strong 
evidence of industrial use and no 
landscape designation) 
 
Susceptibility to Change: Low (as many 
of key characteristics relate to former 
industrial uses) 
 
OVERALL SENSITIVITY: LOW

Greensand Ridge and East

 
The Ridge and its scarp provides one of 
the most wooded areas of the Community 
Forest and is an important backdrop to the 
work planned for the core of the Vale; 
 
Opportunities 
should 
be 
sought 
to 
strengthen 
the 
existing 
woodlands, 
improve the hedgerow network and to add 
features such as copses on knolls; 
 
Points of topographical interest such as 
outcrops of greensand and small valleys 
should not be obscured by planting; 
 
The existing areas of scrub and sites that 
could be developed as acidic grassland 
could offer much to the diversity of the 
Ridge landscape and tree planting must 
not detract from this variety. For some 
sites, management will be required to 
maintain the diversity of habitats that 
generates such landscape interest; 
 
Villages and infrastructure such as roads 
can be better assimilated into the 
landscape by the planting of more blocks 
of trees and the use of screening belts, but 
long distance views of the Greensand 
Ridge must not be obscured.

Introduction  
1.1.1 
The Project is proposed at the former clay extraction pit at Rookery South, near 
Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the approximate centre of the Project Site at grid 
reference 501373, 240734.  The boundary of the Project Site falls within both 
Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC) areas.  
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 and therefore requires development consent 
under that Act. This document therefore supports the development consent order 
("DCO") Application for the Project.   
1.1.2 
The DCO Application is being made to the Planning Inspectorate pursuant to the 
Planning Act 2008 and in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2009 (the “APFP” Regulations”). 
1.1.3 
This outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy has 
been produced to support the DCO application, and outlines the proposed 
mitigation and management measures for the Project in relation to landscape and 
ecological management and mitigation at the Project Site.  It covers the period from 
the completion of the landscape works during the operational phase for the first ten 
years, and can be extended up to the decommissioning stage after a further 15 
years. 
1.1.4 
This outline Strategy is the precursor to a more detailed Landscape and Ecological 
Mitigation and Management Plan which will be prepared should the application be 
successful. 
Purpose of this Document 
1.1.5 
This outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
augments the mitigation measures included in the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) Chapter 11: Landscape and Visual Impact, and Chapter 
8: Ecology. Its purpose is to: 
� Provide a clear landscape and ecology mitigation rationale, which responds to 
the context of the Project site; 
� Provide more clearly defined landscape and ecological mitigation; and 
� Provide graphical descriptions of the proposed mitigation. 
Document Structure 
1.1.6

The Project 
1.1.7 
A full description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3 of the PEIR however, a 
brief overview is provided below.   
1.1.8 
The Project would comprise: 
� a new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical 
output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW).   
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with, one exhaust gas 
flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), 
which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 
a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the ‘Access Road);  
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’); 
� a new gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the ‘Gas Connection’). This 
element incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of 
connection to the NTS; and 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
3 
� a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to 
the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Connection’). This element could be delivered in one of two ways: 
 
The first option would involve one underground double circuit Tee-in. This would 
require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be located in the 
existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net 
additional towers). This option would also require two SECs, one located on each 
side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would then be connected via 
underground cables approximately 500 metres in length to a new substation (the 
‘Substation’). This is hereafter referred to as "Option 1". 
 
The second option is similar to Option 1 and would involve an underground single 
circuit turn in (requiring two cable circuits, one into and one out of the substation). 
This would require one new tower (which will again replace an existing tower and be 
located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby 
resulting in no net additional towers). This option would also require one larger SEC, 
which could be located on either side of the existing transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres 
in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). This is hereafter referred to as 
"Option 2". 
1.1.9 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known 
as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant 
Site’.  
1.1.10 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together 
with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project. The land upon which 
the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate 
the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
1.1.11 
The design of the Project layout has taken into account the landscape receptors, 
ecological features, and mitigation requirements.  In addition, embedded design 
mitigation measures which can often be considered as standard, best practice 
working methods, without which the Project would not be allowed to be developed 
have been included as follows:  
Landscape Working Methods 
1.1.12 
As the construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), 
significant mitigation to limit landscape and visual impacts is not anticipated. 
However, the following will be applied through a CEMP: 
� Land / vegetation clearance and occupation will be limited to the minimum area 
necessary for the works; 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
4 
� Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to be retained 
will be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice; 
� Temporary storage of soils and other material considered of value for retention 
will be undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice. Where practical, 
stockpiles will be sited to screen the construction works from sensitive receptors 
such as PROW.  
� Construction areas will be laid out to minimise adverse impacts arising from 
temporary structures, construction activities and lighting; 
� Construction roads will be on the same alignment as permanent access roads 
where possible; 
� Use of construction site lighting outside normal working hours will be restricted 
to the minimum necessary for workforce and public safety, and for security. 
Directional luminaries will be used to limit unwanted light spill in accordance with 
guidance provided by the Bat Conservation Trust and Institute of Lighting 
Engineers (2009); 
� Maintenance of tidy and contained site compounds; 
� Hoardings erected around the area of construction works, for reasons of creating 
a visual barrier to construction activities and also as a safety measure, to prevent 
access to the general public; 
� Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary structures and 
stockpiles when no longer required, and prompt reinstatement of construction 
areas; 
� Reinstatement of all agricultural land required temporarily during construction, 
and a five year aftercare plan to seek to ensure land is returned to its former 
productivity;  
� Replacement of all trees, shrubs and hedgerows removed to accommodate the 
utility Connections, subject to NG planting constraints; and; 
� The AGI will be screened on all sides with vegetation to limit visual impacts. 
Ecological Working Methods 
1.1.13 
The CEMP would incorporate measures to protect sensitive ecology such as:  
� Work compounds and access tracks etc. will not be located in, or adjacent to, 
areas that maintain habitat value; 
� Site fencing will be used to prevent access to areas outside working areas, 
particularly in areas adjacent to features of ecological value; 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
5 
� Procedures will be implemented to address site safety issues, including storage 
of potentially dangerous materials; 
� Briefings and instruction would be given to contractors regarding the biodiversity 
issues associated with the Project Site; and 
� Best practice pollution prevention measures would be followed to prevent 
pollution of water courses by silt or chemicals. 
Temporal Scope 
1.1.14 
The management plan covers an initial 10 year period commencing at the 
beginning of the construction phase, and will form the basis of a longer term 
management plan for up to 25 years in total, up to the decommissioning of the 
project. 
Spatial Scope 
1.1.15 
The strategy and management plans cover the whole Project Site from Lower Farm 
in the south along a narrow corridor across arable fields.  The principal area for 
development of the Power Generation Plant takes up part of the disused Rookery 
South Pit next to Pillinge Farm South.  The site extends to the north between the 
Marston Vale Line and Wooton Pillage Lake to Green Lanes Crossing in the south 
of Stewartby. 
Responsibilities 
1.1.16 
The execution of the LEMMS will be the responsibility of the operator of the site, 
except for limited areas of new hedge planting along the Gas Connection which will 
be managed by the landowner under agreement or via compulsory purchase 
powers.  The LEMMS operations in association with AGI will be undertaken by 
National Grid.

Baseline Conditions 
Project Site Location 
2.1.1 
The Project will be located in an area known as ‘the Marston Vale’ between Milton 
Keynes and Bedford with the approximate centre of the Project Site at grid 
reference 501373, 240734.  The Project Site falls within areas administered by both 
Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC).   
The Rookery 
2.1.2 
The Project Site is partially located within ‘The Rookery’.  The Rookery comprises 
two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South) separated by an east-west 
spine of unexcavated clay covering an area of some 210 ha.  The Rookery is 
situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford.   
2.1.3 
The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within part of Rookery 
South Pit which is approximately 95 ha in area and is bounded by steep clay banks 
that are varied in nature and substrate. The level of the pit base currently varies 
between approximately 10 and 15 m below ground level and includes open water, 
reed beds, pools and bare inundated clay.  The land that remains at the original 
ground level, approximately 42 m above ordnance datum (AOD) immediately 
around the periphery of Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground that has 
been previously cleared of vegetation and subsequently maintained in this state 
over approximately the last 30 years.  
2.1.4 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would extend from Rookery South 
Pit into farmland to the south and south east. Part of the Access Road would run 
to the west of Rookery North Pit. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme 
2.1.5 
Prior to the commencement of construction works on site a Low Level Restoration 
Scheme (LLRS) will have been undertaken (Appendix 3).  The restoration of the 
site includes a realigned watercourse and surface management ditches.  Most of 
the site will be formed of semi improved grassland, tree and scrub planting, marsh, 
marginal aquatics and native hedgerows. 
2.1.6 
The LLRS provides the baseline for future mitigation proposals following 
construction completion. 
Relevant History 
2.1.7 
The area around the Marston Vale has a long history of clay extraction, which was 
used primarily for the brick industry resulting in former clay extraction pits 
dominating the Marston Vale. Some have been restored for amenity use (e.g. on 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
7 
the nearby Millennium Country Park), while others have been used for landfill (e.g. 
Stewartby and Brogborough), whereas the Rookery South Pit has remained as an 
open, undeveloped pit.  
2.1.8 
Partial backfilling of Rookery South Pit has been recorded, including deposition of 
non-hazardous liquid organic wastes from a variety of industrial sources.  The 
waste was reportedly mixed with unweathered Oxford Clay deposits commonly 
known as the “callow” and pumped, as sludge, into the south eastern quarter of the 
Rookery North Pit and the north eastern quarter of Rookery South Pit. 
2.1.9 
Additional fill to the base of Rookery South Pit has also been historically undertaken 
by placement of variable thicknesses (generally from 1 m to 4 m) of Callow Clay 
Fill across the base of the pit.  These naturally occurring deposits were unsuitable 
for the brick making process and were cast back into the pit along with brick 
fragments and other overburden deposits. 
2.1.10 
The land directly north of the Generating Equipment Site has been allocated to a 
Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) which Covanta Rookery South Limited obtained 
DCO consent for pursuant to the PA 2008 in autumn 2011 (the ‘Covanta RRF 
Project’).  
Landscape Character 
2.1.11 
Published sources describing the landscape character of the area at the National, 
Regional and District level are: 
� National Character Area 88: Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands 
(Natural England, 2014a);

Figure 11.3 of the PEIR illustrates landscape character areas applicable to the site 
and surrounding area.  
Ecological Character 
2.1.13 
Baseline conditions of the Power Generation Plant Site include the Rookery South 
Clay Pit which forms part of the Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS). The 
base of the western parts of Rookery South Pit presently comprises a mosaic of 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
8 
sparsely vegetated and bare ground, with occasional channels and pools of 
standing water supporting emergent vegetation including reed grasses and sedges.   
2.1.14 
In the past, Rookery South Clay Pit supported a large population of great crested 
newts, a small population of grass snakes and a medium population of common 
lizards, along with a valuable invertebrate fauna and numerous bird species of 
conservation importance.  Trapping and translocation of great crested newts (and 
reptiles) has taken place under a mitigation licence, issued by Natural England in 
2011 as part of the LLRS. This has affected the southern half of the Rookery Clay 
Pit CWS incorporating the southern portion of the Access Road and a proportion 
of the arable land in the south of the Project Site. The translocation programme 
was completed in November 2014. Significant areas of the western half of the base 
of Rookery South Pit were levelled following completion of the translocation 
exercise, and during an ecological walkover survey undertaken by PBA in April 
2017, it was noted that herpetofauna exclusion fencing had been retained in situ. 
At the time that the Project is constructed in 2020, it is assumed that no great 
crested newts or reptiles will be present in the base of the Rookery South Pit and 
surrounding area. In addition, the LLRS re-profiling works will replace any terrestrial 
habitat currently suitable for great crested newts, reptiles, breeding birds and/or 
invertebrates within Rookery South Pit with clay, rendering it of negligible nature 
conservation value for these species.   
2.1.15 
The surrounds of the pit comprise a patchy mosaic of bare ground, species-poor 
neutral grassland and woodland/scrub habitats that have developed since clay 
extraction ceased.  The access track comprises a mosaic of bare ground with 
ephemeral vegetation and scrub, which is known to be used as a commuting and 
foraging route by a range of bat species. In addition, suitable terrestrial habitat 
along the track is likely to be used by great crested newts and reptiles, and the 
trees and scrub are likely to be used by nesting birds.  
2.1.16 
The majority of the habitats within the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Connection route comprise intensively managed agricultural land, characterised by 
large arable fields, with grassy field margins which are bound by young species-
poor hedgerows. A small number of plantation woodlands, which appear to be 
relatively recent in origin (less than 30 years old) are present within the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection. Parts of the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection (e.g. the Substation) are within Rookery South Pit. These are 
assumed to be the same as the Power Generation Plant Site.  
2.1.17 
Two great crested newt meta-populations are located within 250m of the Gas and 
Electrical Connection area.  In addition small populations of reptiles (common 
lizards and grass snake) have been recorded within the Gas and Electrical 
Connection areas. In addition, the hedgerows are likely to be used by nesting and 
foraging birds.

Ecological Features 
3.1.1 
In order to determine the ecological features for which ecological mitigation 
measures are required associated with the Project, an evaluation of ecological 
features was undertaken having regards to the Chartered Institute of Ecology and 
Environmental Management’s (CIEEM) Guidelines for Ecological Impact 
Assessment (2016).  Ecological features that were deemed to be important, and 
therefore required full consideration in the impact assessment were identified. 
These features are those that are important within a ‘Local’ context or greater. Only 
one important ecological feature has been identified: Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
Further information is provided in Chapter 8 of the PEIR.   
3.1.2 
A number of ecological features are considered to be of insufficient importance to 
trigger a detailed assessment.  Nevertheless, due to their protection under the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) and/ or the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), consideration needs to be given 
to appropriate management measures during the design and implementation of the 
Project, which are required to avoid a breach of legislation.  These are described 
below.  
Important Ecological Features 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
3.1.3 
There will be direct habitat loss within Rookery Clay Pit CWS associated with the 
construction of the Power Generation Plant.  As identified above, the re-grading 
works associated with the LLRS within Rookery South Pit will replace any terrestrial 
habitat suitable for newts, reptiles, breeding birds and/ or reptiles.  Impacts are 
therefore limited to the loss of any new habitat that would have been created 
associated as part of the LLRS restoration strategy, in the absence of the Project, 
and the areas of ephemeral vegetation and scrub habitat on the peripheral areas 
of the western edge of Rookery North Pit, including along the Access Road, if 
vegetation removal is required.   Given that the LLRS will be completed by the time 
of construction of the Project, and Rookery North Pit will be retained, the effect of 
habitat loss upon Rookery Clay Pit CWS before mitigation is considered to be ‘Not 
Significant’.   
Other ecological features requiring appropriate management to avoid a breach 
of legislation 
Designated sites 
3.1.4 
There is one SSSI within 2 km of the Power Generation Plant Site. Coopers Hill 
SSSI is approximately 1.2 km to the south-east.  A further 11 non-statutory 
designated sites are present within 2 km of the Project Site.  
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
10 
3.1.5 
Given the distances of these statutory and non-statutory designated sites from the 
Power Generation Plant Site, the risk of dust and particulate matter emissions 
during construction and decommissioning of the Project is considered to be low.  
No direct or indirect impacts are anticipated, and no specific mitigation is deemed 
necessary.   
Great crested newts 
3.1.6 
At the time of construction, it is assumed that Rookery South Pit will remain free of 
great crested newts. However, the existing access track, along the alignment of the 
proposed Access Road, on the western edge of Rookery North Pit, comprises 
areas of scrub, ephemeral vegetation and bare ground with cracks and crevices. 
These habitats, including the voids in the bare ground, could be used by the meta-
population of great crested newts supported by Rookery North Pit during their 
terrestrial phase.  The potential exists for construction of the Access Road to result 
in incidental harm to great crested newts using suitable features associated with 
terrestrial habitat along the route of the proposed Access Road.   
3.1.7 
Surveys have confirmed the presence of one small population of great crested 
newts and one medium population of great crested newts within the Gas and 
Electrical Connection area.   
3.1.8 
Great crested newts are relatively common in the county and are widespread within 
the vicinity of the Project Site (comprising four meta-populations recorded during 
the surveys, a large population associated with the receptor sites from the Rookery 
South Pit translocation, and robust meta-populations known to occur elsewhere 
within the base of Marston Vale). The great crested newt populations associated 
with the Project Site are therefore considered to be of less than ‘Local’ importance.   
Reptiles 
3.1.9 
The existing access track along the alignment of the Access Road, on the western 
edge of Rookery North Pit comprises areas of scrub, ephemeral vegetation and 
bare ground with cracks and crevices which could be used by common species of 
reptiles associated with Rookery North Pit. In addition, small populations of 
common lizard and grass snakes were recorded within the Gas and Electrical 
Connection Areas, although the areas affected are considered to be of limited 
value, due to the intense management of the arable farmland.   
3.1.10 
Given that other similar habitat is widespread in Marston Vale and the surrounding 
area, and that only small to medium populations of reptiles have been confirmed 
during the baseline surveys, the reptile populations within the Project Site are 
considered to be of less than ‘Local’ importance.. 
Breeding birds 
3.1.11 
The areas of scrub along the existing access track can be expected to support 
nesting birds.  The majority of the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
11 
Connection are of limited value for breeding birds, consisting of large arable fields, 
delineated by species-poor hedgerows and ditches.  Overall, the assemblage of 
breeding birds associated with the Project Site is considered to be of less than 
‘Local’ importance. 
Bats 
3.1.12 
The majority of bats were recorded foraging and commuting along the scrub-lined 
access track, which constitutes a ‘green corridor’, linking the known bat roosts at 
South Pillinge Farm, with valuable foraging habitat to the north, associated with 
Rookery North Pit and beyond.  The bat populations associated with the Project 
Site are considered to be of less than ‘Local’ importance .

Landscape & Ecological Mitigation Proposals 
Overview 
4.1.1 
The Landscape and Ecology Strategy Plan (Appendix 2) includes the creation of a 
new structurally diverse and species-rich belt of woodland planting to reflect the 
species composition within the wider Marston Vale Forest.  Additional planting and 
appropriate management of existing blocks of planted woodland would be expected 
to enhance their nature conservation value.  Native species of local provenance 
will be used, wherever possible. These new areas of planting linking existing 
habitats would be expected to increase the connectivity of the Project Site for 
wildlife. The planting proposed has been designed to ensure the value for 
biodiversity is maximised, whilst performing a landscape screening function.   
4.1.2 
The surface water management ditches proposed as part of the LLRS have been 
incorporated into the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy for the Project, 
albeit with minor realignments to the south of the Generating Equipment and 
Substation. These features may be of value to great crested newts, depending 
upon any flow in the ditches.  In addition, a series of small ponds will be created 
within the Project Site, designed to be of value to wildlife, with shallow sloping 
edges planted with marginal vegetation to provide egg laying opportunities for 
newts. This new pond creation would also contribute towards relevant targets in 
the Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Action Plan. The exact location of the 
ponds would be defined prior to construction, in liaison with stakeholders. 
Project Landscape Strategy 
Introduction 
4.1.3 
It is anticipated that where possible all of the existing planting within the Project 
Site will be retained and protected.  Where it is necessary for vegetation to be 
removed, the extent will be kept to a minimum and it will be replanted within the 
Project Site following construction. 
4.1.4 
A palette of native tree and shrub planting (see Appendix 1) has been compiled to 
meet the various plantings scenarios identified within this document. 
Planting proposals 
4.1.5 
The planting species that form the basis of the landscape planting strategy on site 
are detailed in Appendix 1, covering the following: 
� New structural planting 
� Trees 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
13 
� Hedgerows, both general mixed native hedgerow planting and hawthorn and 
blackthorn only hedgerows crossing easements. 
� Grassland seeding 
� Scrub planting 
Ecological Mitigation Strategy 
Overview 
4.1.6 
Given that no likely significant effects are predicted on important ecological features 
(Rookery Pit CWS), no project specific mitigation is required in addition to the 
embedded design mitigation described in Chapter 3, section 3.6 of the PEIR.   
4.1.7 
The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy for the Project will ensure that any 
habitats of ecological value that would have been created as part of the LLRS (in 
the absence of the Project) will be incorporated into the design of the Project.  This 
includes surface water management ditches, and areas of woodland, tree and 
scrub planting.  Should the construction of the Access Road result in the loss of 
any vegetation, this would be replanted with appropriate native species, to maintain 
the bat foraging and commuting corridor.  In addition, the enhancement of retained 
vegetation and creation of new habitats, through woodland, tree and hedgerow 
planting and new ponds would be expected to result in a net gain in biodiversity. 
Great crested newts 
4.1.8 
Great crested newts and their places of shelter are protected under the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended).  They are 
also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  The 
management measures identified below are required in order to avoid the incidental 
mortality of great crested newts during the implementation of the Project, and to 
ensure that the favourable conservation status of the local great crested newt 
population is maintained.  
4.1.9 
Whilst no ponds would be directly affected by the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant or Gas and Electrical Connection, short sections of the Access 
Road are located approximately 490 m from the Rookery North Pit large population 
of great crested newts. The potential therefore exists for the incidental mortality of 
great crested newts, associated with the re-surfacing works.  Similarly, the 
Electrical Connection will be installed within 250 m of Pond C (see Appendix 5) 
which supports a small population of great crested newts; a narrow strip of planted 
woodland will be removed to facilitate the trench installation.  In addition, five 
sections of hedgerows will be removed, four of which are located within 250 m of 
Pond H (see Appendix 5).  However, given the distances involved, the limited 
suitability of the habitats affected, and the presence of more suitable terrestrial 
habitat nearby the likelihood of encountering great crested newts has been 
assessed as being low in each instance.   
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
14 
4.1.10 
Using Natural England’s Rapid Risk Assessment tool, the likelihood of an offence 
being committed as a result of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
installation is considered to be ‘highly unlikely’.  Any requirement to carry out the 
works under a precautionary method statement included within the CEMP or a 
derogation licence issued by Natural England to ensure that no newts are harmed 
during the construction process, will be determined prior to construction. This will 
be based on the historical context of mitigation works associated with great crested 
newts in and adjacent to the Project Site. If required, appropriate mitigation 
measures will involve the appropriate timing of works, avoidance of suitable 
terrestrial habitat as far as possible, and the careful removal/ dismantling by hand 
of any suitable refugia beneath the footprint of the works.     
Reptiles 
4.1.11 
Reptiles are afforded protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended).  Any elements of the Project affecting the limited areas of potential 
reptile habitat will give due regard to the legislation protecting common and 
widespread reptile species, i.e. protection against injury and killing.  This will be 
achieved through the displacement of any reptiles present into areas of retained 
habitat within and adjacent to the Project Site prior to construction works 
commencing through the following approach: 
� Progressive removal of suitable low-lying vegetation, including long grass, 
ruderals and scrub, using hand-held tools.  The final stages of clearance to 
ground level should take place during suitable climatic conditions at a time of 
year when reptiles are active (generally April to September inclusive). 
� Dismantling of any potential hibernacula or refugia by hand, including compost 
heaps and log piles. 
� Where appropriate, ground level clearance work will be overseen by a suitably 
experienced ecologist who would relocate any reptiles encountered to an area of 
suitable retained habitat within and adjacent to the site. 
� Following the clearance of vegetation, the vegetation will be maintained at ground 
level to prevent re-colonisation prior to works commencing. 
Nesting birds 
4.1.12 
Nesting birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended).  Any clearance or cutting of woody vegetation will avoid the breeding 
bird season (generally taken to be mid-February to mid-September inclusive) in 
order to avoid the destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the 
vegetation will be checked prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' 
nests.  If active nests are present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be retained 
around the nest and such works will be delayed until the young birds have fledged 
and the nest becomes inactive.

Bats 
4.1.13 
All species of bats in the UK are European protected species, receiving protection 
under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended).  
They are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). 
4.1.14 
The lighting scheme associated with the construction and operation of the Project 
has been sensitively designed to minimise potential impacts on bats in accordance 
with guidance provided by the Bat Conservation Trust and Institute of Lighting 
Engineers (2009).  As a minimum, down-lighting and motion-sensitive lights will be 
used, and light spill will be minimised by the use of baffles, as appropriate to avoid 
disturbance effects on the known bat roost associated with the South Pillinge Farm.  
An outline lighting plan will be included as an Appendix to the ES and submitted 
with the DCO Application.

Landscape and Ecological Management 
Establishment & Management 
Protection of Valuable Features during Construction 
5.1.1 
In order to retain and protect existing trees and hedgerows, temporary fencing will 
be erected in accordance with British Standard BS5837:2012 Trees in relation to 
design, demolition and construction. Root protection zones will have been 
determined by the arboriculturalist. 
5.1.2 
Different fencing types will be used, depending on their proximity to construction 
activity and the potential vulnerability of plant material to construction damage. 
5.1.3 
BS5837:2012 Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction sets out 
operations not permitted within the protected zones, and describes suitable fencing 
types. Fencing will be erected at the commencement of the construction phase and 
be maintained until practical completion.  
Services 
5.1.4 
Landscape proposals will be coordinated with drainage, mechanical and electrical 
services layouts as far as they are available prior to the design being completed. 
Programme for Vegetation Removal and Management 
5.1.5 
Any clearance or cutting of woody vegetation will ideally avoid the breeding bird 
season (generally taken to be March to August inclusive) in order to avoid the 
destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the vegetation will be 
checked prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' nests.  If active nests 
are present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be retained around the nest and 
such works will be delayed until the young birds have fledged and the nest becomes 
inactive.   
Management of Vegetation Prior to Implementation of the Landscape Scheme 
5.1.6 
Hedgerow pruning will be carried out using a reciprocating blade cutter to reduce 
the height of 3-5m. Sides will be cut back. Standard trees are to remain uncut and 
be allowed to grow on. 
5.1.7 
Where overgrown hedges require rejuvenating, they will be coppiced to 150mm in 
height.  
Management Objectives

Annual Maintenance Operations  
Generally 
5.1.20 
The management regime is described below in terms of the scope and frequency 
of annual maintenance operations. These are relevant throughout the whole 
management period, and particularly in years 1-5 during the establishment of 
woody and herbaceous plant material. 
5.1.21 
A health and safety method statement will be agreed between the client and 
contractor regarding the types of maintenance machinery and chemicals to be used 
on-site. 
5.1.22 
Should any new construction works be required on-site, or additional services be 
installed, new and original vegetation is to be protected as set out in paragraphs 
5.1.1 - 5.1.3. 
5.1.23 
The timing of tree and hedgerow works will comply with paragraphs Error! 
Reference source not found. - Error! Reference source not found.. 
5.1.24 
All tree works will be undertaken by a qualified arboriculturalist or tree surgeon. 
Works are to comply with BS3998 and HSE Forestry and Arboricultural safety 
leaflets. Trees are to be left with a well-balanced shape and natural appearance. 
Chainsaw operatives must hold a certificate of competence. Chain or hand saw 
wounds will be as small as possible, cutting back to sound wood leaving a smooth 
surface, angled to shed the water and avoiding bark tears. 
Planted Woodland 
5.1.25 
In order to ensure longevity of trees in good condition and prevent potential 
instability as a result of severed roots, no compaction, excavation, digging of 
service trenches, or level changes are to take place within a zone extending from 
a tree trunk to at least 2m beyond the outer edge of the tree canopy (for deciduous 
trees) or an area with a radius of half the trees height measured from the trunk (for 
evergreen varieties). These dimensions are relevant where root protection zones 
have not been established as part of a recent (within 3 years) arboricultural survey. 
Where such a survey has been undertaken, the dimensions provided by the 
arboriculturalist are to be used. Within woodlands, root protection zones are likely 
to be continuous. 
5.1.26 
Outside root protection zones described above, tree roots over 50mm diameter will 
not be cut. Where cutting takes place, it will by means of a smooth cut with a hand 
saw, followed by backfilling over tree roots with original topsoil. 
5.1.27 
Inspections will be carried out at 12-15 month intervals to note any: 
i. major deadwood that needs to be removed from crowns; 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
23 
ii. split or damaged branches, storm damage, hung-up limbs, and jagged or open 
wounds that require tidying; 
iii. forks, cavities and major defects that could result in structural failure, cavities, 
cracks or bark wounds at the base of trees, together with bracket fungus. An 
arboriculturalist will probe cavities as required to determine the course of action; 
iv. basal suckers or epicormic growth that require removal from the main trunk; 
v. poor quality trees with structural defects, such as forked trunks that may require 
pruning or felling; and 
vi. diseases. 
5.1.28 
Ivy on tree trunks will be retained, except where it needs to be removed to facilitate 
inspection of trees or where it has become extensive and could result in a tree 
falling in high winds. 
5.1.29 
Removal of litter and fly-tipped material will be carried out four times a year. 
New Structure Planting 
5.1.30 
Operations will ensure: 
i. dead, dying and diseased wood and suckers will be removed annually to promote 
healthy growth, a natural shape and to avoid health and safety concerns; 
ii. dead, missing, dying or defective plants will be replaced annually for the first 5 
years after implementation; 
iii. all tree stakes, ties and guards will be adjusted/replaced/removed as required 
until anchorage has been achieved. This will be done biannually; 
iv. rabbit/deer protection will be maintained until no longer needed. This will be 
checked four times a year; 
v. weed-free ground will be maintained with the use of translocated, non-residual 
herbicides, until the canopy closes, in order to avoid competition for water and 
nutrients. This will be done eight times a year, reducing to three times a year 
when the canopy is closed; 
vi. a slow release fertiliser (4:19:10) will be spread annually in early March in the 
first three years after planting or replanting after defects replacements; 
vii. litter and fly-tipped material will be removed four times a year; 
viii. plants overhanging roads or paths or starting to encroach onto public footpaths 
will be trimmed back annually;

and/or by digging up; 
x. self-sown trees will be removed annually by digging up or use of suitable 
herbicides; 
xi. plants will be watered in dry weather in the initial three year establishment period. 
Watering will be carried out twice a week to field capacity. Beyond the 
establishment period, watering will be in times of drought; 
xii. pruning will take place annually to avoid obstruction of sightlines, visibility splays, 
traffic signs and access points; and 
xiii. formative pruning of young trees annually. 
5.1.31 
Management operations will ensure: 
i. root protection zones are identified by an arboriculturalist where construction or 
service trenching is anticipated. To ensure longevity of trees in good condition, 
and ensure no potential instability as a result of severed roots, no compaction, 
excavation, digging of service trenches, or level changes are to take place within 
the root protection zones established as part of a recent (within 3 years) 
arboricultural survey; 
ii. no fertilisers or pesticides will be spread near roots or trunks of trees; and 
iii. litter and fly-tipped material will be removed four times a year.

viii. a slow release fertiliser (4:19:10) will be spread annually in early March in the 
first three years after planting or replanting after defects replacements; 
ix. plants will be watered in dry weather in the initial three year establishment period. 
Watering will be carried out twice a week to field capacity. Beyond the 
establishment period, watering will be in times of drought; 
x. trees are maintained upright and adjustments will be made following strong 
winds; and 
xi. formative pruning will be carried out. 
Mature Hedgerows 
5.1.39 
Objectives in relation to mature hedgerows are to: 
i. thin trees to centres no closer than 6m, retaining the best quality specimens to 
grow on as standards within the hedge; 
ii. trim sides to within 1.0m of the main stems and tops to 3-5m on a 3 year rotational 
basis across the site. Where possible, leave one side of each hedgerow uncut 
each year. This will maintain a resource of flowering and fruiting plants across 
the site and create nesting and foraging habitat for wildlife; 
iii. cut ground flora at the base of hedges on a 3 year rotation to 150mm height, with 
arisings removed. This is to maximise the value of the habitat for overwintering 
and foraging insects, and prevent scrub establishment. Cutting is to take place 
in October/November. 
New Hedgerows 
5.1.40 
Maintenance operations will ensure: 
i. the base of hedges will be kept weed-free manually or by applications of a 
translocated non-residual herbicide. This will be done eight times a year. 
Maintenance input will reduce after Year 5, when continuous hedgerows should 
be achieved. Weeding, watering, fertiliser applications and topping up the mulch 
are key to achieving successful establishment; 
ii. litter and fly-tipped material will be removed four times a year; 
iii. plants will be watered in dry weather in the initial three year establishment period. 
Watering will be carried out twice a week to field capacity. Beyond the 
establishment period, watering will be in times of drought; 
iv. composted woodbark mulch will be topped up annually to 75mm depth for the 
first 3 years after implementation to suppress weeds and retain moisture; 
Preliminary Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
27 
v. rabbit/deer protection will be retained/replaced until no longer needed. This is to 
be checked four times a year; 
vi. a slow release fertiliser (4:19:10) will be applied annually in March; 
vii. all bamboo canes or tree stakes will be adjusted/replaced/removed as necessary 
once plants are anchored. This will be carried out four times a year; 
viii. plants will remain upright. Any adjustments will be made four times a year; 
ix. plants will be pruned annually to remove any dead, lying or diseased wood and 
suckers to promote healthy growth and a natural shape; 
x. dead, dying, defective or missing plants will be replaced annually for the first five 
years after planting; and 
xi. once established, hedgerows will be cut to 3-5m in height. Sides will be cut back 
to within 1.0m of the main stems to create bases that are wider than the top of 
the hedgerows. This will be carried out between November and mid-February 
using a reciprocating blade cutter, not a flail. It will take place annually on a three 
year rotation, with one third of hedgerows being pruned each year. Individual 
trees will be allowed to grown on. Management operations will ensure: 
i. rubbish, vegetation and litter will be removed, including adjacent to any pipes, 
overflows or grates. This will be done biannually; 
ii. marginals and aquatics will be allowed to find their own equilibrium, and this is 
dependent upon unpredictable water levels; 
iii. dead foliage/flower stems will be cut down annually in early autumn; 
iv. vegetation removed from drainage/water features will be left on the sides for 48 
hours for invertebrates to crawl back into the pond, and then removed; 
v. wildflower areas or grass above the waterline will be cut as set out above. 
Reseeding will not take place where grass/wildflowers have died out due to 
regular water inundation; and 
vi. a more open aspect to ditches will be created to reduce overshadowing and 
promote the Periodic Management Operations  
5.1.41 
Annual or regular maintenance operations will continue for 10 years after the 
commencement of the works, and then will be reviewed with the LPA. 
5.1.42 
In addition, other operations will be required intermittently; notably, pruning, 
woodland thinning and coppicing. Approximate years when these are required have 
been set out, although regular site monitoring will be required to respond to 
unpredictable events, poor plant establishment rates, extreme weather, etc.

Where woodland thinning involves trees with a stem diameter over 100mm, a felling 
licence is required where more than 5m³ of timber is felled per calendar quarter 
provided that no more than 2m³ is sold. To avoid felling licences, felling should be 
undertaken quarterly over a number of years, with priority areas tackled first.

be retained at the expense of short-lived varieties. Mature and overmature 
specimens will be retained as veterans. Formative pruning will be undertaken to 
retained trees. Some standing deadwood will be retained for wildlife, providing it 
poses no health and safety risks. Thinning will ensure that remaining canopies are 
not touching. Anticipated centres are 5m after Years 6-9; 8m at Years 15-20 and 
8-10m at Year 25 for new structure planting. Cut stumps will be treated to stop

Arboricultural inspections will identify: 
* 
* 
crown reduction required to mature trees. 
 
 
raising canopies to 6m above roads. 
 
 
pollarding of willows every 5 years. 
 
 
canopy thinning to minimise potential gale damage. 
 
 
the need to thin congested trees. 
 
 
pruning to ensure lighting/CCTV cameras are not obstructed.

Years

Arboricultural inspections will identify: 
 
 
ensure marginals and aquatics do not cover more than two thirds of the surface 
area of water. Periodic thinning will be required depending on the speed of 
colonisation. 
 
 
discarded vegetation will be left on the banks for 48 hours to allow mobile 
invertebrates to re-enter the water, then be removed. 
 
* 
periodic thinning of wetland plants/aquatics is required every 5-7 years to original 
planting centres. Rejuvenate plants by discarding old roots and rhizomes. 
* 
* 
dredge ditches once 300mm of silt has accumulated. 
 
* 
periodic measurement of siltation will be carried out as part of the monitoring of the  
pond/ditch. The minimum desilting will be undertaken in order to promote good 
aquatic communities, whilst retaining the operational functions of ditches/rhynes. 
Marginal vegetation should be left untouched and the operation should be carried 
out from one bank only. 
* 
 
silt will be removed from the bed of the ditches over their entire length, but 'pockets' 
of silt will be retained in specified areas, where this would not restrict flow or 
compromise flood defence. Desilting will progress in an upstream direction to aid 
rapid recolonisation of the desilted and disturbed substrate. It is envisaged that 
desilting will take place on a 10-15 year rotation 
 
* 
desilting will be preceded by a water vole survey, to ensure compliance with the 
law. 
 
* 
Control of bankside vegetation and emergent and submerged weeds: 
* 
 
control of emergent and submerged weeds will follow the Environment Agency's 
best practice guidance set out in 'Aquatic Weed Control Operation' (1998). The 
frequency will depend upon the extent of weed growth found in-channel. However, 
it is envisaged that weed control from alternate sides will be carried out on a 3-5 
year rotation, in September/October. 
 
 
deposition of materials will follow the Environment Agency's best practice 
guidance set out in 'Disposal of Cut Vegetation' (1999). Submerged 
vegetation removed from the watercourse will be deposited on the top of 
the banks for a 48 hour period, to enable mobile aquatic species to return 
to the water. The material will be deposited away from any sensitive areas 
so, for example, the valuable plant communities are not smothered.

Delivery Mechanism 
Construction 
6.1.1 
Mitigation will be implemented in accordance with the contract of works with the 
Main Contractor, and is likely to include: the CEMP, compliance with pollution 
prevention best practice, installation of physical site boundary barriers, lighting 
scheme, preconstruction ecological surveys.  A Great Crested Newt and Reptile 
Method Statement may be required. 
6.1.2 
The mitigation will be implemented before and during construction and will be a 
DCO Requirement. Implementation of the CEMP and the other measures during 
construction will be the responsibility of the Main Contractor. 
Operation 
6.1.3 
During operation, two mitigation measures are proposed: a lighting scheme to 
reduce disturbance from operational lighting and a drainage design to avoid 
pollution of waterbodies. Both will provide for ongoing maintenance activities and 
will be implemented by the site staff operating on site at the time. Please note that 
should great crested newts be found, additional measures may be required during 
operation.  
Decommissioning 
6.1.4 
The implementation of a Decommissioning Environmental Management Plan  will  
be  completed  in accordance with  the  contract  of  works  by  the  Main Contractor.
