Introduction
We believe in doing the right thing
In this, our sixth Modern Slavery Statement ("Statement"), 
we outline the progress we’ve made in 2021 and our 
planned improvements for 2022. 
We’re making this Statement for the financial year ended 
December 2021 and according to the requirements of 
section 54, part 6, of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. 
This Statement applies to all companies within Drax 
Group (“Drax”) that are required to publish a Statement, as 
listed in the ‘Statement Approval’ section.
Please note that we acquired Pinnacle Renewable Energy 
Inc. (‘Pinnacle’) in 2021. We’ve detailed in this Statement 
the actions we’ve taken to date to integrate Pinnacle into 
our Supply Chain Human Rights programme. We'll also 
include information related to the enlarged business in 
the risk assessment graphics from 2022 onwards.

Organisational structure
Drax completes acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc.
Drax is the second largest sustainable biomass producer globally, and the UK’s 
largest source of renewable power by output. We are progressing options for 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
Pellet Production
Our pellets are manufactured 
from forestry and agricultural 
by-products and residues. They 
provide a sustainable, low carbon 
fuel source that can be safely and 
efficiently delivered through our 
global supply chain. The pellets 
are produced to best practice 
sustainability standards. Based 
in the US south and in Western 
Canada, we have 17 operational and 
development sites with nameplate 
capacity of around 5Mt once 
expansions are complete. 
We have US$4.5bn of long-term 
contracted sales to third parties 
across Asia and Europe. Our 
Generation business also uses 
these pellets to make flexible, 
renewable electricity for the UK. 
Generation
Our portfolio of flexible, low-carbon 
and renewable UK power assets 
– biomass, hydro and pumped 
storage generation – provides 
renewable, dispatchable power 
and system support services to the 
electricity grid. 
We are the UK’s largest source of 
renewable power by output, and 
Drax Power Station is the UK’s 
largest single source of renewable 
electricity by output. Our portfolio 
provides long-term earnings 
stability and opportunities to 
optimise returns from the transition 
to a low-carbon economy.
We are developing options for 
BECCS at Drax Power Station and 
exploring options for international 
new-build BECCS.
Customers
Our Customers business is 
principally focused on renewable 
electricity sales to industrial and 
corporate customers. 
The business also offers non-
generation system support and 
energy management services, in 
addition to providing a route to 
market for many smaller embedded 
renewable generators.

Our Modern Slavery Working 
Group (MSWG) is responsible 
for the development and 
delivery of our Supply Chain 
Human Rights programme. It 
reports quarterly on its activity 
to our Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee  (EBCC). 
Our EBCC, a sub-committee of our Executive 
Committee, oversees the programme. It 
provides an annual report on its decisions 
and activity to our Audit Committee, which 
comprises executive and non-executive 
directors.
Governance
“The MSWG continued 
its work to deliver Drax’s 
ongoing improvement 
programme, as reported 
throughout this statement”
The EBCC:
• Is responsible for making sure that Drax takes 
appropriate steps to investigate and remediate 
the risk of modern slavery, both within our own 
business and our supply chains
• Has approved a protocol and remediation plan, 
based on guidance from the Home Office, that 
we must follow if we discover modern slavery in 
our business or supply chains
No cases of modern slavery have been 
escalated to the EBCC to date. We continue to 
work with our colleagues and suppliers to raise 
awareness and promote transparency in our 
supply chains.
Progress in 2021:
• The Drax Code of Conduct (‘Drax Code’) and 
Supplier Code of Conduct (‘Supplier Code’) were 
subject to their first annual review and were 
approved by the EBCC in October 2021
– 
No significant changes were made  
to our Drax Code or Supplier Code.  
The main changes (to the Drax Code) 
related to integrating Pinnacle into  
our Group.
• The MSWG continued its work to deliver an 
ongoing improvement programme for Drax, 
as reported throughout this statement
• An existing EBCC member took on the 
responsibility to escalate any modern slavery 
issues relating to Pinnacle to the EBCC

1 We have over 5,000 suppliers across our procurement activities and engage with many different industries, including forestry, 
manufacturing, freight and logistics, engineering, construction, IT, and site services. 
Note: In light of the situation in Ukraine (March 2022), we ceased the supply of the small percentage of biomass we use from  
Russia and Belarus.
 
Progress in 2021:
• Completed an annual risk assessment of our 
Supply Chain Human Rights programme, in line 
with Home Office guidance, and reported to the 
EBCC
• Updated the Group-wide modern slavery risk 
register, which was – like the risk assessment – 
subject to review by the EBCC
• Issued modern slavery questions to appropriate 
suppliers and assessed responses, following up as 
required
• Progressed work to map the supply chain of our 
higher risk categories of non-fuel spend
• Continued to use our third-party system to enrich 
our risk assessment process
• Researched additional tools that could further 
strengthen our risk assessment process
• Progressed the implementation of our Supplier 
Code into our onboarding and contracting 
processes for new procurement agreements (at 
the point of renewal for existing agreements), 
moving to ‘business as usual’ across many 
departments
• Our Legal team reviewed and updated our 
contractual clauses relating to ethical topics, 
including modern slavery, for use in our UK and 
US procurement agreements
 
– We used these new clauses as a basis for 
developing similar clauses for use by Pinnacle
• Further strengthened our Country Risk 
Assessment process by engaging a third-party 
expert to provide feedback on our existing 
systems, controls, and workflows
Non-fuel procurement in  
the UK and US:
The following graphic provides statistics on our top 
10 non-fuel procurement activity, by percentage of 
spend and geography, on our Tier 1 supply. It shows 
more than 99% of our spend is with Tier 1 suppliers 
based in countries that are lower risk for modern 
slavery. The graphic will include information related 
to the enlarged business (including Pinnacle) from 
our 2022 report onwards. 
Risk  
assessment
We’re committed to identifying 
and addressing modern slavery 
that could be connected to both 
our business and supply chain.
Due to the controls and practices we’ve 
adopted (as described in the ‘Employment 
Practices’ section, on page 16), we believe the 
risk of modern slavery in our own business is 
very low. However, given the increasing variety 
and complexity of the third parties we engage 
with and jurisdictions they're in1, the risk of 
modern slavery is higher in our supply chain.
The Global Slavery Index, which is incorporated 
into our due diligence platform, continues to 
contribute to the risk assessment of potential 
suppliers. Where we identify higher risks during 
our due diligence process, we escalate and 
pursue enquiries more directly. In 2021, we 
engaged with a third-party expert to assess and 
verify our existing risk assessment approach 
and will incorporate their recommendations, as 
appropriate, over the course of 2022. 
Origin of fuel consumed at Drax 
Power Station in 2021
The following graphic provides detail on the 
origin of the fuels (by percentage) consumed 
at Drax Power Station in 2021, to meet our 
contractual commitments including our 
capacity market commitments. Of those 
countries listed, we consider Latvia, Estonia, 
Russia, and Belarus (tier 2) to be higher risk for 
modern slavery and carried out additional due 
diligence on these supply chains.
During 2021, our Procurement team, as part of 
their supplier relationship management regime, 
has continued to map our non-fuel supply chain. 
We've identified four areas of spend as ‘higher risk’: 
smart meters, electric vehicle charging, workwear 
(including personal protective equipment) and 
construction commodities. 
For these areas, we will progressively ensure that 
we more rigorously investigate the supply chains 
of our Tier 1 suppliers and continue to work more 
closely with the suppliers of these items, managing 
the relationships accordingly.
In the meantime, our policy is to carry out risk-
based due diligence on all suppliers before entering 
a contract with them. We also endeavour to include 
obligations within our supplier agreements for 
them to cascade our standards to sub-contractors.
We’ve also started to introduce our Supplier Code 
into our onboarding and contracting processes. 
Where necessary, we’ll employ the services of 
specialist audit firms to provide additional detail.

Due diligence
We’re committed to conducting 
business with honesty and 
integrity, and in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Country approval
The EBCC must approve higher risk countries 
before Drax can conduct business there. The 
EBCC can consider blanket country-wide 
or regional approvals, or specific contract 
approvals, depending on the consolidated 
commercial interest in that country and 
the level of risk identified with it and/or the 
associated supply chain. 
Supplier approval
We carry out proportionate due diligence 
checks on suppliers and, where appropriate, 
their associated persons and supply chain. 
Should we identify concerns during the 
process, we may obtain enhanced due 
diligence from a specialist service provider 
before escalation to the EBCC. 
The EBCC (or Executive Committee) will then 
decide whether to appoint the supplier or not.
Due diligence system
All our business units, both in the UK and 
North America, use the same due diligence 
platform to perform initial due diligence and to 
continually monitor suppliers. We escalate to 
the EBCC as necessary.
Modern slavery instances
In 2021, our due diligence processes identified 
no confirmed instances of modern slavery.
Progress in 2021:
• As part of our acquisition of Pinnacle we:
 
– Completed pre-acquisition due diligence on 
key vendor relationships
 
– Completed detailed due diligence on a 
Vietnamese supply chain, including direct 
engagement with the supplier. A third-party 
expert verified the due diligence and we’ve 
developed a workplan with the supplier that 
will form part of a supply chain visit in 2022 
(Covid-19 permitting)
 
– We also researched ‘in-country’ Non-
Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other 
partners to support Drax should an issue occur 
that requires us to put a remediation plan into 
action
 
– Reviewed the requirements of the Canada 
‘Integrity Declaration on Doing Business with 
Xinjiang Entities’ and sought declarations from 
relevant suppliers
 
–  Reviewed the requirements of the impending 
Canadian Modern Slavery Act, to position 
ourselves for compliance 
 
– Engaged with internal experts regarding an 
appropriate approach to due diligence for our 
inherited relationships with customers, First 
Nations, and joint ventures
• Developed and contracted new fuel sources 
more directly from suppliers, supported by 
enhanced investigation and diligence from a 
specialist due diligence service provider 
• Engaged directly with our suppliers that provide 
IT supplies from companies referenced in a 
report on Uyghur labour, to provide a briefing 
note for the EBCC
 
– Having reviewed the evidence to date, we 
cannot completely rule out any sub-tier links 
between the implicated manufacturing  
facilities and products used at Drax – although, 
the findings indicate there are no direct links to 
the facilities involved and no products used by 
Drax are affected
• Engaged with the Social Responsibility Alliance 
(SRA), to gain a better understanding of its 
Slavery and Trafficking Risk Template and carried 
out a gap analysis versus our own questionnaire 
• Engaged with UN Global Compact peers 
to benchmark our due diligence process in 
higher risk jurisdictions and sought to explore 
opportunities to collaborate and share contacts
• Continued to operate our due diligence 
processes throughout the Covid-19 pandemic 
to ensure we could investigate any employment 
practices of concern emerging because of 
Covid-19
• Explored additional due diligence tools/systems 
that may enhance our due diligence toolkit from 
a human rights perspective
• Commenced the implementation of the 
recommendations identified as part of the 
2020 Due Diligence review (referenced in the 
statement we published last year)
• Commenced a project to provide a geographical 
representation of our supply chains

We expect colleagues to work 
with our values in mind and 
to follow our documentation 
framework, which includes our 
codes, policies and procedures.
In Q3 2021, our Drax Code and Supplier Code 
were subject to annual review, approved (by the 
EBCC) and re-published. Our 2021 updates mainly 
related to integrating Pinnacle into our group. We 
provide online access to both documents at www.
drax.com and, using updated standard ‘business 
ethics’ clauses, incorporate them by reference 
into relevant agreements with third parties, as 
appropriate. These mandatory, principles-based 
documents form part of our Business Ethics 
Documentation Framework. They set out the 
values and behaviours we expect from our people 
and those with whom we conduct business. 
The Drax Code is supplemented by policies, 
procedures, and guidance that provide further 
information on the obligations applicable to 
Drax and how we ensure compliance with them. 
Modern slavery is specifically covered  
by our Human Rights policy, which was also made 
publicly available in 2021. In addition to those 
documents in the public domain, our written 
materials are all readily available to colleagues and 
non-permanent workers (resources not employed 
by Drax, engaged to provide a service or to fulfil a 
specific requirement) via our Group intranet.
Should circumstances arise which suggest 
that a worker or non-permanent worker may 
have failed to meet the standards expected by 
the business, Drax commits to fully investigate 
the matter, in line with the relevant terms of 
employment and disciplinary procedures or 
non-permanent worker agreements. 
Progress in 2021:
• Completed the annual review of our Drax Code 
and Supplier Code – with main updates (to the 
Drax Code) relating to the integration of Pinnacle 
into our group of companies 
• Progressed the implementation of our Supplier 
Code (for new agreements, or at the point of 
renewal for existing agreements, with many 
departments moving to ‘business as usual’)
• Continued a Group Policy Project to ensure our 
mandatory policies are up to date and published 
on a single platform – adding Pinnacle to the 
remit of the project
• Reviewed, updated, and made public our Human 
Rights policy
• Reviewed our Sustainability policy (which will 
be expanded to cover non-woody biomass 
procurement in 2022)

Employment 
practices
We do not tolerate any 
form of human trafficking, 
forced or bonded labour  
or the exploitation of 
children or vulnerable 
persons in our own 
business or our supply 
chains. We’re committed 
to tackling this crime.
We strive to be an inclusive workplace and 
value diversity, with policies and practices in 
place to encourage this. 
Our HR strategy centres around valuing 
people and focusing on talent, raising business 
performance, building capability through our 
people, and developing a high performing 
organisation. Our colleagues are at the heart 
of our success and are key enablers of our 
business strategy and our ethical, inclusive 
culture.
A safe and healthy workplace is paramount to 
our business and so our colleagues benefit from 
a range of policies that support them. These 
include policies designed to enable wellbeing 
and to accommodate different work and 
lifestyle preferences. We also have policies that 
encourage colleagues to raise grievances or 
concerns, to Speak Up, and to support a diverse, 
inclusive, and ethical workplace.
Drax is committed to maintaining high 
standards in its employment practices. A high 
proportion of our colleagues are on permanent 
contracts.
Although the risk of modern slavery taking 
place within our business is much lower than 
through our supply chain, our recruitment 
procedures nevertheless incorporate several 
steps designed to eliminate such risks. These 
include:
• 
Carrying out “right to work” checks and ensuring 
that the agencies we use to supply non-
permanent workers carry out equivalent checks
• 
Carrying out pre-employment checks to verify 
the identity of prospective colleagues and to 
ensure they are over 16 years of age
• 
Completing disclosure and barring service 
checks for specific roles to enable us to make 
safer recruitment decisions 
• 
Making sure that an employment contract 
is in place before the commencement of 
employment at Drax
• 
Paying all our UK-based colleagues at least the 
real Living Wage
• 
Ensuring our new colleagues read and attest to 
our Code of Conduct
• 
Providing information about our Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) policy, reporting channels and 
external service

We communicate with colleagues 
both formally and informally, including 
through emails, our intranet, a quarterly 
newsletter, and open forum meetings 
involving members of the senior 
leadership team.
We respect our colleagues’ rights in areas 
such as freedom of association and collective 
bargaining. Approximately 18% of the Drax 
workforce is covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement. In Canada, 5.4% of the workforce 
is covered by collective bargaining. Employee 
Forums are in place for those not covered 
by a collective bargaining agreement, 
enabling a two-way dialogue between the 
senior leadership team and colleagues. 
We maintain active relationships with our 
trade union partners and attend bi-monthly 
meetings to discuss potential issues that may 
affect members. We also undertake annual 
negotiations on pay.
We communicate with colleagues both  
formally and informally, including through 
emails, our intranet, a quarterly newsletter, 
and open forum meetings involving members 
of the senior leadership team. Each week, 
the CEO takes questions from across Drax 
on a wide range of topics and we share his 
responses with all colleagues. Each year, we 
invite all colleagues to complete a ‘My Voice’ 
engagement survey, share the results and take 
actions based upon them.
Progress in 2021:
• Reviewed our Group policies on ‘Dignity at Work’ 
and ‘Diversity and Inclusion’
• Reviewed our UK ‘Formal Flexible Working’ policy 
and ‘Informal Flexible Working Guidelines’
• Introduced modernised ‘Family Friendly’ policies 
in the UK
• Continued to ensure that all colleagues directly 
employed by Drax in the UK are paid at least the 
real Living Wage and ensured that Pontoon, our 
leading provider of non-permanent workers, also 
paid at least the real Living Wage
• ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ strategy reviewed 
and updated to incorporate the views of 
colleagues from our ‘My Voice’ engagement 
survey. In 2021, we captured an inclusion index 
for the first time in the survey, scoring six points 
ahead of the Energy and Utilities norm

Supplier contracts
In October 2020, our Board 
approved a new Supplier 
Code. This was subject to 
annual review in Q3 2021, 
with no necessary changes 
being identified. 
The Supplier Code has been well-received by 
our suppliers to date. It expects them to ensure 
that their own suppliers operate in line with the 
standards set out in the Code (where involved 
in activities on behalf of Drax). It also provides 
the details of the Speak Up service that Drax 
has for use by colleagues, non-permanent 
workers, and suppliers alike. Suppliers therefore 
have an anonymous route to report modern 
slavery or other concerns about the Drax supply 
chain (accessible in multiple languages).
Progress in 2021:
• Identified areas of spend that may be at high 
risk of modern slavery in their supply chains and 
established a procedure to continue to identify 
such areas
• Developed standard business ethics  
clauses (including in relation to modern slavery) 
to be used consistently across all our agreements 
• Progressed the implementation of our Supplier 
Code and standard business ethics clauses for 
new agreements or at the point of renewal for 
existing agreements (with many departments 
moving to ‘business as usual’)
• Commenced the development of a Supplier 
Code procedure that will guide colleagues if our 
Supplier Code or ethical clauses are challenged 
or rejected

Awareness  
and training 
In 2021, we provided 
Business Ethics training 
(including a dedicated 
section on modern slavery) 
to our senior leadership 
team, and deployed our 
first Code of Conduct 
refresher eLearning module 
to existing colleagues*. 
The latter aimed to remind colleagues of the 
principles set out in the Drax Code, our approach 
to ethical decision making, how to Speak Up 
and our zero tolerance approach to retaliation. 
We also issued several modern slavery related 
articles via our intranet.
We marked Anti-Slavery Day (18 October) with a 
communication encouraging colleagues to do 
something to:
• Raise their own awareness
• Raise the awareness of others 
• Support an organisation working on this 
important issue
The article provided useful links to Unseen UK’s 
website and collateral produced by Slave Free 
Alliance. 
We continued to issue the Drax Code to all new 
starters (including relevant non-permanent 
workers). This  includes an embedded video 
specifically about modern slavery and the 
telltale signs.
We arranged a dedicated ‘Ethical Trade’ 
training session for our teams considered ‘at 
higher risk’ of encountering modern slavery. 
An Ethical Trading Initiative affiliated trainer 
delivered the training.
We progressed an awareness raising campaign 
in collaboration with one of our logistics 
partners, AW Jenkinson. In addition to 
providing financial support to the UK’s Modern 
Slavery and Exploitation Helpline, we plan to 
promote the helpline on the back panel of 
six new vehicles ordered by AW Jenkinson 
for Drax deliveries (see images). We hope this 
will help raise awareness of the helpline and 
connect someone who may need to use it. 
We’re also planning a launch day to further 
raise awareness, and support the provision of 
training to AW Jenkinson’s drivers on how to 
spot modern slavery red flags.

We encourage all those 
connected with Drax 
to challenge unethical 
behaviour and promote a 
speak up culture. 
Within Drax, individuals can raise concerns 
directly via their line management, the 
Group Business Ethics team, or the Company 
Secretary (the Whistleblowing Officer for Drax). 
Alternatively, an independently-operated and 
confidential Speak Up helpline and web portal 
are available (in multiple languages). 
Third parties to Drax can also raise their 
concerns via the Group Business Ethics team, 
Whistleblowing Officer, or external Speak Up 
service. Details on how to do this are set out in 
our Supplier Code.
The external service enables reporters to 
anonymously raise concerns relating to Drax. 
The service forwards any issues raised to 
the Group Business Ethics team and/or the 
Whistleblowing Officer (in accordance with the 
reporter’s anonymity preference). The recipient 
will acknowledge, assess, and investigate as 
appropriate. The Group Business Ethics team/
Whistleblowing Officer reports any concerns 
raised, the status of any investigation and any 
recommended remediation measures to the 
“Speak up” 
culture 
EBCC, the Board, the Audit Committee and, 
where appropriate, the relevant authorities.
No concerns relating to modern slavery were 
raised through our reporting processes in 2021.
Progress in 2021:
• Strengthened our Speak Up programme by;
 
– Updating our Speak Up (whistleblowing) 
policy to incorporate our new Pinnacle 
colleagues 
 
– Deploying our Speak Up programme 
to our new Pinnacle colleagues, within 
a communication plan that includes 
reminders
 
– Scheduling reminders to colleagues in 
the UK and US on what Speak Up is (and 
is not), how to make a report, and how 
managers should handle a report 
 
– Continuing to report directly to the Board 
on Speak Up matters
 
– Focusing a significant proportion of our 
2021 Code of Conduct refresher eLearning 
module on Speak Up and non-retaliation
 
– Progressing a standardised approach to 
our investigation processes for Speak Up 
concerns
 
– Engaging external experts to support 
Speak Up investigations, as appropriate
 
– Benchmarking our Speak Up programme 
against the new EU Whistleblowing 
Directive and third-party benchmarking 
reports
• We strive for continuous improvement in 
our Speak Up arrangements. This includes 
progressing feedback from internal auditors, 
who most recently reviewed our Speak Up 
programme in 2021
• In the 2021 ‘My Voice’ engagement survey, 
86% of colleagues stated that they felt 
comfortable speaking up and/or to raise 
concerns within Drax, which is a 4% 
improvement on the prior year’s survey

We seek to work in 
partnership with others 
to strengthen our 
learning and approach.
Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP)
In 2013, Drax co-founded the Sustainable 
Biomass Program (SBP) with six other 
energy companies. SBP is an independent 
certification system designed for woody 
biomass, mostly in the form of wood pellets 
and wood chips, used in industrial, large-
scale energy production. SBP proactively 
encourages the adoption of standards and 
due diligence processes that include the 
promotion of human rights. For suppliers 
to be approved under the certification 
scheme, they must satisfy multiple 
requirements, including those relating 
to modern slavery due diligence. Further 
information on the Sustainable Biomass 
Program can be found on the SBP website.
UN Global Compact
Since 2018, we’ve participated in the 
United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) – a 
voluntary corporate sustainability initiative 
that encourages businesses worldwide to 
adopt sustainable and socially responsible 
practices. Further information on the UNGC 
can be found on its website. Our Annual 
Report for the financial year end 2021 forms 
our annual ‘communication on progress’. We 
report our progress against the Ten Principles 
(on human rights, labour, environment, and 
anti-corruption) and on actions to support 
the Sustainable Development Goals. We’re 
a member of the UNGC Modern Slavery 
Working Group. Our involvement enables us 
to collaborate with peers as we continually 
develop and enhance our approach to 
addressing the risks of modern slavery. 
Unseen UK
Unseen UK is a charity providing independent 
support for survivors of trafficking and modern 
slavery and runs the UK Modern Slavery 
and Exploitation Helpline. During 2021, we 
engaged with the charity on the development 
of a modern slavery awareness-raising 
initiative. We made a corporate donation to 
support the operation of the helpline, which 
provides free, independent, 24/7 information 
and advice to potential victims, businesses, the 
public and statutory agencies.

Stakeholder engagement
Like many businesses, we have a 
diverse group of stakeholders who are 
affected by our global activities. 
We maintain a detailed map of internal and 
external stakeholders, the concerns they’ve 
raised, and the date of the last meeting. This 
enables us to assess how the stakeholder 
landscape is developing, and to recognise 
and respond to the expectations of a wide 
range of stakeholders, ensuring we consider 
their interests in our decision-making.
