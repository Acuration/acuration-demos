Acoustic Screening
The screening solutions proposed have a profound effect on the overall appearance and 
visual impact of the plant not least in respect of the 4m high concrete wall. 
The proposed acoustic wall is being utilised for site security, being located on the alignment of the Power Plant security 
fence; it is 4m high compared to the proposed mesh fence which will be approx 3m high (though both will be likely to have 
barbed wire topping). The wall acts to screen the minor components of the plant, as well as vehicles and minor maintenance 
activities. The wall will not be seen from the South or the South West due to the landscaping which includes 20m deep 
wooded borders on site boundaries and even viewed directly from the runway the view of the wall will be partly screened 
and effectively broken up by the 5m deep borders on that edge; the wall acts as a screen and is, itself, screened. The wall 
may also utilise different colours in adjcacent panels to break up the uniform appearance, should this be required.
Acoustic Screening
You attributed the need for these measures to prescribed sound levels though you 
considered these levels to be based on a flawed calculation (repeated references were 
made to ‘double-counting’). If this is your belief it seems inconceivable that you would 
not challenge the levels prescribed. 
The proposed acoustic wall is a solution to the need to meet very challenging noise limits less than 1m from the site 
boundary; while, in retrospect this approach has proven to be flawed, these are the figures which we said we would meet 
and the use of the wall is a means of achieving these very low noise impacts while meeting other criteria such as security 
and screening. To challenge the noise levels now could take up to a year with no guarantee of success.
Acoustic Screening
Has such a challenge been made and if so, with what result? If you have not challenged, why 
not? 
No challenge has been made at this point as we are looking for a technical solution which is, a more dependable solution.
Acoustic Screening
As well as the adverse visual impact of the station surely the construction costs are 
increased?
The issue is not just cost related, but also one of fundamantal plant design; one significant source of noise is the air intake, 
but installing silencers could increase height or reduce output. The proposed wall is a cost effective solution that doesn't 
lead to increased height or reduced efficiency.
Project Plan
There is a clear wish from the community representatives to be provided with a project 
plan highlighting key events/dates – in particular key planning applications. This is a 
simple request which, if met, would greatly increase the ability of community 
representatives to understand and explain to their constituents how the project will 
progress.
We have published on the website a table which sets out the key dates of when it is proposed that the discharge 
of requirements submissions will be made. A further update will be made at Workshop 2.
Community Engagement
You appeared to be labelling our meeting as the ‘design group’ and talked about 
convening a community liaison group at a later stage. I think the general community 
view is to keep the same group for both purposes. The group could be expanded if 
necessary but would have the same core membership. This would assist continuity and 
understanding.
The Design Workshops are a process under Requirement 3 (Detailed Design) and the Community Liaison Group is 
a separate requirement stipulation under Requirement 11 (Construction Environmental Management Plan 
(CEMP)); Requirement 11 specifies that the CEMP should include '... the provision for setting up a Community 
Liaison Group'.  The outline CEMP which accompanied the DCO submission (dated December 2014) included the 
commitment to setting up a Community Liaison Group to include '... members of the local community and 
councils' and it is suggested that the Group '...invite a member of the British Horse Society to be one if their 
number'.  This is something that we are now working up within the CEMP that we will be using to discharge 
Requirement  11.  We see the CLG as having a reporting/ information sharing remit and we will complement its 
role by ensuring that the Panel meetings and Project Updates are reported on the PPL website and transmitted 
via other communication channels, should this be deemed efficient. We are proposing that the number of 
representatives is limited for each organisation so that the Group can operate effectively, and allows for fair 
participation and contribution by all members.

My personnel preference would be to keep the session as one group so that we can all hear and 
consider the views of everybody and build upon these rather than having the possibility of 
divergent views being brought back from individual groups.
Experience of other design workshops has taught us that splitting into smaller groups allows a for better sharing 
of comments/ideas/views. In addition following the group discussions there will be plenary session where the 
smaller groups will feedback their views to the wider Workshop, so that the whole workshop is aware of all the 
views.  In addition following the meeting we will invite members to make further comments within a set time 
period.

If you still wish to split into smaller groups this should be no more than 3 and ideally only 2, with 
sufficient time allowed for a combined wash up session.
The number of groups will only be driven by the ultimately number of participants at the workshop.

Key to the group discussions will be input from your and National Grid’s designers/landscape 
architects. Can you therefore aim to have sufficient design specialists available to be with each 
discussion group and just not circulating between the groups.
National Grid will have their landscape specilaist Tim Johns at the meeting. There will also be representatives from Drax, 
National Grid and it will be chaired by a third party.

It would be helpful to have conceptual drawings of the infrastructure available with local 
reference features included so that individuals can gain some sense of scale while discussing the 
options, e.g. the adjacent power station stack, Roy Humphrey warehouses etc.
Visualisations on the structures "on location" will be provided. An ariel shot will be added to National Grids slide deck.

It would be extremely helpful if the Design Principle Statement document could be circulated 
around the group prior to next Monday as some attending may not have seen this key document 
before.
We have already addressed this matter in our communication with the group.

Progress Power’s previous designers were keen and put forward a very strong argument for the 
use of recessive colours on some of the more dominant structures, particular the stack, to reflect 
the various backgrounds they will be seen against - ranging from the darker landscape to the 
lighter skyscape. 
This will be achieved with the colour scheme we are proposing on both the inner structures and the wall itself. 
National Grid's presentation for the Substation will consider colours.

The acoustic wall is a new introduction to the power plant post DCO approval and being of a 
significant height and extent will need careful consideration to its detrimental visual impact both 
long term but more importantly in the short term.
We do not consider the impact of the proposed wall to be detrimental for the reasons mentioned in point under 
"acoustic screening" above. However, we will also be proposing an option on the wall to match the surrounding 
foliage and we will be producing a cross section to show the relationship between perimeter fence, ground levels, 
landscaping and acoustic wall for Workshop 1.

The ECC needs to be most sensitively considered in respect to the introduction of a significant 
structure in a very prominent and open setting. Therefore, as far as it can, it must be made to 
appear to sit comfortably within these constraints by taking every effort to reduce the extent of 
any large flat elevations/facades appearing to protrude out of the landscape. Key will be splitting 
up of the elements into more interesting shapes so that it appears less industrial, allowing 
elements (some of which may need to be false) to break up any significant flat facades and 
creating their own ‘shadows’ and changes in appearance of the structure as light and viewpoints 
change. 
This is within the design principles that National Grid will be using to develop the substation.

Cladding should be vertical and include strong detail features to further assist with breaking up 
of any flat elevations and the potential of them visually merging as one elevation. 
National Grid will be presenting information on cladding and colours at the design workshop.

The finish and treatment of the cladding and roofing must prevent unnecessary reflection and 
glare across the open countryside.
This is within the design principles that National Grid will be using to develop the substation.
1st Design  Workshop aspects 
to cover
At the ECC structures with low flat roofing profiles should avoided to prevent the appearance of 
what could be perceived as industrial modular buildings, therefore more steeply pitched roof 
lines should be preferred.
A number of options for roof pitch/type will be illustrated. A steeper pitch will increase the overall height of structure.
Community Engagement
I believe some of the attendees at the last meeting were taken back by the inference that the 
purpose of these meetings was only to consider the plant’s visual appearance. Those attending 
are the local community and do have a wider interest in making this project happen in the most 
acceptable way for all concerned and this grouping may well form part of the later ‘Community 
Liaison Group’ that meets post construction. I don’t see any reason why Progress Power should 
not use this group as the start of the wider liaison group.
The DCO clearly differentiates between the Design Workshops and the CLG (as explained above), therefore this is 
why they are being kept separate.  Mechanisms to communicate with the local community are therefore being 
set out within the CEMP in line with Requirement 11.
