The economic impact of Drax Power Station in the UK
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Drax Power Station plays a key role in the British energy 
market. Located in Selby, North Yorkshire, it provides 6% of 
the UK’s electricity and is responsible for 11% of the country’s 
renewable power. 
This impact assessment, commissioned by Drax Group, 
evaluates the total contribution of Drax Power Station to the UK 
economy, the UK’s 12 constituent nations and regions, and Selby 
and Ainsty parliamentary constituency. 
The assessment considers Drax Power Station’s own operations, 
the economic activity supported by its procurement spending, 
and its payments to employees.1 These impacts are quantified 
through three key metrics: contribution to gross domestic 
product (GDP), jobs sustained, and tax revenues stimulated. 
Drax Power Station has a significant economic footprint across 
the UK economy. 
Drax Power Station supports a sizeable contribution to UK GDP. 
We estimate Drax Power Station supported a total contribution 
to UK GDP of £735 million in 2021. Nearly half of this total, £349 
million, was generated by Drax Power Station itself—its direct 
impact. A further £199 million contribution to UK GDP was 
supported by its sizeable spending with suppliers—its indirect 
impact. The remaining £187 million contribution to UK GDP was 
supported by the payment of wages associated with operating 
Drax Power Station, and the firms in its supply chain—its 
induced impact.
Across the UK, Drax Power Station sustained an estimated 
total of 7,130 jobs. On top of Drax Power Station’s own 1,074 
employees, its procurement spending supported a further 
3,440 jobs along its UK supply chain. The wage-induced 
spending attributable to Drax Power Station sustained the 
remaining 2,620 UK jobs.
1 For this assessment, the activities of Drax Power Station are defined as those undertaken 
by Drax Power Limited and Drax Corporate Limited.

The economic impact of Drax Power Station in the UK
The activity and employment supported by Drax Power Station 
stimulated significant tax revenues for the UK Exchequer. Drax 
Power Station raised an estimated £154 million in tax revenues 
in 2021, comprising the tax paid by Drax Power Station and its 
employees (£51 million), along with those stimulated along its 
supply chain (£49 million) and by the wage induced spending it 
sustains (£53 million).
The economic activity supported by Drax Power Station is 
spread across the UK but greatest in the Yorkshire and The 
Humber region. 
Drax Power Station supported a total contribution to GDP 
of £358 million in the Yorkshire and The Humber region in 
2021. This primarily comprised Drax Power Station’s direct 
contribution to GDP of £261 million. But through its procurement 
spending, it supported a further £35 million contribution to 
GDP in the region, along with a £62 million contribution to GDP 
sustained through the wage-financed spending of the Drax 
Power Station employees.
A total of 2,580 jobs were supported by Drax Power Station 
in the Yorkshire and The Humber region in 2021. As well as 
the 904 direct employees working in the region, Drax Power 
Station’s procurement spending supported a further 640 jobs, 
with the remaining 1,040 jobs supported by wage-financed 
spending in the region’s consumer economy which is attributed 
to the power station.
Drax Power Station supports economic activity in the Selby and 
Ainsty parliamentary constituency. In Selby and Ainsty, Drax 
Power Station supported a £278 million contribution to GDP 
in 2021. This was equivalent to 12% of Selby and Ainsty’s total 
economy in that year, and comprised mostly the activities of the 
power station itself, supporting a £261 million direct contribution 
to GDP. It is also estimated to have supported a total of 1,190 
jobs in Selby and Ainsty—equivalent to one in every 40 jobs 
located in the area.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT 
OF DRAX POWER STATION 
IN THE UK
1. THE IMPACT OF DRAX POWER STATION ON THE UK ECONOMY
2 This number is taken as the average headcount of ‘Drax Employees’ throughout the year 2021. 
Drax Power Station supports 
a significant contribution to 
the UK economy. Through 
its own operations, it directly 
contributed £349 million to UK 
GDP. This direct contribution 
to GDP is calculated using the 
so-called income approach to 
national accounting as the sum 
of the gross profits earned by 
Drax Power Station and the 
employee compensation it paid.
But beyond its own 
operations, Drax Power 
Station also has a sizeable 
supply chain, spending more 
than £200 million with UK 
suppliers. Its purchases 
of goods and services 
from other UK businesses 
stimulates further economic 
activity across the economy. 
In 2021, we estimate Drax 
Power Station’s procurement 
spending supported a further 
£199 million to UK GDP, known 
as its indirect impact. 
In addition, the wage-financed 
spending of those employed by 
Drax Power Station, as well as 
those employed along its supply 
chain, stimulated further activity 
in the consumer economy. We 
estimate this wage-financed 
spending attributable to Drax 
Power Station supported 
an additional £187 million 
contribution to UK GDP, known 
as its induced impact.
Drax Power Station’s total 
economic footprint in 
the UK is the sum of the 
aforementioned direct, 
indirect, and induced impacts. 
By combining these channels 
of impact, we estimate that 
Drax Power Station supported 
a £735 million contribution to 
UK GDP in 2021.
Drax Power Station supports 
employment across the 
country. Some 1,074 people 
were directly employed by 
Drax Power Station. Most of 
these jobs (901 employees) 
were located in Selby at the 
power station itself, with 
some other roles supporting 
the operation of Drax Power 
Station from London (93 
employees) and elsewhere.2

The economic impact of Drax Power Station in the UK
Its spending with suppliers 
supported a further 3,440 jobs 
along its UK supply chain, with 
another 2,620 jobs sustained 
in the consumer economy by 
the wage-induced spending 
it supports. We therefore 
estimate Drax Power Station 
supported a total of 7,130 jobs 
in the UK in 2021.
Drax Power Station also 
stimulated a contribution 
of tax revenues to the UK 
Exchequer. Drax Power 
Station and its employees paid 
£51 million in taxes to the UK 
authorities in 2021, comprising 
£23 million in corporation tax 
and an estimated £29 million 
in labour taxes. Through its 
procurement spending, Drax 
Power Station stimulated 
a further £49 million in tax 
payments along its UK supply 
chain—the majority of which 
was labour taxes (£36 million). 
Lastly, the wage-induced 
spending attributable to Drax 
Power Station sustained an 
additional £53 million in taxes 
revenues. This sums to an 
estimated total of £154 million 
in tax revenues paid to the UK 
Exchequer in 2021, attributable 
to Drax Power Station.
 
 
2. THE IMPACT OF DRAX POWER STATION ACROSS THE UK’S REGIONS
The impact of Drax Power 
Station is realised across 
the UK’s constituent nations 
and regions. The power 
station supported its largest 
economic footprint in the 
Yorkshire and The Humber 
region where it is located. 
But owing to its procurement 
spending with suppliers across 
the UK, and the spending 
of its employees and those 
employed in its supply chain in 
the UK’s consumer economy, 
the economic impact of 
Drax Power Station also 
reverberates across the rest of 
the UK’s nations and regions.
The majority of Drax Power 
Station’s direct contribution 
to GDP was generated at its 
site in the Yorkshire and The 
Humber, at £261 million. Its 
remaining contribution to 
GDP was spread among the 
small number of other sites in 
other regions where support 
functions are located. 
Drax Power Station’s £214 
million procurement spending 
in 2021 is spread across all 
12 nations and regions of the 
UK. Drax Power Station spent 
the most with suppliers in 
the South East region (23% 
of the total), followed by the 
Yorkshire and The Humber 
(19% of the total) with suppliers 
local to the site. Through 
this spending, Drax Power 
Station generated a £41 million 
indirect contribution to GDP 
in the South East, and a £35 
million contribution to GDP 
in the Yorkshire and The 
Humber. Drax Power Station 
also had a notable impact in 
London, where its spend (also 
19% of the total), mostly in 
the financial services sector, 
generated a £36 million indirect 
contribution to regional GDP. 
With the largest share of its 
employees residing in Yorkshire 
and The Humber, Drax Power 
Station supported a significant 
contribution to GDP through 
the spending it supports in the 
region’s consumer economy 
through the wages it pays. This 
spending supported a further 
£62 million contribution to GDP 
in Yorkshire and The Humber in 
2021. A further £24 million was 
contributed to GDP in London, 
as well as £23 million in the 
South East, which is more 
reflective of the wage-induced 
spending supported along Drax 
Power Station’s supply chain.

The economic impact of Drax Power Station in the UK
 
Overall, Drax Power Station’s 
greatest economic footprint 
was in Yorkshire and The 
Humber, where it made a total 
contribution of £358 million in 
2021. This primarily comprised 
Drax Power Station’s direct 
contribution to GDP, sustained 
at the site itself (73% of this 
total), but supported by its 
indirect, supply chain impact 
(10%), and the impact of 
wage-induced spending in the 
region’s consumer economy, 
which accounted for the 
remaining 17%.
Of the 1,074 people directly 
employed to operate and 
support Drax Power Station in 
2021, the vast majority (904 
workers) were based in the 
Yorkshire and The Humber 
region. There were a number 
of other roles across the UK 
supporting its operation, 
with a further 158 roles based 
across the rest of England, 
including 93 in London and 34 
in the East Midlands, 10 jobs in 
Scotland, and two in Wales.
In 2021, an estimated 3,440 
jobs were sustained along 
Drax Power Station’s supply 
chain in the UK. Reflecting the 
pattern of its spending, 690 
jobs were indirectly supported 
in the South East, and 640 jobs 
in Yorkshire and The Humber. 
An additional 430 jobs were 
supported in London, and 390 
jobs in the North East.
Wage-financed spending in the 
consumer economy supported 
an additional 1,040 jobs in 
Yorkshire and The Humber in 
2021. This was followed by the 
South East, where 300 wage-
induced jobs were supported, 
London (200 jobs), and the 
North East (180 jobs). 
Drax Power Station supported 
2,580 jobs in the Yorkshire and 
The Humber in 2021. These 
jobs were distributed between 
Drax Power Station’s own 
employees (35% of the total), 
the jobs supported along Drax 
Power Station’s supply chain in 
the region (25% of the total), 
and jobs supported in the 
consumer economy by wage-
funded spending attributable 
to Drax Power Station (the 
remaining 40%). Drax Power 
Station also supported a total 
of 1,000 jobs in the South East, 
720 jobs in London, and 570 
jobs in the North East.

The economic impact of Drax Power Station in the UK
3. THE IMPACT OF DRAX POWER STATION IN SELBY AND AINSTY 
3 Estimates for the number of jobs supported are rounded to the nearest five. Constituency totals may not sum due to rounding.
Drax Power Station is located 
in the Selby and Ainsty 
parliamentary constituency, and 
plays an important role in this 
local economy. In 2021, Drax 
Power Station contributed a 
total of £278 million to GDP in 
Selby and Ainsty (Fig. 3). This 
was equivalent to 12% of Selby 
and Ainsty’s total economy in 
that year. It is also estimated to 
have supported a total of 1,190 
jobs in the constituency (Fig. 
4), which is equivalent to one in 
every 40 of all the jobs there.
The activities of the power 
station itself supported a £261 
million contribution to GDP, 
with 901 direct workers based 
at the site. The constituency 
received 0.6% of Drax Power 
Station’s procurement 
spending, which supported a 
£1.1 million indirect contribution 
to GDP and 20 indirect jobs 
with suppliers. But a significant 
21% of its compensation of 
employees was paid to workers 
residing in the constituency.3 
The wage-induced spending 
of these employees in the 
constituency is estimated to 
have supported an additional 
£16.2 million contribution to 
GDP, and a further 270 jobs 
in the consumer economy, in 
2021. The induced impact being 
high in the locality is reflective 
of the Drax Power Station 
workers living—and therefore 
spending their wages—close 
to their workplace, while 
procurement spending is more 
distributed across the region 
and nation more broadly.

METHODOLOGY
To estimate the direct economic 
impact of Drax Power Station, 
Oxford Economics utilised 
the information provided by 
Drax in 2021 that was used 
in its previous economic 
impact report on Drax Group’s 
operations in the UK, U.S., and 
Canada. This data included 
detailed information on 
employment, spending, and 
costs incurred through the 
activities of Drax Power Station, 
as well as its sources of income 
and cash flows. We used its 
gross profits (measured as 
EBITDA) and compensation 
of employees to measure the 
gross value added contribution 
of Drax Power Station to gross 
domestic product (GDP). In 
this case, the activities of Drax 
Power Station are defined 
as those undertaken by Drax 
Power Limited and Drax 
Corporate Limited.  
Oxford Economics put 
together a detailed model 
of the UK economy, initially 
comprising 105 industries 
in each of the 12 standard 
statistical regions. The 105 
industries are those found 
in the most detailed version 
of the ONS set of UK input-
output (I-O) tables. A domestic 
input-output table gives a 
snapshot of an economy at a 
given point in time. The model 
shows the major spending 
flows from “final demand” 
(i.e., consumer spending, 
government spending, 
investment, and exports to the 
rest of the world); intermediate 
spending patterns (i.e., what 
each sector buys from every 
other sector—the supply chain 
in other words); how much of 
that spending stays within the 
domestic/provincial economy; 
and the distribution of income 
between employment income 
and other income (mainly 
profits). In essence, an input-
output table shows who 
buys what from whom in 
the economy. 
To estimate Drax Power 
Station’s indirect impact in 
the UK’s constituent nations 
and regions, we fed in the 
company’s data on the amount 
spent and type of goods and 
services purchased from its 
suppliers. To capture any 
“feedback effects” arising from 
any of Drax Power Station’s 
international procurement, 
we used Oxford Economics’ 
Global Sustainability Model 
to model trade flows across 
industries and how this feeds 
back to industries in the UK 
further along the supply 
chain. In order to calculate the 
induced impact, we input the 
information on compensation 
it pays to workers, as provided 
by Drax, which is distributed 
throughout the consumer 
economy using the I-O tables.
Constituency results are derived 
from a model built by Oxford 
Economics using information 
from the ONS Business 
Register and Employment 
Survey (BRES) to map the 
location share of industry and 
region for each Parliamentary 
Constituency. We input 
information on Drax Power 
Station’s procurement spending 
and wage payments (for 
employees’ home postcodes to 
reflect where the wages will be 
spent) to measure the indirect 
and induced impacts at this 
local level.
