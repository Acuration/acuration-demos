Executive Summary 
Drax Group plc is large energy company headquartered in the UK that generates increasingly 
decarbonized energy in the UK.  Drax’s portfolio of energy generation facilities include biomass, 
power production, and Drax both produces its own pellets and purchases pellets from other 
producers.  Drax is committed to a zero-carbon future and aims to become carbon-negative 
itself by 2030.  With this in mind, Drax wishes to ensure that the fibre procurement for the 
pellets it uses is not having a detrimental effect on forests, how they are managed, and on 
other aspects of the forest industry.  This includes an interest in ensuring that fibre 
procurement contributes to its overall goal of becoming carbon negative. 
Drax commissioned this study to provide evidence on how it is meeting its forest commitments 
related to fibre procurement by two of its supplier pellet plants, located in the Interior region of 
British Columbia (BC).  The two mills, both owned by Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc, are 
located 80 km apart in the towns of Houston and Burns Lake.  The catchment areas of the two 
mills, which are the areas where their fibre originates, overlap considerably and so this analysis 
evaluates the impacts of fibre procurement on the combined catchment area for both mills. 
The historical development of the forest landscape in this catchment area is one of primary 
forest that has been subject to repeated natural cycles of disturbance by fire and insect pests, 
followed by natural regeneration. The forest species are predominantly coniferous, with 
extensive areas of fire-origin stands of pure pine, and spruce and fir stands in higher elevation 
areas.  Mixed stands are most common in the ecological transition zones. The harsh climate, 
particularly cold winters, results in relatively slow growth rates, with natural-origin stands 
requiring between 80 to 120 years to reach maturity. 
While Indigenous people used fire to modify the forest, the extent of the impact of their 
activities is unknown. Europeans began to arrive in the catchment area in the mid-late 19-th 
century as prospectors and farmers, and commercial timber harvesting did not begin until 
1912-13 when the first railway was built through the region. As in most other parts of the 
world, early harvesting tended towards exploitation of the resource for the highest value 
timber with little thought to long term sustainability.  Sawmills and early processing industries 
developed in the 1930’sbut it was not until the 1960’s that forest management became more 
professional.   
In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was an increased global awareness of sustainability 
issues and the need for more sustainable and multiple benefit forest management (considering 
ecological and social impacts as well as economic). In particular, there were globally significant 
conflicts between environmentalists and the forest industry over forestry activities in the 
coastal old growth forests of BC. In 1995, the provincial government brought in a very closely

regulated system known as the Forest Practices Code and embarked on a Protected Areas 
Strategy that aimed to double the amount of protected area in the province.  The Forest 
Practices Code has since evolved into a results-based system, where the objectives are set out 
in forest management plans and it is up to industry foresters to determine how to best achieve 
them. In addition, management approaches began to include voluntary third-party certification 
schemes such as the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC). These schemes aim to ensure that forest management is sustainable and continually 
improving.  It is estimated that between 80-90% of the forest in the catchment area is certified 
under SFI and some under FSC. 
Ninety-six percent of the land in the catchment area is provincially owned Crown land.  These 
are public lands whose use is regulated by the provincial government, and the timber on these 
lands is a public resource regulated by government.  The BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural 
Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD) is responsible for forestry and 
administers forest tenure, licensing, sets stumpage rates and enacts regulations regarding 
overall stewardship of the forests.  The forest industry is responsible for preparing forest 
management plans, which must be approved by FLNRORD, and undertaking operations in a 
manner that is consistent with the forest plans and regulations.  Renewal of harvested areas is 
an industry requirement, and managers must also meet provincial objectives regarding species 
at risk, maintenance of productive capacity, water quality and biodiversity.  In this regime, the 
only deforestation that occurs caused by forestry is associated with road-building – the 
estimated amount in the catchment area is about 50 ha/year.  Total deforestation is estimated 
at 300 ha/year, with conversion to agriculture as the biggest factor. 
The forest industry of the catchment area is dominated by softwood sawmill that manufacture 
dimension lumber from conifer trees.  Other users of forest fibre include “cant” mills, other 
specialty mills, as well as the pellet plants that use the lower grades of conifer fibre.  Residual 
chips from sawmilling are transported to the nearest pulp mills in Prince George.  There is 
almost no hardwood harvested in the catchment area; hardwood accounts for 0.17% of the 
harvest volume and may also be used by the pulp mills or an OSB manufacturer (the closest one 
is seven hours one way). 
This study covers the period from 2000 to 2019, which spans the length of time that the pellet 
mills have been in operation.  This period also covers the outbreak of mountain pine beetle 
(MPB) which killed hundreds of millions of cubic metres of lodgepole pine throughout the 
province.  Prior the infestation, the forests of the catchment area had some of the highest 
proportions of lodgepole pine in the province and they were correspondingly one the most 
heavily impacted areas.  In response, the government and industry combined to launch a 
massive salvage effort to use as much of the dead timber as possible.  This completely altered 
the composition of the timber harvest.  Prior to the salvage, the harvest consisted of live pine

and spruce but from 2002 or 2003 onwards, dead pine became a major part of the harvest 
stream and averaged 55% during the 2010-2019 period.  As time passed, the dead timber 
deteriorated so that it became unusable by sawmills in 2019, and almost 20 sawmills have 
closed in the northern and central parts of BC as a result of the drop in timber supply (including 
one which closed in the catchment area in 2020). 
Inventory data shows that during the study period, most of the mature lodgepole pine was 
killed by the MPB, which made the forest younger and increased the predominance of spruce 
and Abies fir, the two other principle commercial species.  Allowable harvest levels have been 
declining since 2015 and are poised to fall further. 
During the 2015-2019 period, for which the pellet mills were able to provide accurate data on 
their fibre intake, the harvest in the catchment area was 46.1 million m3.  Of this, 24.5 million 
m3 (53%) was dead pine and the remainder a mixture of live spruce and Abies fir.  During this 
same period, the two Pinnacle mills used the equivalent of about 7.5 million m3, representing 
16.3% of the fibre harvested.  However, much of this fibre was sawmill residual; Pinnacle’s use 
of roundwood was equivalent to about 1.6 million m3 or 3.5% of the total harvest.  Given this 
low level of roundwood consumption, and Pinnacle’s use of low-grade fibre, Pinnacle’s wood 
use has not affected harvesting levels in the catchment area.  
Furthermore, given the structure of the industry and the large amount of residual and low-
grade fibre, Pinnacle does not need to compete with other mills for fibre.  The consultants were 
informed that Pinnacle pays the lowest prices for the lowest quality of fibre, which in the 
absence of the pellet plants, would be either left in the forest, burned at the forest landing, or 
otherwise disposed of by the sawmills.

A summary of this report’s key findings is provided in the tables below:  
Is there any evidence that 
bioenergy demand has 
caused the following? 
 
Analysis Findings 
Deforestation? 
Deforestation data were unavailable specifically for the catchment area 
however the federal government tracks it by ecozone as part of its 
national Greenhouse Gas Inventory reporting requirements. 
The catchment area is in the Montane Cordillera ecozone and the 
Canadian Forest Service reports that between 1980 and 2017, the area 
of forest in the ecozone declined from 31,181,000 ha to 31,094,000 ha, 
a decline of 87,000 ha or 0.28 % of the forest area.  Deforestation in the 
catchment area was estimated at 300 ha/year.  Most deforestation in 
the ecozone occurred because of conversion to agriculture; mining, 
forestry and urban expansion were also contributing factors. The 
ownerships on which the deforestation occurred were not specified, 
however the majority of the conversion to agriculture and urban 
expansion would have occurred on private land. Forest road 
construction was estimated to have led to the loss of 50 ha of forest per 
year in the catchment area. 
Pinnacle has relied on sawmill residual fibre for 75-95% of its furnish up 
until 2019. The balance of its furnish comes from other low-grade wood 
and logging slash.  Bioenergy does not contribute to deforestation 
because Pinnacle’s demand for pellet feedstock does not drive any 
harvest activity.  
A change in management 
practices (e.g. rotation 
lengths, renewal, species 
change in forest)? 
The mountain pine beetle infestation has been the primary influence on 
forest management practices, including a significant increase in 
harvesting to salvage dead timber.  This was supported by government 
significantly increasing the allowable cut within the catchment area and 
elsewhere where the infestation occurred.  Between 2000 and 2019, 
deadwood made up a major part of the harvest, from as much as 90-
95% during the 2004-08 period and declining to approximately 48% by 
2019.  
The abundance of salvage material and its use in sawmills increased the 
supply of fibre available to the pellet mills; they benefited from these 
circumstances but did not drive them.  Pinnacle’s use of fibre has not 
influenced forest management practices, other than to reduce the 
extent of roadside slash burning, because some roadside slash is ground 
and used as feedstock for pellet production.

Is there any evidence that 
bioenergy demand has 
caused the following? 
 
Analysis Findings 
Diversion of wood fibre from 
other uses or markets? 
Pellet manufacturers use the lowest-quality fibre in the market. During 
the study period, there was a sufficient quantity of this low-grade 
material produced as a by-product from sawmilling that consumption 
by pellet mills did not divert wood fibre from other uses or markets.  In 
the hierarchy of wood grades, Pinnacle uses the lowest quality timber 
which also fetches the lowest price; contractors would not sell higher 
quality wood to Pinnacle when they can get a better price elsewhere. 
The supply of residual material from sawmills and other timber 
manufacturing has fallen in recent years as the overall rate of timber 
harvest has fallen. However, that shortfall is largely being taken up by 
recovery of fibre from slash and debris left in the forest that would 
other be burned. That recovery is achieved by hauling tree fragments 
into the plants for grinding on site or grinding in the forest and hauling 
that material directly to the plants. 
While some chips produced by the sawmills and cant mills are shipped 
to the pulp mills in Prince George, these mills are not major suppliers of 
pulp chips because the higher transport cost to Prince George 
outweighs the price premium paid by the pulp mills. The many large 
sawmills in Prince George are the primary suppliers of the pulp mills 
there and mills in Houston and Burns Lake are marginal suppliers at 
best.  Pinnacle uses the remainder of the waste from the cant mills. In 
the absence of the pellet mills, the fibre they use would have been 
burned or landfilled. 
An abnormal increase in wood 
prices? 
Pellet manufacturers have not influenced timber prices in the 
catchment area because they do not compete with other users for low-
grade fibre – they use only low-quality fibre that other users will not 
take.  Timber prices in the catchment area have been most strongly 
influenced by lumber prices (which are influenced by US housing starts), 
the US:Canada exchange rate, and general economic conditions. 
A reduction in the volume of 
timber in the forest? 
The amount of growing stock in the forest has declined significantly 
from 2000 to 2020 primarily due to the mortality caused by the MPB. 
Within the catchment area, the MPB killed an estimated 157 million m3 
between 1999 and 2014, representing 42% of the estimated 377 million 
m3 of timber in the catchment area in 1999.  In addition, severe 
wildfires in 2018 burned an estimated 7.1 million m3. 
The use of fibre by Pinnacle has meant that more of the timber that was

Analysis Findings 
harvested has been used, but it did not create any additional harvest 
activity. Pinnacle’s demand for low-grade timber has meant that in 
some harvest blocks, more dead timber is removed than would 
otherwise be the case.  However, provincial government regulations 
require minimum amounts of residual live and dead timber to be left on 
site, and these requirements continue to be met and exceeded on 
many blocks.  In conclusion, the demand for fibre from Pinnacle has not 
impacted the volume of live timber left in a block or compromised the 
site’s productivity. 
A reduction in the rate of 
carbon sequestration? 
There has been very little deforestation during the analysis period and 
harvest operations are monitored to ensure that site damage is 
minimized.  Accordingly, the productive capacity of the land, and the 
long-term capacity of the forest to sequester carbon, has not changed.  
The major change in the catchment area affecting long-term 
sequestration capacity is that more land has been set aside for 
environmental and other reasons, so those areas will continue to store 
carbon until there is a natural disturbance of some kind.  In the short- 
and medium-term, the mortality of the mature pine has created a 
younger forest which will have a more rapid growth rate owing to both 
its age and the impact of forest management (planting and spacing) and 
the use of improved seed.  As a result, the short- and medium-term 
potential of the forest to sequester carbon has increased during the 
analysis period, and the long-term capacity has not changed. 
An increase in harvesting 
above the sustainable yield 
capacity of the forest? 
During the analysis period, the timber harvest exceeded the sustainable 
yield capacity of the forest.  This occurred as the harvest was increased 
in an effort to salvage as much timber killed by the MPB as possible 
before it deteriorated and became unusable.  This was a policy decision 
by the provincial government to deal with an extraordinary situation. 
However, the harvest during the analysis period contained high levels 
of dead wood, ranging from well above 90% between 2004 and 2008 
and trending down to 48% in 2019.  Historical growth figures are 
difficult to ascertain, as is the amount of dead and live wood harvested; 
accordingly it is difficult to compare with confidence the harvest of live 
timber with growth during the analysis period. The 2020 growth rate is 
estimated at 3.45 million m3/yr.  Given that almost no live wood was 
cut between 2004 and 2008 and roughly half of the 2010-2019 harvest 
(i.e. approx 5.0 million m3/year) was live wood, it is reasonable to

Analysis Findings 
surmise that the harvest of live wood was close to the amount of 
growth between 2004 and 2019. 
Notably, Pinnacle’s fibre procurement does not drive forest harvesting 
so that the operations of the pellet mills have had no impact on 
harvesting levels.

Impact of bioenergy 
demand on: 
Analysis Findings 
Volume of timber in the 
forest 
Neutral. The volume of growing stock in the forest has declined significantly 
during the review period due primarily to the MPB, and secondarily due to 
extensive forest fires in 2018 and spruce bark beetle infestations.  Bioenergy 
demand has meant that the timber which has been harvested is used more 
fully, but it has not led to an increase in overall harvest or increased the amount 
of live timber removed from a given harvest block. 
Timber growth rates 
Neutral.  Timber growth rates have declined due to the natural disturbance 
factors cited above, however the large area of regenerating forest will cause 
the total amount of growth in the catchment area to increase over the next 20 
years.  The use of fibre for pellet production has not impacted how harvests are 
conducted but somewhat more dead and low-grade timber is removed from 
each timber block than would be the case in the absence of demand for fibre 
from pellet mills. This happens more frequently on blocks closer to the plants 
than those which are distant and have higher haul costs associated with them. 
In other words, utilization has improved due to the demand for fibre for pellets. 
However, because there is so much dead and low-grade fibre in the blocks 
being harvested, the additional amount that is used for pellet production does 
not reduce the productivity of the sites.  Provincial government regulations 
require minimum amounts of residual live and dead timber to be left on site, 
and these requirements continue to be met and exceeded on many blocks.  
An additional change brought about by the demand from the Pinnacle mills is 
that on some blocks, slash that has been brought to the landing is being ground 
and brought to Pinnacle. However, in the absence of the pellet producer’s 
demand, this would have either been burned or piled and left to decay.  In 
conclusion, fibre procurement for pellet production has had no impact on 
forest growth rates. 
Forest area 
Neutral.  The use of fibre for pellet production has had no impact on Crown 
forest area, since the procurement of fibre for pellets does not affect harvest 
levels or renewal approaches. The grinding of roadside slash will free up a small 
amount of area for prompt renewal, and so by reducing the amount of area 
where the slash would have been left to rot, there may be a marginal positive 
impact on future forested area. 
Wood prices 
Neutral.  Because the fibre used by Pinnacle would not have been used by 
anyone else in the absence of the pellet plants, pellet production has not 
affected the overall wood price structure in the catchment area.  Primary 
drivers of wood prices include factors which affect market demand for lumber,

exchange rates, transportation costs and the costs associated with complying 
with regulatory requirements. 
Markets for solid wood 
products 
Positive. Because the pellet mills rely so heavily on sawmill residuals for their 
furnish, and this residual fibre would have otherwise been burned or landfilled, 
pellet production provides some support for the sawmills in the catchment 
area.  In addition, the presence of the pellet mills has enabled manufacturers to 
build and operate cant mills that occupy a position in the value chain that is 
intermediate between the sawmills and the pellet mills.  Pellet production did 
not divert fibre from other uses; there are no close OSB plants and the nearest 
pulp and paper mills are sufficiently distant that the higher cost of transport 
outweighs any higher price that they can offer or wood fibre.  The pellet 
industry has also created demand for chipping and bush-grinding, which has 
fostered business opportunities and increased employment in the forest sector.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Drax Group is a British electrical power generation and supply company that runs Europe’s 
largest biomass-fueled power station – the UK’s largest decarbonisation project – supplying 
7-8% of the country’s electrical needs.  Drax is among the world’s largest single-point 
consumers of wood fibre and has committed to sourcing wood responsibly.  
In accordance with Drax’s initiative to monitor forest management and timber market trends in 
the jurisdictions where its supplier pellet mills operate, this report provides a review and 
assessment of the trends in management and wood products markets in the catchment area of 
two supplier mills in Burns Lake and Houston, British Columbia (BC).  These two mills are 
operated by Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. and are located 80 km apart. 
The Houston plant has been operating since 2006 and the Burns Lake facility since 2011.  The 
Houston mill is a partnership between Canfor, Pinnacle and Witset First Nation.  Pinnacle’s 2020 
Annual Report states that the annual capacity of the Houston mill is 220,000 ODMTs, while the 
Burns Lake facility is 380,000 ODMTs.  Most of the wood fibre used in the Houston plant is 
residual fibre from the Canfor sawmill in Houston while the Burns Lake mill depends heavily on 
residual fibre from several nearby sawmills. 
1.2 Report Goal 
The goal of this report is to identify and assess the impacts that sourcing biomass for the two 
pellet plants has had on the forest, its management, and wood markets.  This includes impacts 
on timber inventory, forest growth, forest removals, wood prices, forest management 
practices, and local wood fibre markets. 
This report reviews the period 2000 to 2020, which coincides with an extensive outbreak of 
mountain pine beetle (MPB); the resulting mortality of large parts of the mature forest was the 
dominant factor affecting the forest and the industry during this period.  The review period also 
covers the operational start-up of the two pellet mills and so provides an opportunity to 
identify potential impacts of fibre procurement for the mills. 
1.3 Report Structure 
The report is organized as follows: 
i. Description of the Catchment Area (Section 2): The geographic and socio-economic 
characteristics of the catchment area are described. 
ii. Forest Management Practices (Section 3): Approximately 96% of the forest in the catchment 
area is managed by the provincial government, thus government policy is reviewed,

including a discussion of how it has evolved since 2000.  In addition, the impacts of the 
Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak are discussed. 
iii. Description of the Forest in the Catchment Area (Section 4): This section describes the 
current state of the forest, both in area and volume terms, how harvesting is regulated, and 
how the forest has changed since 2000.   
iv. Timber Growth and Removals (Section 5): The volume of timber growth is compared with 
the amount of timber removed through harvesting and natural disturbances. 
v. Markets (Section 6): The markets for wood fibre in and around the catchment area are 
profiled. 
vi. Pricing (Section 7): Describes the method used to calculate stumpage prices are described 
and local stumpage price trends examined. 
vii. Summary of Key Trends and Outlook (Section 8). 
viii. Annex 1 provides the analysis to establish the catchment area.

2 Catchment Area 
2.1 Extent 
A catchment area is the region from which a forest products mill sources its wood fibre.  This 
assessment examines the catchment areas of two central BC pellet mills owned by Pinnacle 
Renewable Energy Inc.  The mills are located in the towns of Houston and Burns Lake, which are 
about 80 km apart.  Their catchment areas have extensive overlap, and hence in this review are 
considered as one large catchment area supplying the pair of mills. 
Approximately 95% of the furnish used by the two pellet mills is procured as residual material 
from sawmills (mostly sawdust and planer shavings) also located in Houston and Burns Lake.  
These sawmills obtain most of their sawlogs from three management units – their catchment 
area consists of the Lakes Timber Supply Area (TSA), the Morice TSA, and the Vanderhoof 
Forest District, which is part of the much larger Prince George TSA.  In this report we refer to 
these units as Administrative Districts or Units.  
These supply dynamics mean that the catchment area of the sawmills is effectively identical to 
the catchment area for the pellet mills (See Figure 1).  The data identifying the three 
Administrative Districts as the catchment area for the pellet mills is presented in Annex 1. 
2.2 The Forest 
Each Administrative District encompasses roughly 1.4 - 1.5-million ha, as shown in Table 1.  
About 94% of the catchment areas is Crown land, which is public land under provincial 
jurisdiction.  Most of the remaining area is owned privately, and there is some land under 
jurisdiction of the federal government that is primarily Indian Reserves.  Indigenous 
communities in the area do not own substantial lands outright but do have forest management 
and timber harvesting rights on some areas. The Crown forest management landbase (CFMLB), 
which is the part of the Crown landbase that supplies wood fibre to the forest industry, is 
approximately one-third of the total area.  The derivation of the CFMLB is explained in more 
detail later in section 3.4 of this report.

Private and federal land contribute to the regional timber harvest however there are no 
inventory data or records of the amount of timber that originates from these ownerships; the 
province does not have jurisdiction over federal land and the federal government does not 
maintain a detailed forest inventory on lands it owns.  As a result, this report does not include 
these lands in the catchment area analysis, however the extent of their contribution to the 
catchment area harvest and forest landbase is in line with their share of the total area and 
activities on these lands do not affect the trends and conclusions identified in this report. 
2.3 Geography and Climate 
The geography of the catchment area is dominated by gently rolling hills, large lakes, and small 
mountain ranges. The area has moderately warm summers with an average daily maximum of 
17oCandcold winters with average daily maximum of -7oC.The average temperature and 
precipitation figures mask considerable extremes, as winter temperatures often reach -30oC. 
Summers are moderate with temperatures seldom exceeding 30oC.The average precipitation in 
Burns Lake (in the center of the catchment area) is about 50 cm, which includes approximately 
30 cm water equivalent of snow. However, because parts of the area are rugged and there is 
considerable variation in elevation, the temperature and precipitation patterns vary throughout 
the catchment area and are strongly affected by aspect, elevation and other topographical 
characteristics. 
2.4 Transportation Infrastructure 
A paved two-lane highway (Highway 16) bisects the catchment area, connecting the main 
towns and villages and all major sawmills in the area, as well as the two pellet plants.  As the 
main transportation artery through the area, Highway 16 joins Houston and Burns Lake with 
Vanderhoof and Prince George to the east and Smithers, Terrace, and Prince Rupert to the 
west.  Highway 16 is also the primary route for hauling timber and wood fibre. 
A single-track railway, owned and operated by the Canadian National Railway, roughly parallels 
the highway through the catchment area. The railway is used primarily to carry shipping 
containers, grain, and other commodities to the seaport at Prince Rupert.  Pinnacle Pellet has a 
dedicated loading facility at the Prince Rupert port and most product from the Burns Lake and 
Houston pellet plants is shipped through that facility. 
2.5 Development of the Catchment Area 
Europeans began to settle in the valleys within the catchment area in the late 19-th century and 
prospectors began to explore the area, stimulated by a large discovery of gold in Barkerville, BC.  
The valleys were well-suited to agriculture and the first mining activity is reported to have 
occurred in 1910.  Mining has always been a significant contributor to the local economies. 
Several large copper and molybdenum mines in the area have operated over the years; at 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS

ArborVitae Environmental Services Ltd. 
 
present, the Huckleberry copper mine is producing near Houston.  Forestry, agriculture, mining 
and transportation have been the key economic sectors in the catchment area for many years. 
Railway tie production was the first commercial forest products manufacturing in the 
catchment area, beginning around 1912-13 when the first railroad was being built.  Both Burns 
Lake and Houston developed into major tie-cutting centres.1 
During the 1930’s and 1940’s, there were a growing number of portable sawmills in the area 
(42 in the Houston district by 1949), which moved to where the timber was.  In 1948, the first 
stationary mill was built near Houston, and later a planer, drying kilns and chippers were added.  
Another large (for the time) sawmill was built in Houston in 1969 but the company soon ran 
into financial trouble and was purchased by Northwood Pulp and Timber. This mill became 
what is now the Canadian Forest Products (Canfor) sawmill.  Houston also had a second large 
sawmill (Houston Forest Products) which was owned by West Fraser Timber, however it closed 
permanently in 2014 as part of an industry rationalization brought on by the Mountain Pine 
Beetle infestation. 
Today, the catchment area is sparsely populated.  Burns Lake (just less than 2,000 residents) 
and Houston (approximately 2,100 residents) are the largest communities in the area. Smaller 
communities in the Vanderhoof Administrative Unit include Vanderhoof (2,000 residents) and 
Fraser Lake (1,000 residents). These figures exclude people living rurally outside of the town 
boundaries; the area also includes several scattered smaller communities. Statistics Canada 
shows that the population of Burns Lake declined by 13% between the 2011 and 2016 census 
dates while Houston’s population was stable.  The city of Prince George is the regional centre 
with a population of about 74,000 residents; in the past five years the city’s population has 
risen by roughly 0.5% per annum.   
2.6 First Nations 
Numerous First Nations have traditional territory within the catchment area.  The Lakes TSA 
overlaps the traditional territory of 13 First Nations while the traditional territory of eight First 
Nations extends into the Morice TSA (some First Nations have territory in both TSAs).The 
traditional territory of the Carrier Sekani and Takla Lake First Nations is centred in the Lakes 
TSA, and there are a number of politically and economically autonomous sub-groups living in 
local communities.  The number of Aboriginal people in the catchment area is somewhat 
uncertain because the national census is typically challenged to obtain a high response rate on 
Indian reserves.  The most recent census data, from 2016, shows that within Burns Lake, 900 
people or approximately 45% of the population, identified as Aboriginal, while in Houston 375 
people did so.

Indigenous communities have significant forest management and timber harvesting rights in 
the area.  The 2019 Lakes TSA discussion paper reports that First Nations are deeply involved in 
the forest sector through partnerships, community forests and as holders of forest licences.  
The Burns Lake Native Development Corporation is a 10% owner of Babine Forest Products and 
Decker Lake Forest Products while Witset First Nation is a partner owning 10% of the Houston 
pellet plant.  
The local forest sector is a source of employment and the Carrier Sekani First Nations 
Collaboration Agreement with the provincial government provides a framework to deepen First 
Nation involvement in decision-making.  In addition, the Omineca Environmental Stewardship 
Initiative Demonstration Project, a partnership between the Carrier Sekani First Nations and the 
Province of B.C., is underway with the goal of assessing the current state and cumulative effect 
of natural and development-related disturbance on moose, forest biodiversity, and several 
watershed values.

3 Forest Management 
3.1 Legislation 
The provincial Forest Act and its regulations set out the forest management framework on 
Crown land, including forest tenure, planning requirements, allowable cut determination, 
timber measurement and marking, and the setting of stumpage rates.  The Forests and Range 
Protection Act (FRPA) is the primary provincial legislation regulating forestry practices and 
planning on Crown land.  Under FRPA, the Forest Planning and Practices Regulation (FPPR) 
identifies objectives set by government for environmental values including fish, wildlife, 
biodiversity, soils, and water that must be addressed in Forest Stewardship Plans, which are the 
strategic planning documents required for Crown forests.  The government may also establish 
orders under the Government Actions Regulation or the Land Use Objectives Regulation for 
specific land uses such as ungulate winter range, wildlife habitat areas, critical habitat for fish 
and old growth management areas. 
On Crown land, the provincial government regulates forest planning and operations, including 
the determination of the allowable harvest. Government approves all forest management plans 
on all tenures.  On area-based tenures, the plan preparer determines an allowable harvest 
which must be approved by the provincial government.  On volume-based tenures, the Ministry 
of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development’s (FLNRORD) Chief 
Forester follows a rigourous process to establish the allowable cut.  The province also monitors 
the performance of the licensees in conducting their operations in a way that does not cause 
damage to the site and meets requirements associated with biodiversity conservation. 
3.2 Stumpage 
Stumpage in BC is the price paid by anyone harvesting timber from Crown land. The stumpage 
rate is set by the Provincial Government using a market-based system. BC Timber Sales (BCTS), 
a branch of the Provincial Government, publicly auctions “blocks” of merchantable timber.  The 
market prices paid for this timber are used to set the rates for similar types and qualities of 
Crown timber harvested by other forest operators under long-term harvesting rights granted by 
the Government.  In BC, all timber scheduled for harvest undergoes a detailed field inventory 
process (timber cruising) to assess the quantity and quality of timber.  The cruise and bid data 
from BCTS enables the government to develop regression equations that are used to set the 
stumpage rates on non-BCTS blocks.  In this way, the provincial government receives a fair 
market-based stumpage for all of the timber harvested from Crown land. Stumpage rates for 
forest licensees are revised by the Government every four months to reflect changing market 
conditions.

3.3 Timber Supply Areas 
The province is organized into 37 TSAs - nine along the Coast, 15 in the South, and 13 in the 
North.  Within each TSA there are multiple forestry tenures.  Some grant rights to harvest 
timber in a defined area (i.e., area-based tenures) and other forms of tenure grant rights to 
harvest a set volume (i.e., volume-based tenures) from within a given TSA.  Area-based tenures 
within the catchment area include Community Forest licences, Woodlot Licences and First 
Nations Woodland Licences (FNWL).2  An Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) is determined by the 
provincial Chief Forester for each area-based tenure.  For the volume-based tenures, an AAC is 
determined by the provincial Chief Forester for each TSA and apportioned amongst the volume-
based licence holders by the Minister of FLNRORD.  
While volume-based tenures supply the majority of the timber harvest in the catchment area, a 
substantial amount of TSA area has been shifted from volume-based to area-based tenures 
during the past 20 years.  The area-based tenures have been designated to more widely 
distribute the benefits of forestry and to provide for a variety of forest management 
approaches.  This trend can be seen for the Lakes TSA in Figure 2, which was prepared by 
Agathe Bernard in the Nadina District FLNRORD office3.  This transfer of land from volume-
based tenures to area-based tenures represents a source of downward pressure on the AAC 
calculated for the volume-based portion of the TSA.

Table 2 shows the area in Community Forests, FNWLs, and Woodlot Licences in each of the 
Administrative Districts.  Note that some of the FNWL areas span both the Lakes and Morice 
TSAs hence the total area in both is shown under the Lakes TSA.  The area shown in Table 2 is 
gross area; most of this is forested, however the area available for timber harvesting will be 
somewhat less.  As Figure 2 illustrates, the extent of these licence areas has grown over the 
years as new licences have been issued and existing ones expanded.  
 
2 There are no Tree Farm Licences, which is another form of area-based tenure, within the catchment area.

3.4 Netdowns 
It has been mentioned above that a large percentage of the catchment area is unavailable for 
timber harvesting for operational and policy reasons.  The Timber Supply Review (TSR), 
conducted by the Chief Forester to determine the AAC, includes a lengthy process of identifying 
the landbase that can support commercial timber production.  This process, known as the 
“netdown”, involves removing areas that are unavailable for timber harvesting from the forest 
landbase to arrive at the Crown Forest Management Landbase (CFMLB), which is the landbase 
used to calculate the AAC.  Areas that are netted out include, but are not limited to, lands 
where timber harvesting is prohibited, such as parks, areas that do not support merchantable 
timber or which are inoperable due to topography or other factors, and ecologically sensitive 
areas (such as Old Growth Management Areas or OGMAs) and riparian areas.  
Parks and conservation reserves are readily identifiable in the forest inventory and netted out 
(see Figure 3).  In contrast, designating which areas are inoperable is a judgement call on the 
part of the Chief Forester and these areas are not formally identified in the forest inventory.  
Many types of reserves, such as ungulate winter range and recreational zones, are partially 
available for harvesting and the netdown process involves a review of department guidance 
and discussions with staff.  The area that is netted out for these purposes is also not recorded in 
the forest inventory. 
A netdown is only done as part of a TSR and in the catchment area, each of the three 
Administrative Units has a different vintage of TSR.  The most recent TSR for the Morice TSA 
was done in 2013, the Prince George TSA had a TSR done in 2015 and the TSR for the Lakes TSA 
is in process.  Each of these TSRs will have been done to somewhat different standards and in 
different regulatory environments, since TSR’s are not revised every time there is a legislative 
change.  Additionally, the TSR process only applies to the volume-based tenure lands, and as 
discussed, this area has been shrinking over time in the catchment area.  In brief, there are 
many moving parts in a determination of the timber harvesting landbase in the catchment area 
and the applicable AAC; a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this project.

Instead, the consultants have reviewed the most recent TSRs for the three administrative units 
of the catchment area and approximated the amount of area removed from the forested 
landbase for the various reasons described above.  The results are shown in Table 3, which is 
based on a compilation of information from the 2020 Lakes TSR, the 2013 Morice TSR, and the 
2015 Prince George TSR.  Note that because the Prince George TSR did not break out data 
separately for the Vanderhoof District, the numbers for the Vanderhoof District are based on 
pro-rating the total area in Prince George TSA by 17.4%, which is the proportion of the TSA area 
in the Vanderhoof District. 
The second column of Table 3 shows the total area in each land designation and the third 
column shows the percentage of the total landbase in volume-based harvest licences in this 
designation.  Accordingly, approximately 21% of the area in volume-based licences (at the time 
of the most recent TSR in each administrative unit) is non-forested or not sufficiently 
productive to grow trees.  The fourth column to the right presents the amount of area in each 
designation that is considered unavailable, and the right-hand column shows the percentage of 
that designation that is unavailable.  Of the non-forested and non-productive lands, 79% was 
considered unavailable in the three TSR analyses.

TABLE 3. SUMMARY OF AREA (HA) UNAVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION IN CROWN TIMBER HARVESTING LANDBASE. 
Roads are considered largely unavailable, while only 19% of areas that are considered 
inoperable were excluded (the Chief Forester left open the possibility that changes in harvest 
 
4Problem forest type is the term used for stands that are physically operable and above minimum site quality yet 
are not currently utilized or have marginal merchantability due to quality, size or volume.  In the catchment area, 
problem forest types consist of deciduous-leading-stands (since here is no demand for deciduous timber) and old, 
slow-growing ESSF and SBS stands.

equipment might enable some inoperable areas to be harvested; for example, one company 
has introduced a cable-tethering process to access steep slopes). 
Table 3 also shows the areas of parks and other protected areas (shown in Figure 3), sensitive 
areas, wildlife reserves and low productivity forest that are removed from the timber 
harvesting landbase.  Combining the results of the netdown processes in the three TSRs yields a 
CTHLB of roughly 34% of the catchment area landbase.  (Note that the data in Table 3 was 
derived from the three TSR processes that took place at three different times: 2013 for Morice, 
2015 for Prince George and 2020 for Lakes TSA.  A 2020 determination of the CTHLB in the 
entire catchment area would yield somewhat different results as the assumptions used in the 
netdown process will have changed over time.) 
3.5 The Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreak 
As mentioned above, the MPB outbreak is the most significant factor that affected the 
catchment area forest (and indeed the provincial forest) during the past twenty years.  MPB 
was already present in the catchment area in 2000, and the province responded by increasing 
AAC levels to permit salvage operations.  These increases occurred as soon as 2001 in the Lakes 
TSA, when the Chief Forester added 1 million m3/year to the AAC to “manage” the MPB 
infestation.  During the 2002 TSR for the Prince George TSA, the Chief Forester added 3 million 
m3 to the AAC for MPB salvage.  By 2004, the outbreak had worsened dramatically, and an 
expedited TSR was conducted for Lakes, Prince George and Quesnel TSAs, which constituted 
the hardest-hit region of the province (Quesnel is a small TSA located south of the Prince 
George TSA). FLNRORD staff estimated that the MPB might kill as much as 160 million m3of the 
existing467 million m3 of pine volume in the three TSAs and a discussion paper prepared by 
FLNRORD for the 2004 TSR indicated that many mature lodgepole pine stands (i.e. older than 
80 years) were infested, as were a number of pine stands in the 61-80 year age class.

FIGURE4. ANNUAL MORTALITY DUE TO MPB IN THE CATCHMENT AREA (M3/YEAR). 
4 shows the annual mortality, expressed in cubic metres5, caused by the MPB within the 
catchment area; the very rapid escalation of mortality between 2002 and 2005 is evident.  The 
decline in the annual rate of mortality was equally rapid; the infestation was so intense that the 
beetles quickly killed the majority of the pine in the susceptible age classes. 
The AAC for the Lakes TSA, which had been almost doubled in 2001 from 1.5 million m3/yr to 
2.96 million m3/yr, was increased again in 2004 to 3.16 million m3/yr to facilitate salvage 
harvesting. Figure 5 shows the AACs for the Lakes and Morice TSAs and the pro-rated AAC for 
Vanderhoof District from 1999 to 2019.

FIGURE 5. AACS IN LAKES AND MORICE TSAS AND VANDERHOOF DISTRICT. 
The AAC for the Morice TSA was not increased in the same way as for Lakes and Prince George, 
but instead (for reasons unknown to the consultants) the allowable harvest was raised through 
a different mechanism outside of the TSR process (i.e., Innovative Forest Practices Agreement).  
Because of this, the AAC figure used in the Morice TSR does not provide an accurate 
assessment of the allowable harvest during this period.

Table 4Error! Reference source not found. shows the proportions of pine in the growing stock 
on the CTHLB in 1999 – the amounts of pine are very high.  In fact, Vanderhoof District had 
highest proportion of pine in province and Lakes TSA was third highest; Morice TSA was mid-
range for interior forest areas.  The relatively low abundance of pine in the Morice TSA meant 
there was less MPB mortality on both a total volume basis and as a percentage of the pre-
outbreak amounts of pine.

Table 4 also shows the extensive loss of live volume caused by the MPB; Figure 7 shows a 
typical landscape with high levels of MPB mortality.  Almost 75% of the pine volume in Lakes 
and Vanderhoof was killed, amounting to roughly half of the total 1999 growing stock in the 
Lakes TSA and 54% in Vanderhoof.  The most susceptible stands were those with high 
proportions of mature lodgepole pine in them – mortality was usually close to 100% in these 
types of stands.  The impact was lower but still substantial in Morice, which lost just over half of 
its pine and 25% of the 1999 total volume.

FIGURE 7. MORTALITY CAUSED BY MPB: THE RED TREES ARE DEAD AND DYING (PHOTO COURTESY OF JIM THROWER). 
As 4 shows, the MPB outbreak had largely subsided by 2010, and there was relatively little new 
mortality.  The decline occurred as the beetle had killed the majority of the most susceptible 
pine stands and the rate of spread varied with the terrain and was also slower in stands with a 
greater diversity of species.  Salvage harvesting also began to slowly decline and the AACs in the 
Lakes and Prince George TSAs were lowered slightly in 2011.  As salvage harvesting was 
completed, the Chief Forester began to institute much large reductions in the AAC, as seen in 
Figure 5.  In 2018, the Prince George AAC fell by one-third to 8.35 million m3, which is well 
below the pre-MPB level of 9.36 million m3/yr.  The 2015 Morice TSR lowered the AAC by 
265,000 m3/yr to 1.9 million m3 until March 2020, when it made another step lower to 1.6 
million m3. The next Morice TSR is presently scheduled for 2025. The Lakes TSR is in process 
now and a hefty decline is anticipated.

FIGURE 8. COMPARISON OF LEADING SPECIES COMPOSITION FOR THE LAKES TSA CTHLB AREA: 2000 VS. 2018. 
Figure 8 illustrates how the MPB outbreak altered the species and age distribution of the forest 
in the Lakes TSA (FLNRORD 2019).  The height of the bars represents the percentage species 
composition of the forest, while the upper portion of each bar represents the proportion of the 
forest in the leading species group older than 50.  The vertically hatched portion of the bar 
represents the amount of forest less than 50 years old.  The proportion of pine leading stands 
declined from 77% in 2000 to 55% in 2018, with the spruce-leading stands and balsam-leading 
stands doubling in abundance. The age composition of the pine also shifted to a much younger 
age; in 2018, 70% of the pine is less than 50 years old, as compared to 18% being that young in 
2000.  Very similar changes occurred in Vanderhoof and in the Morice TSA.  
3.6 The Impact of the 2018 Wildfires 
The forests in the catchment area are primarily fire-driven ecosystems, and the mortality 
caused by the MPB created perfect conditions for extensive fires.  It is not surprising that 2017 
and 2018 were British Columbia’s two worst forest fire years ever, in terms of area burned.  
While the 2017 fires were largely outside the catchment area, the 2018 fires were concentrated 
in the catchment area, as shown in Figure 9.  Of the 1.3 million ha burned that year, 
approximately 370,000 ha were burned in the catchment area.

Table 5 presents some key fire impact statistics for the catchment area, with the volume losses 
pertaining to the CTHLB only.  There were additional losses in non-CTHLB areas, such as parks.  
Table 5Error! Reference source not found. shows that within the perimeter of the fire, roughly 
half of the volume was lost.  Overall, the Lakes TSA and Morice TSAs lost 5% and 3% of their 
growing stock, respectively; the absolute level of loss was greatest in the Vanderhoof District.  
Data were not broken out by FLNRORD for the Vanderhoof District, however the majority of 
burn area in the Prince George TSA occurred in Vanderhoof, and thus the impacts on the 
District are likely to be similar to those on the two TSAs.

Wildfires are variable in their intensity and within the perimeter, some trees are left alive, 
others are scorched and killed while others are partially burned.  Depending on access, the 
living and scorched trees can be salvaged for sawlogs, with the unusable wood providing hog 
fuel and potentially some pellet furnish depending on the amount of char that is present.

4 Forest Inventory 
4.1 Inventory 
The analysis of the landbase and the forest in the catchment area has been derived from the 
provincial government’s Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI).  The VRI is the provincial 
standard for forest inventory.  It is based on digital aerial imagery captured periodically to 
delineate forest and non-forest areas.  Attributes are attached to all inventory polygons and are 
updated annually for tree growth, natural mortality, and depletions such as timber harvesting, 
wildfires, and insect caused mortality. 
The government has a program of periodic checks or audits of key inventory attributes using 
statistically design ground sample programs.  Audits of forest stands greater than 50 years of 
age were conducted in the three administrative units in January 2020.  Results showed that VRI 
estimates of volume were close in the Lakes TSA and Prince George TSA (of which the 
Vanderhoof District is a part), and slightly underestimated in the Morice TSA. 
4.2 Ecosystem Types 
For ecological purposes, BC has been classified into Biogeoclimatic zones (BEC zones).  Each BEC 
is an extensive area with a broad homogeneous macroclimate that influences development of 
vegetation and soil.  BEC zones in the catchment area are largely boreal, sub-alpine, and alpine 
in nature.  A small portion of the Morice and Lakes TSAs is in two BEC zones that have coastal 
climate influences (CMA and CWH), however the catchment area does not include the Interior 
Cedar Hemlock (ICH) BEC zone, which has been considered by some as being synonymous with 
the interior temperate rainforest. 
Two BEC zones in the catchment area account for 92% of the total area (Table 6). The SBS is the 
dominant zone, defined by lower elevations with gently rolling hills and moderate climate.  The 
ESSF occurs at higher elevations with a more severe climate, shorter growing season, and lower 
forest productivity.

Figure 10 shows the information in Table 6 in graphical format – the dominance of the SBS Zone 
is very evident. Note that the MS and CMA zones have been removed from Figure 10 for clarity.  
Interestingly, the BEC zone nomenclature references spruce and fir but not pine, which prior to 
the MPB epidemic, was the most abundant species in the mature forest.

4.3.1 Leading Species 
The catchment area forest is dominated by coniferous tree species, principally lodgepole pine, 
white and Englemann spruce, and sub-alpine fir (Table 7 and Figure 11).  Spruce and pine-
dominated stands account for 67% of the forest in the catchment area and Abies leading stands 
23%.  Hardwood stands account for about 10% of the forest area.

The relative abundance of spruce has increased due to the effect of the widespread mortality of 
mature pine stands killed by the MPB (Figure 8 shows how MPB affected forest composition 
and age in the Lakes TSA).  Nevertheless, there remains a substantial amount of pine leading 
forest in the catchment area, most of it in the younger age classes. 
 
FIGURE 11.  PROPORTIONAL AREA X LEADING SPECIES IN THE CATCHMENT AREA. 
 
4.3.2 Age Class 
The BC forest inventory uses an age class schedule that reflects historic conditions in the coastal 
forest: age classes 1-7 are twenty-year age classes, while age class 8 is stands that are between 
141-250 years of age, and class 9 is older than 250 years.  The majority of the forest in the 
catchment area is older than 100 years (Figure 12) and age class 8 (ages 141-250) has by far the 
largest area, reflecting in part the large range of ages included in it as well as a substantial area 
of low productivity and difficult to access stands. Classes 3 and 4 (ages 41-60 and 61-80) have 
relatively little area in them in part because fire suppression had been effective between 1940 
and 1980 and there were no large natural disturbances during that period.  Classes 1 and 2 
(ages 1-20 and 21-40) are relatively large and consist mainly of renewal of harvested area.  
Most post-harvest regeneration is achieved through planting (generally 1-2 years after harvest) 
with some left for natural regeneration.  Most of the un-salvaged MPB killed areas are

regenerating naturally.6  Naturally and artificially renewed stands are often spaced, but very 
little commercial thinning is done in the BC Interior and there is almost none in the catchment 
area. 
 
FIGURE 12. AREA X AGE CLASS FOR THE MAIN FOREST TYPES IN THE CATCHMENT AREA. 
In the catchment area, most stands become merchantable around 80 years and peak in mean 
annual increment in age classes 5 or 6.  While there is no firm rotation age in BC, conifer stands 
are usually harvested between 80 and 120 years of age.7  In contrast, stands in age classes 8 
and 9 are growing slowly if at all.  Stands in these age classes are frequently in biological decline 
and are commercially unattractive in all but the most favourable timber markets.   
The age class structure of the forest is imbalanced as a result of variations in operability and the 
lack of a hardwood market as well as the impact of natural disturbances – this is accepted by 
forest managers who do not have a mandate or a goal to “normalize” the age class structure of 
even the commercially available forest. 
 
 
 
6Very little commercial thinning is done in BC, and there is almost none in the catchment area. 
7Merchantable blocks of timber are usually scheduled for harvest based on strategic considerations, such as access 
construction, balancing haul distance, and operability.

figures are calculated separately for each species identified in each stand, however the

Since many of the stands in the catchment area are spruce-fir mixtures, there would be a 
considerable amount of spruce volume in the Abies fir growing stock in Figure 13, and vice-
versa.  The relative proportions of growing stock reflect the extensive mortality of pine due to 
MPB – formerly pine-dominated stands have moved into the fir, poplar or spruce-leading stand 
types once the pine mortality was inventoried. 
The inventory also tallies the volume of dead timber in each stand.  The total volume of dead 
timber in the inventory is 90.08 million m3, equivalent to 24% of the live growing stock.  The 
dead timber is not identified by species in the inventory but is primarily lodgepole pine killed by 
the MPB, which has proved to remain merchantable for sawtimber for as long as 15 years. 
The volume of pine shown in Figure 13 is less than the 68.6 million m3 of pine reported in the 
catchment area in 2014 (See Table 4); the difference reflects the differences in the basis of the 
volume determination (i.e. leading species and dead wood included in Figure 13 vs estimated 
actual live volume only in Table 4) and the impacts of the 2018 fires. 
4.4.2 Age Class 
Figure 14, based on current data from the BC forest inventory shown in Table 9, shows the 
amount of live growing stock by leading species and age class for the forests in the catchment 
area.  As expected, there is little growing stock in the two youngest age classes, and also in age 
classes 3 and 4 (representing stands aged 41-60 and 61-80) due to the relative lack of area in 
those latter two classes.  Fully 43% of the growing stock in the catchment area is in age class 8 
(ages 141-250), equally divided between spruce and fir.  Age classes 5 and 7 (ages 81-100 and 
121-140, respectively) each have roughly 15% of the growing stock in the catchment area.

The forest is transitioning from first-growth natural-origin stands to second-growth stands 
which have been established after a harvest.  Licensees have been responsible for basic 
silviculture since 1987, and since 2007, 100% of the spruce seed used has been genetically 
improved (FLNRORD 2019)8.  Improved spruce is estimated to yield 20% more than the average 
natural stock.  Improved lodgepole pine stock was used starting in 2009, and today 64% of pine 
stock is improved, with a 9% gain in yield expected.

TABLE 9. GROWING STOCK BY AGE CLASS AND LEADING SPECIES (MILLION M3). 
On the Lakes TSA, there are roughly 23,000 ha of stands established prior to 1987, 63,000 ha 
established between 1987 and 2007, and about 50,000 ha regenerated since 2007.During the 
past four decades, approximately 67% of the renewal was planted.   
The April 2019 Data Package for the Lakes TSA reports that many of the stands renewed prior 
to 1987 were planted, and some were naturally renewed and spaced and so are considered as 
managed.  Pure spruce and pure pine were planted, as well as 80:20 mixtures of the two 
species, which pine leading sometimes and spruce leading other times.  Area x planting 
composition data were not available. 
Between 1987 and 2007, all renewal was through planting.  Improved spruce seed was used for 
75% of the planted spruce, with an average estimated genetic gain of 14%.  No genetic gain was 
estimated for the planted pine.  Mixed species were planted on all sites, at 90:10 and 70:30 
spruce: pine and pine:spruce ratios, as well as a 40% pine, 30% spruce and 30% Abies fir 
combination.  These changes were presumably made to add diversity to the second-growth 
forest.  The widespread use of improved stock since 2007 has prompted FLNRORD to consider 
the post 2007 stands as growing according to different yield curves.  A genetic gain of 20% has 
been applied to planted spruce and 9% to planted pine, and an even wider range of species 
mixtures has been planted.

Approximately 9,000 ha of plantations were fertilized during the past decade.  Most of the 
fertilized areas were pine-leading plantations around 35 years of age, however some areas of 
50 – 70 year spruce was also fertilized.  
4.5 Future Growing Stock 
Due to the effects of the MPB and the 2018 wildfires, the growing stock and average age of the 
forest in the catchment area are at a cyclical low point; Figure 14shows a substantial amount of 
area in age classes 1 and 2 (1-20 and 21-40, respectively).  These stands are young enough that 
they presently have little growing stock and in age class 1 the volume growth rates are 
relatively low.   
As mentioned, a TSR is presently underway for the Lakes TSA and a discussion paper released in 
2019 by FLNRORD as part of the process describes the projected state of the forest. Because 
there are no recent analyses for Morice and Vanderhoof, the Lakes TSA analysis is reviewed 
here in some detail since the results are representative of the entire catchment area. 
The Lakes TSR discussion paper notes that the size of the Crown managed forest landbase is 
approximately 33% smaller (265,000 ha) than it was in 2000, due to the transfer of area from 
volume-based tenures to area-based tenures (see section 3.3).  The AAC in the volume-based 
portion of the TSA is expected to decline significantly when the Chief Forester sets the new 
AAC, likely within the next year.  The base case AAC in the discussion paper (FLNRORD 2019) 
shows the live volume portion of the AAC being reduced to 400,000 m3/yr for 60 years before it 
rises to a long-term sustainable level of 900,000 m3/yr.  There is also a 400,000 m3/yr harvest of 
dead wood planned for the first decade, that then varies between approximately 50,000 and 
80,000 m3/yr to year 60.  The pathway of the total and merchantable growing stock9 is shown in 
Figure 15 for the base case timber supply projection in the Lakes TSA.  The base case is the 
scenario that captures current practice and seeks to balance objectives such as long-term 
sustainability, provision of timber, and optimal use of the remaining dead wood in the forest10; 
the AAC that is determined by the Chief Forester will likely be consistent with the base case. 
 
9 Merchantable stands are conifer-leading stands older than 80 years and containing more than 140 m3/ha 
10 The Discussion Paper notes that there is a significant amount of dead wood remaining on the landbase however 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding its continued merchantability.  The base case has not changed the 
assumed “shelf life” of the dead pine; the base case scenario reflects a sustainable live volume harvest with a focus 
on stands with the highest proportion of dead timber in them.

FIGURE 15.  BASE CASE GROWING STOCK PROJECTION ON LAKES TSA. 
The AAC determination also needs to consider the transition from the primary forest to the 
second-growth forest, much of which has been planted and tended and grows more rapidly 
than natural origin stands.  Between the expected gain from using improved seed and the 
application of management, growth rates in the managed stands are roughly twice those of 
natural origin stands.  The Lakes TSA base case shows the primary forest providing all of the 
harvest for the next 25 years, after which the second-growth becomes an increasing proportion 
of the harvest volume.  By year 40, second-growth stands are expected to supply approximately 
67% of the harvest volume, and by year 60 it will be more than 90%.

5 Timber Removals and Growth 
5.1 Removals 
During the study period (2000-2019), the three principle sources of removals were the MPB, 
wildfires, and harvesting.  This assessment has reviewed the primary source of forest mortality, 
namely the MPB, as well as the 2018 wildfires in sections 3.5 and 3.6, respectively.  This section 
will examine the harvest in detail. 
5.1.1 Harvest 
Like everything else, harvesting was greatly affected by the MPB outbreak during the study 
period; harvesting was elevated compared with previous periods due to the concerted effort to 
salvage MPB-killed timber. Salvage harvesting began to ramp up as early as 2001 and continued 
at substantial levels through most of the assessment period.  The extensive salvage harvesting 
meant that in many years, well over 50% of the harvest consisted of dead pine. 
Table 10 shows the volume harvested each year from 2010-2019 by species, and Figure 16 
shows the same data for the three primary species.  On average, the annual harvest was 
approximately 10 million m3 between 2010 and 2019; 2011 and 2013 were the two highest 
years with harvests of 12.1 million m3 and 11.4 million m3, respectively.  From 2017 to 2019, the 
harvest showed a declining trend, with the 2019 harvest being 7.7 million m3. 
Lodgepole pine made up the majority of the harvest, at 65% over the entire period, and spruce 
comprised 25%.  Abies fir made up just less than 10%.  Hemlock made up only 0.3% and the 
deciduous species accounted for less than 0.2% of the harvest.

TABLE 10. CATCHMENT AREA HARVEST VOLUME BY SPECIES (THOUSAND M3) 
The proportion of pine in the harvest trended down gradually, from 75% in 2010, to between 
65 and 69% between 2011 and 2016, before declining to roughly 55% in 2017 and 2018 and 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS

thence to 48% in 2019.  This reflects the trajectory of the salvage.  On the other hand, the 
proportion of spruce trended higher during the past decade, rising from 18% in 2010 to an 
average of 30% between 2016 and 2019. 
Harvest data from FLNRORD for the individual TSAs show that between 2004 and 2008, when 
the salvage was most intensive, 99.2% of the volume harvested in the Lakes TSA was pine, 
primarily dead and dying timber. About two-thirds of the harvest in the 2010 and 2019 period 
was pine (Figure 17).  Between 2012 and 2018, 13% of the Lakes harvest was live pine (average 
of 167,844 m3/year), 58% was dead pine (737,750 m3/year on average) and the remaining 29% 
was live timber of other species (average was approx 360,000 m3/year).  Like the Lakes TSA, a 
considerable amount of pine salvage occurred in the Morice TSA; data provided by FLNRORD 
show that 46% of 2015 harvest was dead timber, which declined in subsequent years to reach 
29% in 2019.

Figure 18 summarizes harvested volumes for the past ten years by two broad quality classes.  
The sawlog grade represents the best quality timber whereas the low-grade timber consists of 
logs with defect and rot, small logs and other lower grade materials that cannot be processed in 
a sawmill (See section 6.3 for more detail).  The sawlog  grade timber is the most valuable and is 
processed by the sawmills. 
 
FIGURE 18. ACTUAL HARVEST IN CATCHMENT AREA. 
On average, 95% of the sawlog grade was live timber and 5% was dead.  Even though dead, the 
wood could be sawn in a sawmill and met the quality specifications for the grade.

In contrast, 95% of the low-grade wood was dead and only 5% was living. Sawmills were using 
some of the grade 4 dead wood while that which they couldn’t process went either to the cant 
mills or, if its quality was very poor, directly to the pellet mills.  The proportion of dead wood in 
the harvest between 2010 and 2019 ranged between 50 and 59 %, averaging 55% over the 
period; this suggests that 5.5 million m3 of dead wood was cut on average each year.   
5.2 Deforestation 
Deforestation is the removal of forest cover as the land is converted to a different use other 
than forestry.  Timber harvesting followed by renewal of the forest is not deforestation - 
clearing forest for agriculture is.  BC does not report on deforestation and the BC forest 
inventory does not readily allow one to determine the rate of deforestation, primarily because 
each time the inventory is updated with new photography, the assessment of what is and is not 
forest changes for areas that are borderline forests, typically sub-alpine and alpine areas in the 
case of the catchment area. 
However, the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) tracks deforestation to meet Canada’s obligations 
for national greenhouse gas reporting.  These data are tabulated by ecozone, which are very 
large areas. The catchment area is in the Montane Cordillera ecozone and the CFS reports that 
between 1980 and 2017, the area of forest in the ecozone declined from 31,181,000 ha to 
31,094,000 ha, a reduction of 87,000 ha or 0.28 % of the forest area.  The amount of 
deforestation averaged 2,350 ha/yr, with approximately 300 ha/yr occurring in the catchment 
area.  The leading causes of deforestation have been conversion to agriculture (40%), urban 
expansion (17%), forestry roads and landings (17%) and mining (15%). The ownerships on which 
the deforestation occurred were not specified, however the majority of the conversion to 
agriculture and urban expansion would have occurred on private land. Forest roads and 
landings accounted for a loss of approximately 400 ha per year in the ecozone; since the 
ecozone is approximately eight times as large as the catchment area, this translates to a loss of 
50 ha/year in the catchment area. While forest companies are required to renew harvested 
lands, and thus not contribute to deforestation, provincial policy in general is neutral in terms 
of whether it encourages or discourages deforestation.  
5.3 Growth 
The VRI estimates the annual growth rate of each stand based on its species composition and 
site characteristics.  These growth rates are all modelled in the VRI as if the stands renewed 
naturally, which is not the case.  For the past fifty years, many of the stands in the catchment 
area have been renewed by planting followed by a spacing operation, and some naturally 
renewed stands have been spaced.  In addition, as mentioned above, improved seed has 
increasingly been used to grow the planting stock.  As a result, the VRI underestimates the 
current rate of growth. 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS 
 
 
36 
ArborVitae Environmental Services Ltd. 
 
To obtain a more realistic rate of growth for the forest management landbase, the consultants 
re-estimated the growth rates of young stands using managed stand yield curves. In the 
absence of the ability to accurately determine how stands originated, all stands less than 50 
years old were assumed to be managed.  The results of this assessment are shown in Table 11. 
To simplify the presentation, Table 11 shows the results for four age classes in the portion of 
the forest that is identified in the inventory as the forest management landbase. The Regen age 
class is recently harvested and renewed area that has not been assessed as free-to-grow and so 
has not been assigned stand characteristics.  Most of the Regen area is less than 10 years old.   
The row labelled CAI (Current Annual Increment) shows the total annual volume growth in each 
age class and the row labelled Avg CAI shows the average annual growth per hectare by age 
class.  These data are portrayed in Figure 19.  Despite being 31% of the area, the 1-50 year age 
class accounts for 62% of the total growth.  Overall, the average growth rate is 1.2 m3/ha/year; 
the large amount of area in the oldest age class greatly lowers the increment for the forest 
management area as a whole.

The growth rates in the stands older than 50 years have been reduced by the MPB.  While many 
of the high percentage pine stands have been salvaged and renewed, stands that were a 
mixture of pine and spruce have experienced a loss of pine volume but the remaining species 
continue to form a stand.  Likewise, some of the area within the 2018 fire zones was only 
partially killed, leaving stands in a similar under-stocked condition.  These depleted but 
“unsalvaged” stands will have low rates of growth because the stocking has been so reduced.  
As a result, the current growth within the TSA is below the capacity of the forest, however the 
large area of young managed stands will provide for a sizeable boost in growth rate over the 
next several decades. 
Table 11 provides an indication of the potential growth rates by showing the CAI at the age 
when the Mean Annual Increment peaks, or culminates (i.e. the age of CMAI).  These average 
ages of CMAI are shown, as well as the average total annual increment at CMAI, and the per 
hectare increment at the same time.  These data are graphed in Figure 20. 
As time goes by and natural origin forest is harvested and the regenerated areas grow 
according to the managed yield curves, the area in the 1-50 age class will move into its most 
productive age. As this happens, the total amount of growth and the average increment per ha 
in the forest will rise.  The managed stands achieve peak MAI at 84 years on average, while the 
unmanaged stands achieve peak MAI at ages 117 and 139, respectively.  Stands are generally 
harvested when they are near peak MAI.  The total increment achieved by the current stands at 
the age of peak MAI is 5.9 million m3/year, which provides an indicator of future levels of 
growth from the forest management landbase.

5.4 Growth to Removal Ratio 
During the 2010-2019 period, the primary source of removals from the catchment area was 
timber harvesting, which accounted for 100.2 million m3 during the period.  MPB mortality was 
minimal, as the majority of it occurred during the previous decade.  The 2018 wildfires are 
estimated by FLNRORD to have killed 7.1 million m3 in the catchment area. 
Table 11 shows that the current annual growth on the forest management landbase is 3.45 
million m3.  Since annual growth rates are not available for previous years, the growth over the 
ten-year period can be approximated as ten times the 2020 figure, or 34.5 million m3. 
Thus, the total removals of 107.3 million m3 during the period handily exceeded growth. 
However, approximately 55 million m3 of the harvest consisted of dead wood, so the removal of 
live wood was only 52.3 million m3, or 17.8 million m3 more than estimated growth. 
In the prior decade, 2000-2009, MPB killed 157 million m3 however a much greater percentage 
of the harvest was dead pine during the period – as much as 98% in some years.  As a result, it 
is likely that the growth rate during 2000-2009 exceeded the removals of live timber from 
harvesting. 
The growth to removal ratio has been greatly affected by the impacts of MPB on the forest and 
the harvesting response.  The growth rate for the catchment area is near a cyclical low point 
due to the mortality caused by the MPB, which has created the conditions for the recent fires 
and bark beetle infestations.  As the large area of young managed forest grows and reaches the 
ages of rapid growth, the growth increment in the catchment area will increase significantly.   
At the same time, the allowable harvest is presently near 8.0 million m3/yr and being reduced.  
Figure 5 shows that in 2000, the AAC for the volume-based licence area was roughly 5.3 million 
m3, and one may anticipate that the live portion of the harvest will soon be reduced to or 
below this level.  There is still a deadwood component in the harvest, although it is relatively 
minor, and the total growing stock is projected to decrease for another 10-15 years, while 
merchantable growing stock will decline for another 30 years.  There will be a long period of 
adjustment after the-MPB infestation.  As a result, the growth to removals ratio is not an 
especially accurate indicator of trends in the forest or of the overall sustainability of forest 
management. 
Between 2015 and 2019, the catchment area harvest was 46.1 million m3.  Pinnacle’s use of 
fibre was equivalent to 7.5 million m3, representing 16.3% of the harvest volume11.  However, 
much of this was sawmill residual; Pinnacle’s use of roundwood was equivalent to 1.6 million 
m3 or 3.5% of the total harvest.  Given this low level of roundwood consumption, and Pinnacle’s

use of low-grade fibre, the consultants conclude that Pinnacle’s wood use has not affected 
harvest levels.  
The consultants believe that before long, growth will exceed the volume of live timber 
harvested. The growing stock in the catchment area will enter a long period of increase given 
the commitment to silvicultural and forest management investments.  Demand for fibre by 
pellet mills will not be driving this trend or any related decisions.

6 Market Profile 
6.1 Overview 
The forest industry is the primary driver of the economy in the catchment area.  The foundation 
of the industry is the production of solid wood products, i.e., dimension lumber manufactured 
in sawmills.  Most of the timber harvested from the catchment areas is processed by local mills, 
although some sawlogs from the Vanderhoof District are shipped to Prince George. About two-
thirds of the lumber produced in BC is exported to the US.  
Sawdust and shavings from sawmills, as well as chips and trim blocks, are the main supply of 
fibre for pellet plants. The chips and trim blocks are ground and represent a minor proportion 
of the sawmill residuals. More recently, “hogfuel” from sawmills (miscellaneous waste fibre, 
mostly tree bark) is being used by pellet plants and biomass powered generators.  
The catchment area also has secondary manufacturing facilities and speciality mills (e.g. 
telephone poles and cedar mills).  In Burns Lake and Houston, low-grade logs that do not meet 
the quality specifications of the sawmills are processed in local ‘cant’ mills, where the logs are 
squared into cants, which are put into containers as ‘squares’ and exported to Asia.  
Most of the waste from the cant mills goes to the pellet mills however there is demand from 
pulp and paper mills in Prince George for the chips produced from the sawmills.  Approximately 
55-60% of the volume of wood processed in sawmills is recovered as lumber, 35% as chips, and 
the remainder as sawdust, shavings, and hogfuel.  The nearest Oriented Strandboard (OSB) mill 
is even further, located near Fort St. John, seven hours from Burns Lake.  The pulp and OSB 
mills draw only a minor amount of their furnish from the catchment area and are incidental to 
the local forest sector, leaving the pellet mills as the primary destination for sawmill residues 
produced in the catchment area. 
Figure 21 shows the location of the main forest products mills in the catchment area and the 
surrounding region.  Small sawmills with a capacity of less than 94,390 m3/r12and other small 
speciality mills, such as the cant mills, are not shown.  There is a string of large sawmills along 
Highway 16 from Houston to Prince George; they are indicated by a single symbol regardless of 
whether there is one or more mills of the same type in a community (e.g. Burns Lake and Prince 
George).  Similarly, the pulp mill symbol on Prince George represents the four pulp and paper 
mills in that city.  Table 12 lists the mills by type, company, location and capacity.  The capacity 
data was obtained from FLNRORD 2020.13

TABLE 12. MAJOR FOREST PRODUCTS MILLS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA AND SURROUNDING REGION. 
Much of the forest area in the catchment has been certified to the SFI standard, which has been 
adopted by Canfor and many of the other licensees.  The Burns Lake Community Forest is the 
main area within the catchment that has been certified to the FSC standard.  In all, between 80-
90% of the forest is certified.  Additionally, Pinnacle’s two pellet mills have been certified to the 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS 
 
 
43 
ArborVitae Environmental Services Ltd. 
 
Sustainable Biomass Program standard, which includes requirements associated with the 
sustainability of fibre sourcing. 
6.2 Pellet Plants 
Pellet mills in the catchment area include the two Pinnacle mills as well as a smaller facility in 
Vanderhoof (Premium Pellet).  The Vanderhoof plant is located immediately adjacent to a 
sawmill, which represents almost the entire the source of furnish for that mill. A new pellet 
plant was commissioned in 2018 in Smithers, to the west of the catchment area. That plant, 
which is a partnership between Pinnacle (70%) and West Fraser (30%), was built on the site of a 
former particleboard mill.  The new plant sources its fibre primarily from a large sawmill in 
Smithers and from other sawmills to the west of Smithers. Pacific Timber, part of the larger 
Tahtsa Group, is a relatively new company that was started to make use of salvage timber that 
was killed by the MPB epidemic. Its pellet mill in Prince George primarily sources from local 
sawmills. Distances between sawmills and pellet mills are generally less than 100 km. 
As detailed below, the pellet mills rely on residuals from the sawmills and use the lowest grades 
of fibre that the other mills do not or cannot use.  Thus, the pellet mills play an important role 
in supporting the local mills by providing a sales destination and revenue for the low-grade fibre 
and residuals.  Prior to the pellet mills, sawmill residuals were burned in beehive burners. 
The pellet mills obtain a minor part of their furnish (typically less than 5%) from the use of 
logging slash, which consists of the tops, branches, dead wood, and other non-merchantable 
material.  Slash is the woody debris left after harvested trees are processed into logs at landings 
along forest access roads; once the logs have been removed, the slash is ground into fibre and 
trucked to the pellet mill.  Haul distances generally range from 10 to 100 km.  The relatively low 
price for the bush grind material cannot support haul distances much beyond that.  Demand 
from the pellet plants gave rise to bush grinding; before that, this material was piled and 
burned or left to rot. 
6.3 Log Market 
There is a well-defined correspondence between the grade of a log and the type of mill that 
uses it. BC’s log grading system is summarized in Table 13.   
grade 1: premium sawlog (large good logs). 
grade 2: sawlog (the log has 50-100% firmwood, little defect, generally good condition). 
grade 4: lumber reject (the log has <50% firmwood and defects such as checks, spiral grain, etc.). 
grade 6: undersize (less than 10 cm diam) 
grade Z: firmwood reject (lots of rot, very poor form, etc.). 
TABLE 13. BC GOVERNMENT LOG QUALITY CLASSES. 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS 
 
 
44 
ArborVitae Environmental Services Ltd. 
 
There are five grades, with grade 1 the highest and grade Z lowest.  There are few grade 1 logs 
in the catchment area – grade 1 usually applies to logs from the coast which are larger than 
those from the catchment area.  The majority of quality sawlogs in the catchment area fall into 
grade 2; these logs have little defect and any defects that are present are minor, and at least 
50% of the log is firmwood. (Firmwood excludes all rot, char, holes and missing wood; detailed 
grade specifications can be found in the BC Interior Scaling Manual.) 
Grade 4 timber has less than 50% firmwood and more significant defects, such as checks and 
spiral grain.  Grade 6 timber is small-sized wood and Grade Z is the lowest quality of log.  
Grades 4, 6 and Z are known collectively as low-grade wood, which is not used by sawmills. One 
of the limitations of this grading system is that it does not distinguish dry and green logs.  
The widespread mortality caused by the MPB, and to a lesser extent by the wildfires, created a 
large supply of sawlogs from dead and dying trees.  The dead mature pine stayed standing for 
as long as 15 years, drying and remaining usable as lumber, although steadily deteriorating in 
quality.  The sawmills ran at levels close to full capacity during this period, and some increased 
their capacity, creating an abundant amount of residual fibre for the pellet mills.   
Until the end of 2018, dry dead sawlogs were in high demand and fetched a decent price at the 
sawmills.  The consultants estimate that as much as 75% of the MPB deadwood was grade 2; 
the remainder either went to the cant mills, got burned on the landing, or was left in the block. 
The low-grade logs are sorted and used by the local ‘cant’ mills.  The remaining, even lower 
grade logs or residuals such as broken pieces and dead wood are processed through a grinder 
for pelletizing.  A portable grinder operates on the Burns Lake pellet mill site. 
In 2019, sawmills stopped using the deadwood as it had deteriorated beyond the point where 
they could use it.  This phenomenon occurred throughout the BC Interior; the substantial 
reduction in supply has caused as many as 20 sawmills to close permanently in BC and others 
have reduced the number of shifts or taken downtime.  This change in the supply has reduced 
the amount of mill residual fibre available to Pinnacle, and the data in Figure 22 and in Figure 
23 show that the pellet mills responded by increasing their use of roundwood.  In discussions 
with the Burns Lake community forest manager, it is also apparent that the forest still contains 
large volumes of these dry dead trees which can only now be used as cants or as fibre furnish 
for wood pellets.  
Most recently, Canfor temporarily closed its sawmills in Houston and Vanderhoof from March 
30 to June, due to the slowdowns associated with COVID-19.  In May 2020 it also announced 
the permanent closure of its Isle Pierre sawmill near Vanderhoof (capacity 472,000 m3). Since 
June, lumber prices have risen dramatically and the surviving sawmills are at full production.

6.4 Pinnacle’s Fibre Intake by Source 
Fibre source data for the two Pinnacle mills was obtained from the government's Harvest and 
Billing System data.  Figure 22 and Table 14 show the furnish source data for Burns Lake while 
Figure 23 and Table 15 show the Houston mill data. Table 14 and Table 15 indicate that both 
mills rely heavily on sawmill residuals; until 2019 more than 70% of the fibre used by Burns Lake 
was mill residual and the Houston plant used an even higher percentage of mill residual. The 
effect of the supply shift described above is evident in 2019, as both facilities greatly increased 
their use of alternate fibre sources.  
The wood labelled as “Roundwood“ in Table 14 and Table 15 consists primarily of low-grade 
timber.  Logs that are trucked to the pellet mill are often too short to go through a sawmill but 
long enough to stay on the bunks of the truck. Another component of the roundwood is tops; 
sawlogs are taken to a 4” top and what remains can be delimbed and brought to the mill.  None 
of the material has an alternate use in the catchment area.  
The fibre labelled as “bush grind” is produced by flails that break down the logging slash left at 
roadside, which typically includes butt sections that are rotten or twisted, tops that are too 
small to recover for any other product, branches, broken pieces, etc.  This material has no other 
commercial use and if it is not ground, it is either burned or left to rot.  “Yard grind” represents 
the low-grade timber that is trucked to the pellet mill yard and ground there.

FIGURE 23. WOOD FIBRE FURNISH FOR HOUSTON PELLET PLANT, BY TYPE. 
There is an abundant supply of sawmill residuals and low-grade wood such that the pellet mills 
do not compete with other facilities.  Local loggers and forest managers informed the 
consultants that Pinnacle pays the lowest prices for timber of all catchment area mills, which is 
evidence of lack of competition.  To date, Pinnacle has not taken the additional step of 
conducting its own logging operations – all of the fibre that it has purchased has been a by-
product of traditional harvesting in the catchment area for either saw or cant mills.

7 Timber and Product Pricing 
7.1 Stumpage Prices 
Stumpage prices for grade 1 and 2 sawlogs have generally risen in the catchment area since 
2010, as shown in Figure 24, unadjusted for inflation.  The stumpage rates shown are the 
amounts paid to the Crown after the deduction of tenure costs associated with cruising, 
planning, silviculture, roads, etc. (In contrast, stumpage for salvage sawlogs (grade 4) remained 
at $0.25/m3 throughout the period.) 
 
FIGURE 24. AVERAGE GRADE 1 AND 2 SAWLOG STUMPAGE PRICES ($CDN/M3). 
The stumpage price increase during the 2010-2014 period can generally be attributed to the 
recovery in the global economy following the 2008-09 recession, which most severely affected 
US homebuilding.  As the economy recovered, US homebuilding levels and the Asian economy 
improved, and lumber prices rose (Figure 25).  Stumpage prices rose in tandem (Figure 24).  In 
addition, the US dollar notably appreciated against the Canadian dollar from 2014 onwards, 
adding additional impetus to increases in stumpage prices and Canadian lumber prices. 
2018 marked the end of the cyclical rise in lumber prices; the price spiked from US$ 200/m314 in 
January 2018 to a peak of US$ 279/m3 in June and ended the year at US$ 139/m3.  Thus, the 
average price for 2018 masks considerable volatility throughout the year.  From March to May 
2020, the worldwide closures of national economies sent lumber prices lower, only to reverse 
in May and reach record highs above US$ 400/m3for western 2x4’sin September.

FIGURE 25. AVERAGE ANNUAL PRICES OF 2X4 RANDOM LENGTHS KILN-DRIED #2 OR BETTER SPF. 
A contributing factor to the rise in stumpage is that sawmills in BC increased capacity to use the 
MPB salvage, and as the availability of salvage timber decreased, mills looking to replace the 
salvage put upward pressure on sawlog stumpage rates through higher bid prices for BCTS 
sales. 
The presence of BCTS and the licensing arrangements in BC make it almost impossible for any 
company or mill to corner the market for timber.  Because licensees are all allocated a portion 
of the volume-based harvest, and the holders of area-based tenure have control over how they 
dispose of timber, there are too many players that control some part of the market to enable 
any one player to develop any degree of market power.  The harvest contractors who hold 
licences and are free to sell their timber as they see fit also play a role in keeping markets 
balanced – no contractor wants to alienate a purchaser and so they would be reluctant to shift 
too much of their harvest to any one buyer. 
There is no evidence that the rising stumpage prices were driven by the pellet industry.  As one 
very experienced industry consultant noted: “In the Interior, the scarcity of timber supply (a 
legacy impact of the mountain pine beetle and wildfires) is having a strong influence on 
stumpage, driving up timber sale bids and stumpage rates.” He concluded that the “Interior 
stumpage rate has fluctuated based on the interplay of lumber prices and high bids” (Grieg 
2019).  Given the abundance of sawmill residuals and low-grade timber, the pellet mills have 
not bid on Crown timber since they would always be the lowest bidders on any timber sale.

7.2 Sawmill Residue, Pulp Chip, and Pellet Prices 
Sawmill residue is an important component of the feedstock used by pulp mills and pellet mills.  
The chip component of the residues is trucked to Prince George, where the nearest pulp mills 
to the catchment area are located.  The pellet mills, on the other hand can co-locate with 
sawmills, at a much lower capital outlay.  They take sawdust, planer shavings, and other low-
grade residual fibre. In addition, pellet facilities can use forest residues and very low-grade logs 
salvaged from fires and insect outbreaks.  
Figure 26 shows average pellet delivered feedstock prices in the US and Canada.  Since most of 
Canadian pellet production occurs in BC, the Canada index will be generally reflective of the 
prices of sawdust and shavings in BC.  The delivered cost of pellet feedstock was stable at 
US$55/ODMT until early 2018, when it began rising to reach US$70/ODMT in 2020.  
 
FIGURE 26. PELLET FEEDSTOCK PRICE INDEX FOR CANADA AND THE US. 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS

ArborVitae Environmental Services Ltd. 
 
A report in Canadian Biomass15 attributed the rising feedstock price to a reduction in sawmill 
residuals due to sawmill closures and curtailments, as the BC industry grappled with the end of 
the MPB salvage harvesting. After more than two years of increases, the pace of rising fibre 
costs slowed in Q4 2019, as mills reduced their operating rates and diversified their feedstocks. 
Many pellet mills are upgrading to allow more flexibility in feedstock inputs to counteract the 
reduced volume of sawmill residues.  Figure 27 shows that BC pulp log prices in the Interior 
region have followed a similar pattern as pellet feedstock prices – both categories of fibre are 
low end and are subject to similar supply constraints. 
In contrast, the lower panel of Figure 27 shows that residual chip prices have been stable to 
slightly decreasing, and there is no indication of pricing pressure due to demand from pellet 
mills because the pellet mills use different components of the fibre supply (i.e. sawdust and 
shavings).

8 Summary of Key Trends and Outlook 
8.1 The Forest 
The analysis period covers the MPB outbreak which killed hundreds of millions of cubic metres 
of lodgepole pine throughout the province; the catchment area was the hardest hit part of BC.  
Not only was the harvest level increased, the effects also included a reduction in the abundance 
of pine in the forest and a reduction in the average age of the forest. 
During the review period, there were additional measures put in place to protect biodiversity 
and key ecological elements of it, including ungulates and old growth.  These measures have 
resulted in partial withdrawals of land from timber harvest availability – in some areas 
harvesting is prohibited whereas in others it may proceed on a modified basis.  As a result of 
these measures, the CTHLB has been reduced over time, however the total area of forest has 
been unaffected.  There are indications that further restrictions are in the offing – caribou herds 
in BC continue to be threatened, and the Premier has appointed a two-person panel to review 
the management of old growth in the province.  The Old Growth panel released its report in 
September 2020 and has recommended additional protection for old growth timber. 
Forestry is a small driver of the deforestation that does occur (15%) due to the building of road 
networks and landings which are necessary for active forest management.  The government 
requires forest licensees to renew the areas that they harvest, and this is done well.  As a result 
forestry companies cause some deforestation through the construction of access roads, but the 
extent of it is estimated by the consultants to be on the order of .03-.04 % per annum, and the 
rate is declining as the forest access network is largely in place.  The majority of deforestation 
on Crown land is due to infrastructure development associated with agriculture, mining, 
energy, and transportation. Deforestation rates on private land are unknown, however given 
the low levels of private land in the catchment area, it does not have a material impact on the 
forest. 
8.2 The Industry 
The forest sector in the catchment area is based on the production of solid wood products, 
virtually all of which is lumber.  Prior to the arrival of the pellet mills, there was only a small 
market for sawmill residuals and low-grade wood – these were generally burned at the mill and 
in the bush, respectively.  Thus, the pellet and cant mills have created a market for low value 
fibre that did not exist previously, and in this way they have supported the existing sawmills, as 
well as forest contractors and associated businesses. 
As a result of the MPB, government and industry combined to enable a massive salvage effort, 
which completely altered the composition of the timber harvest.  Prior to the salvage, the 
CATCHMENT AREA ANALYSIS: PINNACLE RENEWABLE ENERGY’S BURNS LAKE & HOUSTON MILLS 
 
 
53 
ArborVitae Environmental Services Ltd. 
 
harvest consisted of live pine and spruce and but from 2002 or 2003 onwards, dead pine 
became a major part of the harvest stream and averaged 55% during the 2010-2019 period.  
Industry’s response to the MPB outbreak included boosting sawmill capacity was increased to 
use salvaged timber.  This created an abundant supply of low-cost sawmill residuals which 
provided Pinnacle with favourable conditions for it to construct the two pellet mills. 
In 2019, the MPB-killed wood declined below the sawlog quality threshold, which has led 
sawmills to close or curtail their production by reducing the number of shifts or taking down 
time.  Across BC, as many as 20 sawmills were expected to close permanently by 2019 and 
2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic has put added pressure on the weaker facilities.  Sawmill 
capacity will adjust to balance with the available harvest and residuals will continue to flow to 
pellet mills, however pellet mills have had to source more fibre from low-grade roundwood and 
bush grind. 
Industry dynamics are not driven by pellet mills since they cannot and do not process sawlogs 
and their cost structure will not enable them to harvest their own fibre. Pellet mills remain 
users of the lowest valued fibre and do not compete with pulp mills, cant mills or sawmills for 
fibre.  If anything, the market for residuals provided by pellet mills has provided support for 
sawmills to continue operations. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has created major economic disruptions across the world, and since 
we are still in the pandemic, and infection rates are worsening in the US as well as countries 
such as Brazil and Russia, the extent of its impact is far from clear.  While losses of employment 
and GD in Q2 2020 were worse than those in the Great Depression, recovery scenarios range 
from unrealistically rosy (i.e. a V-shaped recovery) to very pessimistic (the recovery period may 
take until 2023 or 2024).  The 2008-09 recession forced the BC solid wood sector to increase its 
diversification away from the US, so that China and Japan are the second and third most 
important markets for the industry, and their relative importance has increased vis-a-vis the US 
market.  This provides ground for optimism that the sector will be able to sustain itself during 
the next couple of years, now that it has adapted to the post-MPB harvest levels and forest 
conditions.

ANNEX 1- DEFINING THE CATCHMENT AREA 
The consultants were able to delineate the catchment area using wood fibre scaling data.  The 
Burns Lake facility has its own weigh scale run by Pinnacle, and so the company has detailed 
records of the incoming furnish for its mill.  The scale records are linked back to the harvest 
location through the use of a ‘timbermark’ and Pinnacle provided the consultants with these 
data for 2015 to the end of 2019. (A timber mark is a code that identifies the ownership of logs 
in BC and helps prevent theft of timber from Crown land.)  
Pinnacle’s current information management system has been in place since 2015, and earlier 
records were no longer readily available.  Pinnacle’s management informed the consultants 
that prior to 2015, sawmill residuals made up an even higher proportion of the furnish for each 
mill.  Our interviews with logging contractors confirmed this is the case.  
Table A16 shows the amounts of biomass used by Burns Lake each year by source, and the 
percentage of total fibre use from each source.  (Note that the percentages do not always add 
to 100% due to rounding.) As one would expect, the primary source area was the Lakes Timber 
Supply Area (TSA), which is where the mill is located.  Vanderhoof District in the Prince George 
TSA was the other main source, providing almost one third of the fibre used by Pinnacle.  There 
is a high degree of consistency, on an annual basis, in Burns Lake’s sourcing.  Bulkley TSA, which 
is a small TSA to the north of the Morice TSA, is a distant third in terms of supply, and the 
Kispiox TSA, which is located north of the Bulkley TSA, provides a minor contribution.  The 
Other source areas include Kalum TSA (located west of the Morice and Bulkley TSAs) and the 
province of Alberta. 
Table A17shows the source locations of the fibre entering Pinnacle’s Houston mill. It is weighed 
at one of two scales owned by other companies, under an arrangement with Pinnacle.  These 
data were obtained from Pinnacle and compiled by the consultants.  For this mill, the home 
TSA, Morice, provides the majority of fibre used by the mill, with a minor contribution from 
Bulkley.  
Table A18 shows the sourcing of fibre for the two Pinnacle mills combined – 90% of the 
sourcing comes from Lakes, Morice and Vanderhoof, and hence these three areas were 
identified as the catchment area for these two pellet mills.  Figure 28 shows the catchment area 
in the regional context.
