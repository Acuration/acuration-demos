Drax – August 2019 
Executive Summary 
A mill’s catchment area is the area in which a single pellet mill (“nucleus mill”) has directly acquired fiber 
since the mill started operations, including any additional forest areas where future purchase contracts 
exist. In accordance with Drax’s initiative to monitor its sourcing regions and the catchment areas in 
which its mills operate, this report, specifically, examines the fiber catchment area for Drax’s Amite 
BioEnergy pellet mill located in Gloster, Mississippi. 
The Amite BioEnergy catchment area analysis is broken down into five sections:  
1. Market Profile & Resource Assessment – includes catchment area-specific details regarding land 
and forest area, timber inventory, timber growth, and timber removals. 
2. Wood Demand & Raw Material Cost Assessment – identifies all mills (sources of wood demand) 
that procure wood from within the Amite BioEnergy fiber catchment area; provides details 
regarding annual wood demand and current raw material costs (timber prices) within the 
catchment area. 
3. Forest Management Practices Assessment – includes a market study and logger survey that 
examines how forest management practices have changed in the catchment area since Amite 
BioEnergy commenced production.  
4. Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook – identifies trends and changes in land and forest area, 
timber inventory, growth, harvest removals, wood demand, and raw material prices since 2010; 
identifies and details any links between bioenergy-related wood demand and the 
aforementioned items. This section also includes a market outlook that details anticipated 
changes in wood demand and raw material costs for the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill through the 
year 2022. 
5. Analysis Summary & Findings – provides a summary of the Amite BioEnergy catchment area 
analysis and details the report’s findings.  
Ultimately, the focus of this report is to assess and identify the impact the Drax pellet mill and bioenergy-
related wood demand has had on this market since the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill commenced 
production in late 2014. A summary of the report’s key findings has been provided on the following 
pages.

Drax – August 2019 
Is there any evidence that bioenergy 
demand has caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
Deforestation? 
No. US Forest Service data shows the opposite. Total timberland acreage has 
increased 1% since Amite BioEnergy commenced production in late 2014.  
A change in management practices 
(rotation lengths, thinnings, 
conversion from hardwood to pine)? 
No / Inconclusive. Changes in management practices have occurred in the 
catchment area over the last 5-10 years, but there is little evidence to 
suggest bioenergy demand has caused these changes. Market research 
shows thinnings have declined in this catchment area since 2014 (when 
Amite BioEnergy commenced production). However, local loggers identify 
poor markets conditions for the decrease in thinnings, not increased 
bioenergy demand.   
The primary focus of timber management in this area is the production of 
sawtimber grade timber, and rotation lengths of managed forests have 
remained unchanged (between 25-35 years of age) despite increases in 
bioenergy demand. Increased bioenergy demand, however, has benefited 
landowners in this catchment area, providing additional outlets for 
pulpwood removed from thinnings – a management activity necessary for 
sawtimber production. 
Conversion from naturally regenerated hardwood to planted pine has 
occurred in the catchment area. From 2014 through 2017, the latest 
available, planted pine acreage increased 7% while naturally generated 
hardwood timberland acreage decreased 5%. However, it is inconclusive as 
to whether bioenergy demand caused this change. Conversion from 
naturally regenerated timber to planted pine is typical in this market. As 
less productive naturally regenerated timber stands are harvested, these 
stands are replaced with more productive planted pine (improved genetics 
that offer better growth, improved form, reduced susceptibility to disease, 
and improved financial returns) to be managed for sawtimber production.   
Diversion from other markets? 
No. Since 2014, softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has 
increased 8% while demand for softwood sawlogs and hardwood 
pulpwood has increased 53% and 5%, respectively. Demand for hardwood 
sawlogs is down an estimated 24% since 2014; however, hardwood sawlog 
demand has been increasing since 2017. 
An abnormal increase in wood 
prices? 
No. Prices for delivered pine pulpwood (the primary raw material consumed by 
Amite BioEnergy) have rather decreased 12% since the pellet mill 
commenced production in 2014. And while prices for pine sawmill 
residuals and in-woods chips (the other two raw materials consumed by 
Amite BioEnergy) are both up 3% compared to 2014 levels, prices have 
declined each of the last two years for pine sawmill residuals and each of 
the last three years for in-woods chips.  
A reduction in growing stock timber? 
No / Inconclusive. Total growing stock inventory in the catchment area 
increased 5% from 2014 through 2017, the latest available. Specifically, 
pine sawtimber inventory increased 13%, pine chip-n-saw inventory 
increased 24%, and pine pulpwood inventory decreased 12% over this 
period. There is little evidence to suggest that increased bioenergy 
demand has caused this reduction in pine pulpwood inventory. Rather, the 
increase in total in timber inventory (including both pine sawtimber and 
chip-n-saw inventory) along with the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory 
is indicative of an aging forest. It also suggests the forest is in a state of 
transition, with pine pulpwood moving up in product class (to chip-n-saw).

Drax – August 2019 
Is there any evidence that bioenergy 
demand has caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
A reduction in the sequestration rate 
of carbon? 
No. US Forest Service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing 
stock timber has decreased slightly since 2014, and a slower timber growth 
rate essentially represents a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon. 
However, the reduced growth rate and subsequent reduction in the 
sequestration rate of carbon is due to the aging of the forest (changes in 
timber age class distribution), not to increases in bioenergy demand.  
An increase in harvesting above the 
sustainable yield capacity of the 
forest area? 
No. Growth-to-removals ratios, which compare annual timber growth to annual 
harvests, provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well 
as a gauge of market sustainability. In 2017, the latest available, the 
growth-to-removals ratio for pine pulpwood equaled 1.80 (a value greater 
than 1.0 indicates sustainable harvest levels). Even with the increased 
harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand, harvest levels remain 
well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area. 
 
Impact of bioenergy demand on:  
Analysis Findings 
Timber growing stock inventory 
Neutral. Total wood demand (from biomass and other solid wood products) is 
up more than 35% compared to 2014 levels. Intuitively, increased demand 
means more timber is harvested, which reduces total growing stock 
inventory. However, in this catchment area, inventories are so substantial 
that increases in demand from bioenergy, as well as from other sources, 
have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth, and, as such, 
total growing stock inventory has continued to increase – an average of 2% 
per year since 2014 (when Amite BioEnergy commenced production).  
Timber growth rates 
Neutral. Timber growth rates have declined since 2014; however, evidence 
suggests the reduction in growth rates is more a product of an aging forest 
and not due to changes in bioenergy demand.  
Additionally, young planted pine stands are actually growing at a faster rate 
than ever before – due to the continued improvement of seedling genetics. 
And, as timber is harvested and these stands are replanted in pine (as has 
historically occurred in the catchment area), over the long term, the 
average timber growth rate is likely to increase. 
Forest area 
Positive / Neutral. Total forest (timberland) area in the catchment area 
increased more than 5,200 hectares from 2014 through 2017, the latest 
available. And while our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found 
a moderately strong relationship between the two, findings are inconclusive 
as to whether the increase in timberland acreage can be attributed to 
increases in biomass demand. 
Wood prices 
Neutral. Despite the additional wood demand placed on this market by Amite 
BioEnergy, since 2014, prices for delivered pine pulpwood (the primary raw 
material consumed by Amite BioEnergy) have decreased 12% in the 
catchment area. Prices for pine sawmill residuals and in-woods chips (the 
other two raw materials consumed by Amite BioEnergy) have also declined 
over the last several years – down 3% since 2016 for pine sawmill residuals 
and down 3% since 2015 for in-woods chips.  
According to the laws of supply and demand, for price to decrease despite 
an increase in demand, an even larger increase in supply must occur. And 
that’s what we’ve seen in this catchment area. Increases in bioenergy

Impact of bioenergy demand on:  
Analysis Findings 
demand have been matched with decreases in raw material prices, and it’s 
the increase in wood supply that’s driven prices downward, not increases in 
bioenergy demand.    
Markets for solid wood products 
Positive / Neutral. In the Amite BioEnergy catchment area, demand for 
softwood sawlogs to produce lumber has increased more than 50% since 
2014. A by-product of the sawmilling process is sawmill residuals – a 
material utilized by Amite BioEnergy to produce wood pellets. With the 
increase in softwood lumber production has come an increase in sawmill 
residuals, some of which has been consumed by Amite BioEnergy. Not only 
has Amite BioEnergy benefited from the greater availability of this by-
product, but lumber producers have also benefited, as Amite BioEnergy has 
provided an additional outlet for these producers and their by-products. 
The impact of bioenergy demand on hardwood markets, however, has been 
neutral. Amite BioEnergy utilizes no hardwood in its production of wood 
pellets, and there is no strong evidence to suggest bioenergy demand has 
had any significant impact on hardwood markets in the catchment area.

2. Market Profile & Resource Assessment 
A mill’s catchment area is the area in which a single pellet mill (“nucleus mill”) has directly acquired fiber 
since the mill started operations, including any additional forest areas where future purchase contracts 
exist. Amite BioEnergy’s catchment area, whose shape was derived by georeferencing site-specific data 
from Drax’s primary feedstock supplies to the mill, extends as far out as 80 kilometers from the mill’s 
location in Gloster, Mississippi, and includes areas located within nine different counties in southwest 
Mississippi and two different parishes in Louisiana (see Figure 1). 
Since information and data pertaining to land classification, timber inventory, growth, and removals is 
provided at the individual county level, geospatial analysis software (Esri ArcGIS) was used to identify the 
proportion of each county located within the catchment area (see Table 1).

2.1.1  Timberland 
Forestland, defined by the USDA as land at least 10% stock with trees of any kind, totals approximately 
557,206 hectares and constitutes 84% of the catchment area’s total land area.  
Timberland, or forestland that is capable of producing at least 0.5 m3 of industrial wood per year, 
constitutes over 99% of total forestland in the catchment area and totals approximately 554,176 
hectares. (Note that not all forestland is capable of commercial timber production, but in this catchment 
area, 99% of all forestland is considered commercially productive. Also note that the following analysis 
will focus on and include timber inventory, growth, and removals data from timberland only). 
 
2.1.1.1  By Ownership Group 
Ownership of timberland in the Amite BioEnergy catchment area is predominantly privately owned. 
According to US Forest Service - Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from 2017, the latest available, 
privately-owned timberland totaled approximately 472,305 hectares (85%), compared to 57,081 hectares 
(10%) of National Forest, 24,776 hectares (5%) owned by state and local authorities, and 15 hectares 
(<1%) owned by other federal authorities.

2.1.1.2  By Forest Type and Age Class 
According to US Forest Service data, of the 554,176 hectares of timberland in the catchment area, 
approximately 53% (296,757 hectares) is pine, 37% (211,485 hectares) is hardwood, and 9% (45,933 
hectares) is mixed pine-hardwood. 
Distribution of timberland area by age class varies by forest type. Approximately 76% of pine timberland 
is 30 years of age or younger, with 50% 16-30 years of age. In contrast, approximately 65% of hardwood 
timberland area is 36-75 years of age, with 44% 51-75 years of age. Distribution of mixed pine-hardwood 
timberland by age class is a bit more wide-spread than that of both pine and hardwood timberland, with 
approximately 73% of mixed pine-hardwood timberland 26-80 years of age, with 53% 31-65 years of age. 
Note that the age class distributions of both pine and hardwood timberland are in line with typical 
management regimes for these two species. In this market, timber management is focused on sawtimber 
production, and in general, pine reaches sawtimber grade in 25-30 years whereas hardwoods grow 
slower and typically don’t reach sawtimber grade until around age 40-50.

2.2  Timber Inventory 
Timber inventory data for the Amite BioEnergy catchment area is provided by the US Forest Service - 
Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program. FIA data utilizes approximately 50-60 sample plots per county 
to calculate inventory estimates, with sampling errors of 10-25%.  
Note that this section provides timber inventory details as of 20171, the most current available. Further 
analysis, including inventory projections through 2022, is provided in the Market Analysis, Trends, & 
Outlook section beginning on page 44. 
 
2.2.1  By Ownership Group 
Growing stock inventory on timberland in the Amite BioEnergy catchment area totals an estimated 89.6 
million m3, of which approximately 80% (71.9 million m3) is privately owned, 17% (14.9 million m3) is 
National Forest, 3% (2.7 million m3) is owned by state and local authorities, and <1% (22,315 m3) is owned 
by other federal authorities.  
Distribution of total growing stock inventory by ownership group varies slightly by major species group 
(softwood vs. hardwood). According to the US Forest Service, inventory of softwood growing stock on 
timberland totals approximately 53.1 million m3 (59% of total inventory), of which 77% (40.9 million m3) is 
privately owned, 20% (10.8 million m3) is National Forest, and 3% (1.4 million m3) is owned by state and 
local authorities. 
Hardwood growing stock inventory in the catchment area totals an estimated 36.6 million m3 (41% of 
total inventory), with approximately 85% (31.1 million m3) privately owned, 11% (4.2 million m3) National 
Forest, 4% (1.3 million m3) owned by state and local authorities, and <1% (22,315 m3) owned by other 
federal authorities.

2.2.2  By Diameter Class Distribution 
Distribution of total growing stock inventory on timberland by diameter class varies by major species 
group. Based on the most current US Forest Service data, the distribution of softwood growing stock 
inventory shows that approximately 73% (38.9 million m3) is less than 17 inches in diameter, with 59% 
(31.1 million m3) of softwood inventory 7-15 inches in diameter. 
In contrast, distribution of hardwood growing stock in the catchment area shows that 83% (30.3 million 
m3) is 7-25 inches in diameter, with approximately 54% (19.6 million m3) of hardwood inventory 11-21 
inches in diameter. 
In addition, FIA estimates of diameter class distribution by major species group allow us to break down 
volume estimates according to major timber product. Since pine constitutes greater than 98% of total 
softwood inventory in the catchment area (according to FIA data), for these calculations, all softwood 
inventory is considered pine. Individual product specifications are defined as follows: 
Major Product  
DBH (inches) 
Pine Pulpwood  
5.0 – 8.9 
Pine Chip-n-saw 
9.0 – 11.9 
Pine Sawtimber  
12.0+ 
Hardwood Pulpwood 
5.0 – 11.9 
Hardwood Sawtimber  12.0+ 
 
Based on these product specifications, approximately 28.3 million m3 of total growing stock inventory is 
classified as pine sawtimber (32%), compared to 13.7 million m3 of pine chip-n-saw (15%), 11.1 million m3 
of pine pulpwood (12%), 27.1 million m3 of hardwood sawtimber (30%), and 9.5 million m3 of hardwood 
pulpwood (11%).

2.2.3  By Age Class Distribution 
Distribution of total growing stock volume on timberland by age class is bimodal, with approximately 34% 
of total inventory 16-30 years of age and 28% of total inventory 51-70 years of age (see Figure 8). This is 
explained by major species composition, as softwood growing stock averages roughly 36 years of age 
compared to 56 years of age for hardwood growing stock. 
According to US Forest Service data, the distribution of softwood growing stock volume by age class 
shows that 66% (35.2 million m3) is 11-40 years of age, with approximately 49% (26.1 million m3) 16-30 
years of age. 
Distribution of hardwood growing stock in the catchment area by age class shows approximately 76% 
(27.7 million m3) is 36-80 years of age, with 51% (18.8 million m3) of hardwood growing stock volume 51-
75 years of age.

2.2.4  By Stand Origin 
US Forest Service data includes two classifications for stand origin: 1) naturally regenerated timber stands 
and 2) planted timber stands. Based on the most current US Forest Service FIA estimates, approximately 
68% of total growing stock volume in the catchment area, or 61.0 million m3, is of natural origin, 
compared to 32% (28.6 million m3) that was planted. However, note that stand origin distribution varies 
widely by major species group. 
According to US Forest Service data, approximately 49% (26.1 million m3) of softwood growing stock is 
naturally regenerated, whereas 51% (26.9 million m3) is planted. In contrast, approximately 95% (34.8 
million m3) of hardwood inventory is naturally regenerated, compared to 5% (1.7 million m3) planted.

2.2.5  Commercially Available Timber Inventory 
Private landowners have the ability to sell their timber whenever and to whomever they decide, as such, 
all privately-owned timber inventory is considered commercially available. In the Amite BioEnergy 
catchment area, this totals an estimated 71.9 million m3, or 80% of total growing stock volume. While 
only privately-owned timber is considered commercially available, note that a significant portion of 
National Forest and state and locally owned timberland is actively managed for timber production. 
The US Forest Service (USFS) manages all National Forests and the overriding objective of the USFS’s 
forest management program is to ensure that National Forests are managed in an ecologically sustainable 
manner. Other objectives include maintaining vegetation, restoring ecosystems, reducing hazards, and 
maintaining forest health. Timber harvests are a management tool the USFS utilizes to help meet these 
objectives. However, in accordance with the National Forest Management Act of 1976, the USFS must 
manage national forests on a maximum sustained yield basis. Ultimately, this translates to longer rotation 
lengths and a smaller percentage of National Forest timber that is harvested annually. 
In Mississippi, much of the timberland owned by state and local authorities is 16th section land2 that is 
managed by the Mississippi Forestry Commission under the direction of the Mississippi Secretary of State 
and in cooperation with local school districts. Like National Forests, state timberlands are also managed 
on a maximum sustained yield basis.  
Conservatively, 40-60% of this timberland, or an additional 7-10 million m3 of timber, is likely available. 
However, for this analysis, National Forests and state and locally owned timber is not considered 
commercially available.

2.3.3  Growth-to-Removal Ratios 
Growth-to-removals analysis compares annual timber growth to annual harvests and provides a measure 
of market demand relative to supply. A growth-to-removals ratio of 1.0 indicates a balanced market 
where growth equals removals. A value of >1 indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying sustainable 
harvest levels (as well as oversupply). A value of <1 indicates removals (or harvest levels) exceed growth, 
signifying more highly competitive market conditions and harvest levels that are unsustainable over the 
long term. 
According to US Forest Service data from 2017, the latest available, overall inventory growth totaled 5.1 
million m3, compared to total harvest removals of 2.4 million m3, or a growth-to-removals ratio of 2.12. 
The growth-to-removal ratio for softwood species was 2.02, compared to 2.58 for hardwood species. 
Growth-to-removals ratios by species and individual timber product are as follows: pine sawtimber=1.96, 
pine chip-n-saw=2.50, pine pulpwood=1.80, hardwood sawtimber=1.74, and hardwood pulpwood=5.32. 
Note that growth-to-removal ratios for all five major timber products are well above 1.0, indicating 
sustainable market conditions as well as oversupply.

3. Wood Demand & Raw Material Cost Assessment 
3.1  Mill Capacity & Wood Demand  
According to TimberMart-South’s mill database, as of June 2019, there were 44 major mills operating in 
and around the Amite BioEnergy catchment area (within a 160-kilometer radius of Drax’s pellet mill in 
Gloster, Mississippi). This includes 26 lumber mills (14 softwood mills and 12 hardwood mills), five 
pulp/paper mills, five panel (plywood/OSB) mills, six chip mills, and two pellet mills (including Amite 
BioEnergy).  
Total production capacity associated with these 44 mills translates to approximately 21.6 million tonnes 
of wood per year. However, not all wood procurement for these mills occurs within Amite BioEnergy’s 
catchment area. Based on the relative location of these mills to Amite BioEnergy and its catchment area, 
we estimate the total allocated capacity of these mills to the BioEnergy catchment area at approximately 
5,296,598 tonnes (Table 12).  
Note that total capacity is not the same as actual demand, but rather the maximum potential demand 
associated with mills running at full production capacity. Details regarding historic wood demand in the 
catchment area are provided in the Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook section beginning on page 44.

3.2.4  Timber Price Drivers 
A detailed assessment of raw material prices and price trends is provided in the Market Trends, Analysis, 
& Outlook section beginning on page 44. However, we would like to point out and highlight some of the 
major price drivers and indicators. 
 Production.  Production levels for forest products are representative of wood demand and have 
historically been a strong indicator of timber price. The figure below (left) shows annual Southern 
pine lumber production and annual average delivered pine sawtimber prices in the Amite 
BioEnergy catchment area from 2010-2018. Looking at this figure, pine sawtimber price has 
generally tracked lumber production, particularly from 2011-2015. Over this period, production 
increased 24% and pine sawtimber price increased 12%. However, we’d like to note that the 
recent divergence of lumber production and pine sawtimber price (since 2015) is largely due to 
increases in wood supply, which is documented in detail in subsequent sections of this report.  
Similarly, US paper and paperboard production has historically been a strong indicator of pine 
pulpwood price (see figure below (right) of annual US paper and paperboard production and 
catchment area delivered pine pulpwood prices from 2010-2018).

 Domestic Economy.  The state of the domestic economy drives changes in timber prices both 
locally and across the Southern region. Specifically, financial markets have historically been a 
strong indicator of price. Over the long term, timber prices, specifically pine sawtimber price, 
have generally tracked both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 (see figure 
below of the DJIA and catchment area delivered pine sawtimber prices from 2010-2018).

Drax – August 2019 
 Housing Starts. US residential building construction is a principal driver of the wood products 
industry and, historically, domestic housing starts have been a major indicator of sawtimber 
price. For instance, US housing starts totaled just over 600,000 units in 2011, increasing to over 
1.1 million units in 2015. Delivered pine sawtimber prices closely tracked housing starts over this 
period, increasing 12% from 2011-2015 (see figure below). But while housing starts have 
continued to increase since 2015 (to nearly 1.3 million units in 2018), delivered pine sawtimber 
prices have remained relatively flat. As we saw with pine sawtimber price and lumber production, 
pine sawtimber price and housing starts have also diverged since 2015 – largely due to wood 
oversupply.

 International Trade. International trade and foreign trade policy also drives changes in timber 
prices, particularly changes in hardwood sawtimber price. Hardwood log and lumber exports, 
specifically, constitute around 65-75% of total US log and lumber exports, and these exports are 
driven largely by exchange rates. For instance, the US trade weighted exchange rate (TWEX) 
increased from 97 in 2011 to 122 in 2016 (a value greater than 100 is indicative of a strong US 
dollar), and, over this same period, delivered hardwood sawtimber prices in the catchment area 
increased nearly 30% (see figure below (left)). However, trade policies enacted by the current US 
President since then have slowed growth in US exports and consequently hardwood sawtimber 
prices have held relatively flat since 2016.

 Weather. Weather trends also impact timber prices; however, these trends are much more 
seasonal in nature and affect short-term price movements. In this region, wet conditions typically 
persist throughout the winter (in the 1st and 4th quarters of the year), creating wood accessibility 
issues and constraining supply. And as a result, timber prices increase over the short term. 
However, wet winters are followed by hot summers, which alleviate supply constraints and 
provide greater access to wood. In turn, with supply no longer an issue, timber prices decline in 
the short term (typically during the 2nd or 3rd quarter of the year). 
The figure below shows quarterly average delivered pine pulpwood prices in the Amite BioEnergy 
catchment area since 2010. Looking at this figure you can see the seasonality in price movements 
(seasonal weather-related price spikes highlighted in light red). An example of a short-term, 
weather-driven price spike occurred in 1Q 2019, with delivered pine pulpwood price increasing 
11% quarter-over-quarter due largely to wet conditions that persisted in this market from 
September 2018 through March 2019.

4. Forest Management Practices Assessment 
To assess how forest management practices in both the catchment area and other similar areas across 
the US South have changed since 2010, we examined historical timber sales reported to TimberMart-
South as well as conducted interviews with multiple loggers who operate in and around the Amite 
BioEnergy catchment area. 
 
4.1  TimberMart-South Harvest Trends 
The TimberMart-South (TMS) sales database includes over 46,000 unique timber sales that have occurred 
throughout the TMS 11-state region since 2010. In addition to providing details regarding timber prices 
(by product), these reported sales include information regarding date of sale, location, sale volume, sale 
size (hectares), sale type (final harvest/clearcut vs. thinning), and other unique sale characteristics. The 
data provided in the following section contains some of these stumpage characteristic details, particularly 
those related to trends in sale type and harvesting activities. 
The Amite BioEnergy catchment area is located in two different TMS regions: Mississippi Region 2 and 
Louisiana Region 2 (see highlighted portion Figure 19). So, in addition to providing region-wide 
information, data and trends for this 2-region area (denoted ‘Amite BioEnergy market’ hereafter) have 
been provided and are intended to be representative of the catchment area.   
Note that TMS database sales utilized for this portion of the assessment only includes those reported 
sales with total sale volumes between 500 and 50,000 tonnes. Sales that fell outside these parameters 
were excluded to ensure consistency and to mitigate potential bias from major outliers.

Drax – August 2019 
4.1.1  Total Sale Area 
In the Amite BioEnergy market, total sale area that fell within the study’s parameters averaged 3,435 
hectares per year from 2010 through 2014, doubling and averaging 6,840 hectares per year since 2015. 
Note there is no evidence connecting this increase in sale area to increases in biomass demand, but 
rather this increase in total sale area is due to new reporters participating in TMS’s market survey and an 
increase in the total number of reported sales that fell within the study’s parameters. 
More importantly, we want to focus on distribution of reported sale area by harvest type (clearcut vs. 
thinning). In the Amite BioEnergy market, thinned hectares as a percentage of total reported sale area 
peaked in 2013 at 79% but steadily declined over the three years that followed to 29% in 2016. However, 
that percentage has increased the last several years and in 2018 equaled 45%. 
Comparing trends in the Amite BioEnergy market to South-wide market trends, thinned hectares as a 
percentage of total reported sale area for the TMS 11-state Southern region peaked in 2011 at 69%. 
However, the proportion of area thinned steadily declined over the five years that followed, falling to 33% 
in 2016. The distribution of thinned area has slowly increased since that time and in 2018 equaled 41%. 
Ultimately, this study identified a decreasing trend in the percentage of area thinned in both the Amite 
BioEnergy market and across the Southern region as a whole, suggesting that thinnings decrease when 
markets are weak. Specifically, thinned area as a percentage of total reported sale area in the Amite 
BioEnergy market averaged 62% from 2010-2013 but 45% from 2014-2018. Similarly, the distribution of 
thinned area across the South averaged 59% from 2010-2013 and 41% from 2014-2018.

4.1.2  Total Sale Volume 
In the Amite BioEnergy market, total reported sale volume has changed very little since 2010. However, 
as with total sale area, the distribution of total sale volume by harvest type shows the proportion of total 
volume attributed to thinnings decreasing since 2010. In the Amite BioEnergy market, volume thinned as 
a percentage of total reported sale volume trended downwards from 43% in 2010 to 26% in 2016 (and 
increasing slightly to 30% in 2018).  
Similarly, the distribution of total sale volume by harvest type for the entire TMS 11-state region also 
shows the proportion of total volume attributed to thinnings declining over this period. Across the TMS 
11-state region, volume thinned as a percentage of total reported sale volume decreased from 41% in 
2010 to 23% in 2017 (and increasing slightly to 24% in 2018). 
Note that the overall decreasing trend in thinning volume (as a percentage of total sale volume) is in line 
with what typically occurs when markets are weak. That is, when timber markets are weak, loggers tend 
to reduce the amount of thinnings they conduct because the profitability associated with thinnings is 
lower than that associated with clearcut harvests.

4.1.3  Average Sale Size 
Average sale size in the Amite BioEnergy market has averaged 41 hectares in size since 2010. However, 
reported sales data shows that thinnings have averaged 28% larger (+10 hectares) than clearcuts, with 
thinnings averaging 46 hectares in size compared to 36 hectares for clearcuts.  
The average sale size has been slightly larger across the TMS 11-state region as a whole, averaging 49 
hectares in size since 2010. However, average sale size by harvest type shows a similar relationship to 
what was observed between clearcuts and thinnings in the Amite BioEnergy market. Across the US South 
since 2010, thinnings have averaged 31% larger (+14 hectares) than clearcuts, with thinnings averaging 57 
hectares in size compared to 43 hectares for clearcuts.  
We’d like to note that clearcuts are typically smaller in size compared to thinnings due to capital 
requirements, as clearcuts generally remove more timber volume per acre than do thinnings. For 
example, given the same amount of capital, a wood buyer/logger can purchase a 35-hectare tract to be 
clear cut or a 50-hectare tract to be thinned. Also, loggers typically prefer larger tracts for thinning 
because it allows them to take advantage of economies of scale.

4.2  Logger Interviews/Survey 
For this assessment, Hood Consulting also interviewed multiple loggers to provide first-hand accounts of 
how forest management practices, specifically harvest activities, have changed since 2010. Note that all 
professionals interviewed operate in and around the Amite BioEnergy catchment area. 
The individuals interviewed include Dale Stephens, the southwest Mississippi regional forester for Charles 
Donald Pulpwood, Inc., John Coates, region manager of Good Hope Inc., and Lance Smith, owner of Lance 
Smith Logging Inc. Together, the three companies represented operate over 50 crews, deliver more than 
85,000 loads per year, and have over 125 years of combined logging experience.

Each of the individuals interviewed were asked the following questions pertaining to the logging industry 
and harvesting practices. A summary of the interviewees’ answers is provided on the following page. 
1. How have forest management practices, specifically thinning practices, changed since 2010? 
2. Have thinnings become more/less prevalent over the last 8-10 years? 
3. Based on your experience, do thinnings decline (or pick up) when timber markets weaken? 
4. How has forest certification and carbon sequestration affected logging and logging practices? 
5. Based on your experience, what drives (or has driven) changes in logging and logging practices? 
6. What are your expectations regarding changes in timber prices over the next 3-5 years? 
 
 
 
 
Charles Donald Pulpwood, Inc. was originally founded in 1946 
and is based out of Port Gibson, Mississippi. Charles Donald 
Pulpwood operates four logging crews throughout central and 
south Mississippi, delivering an average of 1,200-1,300 loads 
per year.  
Good Hope Inc. was founded in 1982 and is based out of 
Natchez, Mississippi. Good Hope operated 40-50 logging crews 
and works throughout Mississippi, Louisiana, and in eastern 
Arkansas, delivering 75,000-80,000 loads per year.  
Lance Smith Logging Inc. was founded in 2002 and is based out 
of Brookhaven, Mississippi. Lance operates predominantly in 
southwest and south-central Mississippi, operating two logging 
crews and delivering 4,500-5,000 loads per year.

Table 14. Logger Interview Questions & Reponses 
Question 
Interviewee Responses 
How have forest 
management practices, 
particularly thinning 
practices, changed since 
2010? 
All individuals interviewed stated that actual logging and thinning practices have not 
changed since 2010. 
  
Have thinnings become 
more/less prevalent over 
the last 8-10 years? 
Two of the interviewees stated that the proportion of their respective company’s 
logging activities attributed to thinnings has decline since 2010, but even more so 
the last several years. Both pointed to weak market conditions for pine pulpwood, 
which is the predominant timber product removed (harvested) with 1st thinnings. 
The same two individuals also stated the reduction in thinnings was an internal 
company decision – to focus primarily on clearcut harvests, which provide improved 
profit margins over thinnings.  
One interviewee stated that his company focuses primarily on pulpwood production 
and logging, and that that proportion of his company’s logging activites attributed to 
thinnings has essentially remained the same every year since 2010, despite changes 
in market conditions.  
Based on your 
experience, do thinnings 
decline (or pick up) when 
timber markets weaken? 
All three interviewees stated that thinnings typically decline when markets weaken, 
due in part to landowners’ unwillingness to sell timber and because loggers 
intentionally reduce the amount of thinnings they perform (it becomes unprofitable 
for loggers when markets weaken and prices fall below a certain level).  
How has forest 
certification and carbon 
sequestration affected 
logging and logging 
practices? 
All three individuals interviewed stated that their companies’ loggers are trained 
through Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) programs. However, certification has not 
affected actual logging practices, noting just the additional time required to 
complete certification training programs. 
All three stated that carbon sequestration has had no effect on logging and logging 
practices. 
Based on your 
experience, what drives 
(or has driven) changes in 
logging and logging 
practices? 
Multiple drivers of change were identified by the interviewed individuals, including: 
­ 
Efficiency of new machines/logging equipment (a single logging crew’s 
production capabilities has doubled over the last 10 years, from 7-8 
loads/day to 15-16 loads/day) 
­ 
Mill closures (leads to farther haul distances and reduced logger margins) 
­ 
Logger workforce (one individual stated that his company has started 
focusing on buying winter-accessible tracts (often paying premium prices) 
to ensure continued work for their loggers  so they don’t lose 
experienced loggers due to downtime and lack of work)  
What are your 
expectations regarding 
changes in timber prices 
over the next 3-5 years? 
All three interviewees expressed concern, particularly regarding pine pulpwood 
markets with the recent shutdown that occurred at Georgia-Pacific’s Port Hudson 
mill. Each of these individuals anticipate pine pulpwood prices holding flat (or even 
declining a bit) over the next several years. 
A common thought amongst these individuals is that conditions need to change, or 
more and more logger attrition will occur in this area. Increased equipment and 
insurance costs already make logging profitability difficult, and if timber prices

5. Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook 
The following section provides an examination and assessment of market trends in the Amite BioEnergy 
catchment area since 2010, including changes in forest area, timber inventory, growth, removals, wood 
demand, and raw material costs. This section also identifies and details any links between these variables 
and both biomass demand and total wood demand. 
In addition, we have provided a market outlook through 2022. This outlook details anticipated changes in 
wood demand and how these anticipated changes are likely to impact raw material costs in the 
catchment area over the next several years. 
 
5.1  Market Trends & Analysis 
A key aspect of this analysis includes assessing and identifying any links or relationships between wood 
demand and other market changes (i.e. forest area, inventory, raw material prices, etc.) in the catchment 
area since 2010. As such, this section will begin with our analysis of wood demand.  
 
5.1.1  Wood Demand 
Total wood demand3 in the Amite Bioenergy catchment area doubled from an estimated 2,502,954 
tonnes in 2010 to 5,001,021 tonnes in 2018, or an average increase of 9.0% over this period. Softwood 
pulpwood demand, specifically, increased an estimated 1,027,178 tonnes over this same period, from 
1,110,677 tonnes in 2010 to 2,137,855 tonnes in 2018 (+93% total; +8.5% per year average).

3 Wood demand estimates for the Amite BioEnergy catchment area are based on USDA Forest Service – Timber Products Output (TPO) data, 
which estimates industrial uses of roundwood via survey of all primary wood-using mills within each state, as well as TimberMart-South wood 
demand estimates and consumption data provided by Drax Group.

Specifically, for this analysis, biomass demand is defined as softwood pulpwood (roundwood) consumed 
by pellet or other bioenergy facilities. See Table 16 for annual estimates of biomass demand in the Amite 
BioEnergy catchment area from 2010-2018. 
Note, however, that not all wood consumed by a pellet mill or other bioenergy facility is classified as 
biomass demand. Like with Amite BioEnergy, wood consumption (demand) at pellet and other bioenergy 
facilities generally includes a combination of wood chips and sawmill residuals. Keep in mind that sawmill 
residuals are a by-product of the sawmilling process – from the processing of sawlogs, not pulpwood. As 
such, sawmill residuals consumed by biomass facilities are not included in our determination of biomass 
demand.

5.1.2  Changes in Forest Area 
According to US Forest Service data, timberland area in the Amite BioEnergy catchment area experienced 
a net increase of 3,992 hectares (+0.7%) from 2010 to 2017, the latest available, increasing from 550,184 
to 554,176 hectares over this 7-year period.  
The composition of timberland in the catchment area has also undergone changes since 2010, as the 
trend has been for naturally regenerated pine and hardwood timber stands to be converted to planted 
pine. Specifically, planted pine area increased an estimated 15,305 hectares (+9%) from 2010-2017, while 
naturally regenerated pine and hardwood timberland decreased a combined 12,003 hectares (-4% 
combined). See Table 17 for details.

Figure 27 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand 
versus timberland area (hectares) in the catchment area from 2010-2018. Looking at this figure, no 
relationship appears evident between timberland area and demand from 2010-2014. However, 
timberland area has closely tracked both biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand since 
2015.  
A correlation analysis of timberland area, biomass demand, and total softwood pulpwood demand 
identified a moderately strong positive correlation between timberland area and both biomass demand 
(correlation coefficient = 0.65) and total softwood pulpwood demand (correlation coefficient = 0.68) from 
2010 to 2018. However, we’d like to note that correlation and causation are not the same and that there 
is insufficient evidence to suggest that increases in demand are responsible or have caused increases in 
timberland area.

5.1.3  Changes in Timber Inventory 
According to US Forest Service data, total growing stock inventory on timberland in the Amite BioEnergy 
catchment area increased from 78.5 million m3 in 2010 to 89.6 million m3 in 2017, or a net increase of 
11.1 million m3 (+14% total; +1.9% per year average). 
Table 20 provides timber inventory estimates from 2010 through 2017, the latest available, by major 
timber product. Of the five major timber products, pine sawtimber inventory increased the largest 
amount, increasing 5.1 million m3 (+22% total; +2.9% per year average) from 23.2 million m3 in 2010 to 
28.3 million m3 in 2017. Over this same period, pine chip-n-saw inventory increased 4.7 million m3 (+52% 
total; +6.1% per year average) while hardwood sawtimber inventory increased 1.6 million m3 (+6% total; 
+0.9% per year average). Pine pulpwood inventory decreased 0.3 million m3 (-3% total; -0.4% per year 
average) from 2010-2017; hardwood pulpwood inventory decreased only marginally (<1%).

Drax – August 2019 
We’d like to note that the significant increases in both pine sawtimber and pine chip-n-saw inventories, as 
well as the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory, are in line with trends in timber production and 
reforestation through the 2000s, considering the natural progression (development) of planted forests. 
Strong economic growth in the US through the 1990s and mid-2000s brought growth in the forest 
products industry and increased demand for forest products. Through the early and mid-2000s, 
investment in the timber industry grew in anticipation of sustained market conditions moving forward, 
particularly given the above-average (financial) returns that timber management and investment had 
provided up to that point. So, in part, the growth of both pine sawtimber and pine chip-n-saw inventories 
since 2010 can be linked to investment in the timber industry back in the 1990s and 2000s (considering 
planted pine can reach sawtimber grade in as little as 25 years and chip-n-saw grade in less than 20 
years). 
However, the bursting of the US housing bubble and Great Recession that followed saw Southern pine 
lumber production decline 37% and US paper and paperboard production decline a combined 14% from 
2006-20094. The decline in both production and overall wood demand ultimately drove timber prices 
downwards, and the effects of reduced harvest levels in combination with declining investment in the 
timber industry help explain the reduction on pine pulpwood inventory since 2010 (considering planted 
pine can reach pulpwood grade in as quickly as 12 years).

Figure 29 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand 
versus pine pulpwood inventory in the catchment area from 2010-2018. Looking at this figure, an inverse 
relationship appears to exist between pine pulpwood inventory and both biomass demand and total 
softwood pulpwood demand, particularly since 2014.  
A correlation analysis identified a moderately strong negative correlation between pine pulpwood 
inventory and both biomass demand (correlation coefficient = -0.69) and total softwood pulpwood 
demand (correlation coefficient = -0.61) from 2010 to 2018. However, total inventory has increased since 
2010, and there is more evidence to suggest that the decline in pine pulpwood inventory is linked to age 
class and the natural cycle of forest development and management, not to increased biomass demand. 
In this catchment area, timber management is primarily focused on the production of sawtimber grade 
timber, and with this type of management regime, pulpwood is removed (via thinning) as a stand ages to 
allow for increased growth and timber to move up in product class. And this is exactly what we see in the 
Amite BioEnergy catchment area. Pine pulpwood inventory declined 12% from 2014-2017; however, over 
this same period, the proportion of sawtimber (i.e. pine chip-n-saw or pine sawtimber) increased, with 
pine chip-n-saw inventory increasing 24%.

5.1.4  Changes in Annual Timber Growth 
Average annual growth of total growing stock Inventory in the catchment area has declined since 2010. 
According to US Forest Service data, net growth in timber volume totaled 6.0 million m3 in 2010, 
decreasing to 5.1 million m3 in 2017, the latest available, or an overall decrease of 15% over this period.  
Table 22 breaks down annual growth estimates from 2010-2017 by major timber product. Of the five 
major timber products, annual growth of pine pulpwood decreased the greatest over this period, 
decreasing from 2.0 million m3 in 2010 to 1.2 million m3 in 2017 (-23% total). However, note that this 
decrease in annual growth is linked to both changes in pine pulpwood inventory as well as to changes in 
age and diameter class structure of the forest. Recall that pine pulpwood inventory has declined while 
pine chip-n-saw inventory has increased. This indicates or suggests the forest is in a state of transition, 
with pine pulpwood moving up in product class (to pine chip-n-saw). So, with pine pulpwood moving up 
in product class, pine pulpwood inventory and therefore annual growth of pine pulpwood has declined.   
Annual growth of pine sawtimber also declined, falling from 1.5 million m3 in 2010 to 1.3 million m3 in 
2017 (-12% total). However, annual growth of pine chip-n-saw increased from 1.1 million m3 in 2010 to 
1.2 million m3 in 2017 (+16% total).

Drax – August 2019 
The figures on the preceding page show net annual volume growth (growth less any mortality) from 
2010-2017 for each of the five major timber products. But we’d like to draw your attention to the major 
pine products, specifically. 
Figure 31(c) shows annual growth of pine pulpwood from 2010-2017, and what you’ll observe is a 
downward trend, specifically since 2012. From 2012-2017, annual growth of pine pulpwood decreased 
24%. However, over this same period, annual growth of pine chip-n-saw (see Figure 29(b)) trended 
upward, increasing 32% from 2012-2017. We’ve documented that total timber inventory has increased in 
the catchment area since 2010, and this increase in combination with these annual growth trends provide 
indication of two thing. First, that the forest is aging. And second, that the forest is also in a state of 
transition – pine pulpwood is moving up in product class to pine chip-n-saw. 
 
Growth Rates 
Table 23 provides average annual growth rates by major product from 2010-2017. These rates are also 
shown in Figure 31 on the following page. What you’ll notice is that these rates have declined for all five 
major products since 2010. 
Note that declining growth rates are representative of an aging forest. To elaborate, if we consider just 
the three major pine products, US Forest Service data indicates that the average age of pine sawtimber 
inventory has increased, that pine chip-n-saw has moved closer to the transition point where it moves up 
in product class to pine sawtimber, and that pine pulpwood has moved closer to the transition point 
where it moves up in product class to pine chip-n-saw. In general, timber growth rates decline with age, 
and this is what the data suggests has happened in the catchment area. Not that overall productivity has 
declined, but that the average age of the forest has increased and, as such, average growth rates have 
declined.

Per Acre Growth 
Table 24 provides average annual per hectare volume growth estimates in the catchment area from 
2010-2017. Over this period, total annual per hectare growth decreased from 10.9 m3 to 9.2 m3 per year, 
with average per hectare growth decreasing for four of the five major timber products. However, per 
hectare growth increased for pine chip-n-saw, from an average of 1.9 m3 per year in 2010 to 2.2 m3 per 
year in 2017. 
The increase in per hectare growth for pine chip-n-saw in combination with the decrease in growth per 
hectare for pine pulpwood provides further evidence of not only an aging forest, but also of pine 
pulpwood transitioning and moving up in product class to pine chip-n-saw.

Figure 32 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand 
versus annual growth of both pine pulpwood and pine chip-n-saw in the catchment area from 2010-2018. 
Similar to the relationship that was found with pine pulpwood inventory, an inverse relationship also 
appears to exist between pine pulpwood growth and both biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood 
demand, particularly since 2014. 
Correlation analysis confirms this inverse relationship, identifying a strong negative correlation between 
annual growth of pine pulpwood and both biomass demand (correlation coefficient = -0.89) and total 
softwood pulpwood demand (correlation coefficient = -0.93) from 2010 to 2018. However, analysis also 
identifies a strong positive correlation between annual growth of pine chip-n-saw and both biomass 
demand (correlation coefficient = 0.94) and total softwood pulpwood demand (correlation coefficient = 
0.85) over this same period. See Table 25.   
These strong (positive and negative) correlation coefficients do not suggest that increases in biomass 
demand have caused decreases in annual growth of pine pulpwood and increases in annual growth of 
pine chip-n-saw. Rather, they provide indication of a forest where pine pulpwood is transitioning to pine 
chip-n-saw. As timber ages and moves from pine pulpwood to pine chip-n-saw, growth rates and marginal 
annual growth start to decline. And on the other side of the transition, pine chip-n-saw growth rates and 
marginal annual growth increase as the relative age of pine chip-n-saw declines with the entry of younger 
timber into this product class.

5.1.5  Changes in Annual Removals 
Annual removals of total growing stock timber in the catchment area increased each year from 2010-
2017. According to US Forest Service data, annual removals of growing stock timber in the catchment 
area increased 71% (+997,699 m3) from 1,413,271 m3 in 2010 to 2,410,970 m3 in 2017, the latest 
available, or an average increase of 7.9% per year over this period.  
In terms of historical context, total annual removals averaged approximately 3.1 million m3 per year 
through the 1990s, and just under 2.3 million m3 per year through the 2000s. Total annual removals 
averaged just under 2. million m3 per year from 2010-2017, which was down approximately 14% 
compared to the 2000s average and down 36% compared to the 1990s average.  
Table 26 breaks down annual removal estimates from 2010 through 2017 by major timber product. Of 
the five major timber products, annual removals of pine chip-n-saw increased the greatest over this 
period, more than tripling from 150,998 m3 in 2010 to 492,744 m3 in 2017. Over this same period, annual 
removals of pine sawtimber increased 68% (+7.7% per year average) from 395,577 m3 in 2010 to 663,956 
m3 in 2017. Annual removals of pine pulpwood increased 65% (+7.4% per year average) from 511,985 m3 
in 2010 to 846,472 m3 in 2017.

Figure 35 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand 
versus pine pulpwood removals in the catchment area from 2010-2018. Since pine pulpwood removals 
should be representative of softwood pulpwood demand, we’d expected these two to be very strongly 
(positively) correlated, and that’s exactly what this figure shows. A correlation analysis confirmed the 
relationship, identifying a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.88) between pine 
pulpwood removals and total softwood pulpwood.   
Correlation analysis also identified a strong positive correlation between pine pulpwood removals and 
biomass demand (correlation coefficient = 0.90). See Table 27 for correlation analysis details.

5.1.6  Changes in Raw Material Costs 
Historically, Amite BioEnergy raw material purchases have included three different products: pine 
pulpwood (roundwood), pine sawmill chips (sawmill residuals), and pine in-woods chips. As such, our 
examination of raw material costs will focus on how prices for these specific timber products have 
changed in the catchment area since 2010. However, in this section, we also include hardwood pulpwood 
as well as both pine and hardwood sawtimber to see how prices of all the different major timber products 
have changed and trended in the catchment area since 2010.  
Note that only delivered timber prices (including chip and residual prices) are included and examined in 
this section.   
 
Delivered Pulpwood, Chip & Sawmill Residual Prices 
Prices for delivered pine and hardwood pulpwood as well as pine sawmill chips and in-woods debarked 
pine chips all spiked in 1Q 2010 due largely to near-record levels of rainfall in this region in 4Q 2009 (wet 
conditions limited accessibility to wood, resulting in a short-term supply shortage that drove prices 
upward). However, markets readjusted over the months that followed and prices of each of these 
products fell back in line with respective pre-weather-related shortage trends by the end of 2010.  
Trends/changes with delivered pulpwood, chips, and sawmill residual prices: 
 Delivered Pine Pulpwood. Prices increased 4.7% (+1.5% per year average) from $29.92 per tonne 
in 2011 to $31.31 per tonne in 2014. However, delivered pine pulpwood prices have declined 
since 2014, decreasing an average of 3.1% per year (-11.9% overall) to $27.58 per tonne in 2018.  
 Delivered Hardwood Pulpwood. Prices increased 19.1% from $27.50 per tonne in 2011 to $32.74 
per tonne in 2013, leveling out and averaging $32.91 per tonne from 2013 through 2015. 
Delivered hardwood pulpwood priced dipped in 2016 and 2017 but rebounded and averaged 
$33.20 per tonne in 2018.  
 Pine Sawmill Chips (Sawmill Residuals). Prices averaged $29.16 per tonne in 2011, falling to $28.14 
per tonne in 2012. However, prices have trended upwards since, increasing an average of 1.5% 
per year over the last six years and to $29.88 per tonne in 2018.  
 In-Woods Debarked Pine Chips. As with pine sawmill chips, in-woods debarked pine chip prices 
also fell from 2010 to 2012 (to $34.89 per tonne). However, since that time, prices have 
remained relatively flat, increasing only marginally to $35.15 per tonne in 2018 and averaging 
$35.28 per tonne over the last six years.

Figure 38 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand 
versus delivered pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chip, and in-woods debarked pine chip prices in the 
catchment area from 2010-2018. Intuitively, what we might expect to see is prices and demand moving in 
the same direction, and that generally appears to be the case with pine sawmill chip (sawmill residual) 
prices and biomass demand; however, both delivered pine pulpwood and in-woods debarked pine chip 
prices have actually declined in recent years (despite the increase in biomass demand). 
A correlation analysis of biomass demand and these raw material prices in the Amite BioEnergy 
catchment area identifies a moderately strong negative correlation between biomass demand and 
delivered pine pulpwood prices (correlation coefficient = -0.65), a very weak negative correlation 
between biomass demand and in-woods debarked pine chip prices (correlation coefficient = -0.19), and a 
moderately strong positive correlation between biomass demand and pine sawmill chip prices 
(correlation coefficient = 0.70).

Delivered Sawtimber Prices 
Figure 39 provides historical prices for both delivered pine and hardwood sawtimber as well as delivered 
pine chip-n-saw. We’d like to first point out the decline of delivered pine sawtimber prices through 2010 
and into 2011, which was connected to the downward market shift resulting from the bursting of the US 
housing bubble in 2006-2007 and the subsequent Great Recession that followed. Since this shift in price 
level finally concluded in 2011, it’s from this point forward that we focus our assessment of delivered pine 
sawtimber price trends.   
Trends/changes with delivered sawtimber prices: 
 Delivered Pine Sawtimber. Prices bottomed out in 2011 at $44.87 per tonne, down 15.9% from 
$53.37 per tonne in 2010. Delivered pine sawtimber prices rebounded a bit over the four years 
that followed, increasing 11.9% (+2.8% per year average) to $50.21 per tonne in 2015. However, 
prices have been declining slowly since, decrease an average of 1.4% per year since to $48.10 per 
tonne in 2018.  
 Delivered Pine Chip-n-saw. Prices remained nearly unchanged from 2010 through 2012, averaging 
$38.28 per tonne over this 3-year period before increasing more than 10% to $42.34 per tonne in 
2014. However, delivered pine chip-n-saw prices have been on a downward slide since, 
decreasing an average of 1.6% per year to $39.71 per tonne in 2018.  
 Delivered Hardwood Sawtimber. Prices averaged $52.51 per tonne in 2010, increasing an average 
of 4.9% per year (+33.2% overall) to $69.96 per tonne in 2016. However, delivered hardwood 
sawtimber prices have held steady (decreased only slightly), averaging $68.74 per tonne from 
2016 through 2018.

Figure 40 provides a side-by-side comparison of delivered pine sawtimber and chip-n-saw prices versus 
softwood sawlog demand in the catchment area from 2010-2018. Looking at this figure, both delivered 
pine sawtimber and chip-n-saw prices appeared to generally track softwood sawlog demand from 2010 
through around 2014; however, that relationship has disappeared since then and prices have held flat 
(decreased slightly) while softwood sawlog demand has continued to increase.  
A correlation analysis of delivered pine sawtimber prices, delivered pine chip-n-saw prices, and softwood 
sawlog demand confirms these relationships, or lack thereof. No correlation was found between 
delivered pine sawtimber price and softwood sawlog demand (correlation coefficient = 0.04) while only a 
moderate positive correlation was found between delivered pine chip-n-saw price and softwood sawlog 
demand.  
Note that no correlation (or only a very weak positive correlation) was found between biomass demand 
and both delivered pine sawtimber and chip-n-saw prices in the catchment area. See Table 30 for 
correlation analysis details.

Figure 41 provides a side-by-side comparison of delivered hardwood sawtimber price and hardwood 
sawlog demand in the catchment area from 2010-2018. Looking at this figure, delivered hardwood 
sawtimber price has generally increased while hardwood sawlog demand has ultimately decreased, 
indicating an inverse relationship. A correlation analysis confirmed this relationship, identifying a 
moderately strong negative correlation between delivered hardwood sawtimber price and hardwood 
sawlog demand (correlation coefficient = -0.59). 
However, keep in mind there are numerous hardwood species and that wood quality is an important 
factor, especially depending on hardwood product end-use. And in this market, demand for high-quality 
hardwood sawlogs remains relatively high and has held hardwood sawtimber prices near record highs for 
the last several years.

5.2  Market Outlook: 2019-2022 
There have been four major announcements related to mill openings and closings in the Amite BioEnergy 
catchment area that stand to impact this market moving forward. These include: 
 Georgia-Pacific (GP) announced in January of 2019 that the company would be exiting the communication 
papers business, and, as a result, it would permanently shut down the communication papers machines, 
related converting assets, as well as the woodyard, pulp mill, and a significant portion of the energy 
complex at its Port Hudson, Louisiana, facility. Final shutdown occurred in March of 2019; however, GP 
continues to operate the consumer tissue and towel business operations at the facility. 
The Port Hudson mill is located approximately 65 kilometers southwest of the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill 
in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. The shuttering of the communication papers business eliminates an 
estimated 725,000 tonnes per year of roundwood demand that had previously been sourced from within 
Amite BioEnergy’s catchment area.  
 Alternative Energy Development (AED) announced in October 2018 that the company had commenced 
construction on a new wood pellet mill in Gallman, Mississippi. Construction is expected to take 14 months, 
with the plant scheduled to begin operating in early 2020. At full capacity, the plant will be capable of 
producing 500,000 metric tons of wood pellets per year.  
The AED plant is located approximately 120 kilometers northeast of the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill in 
Copiah County, Mississippi. Once fully operational, an estimated 275,000-375,000 tonnes of roundwood 
per year, or 30-40% of the mill’s annual wood demand, is expected to be sourced from within Amite 
BioEnergy’s catchment area.   
 Velocys plc announced in October of 2017 plans to build its first US biorefinery in Natchez, Mississippi. At 
full production, the facility will produce an estimated 1,400 barrels per day of low sulfur diesel, or 
approximately 19 million gallons per year. To meet production needs, the facility will require approximately 
2,000 green tons per day of pine, or more than 635,000 tonnes annually. The company is currently in the 
planning stages; however, Velocys expects to complete construction of the new facilityand commence 
operations in 2024.   
The Velocys biorefinery is to be located approximately 65 kilometers northwest of the Amite BioEnergy 
pellet mill in Adams County, Mississippi, at the former International Paper pulp/paper mill site. Although 
this facility is not expected to be operational until 2024, once open, an estimated 400,000-500,000 tonnes, 
or 65-80% of the mill’s annual wood demand, is expected to be sourced from within Amite BioEnergy’s 
catchment area. 
 Rex Lumber announced in June 2019 that the company has decided to curtail production at its southern 
yellow pine sawmill in Brookhaven, Mississippi, reducing lumber production by 20%. The company cites 
current market conditions as the reason for the curtailment.  
The Rex Lumber sawmill is located approximately 80 kilometers northeast of the Amite BioEnergy pellet 
mill in Lincoln County, Mississippi. The curtailment eliminates an estimated 45,000 tonnes of annual wood 
demand from within Amite BioEnergy’s catchment area.

5.2.1  Wood Demand Outlook 
In the Amite BioEnergy catchment area, based on these announcements and other expected production 
changes, we anticipate total wood demand to decline an estimated 8% in 2019, due in large part to the 
shutdown that occurred at Georgia-Pacific’s Port Hudson mill as well as to the production curtailment at 
Rex Lumber in Brookhaven, Mississippi.  
However, with the construction of Alternative Energy Development’s pellet mill in Gallman, Mississippi, 
and anticipated increases in softwood sawlog demand over the next several years, we project a majority 
of the lost demand to be regained and for total wood demand in the catchment area to increase to nearly 
5.0 million tonnes in 2022, which is down marginally (<1%) compared to 2018 levels.

Drax – August 2019 
Amite BioEnergy pellet mill wood purchases (and total pellet production) are assumed to increase 
modestly (4-5%) over the next several years. And with the anticipated startup and ramp-up of the AED 
pellet mill in Gallman, we project total biomass-related wood demand in the catchment area to increase 
nearly 15% from 2018-2022 (see Table 33). 
We’d like to note, however, that due to the shutdown at Georgia-Pacific’s Port Hudson pulp mill, total 
softwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area is projected to decrease approximately 10% in 2019. 
The anticipated increases in biomass demand will help recapture some of the lost demand, increasing 
total softwood pulpwood demand to a just over 2.1 million tonnes in 2022, which is still down roughly 2% 
compared to 2018 levels.

5.2.2  Raw Material Price Outlook 
Raw material purchases for the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill have historically included three different 
materials: pine pulpwood (roundwood), pine sawmill chips (sawmill residuals), and pine in-woods chips. 
Since these specific raw materials are expected to constitute total wood purchases moving forward, our 
price forecasts focus specifically on these three products. 
 Delivered Pine Pulpwood. Based on our analysis of raw material prices in the catchment area, 
including anticipated changes in biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand moving 
forward, we forecast only marginal changes in delivered pine pulpwood prices from 2019 through 
2022. Delivered pine pulpwood prices are forecasted to increase in 2019 (primarily due to the 
extreme wet conditions that drove prices upwards early in the year) but decline in 2020 and 2021 
before increasing again in 2022 with the increased demand attributed to the new AED pellet mill. 
Overall, delivered pine pulpwood prices are forecasted to average $27.64 per tonne from 2019-2022, 
up less than 1% from the 2018 average of $27.58 per tonne. 
 Pine Sawmill Chips. Pine sawmill chip prices are forecasted to increase more than 2% in 2019 and 
continue to increase, albeit at a decreasing rate, over the three years that follow – to $31.10 per 
tonne in 2022. Overall, pine sawmill chip prices are forecasted to average $30.88 per tonne from 
2019-2022, up a little more than 3% from the 2018 average of $29.87 per tonne. 
 In-Woods Debarked Pine Chips. In-woods debarked pine chip prices are forecasted to increase each of 
the next four years and to $36.55 per tonne in 2022. This represents an approximately 4% increase over 
the 2018 average of $35.15 per tonne. Overall, in-woods debarked pine chip prices are forecasted to 
average $36.31 per tonne from 2019-2022, up a little more than 3% from the 2018 average.

Drax – August 2019 
Table 35 provides a breakdown of historic and projected prices from 2014 through 2022 for the three 
specific raw material products consumed by Amite BioEnergy. Note that these raw material prices are not 
actual per unit costs incurred by the mill, but rather average market prices for the catchment area.  
Also included in this table is the calculated weighted average per unit raw material cost based on the 
actual distributions of Amite BioEnergy raw material purchases. This weighted average price is intended 
to show how Amite BioEnergy’s raw material costs are forecasted to change given the anticipated 
changes in wood demand and timber (raw material) prices in the catchment area over the next four 
years.  
This weighted average per unit cost of raw materials for the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill averaged $26.74 
per ton in 2018. Based on our price forecasts and anticipated changes in raw material purchases, the 
average per unit raw material cost is projected to increase 2.0% in 2019 but decline slightly in both 2020 
and 2021 before increasing (modestly) in 2022. Overall, the average per unit cost of raw materials at the 
Amite BioEnergy pellet mill is forecasted to average $27.08 per ton from 2019-2022, up 1.2% compared 
to the 2018 weighted average per unit cost.

6. Analysis Summary & Findings 
Provided below and on the following pages is Hood Consulting’s overall analysis summary, including a 
synopsis of key report elements and analysis findings. Please note that any conclusions drawn by Hood 
Consulting are based on a thorough assessment of the Amite BioEnergy catchment area and on our 
professional expertise and market knowledge. 
 
 Changes in Forest Area 
Despite relatively poor market conditions (particularly for forest landowners) since 2010, US 
Forest Service data shows that overall timberland hectares increased (<1%) in the Amite 
BioEnergy catchment area from 2010-2017. Also, important to note is that total planted pine 
acres increased 15,305 hectares (+9%) over this period. To us, this indicates two things. First, land 
not formerly classified as timberland has been converted to timberland, and second, that 
harvested timberland continues to be replanted (predominantly in pine). 
As this relates to Amite BioEnergy specifically, the increase in timberland provides great 
indication that more than adequate supply will be available for future consumption (at least over 
the short to mid-term). 
 
 Changes in Timber Inventory, Growth, & Removals 
Total removals in the catchment area increased 71% from 2010-2017, and while total annual 
growth declined 14% over this period, growth still exceeded removals by a wide margin and total 
growing stock inventory increased 14% from 2010-2017. 
Another way to gauge long-term resource availability and market sustainability is to examine 
growth-to-removal ratios. In this catchment area, total softwood growth-to-removals declined 
from 4.25 in 2010 to 2.02 in 2017. More specifically, softwood pulpwood (i.e. pine pulpwood) 
growth-to-removals declined from 3.85 in 2010 to 1.80 in 2017. (Recall that a value of >1 
indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying oversupply). So, while this ratio has come down 
since 2010, a value of 1.80 still indicates that annual growth of softwood pulpwood is nearly 2x 
that of annual removals. 
For Amite BioEnergy, this indicates, firstly, that current harvest levels (demand) are sustainable, 
and secondly, that softwood pulpwood demand (including biomass-related wood demand) can 
increase much further without jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of this market. However, 
we anticipate a decline in softwood pulpwood demand in the Amite BioEnergy catchment area in 
2019 due to the recent shutdown at Georgia-Pacific’s Port Hudson pulp mill, and this decrease in 
demand means greater wood availability for Amite BioEnergy and likely a reduction in overall raw 
material costs.

Drax – August 2019 
 Changes in Wood Demand 
Total wood demand in the Amite BioEnergy catchment area doubled from 2010-2018. Over this 
same period, softwood pulpwood demand increased an estimated 92% - largely attributed to 
construction and startup of the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill. However, the previously mentioned 
shutdown at Georgia-Pacific’s Port Hudson pulp mill is expected to reduce total softwood 
pulpwood demand by approximately 10% in this catchment area in 2019. 
But with the anticipated startup of the Alternative Energy Development (AED) pellet mill in 
Gallman, Mississippi, which is presently expected to occur sometime late in 2020, some of the 
lost softwood pulpwood demand will be regained. But ultimately, total softwood pulpwood 
demand in the catchment area is projected to be 2% lower in 2022 than it was in 2018. 
For the Amite BioEnergy pellet mill, decreased demand (reduced competition) for softwood 
pulpwood should translate to lower raw material costs.  
 
 Changes in Raw Material Prices 
Amite BioEnergy raw material purchases included three different products: pine pulpwood 
(roundwood), pine sawmill chips (sawmill residuals), and pine in-woods chips. Delivered pine 
pulpwood prices in the catchment area have trended downward since 2010, decreasing an 
average of 2.2% per year from 2010 through 2018. Pine sawmill chip prices, which trended 
upwards from 2012 through 2016, have retreated a bit the last several years, decreasing 3.1% 
from 2016 through 2018. And in-woods debarked pine chip prices have remained relatively flat, 
increasing <1% overall from 2012 through 2018. 
The outlook for Amite BioEnergy in terms of raw material costs is positive. Prices for all three of 
these products did increase in 1Q 2019; however, these increases were largely due to extreme 
wet conditions that constrained supply in the short term. But given the expected decline in 
softwood pulpwood demand over the next several years, we expect overall raw material costs to 
decline as well. 
 
 Changes in Management/Harvesting Practices 
As part of this market analysis, Hood Consulting examined management practices to see how 
harvesting activities have changed since 2010. We also interviewed multiple loggers to get their 
perspective and account of how logging and logging practices have changed since 2010.  
The general notion is that thinnings (which provide a majority of the raw material that Amite 
BioEnergy purchases and utilizes) decline when timber markets are weak, and both the research 
and logger interviews conducted provided evidence to support this. In this market, delivered pine 
pulpwood prices declined 12% from 2014-2018, and over this same period, TimberMart-South 
data shows that the total number of acres thinned as a percentage of total acres harvested 
declined from roughly 60% to 45%. The loggers interviewed also provided confirmation of this, 
with two of the individuals noting specifically that their logging companies have reduced the 
amount of thinnings they conduct as pine pulpwood prices have declined.

Drax – August 2019 
But one of the other major takeaways we got from our logger interviews, and something Drax 
and Amite BioEnergy will likely find important, is the concern these loggers expressed. More than 
one of the loggers interviewed said they expect some logger attrition to occur due to the 
shutdown at G-P Port Hudson and the production curtailment at Rex Lumber, and that more and 
more attrition will likely occur if delivered timber prices move any lower (it will be too difficult for 
loggers to be profitable, and as a result they will decide to exit the industry). So, while reduced 
wood demand in this catchment area may be good for Amite BioEnergy (in terms of reduced 
buyer competition), if timber prices fall much further and the snowball effect includes a reduced 
logger workforce, then this could impact Amite BioEnergy wood procurement. 
 
 Impact of Biomass Demand on Raw Material Prices 
One of the important components of this analysis was to identify any relationships or linkages 
between changes in biomass demand and changes in raw material prices, and our correlation 
analysis identified an inverse relationship between these two in the catchment area. In other 
words, an increase in biomass demand corresponded to a decrease in raw material prices. This 
opposes intuitive thought – that prices and demand should move in the same direction. However, 
the supply side of supply and demand provides the explanation.  
When demand increases (as has happened in the catchment area), the only way for prices to 
decrease is for an even larger increase in supply to occur – and that’s what has happened in this 
catchment area (and in most timber markets across the US South). Timber production decreased 
substantially with the bursting of the US housing bubble in the mid-2000s and the Great 
Recession that followed; however; timber inventories continued to grow. Specifically, pine 
pulpwood inventory in the catchment area increased more than 11% from 2010-2014. And even 
though pine pulpwood inventory has declined in this market since that time, oversupply still 
persists, and this is the primary reason pine pulpwood prices have decreased despite an increase 
in demand.  
Our summation is that the inverse relationship found between biomass demand and raw material 
prices points more towards unrelation than causation. The evidence we gathered suggests 
(over)supply, not demand, is currently the greatest factor driving changes in raw material prices.

Drax – August 2019 
7.  Annex 1 – Project Scaling Procedures, Methodology, & Costs 
The Amite BioEnergy catchment area analysis represents a ‘pilot project/proof of concept’ to be 
replicated throughout Drax’s supply chain in accordance with Drax’s initiative to roll out and implement a 
more extensive monitoring program. In addition to Amite BioEnergy, Drax has two additional wood pellet 
facilities in the US South:  
 Morehouse BioEnergy in Bastrop, Louisiana  
 LaSalle BioEnergy in Urania, Louisiana 
Drax Power Station biomass pellet feedstock is also sourced from other regions and countries, including:  
 Canada 
 Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) 
 Portugal 
 
7.1  Project Scaling Procedures & Methodology 
Replication of the Amite BioEnergy catchment area analysis for both the Morehouse BioEnergy and 
LaSalle BioEnergy pellet mills can be done with relative ease, as US Forest Service inventory data, wood 
demand data, and TimberMart-South pricing data is readily available and attainable for each respective 
mill’s fiber catchment area. Also, Hood Consulting’s network of loggers provides access to industry 
professionals in these markets, allowing us to gather area-specific information regarding trends and 
changes in management and harvest practices.  
Regarding Drax’s sourcing regions in Canada, the Baltic States, and Portugal, the data and information 
required to monitor these sourcing regions can be attained from each respective country’s ministry of 
forestry and well as from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other 
sources.  
The methodology behind subsequent catchment area or sourcing region analyses would follow that of 
the Amite BioEnergy catchment area analysis. This includes data collection and analysis that details or 
provides the following: 
 Changes in forest area and forest composition 
 Changes in timber inventory, growth, and removals 
 Changes in wood demand (including biomass-related wood demand) 
 Changes in raw material prices 
 Changes in management and harvesting practices 
 Long-term market sustainability 
 Relationships or linkages between changes in wood demand (biomass demand) and changes in 
forest area 
 Relationships or linkages between changes in wood demand (biomass demand) and changes in 
raw material prices 
 Identification of anticipated changes in wood demand, including the impact these anticipated 
changes will have on Drax’s future raw material costs

Drax – August 2019 
Due to the US Forest Service’s data collection and release schedule, updated inventory, growth, and 
removal estimates are not typically provided every year. However, Hood Consulting continuously tracks 
changes in wood demand. In addition, TimberMart-South provides updated market price reports every 
quarter. An important part of the monitoring process includes tracking changes in both wood demand 
and raw material prices, so we would recommend updating these portions of the catchment area analysis 
every year. However, complete updates (including updated inventory data) are likely limited to every 
other year. 
 
7.2  Projected Costs & Timeline 
The cost to conduct catchment area analyses for Morehouse BioEnergy and LaSalle BioEnergy would be in 
line with that of the Amite BioEnergy catchment area analysis. However, since a template for this type of 
report has been established with the Amite BioEnergy catchment area analysis, there are likely some 
related cost savings to be had. Turnaround time on this type of market or catchment area analysis is 6-8 
weeks for each report. 
Regarding annual updates to the wood demand and raw material price portions of one of these analyses 
(including an updated market outlook with 3-5-year forecasts), we anticipate a turnaround time of only 1-
2 weeks for a given catchment area. More importantly, our estimated cost to provide such an update is 
25-35% that of a full report or a complete report update. 
For additional cost details or questions regarding project scaling and timeline, please contact Harrison 
Hood at 601-540-8602 or by email at hbhood@hoodconsultingllc.com.

Glossary of Terms 
Average annual mortality of growing stock: The average cubic foot volume of sound wood in growing-stock trees 
that died in one year. 
Average annual net growth of growing stock: The annual change in cubic foot volume of sound wood in live 
sawtimber and poletimber trees, and the total volume of trees entering these classes through ingrowth, less volume 
losses resulting from natural causes, between 1999 and 2003.  
Average annual removals from growing stock: The average net growing-stock volume in growing-stock trees 
removed annually for roundwood forest products, in addition to the volume of logging residues and the volume of 
other removals.  
Basal area: Tree area in square feet of the cross section at breast height of a single tree.  When the basal areas of all 
trees in a stand are summed, the result is usually expressed as square feet of basal area per acre. 
Commercial species: Tree species suitable for industrial wood products. 
County and municipal: An ownership class of public lands owned by counties or local public agencies, or lands leased 
by these governmental units for more than 50 years.  
Cropland: Land under cultivation within the last 24 months, including cropland harvested, crop failures, cultivated 
summer fallow, idle cropland used only for pasture, orchards, active Christmas tree plantations indicated by annual 
shearing, nurseries, and land in soil improvement crops, but excluding land cultivated in developing improved 
pasture. 
Diameter class: A classification of trees based on diameter outside bark, measured at breast height 4.5 feet (DBH) 
(1.37m) above the ground or at root collar (DRC). Note: Diameter classes are commonly in 2-inch (5cm) increments, 
beginning with 2-inches (5cm). Each class provides a range of values with the class name being the approximate 
mid-point. For example, the 6-inch class (15-cm class) includes trees 5.0 through 6.9 inches (12.7 cm through 17.5 
cm) DBH, inclusive. 
Federal Land: An ownership class of public lands owned by the U.S. Government.  
Forest land: Land that has at least 10 percent crown cover by live tally trees of any size or has had at least 10 
percent canopy cover of live tally species in the past, based on the presence of stumps, snags, or other evidence. To 
qualify, the area must be at least 1.0 acre in size and 120.0 feet wide. Forest land includes transition zones, such as 
areas between forest and nonforest lands that meet the minimal tree stocking/cover and forest areas adjacent to 
urban and built—up lands. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 
feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Unimproved roads and trails, streams, and 
clearings in forest areas are classified as forest if they are less than 120 feet wide or less than an acre in size. Tree-
covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree—covered areas in urban settings, 
such as city parks, are not considered forest land.  
Forest type: A classification of forest land based upon and named for the tree species that forms the plurality of live-
tree stocking. A forest type classification for a field location indicates the predominant live-tree species cover for the 
field location; hardwoods and softwoods are the first group to be determine predominant group, and Forest Type is 
selected from the predominant group. 
Growing stock tree: All live trees 5.0 inches (12.7) cm) DBH or larger that meet (now or prospectively) regional 
merchantability requirements in terms of saw-log length, grade, and cull deductions. Excludes rough and rotten cull 
trees. 
Hardwood: Tree species belonging to the botanical subdivision Angiospermae, class Dicotyledonous, usually broad-
leaved and deciduous.  
Land: The area of dry land and land temporarily or partly covered by water, such as marshes, swamps, and river 
flood plains.

Logging residues: The unused portions of trees cut or destroyed during harvest and left in the woods.  
Merchantable: Refers to a pulpwood or sawlog section that meets pulpwood or sawlog specifications, respectively. 
National forest: An ownership class of Federal lands, designated by Executive order or statute as National Forests or 
purchase units, and other lands under the administration of the Forest Service including experimental areas. 
Net annual growth: The average annual net increase in the volume of trees during the period between 
inventories.  Components include the increment in net volume of trees at the beginning of the specific year 
surviving to its end, plus the net volume of trees reaching the minimum size class during the year, minus the volume 
of trees that died during the year, and minus the net volume of trees that became cull trees during the year.  
Net volume in cubic feet: The gross volume in cubic feet less deductions for rot, roughness, and poor form.  Volume 
is computed for the central stem from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4.0-inch top diameter outside bark, or to the 
point where the central stem breaks into limbs. 
Nonforest land: Land that does not support or has never supported, forests and lands formerly forested where use 
of timber management is precluded by development for other uses. Includes area used for crops, improved pasture, 
residential areas, city parks, improved roads of any width and adjoining rights-of-way, powerline clearings of any 
width, and noncensus water.  If intermingled in forest areas, unimproved roads and nonforest strips must be more 
than 120 feet (36.6m) wide, and clearings, etc., more than one acre (0.4ha) in size, to qualify as nonforest land. 
Ownership: A legal entity having an ownership interest in land regardless of the number of people involved. An 
ownership may be an individual; a combination of persons; a legal entity such as corporation, partnership, club, or 
trust; or a public agency. An ownership has control of a parcel or group of parcels of land. 
Pulpwood: Roundwood, whole-tree chips, or wood residues used for the production of wood pulp.  
Roundwood products: Logs, bolts, or other round timber generated from harvesting trees for industrial or consumer 
uses. Includes sawlogs; veneer and cooperage logs and bolts; pulpwood; fuelwood; pilings; poles; posts; hewn ties; 
mine timbers; and various other round, split or hewn products. 
Saw log: A log meeting minimum standards of diameter, length, and defect, including logs at least 8 feet long, sound 
and straight, and with a minimum diameter inside bark of 6 inches for softwoods and 8 inches for hardwoods, or 
meeting other combinations of size and defect specified by regional standards.   
Sawtimber tree: A live tree of commercial species containing at least a 12-foot sawlog or two noncontiguous saw 
logs 8 feet or longer and meeting regional specifications for freedom from defect.  Softwoods must be at least 9.0 
inches d.b.h.  Hardwoods must be at least 11.0 inches diameter outside bark (d.o.b.). 
Softwood: A coniferous tree, usually evergreen, having needles or scale-like leaves.  
Stand: A group of trees on a minimum of 1 acre of forest land that is stocked by forest trees of any size.  
State land: An ownership class of public lands owned by States or lands leased by States for more than 50 years.  
Timberland: Forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn 
from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation.  (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of 
producing in excess of 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands.  Currently inaccessible 
and inoperable areas are included.)   
Timber products output (TPO): All timber products cut from roundwood and byproducts of wood manufacturing 
plants.  Roundwood products include logs, bolts, or other round sections cut from growing-stock trees, cull trees, 
salvable dead trees, trees on nonforest land, noncommercial species, sapling-size trees, and limbwood.  Byproducts 
from primary manufacturing plants include slabs, edging, trimmings, miscuts, sawdust, shavings, veneer cores and 
clippings, and screenings of pulpmills that are used as pulpwood chips or other products. 
Tree: A woody perennial plant, typically large, with a single well-defined stem carrying a more or less definite crown; 
sometimes defined as attaining a minimum diameter of 3 inches (7.6) and a minimum height of 15 ft (4.6 m) at 
maturity. For FIA, any plant on the tree list in the current field manual is measured as a tree.

Tree size class: A classification of trees based on diameter at breast height, including sawtimber trees, poletimber 
trees, saplings, and seedlings. 
Urban forest land: Land that would otherwise meet the criteria for timberland but is in an urban-suburban area 
surrounded by commercial, industrial, or residential development and not likely to be managed for the production 
of industrial wood products on a continuing basis.  Wood removed would be for land clearing, fuelwood, or esthetic 
purposes.  Such forest land may be associated with industrial, commercial, residential subdivision, industrial parks, 
golf course perimeters, airport buffer strips, and public urban parks that qualify as forest land.  
Veneer log: A roundwood product from which veneer is sliced or sawn and that usually meets certain standards of 
minimum diameter and length and maximum defect.  
Weight: The weight of wood and bark, oven-dry basis (approximately 12 percent moisture content).
