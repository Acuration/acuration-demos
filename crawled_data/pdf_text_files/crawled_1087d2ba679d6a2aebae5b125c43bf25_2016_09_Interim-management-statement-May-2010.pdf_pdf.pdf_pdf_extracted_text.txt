Interim Management Statement 
  
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 January 2010 
to date. 
  
Trading Performance  
Whilst trading conditions in the commodity markets in which we operate have remained 
challenging, we continue to benefit from a very strong contracted position. In addition, we 
have delivered good operational performance so far in 2010 and we have the ability to take 
advantage of Drax Power Station's flexibility and reliability to improve profitability in such 
market conditions. As a result, we continue to trade in line with expectations.

Notes 
1.   Fixed price power sales include approximately 2.2TWh supplied to Centrica in the 
period 1 January 2010 to 11 May 2010 under the ﬁve and a quarter year 
baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2007. 
  
2.   Fixed margin and structured power sales include approximately 3.7TWh in 2010 
and 7.9TWh in each of 2011 and 2012 in connection with the above contract and 
the five year 300MW baseload contract commencing 1 October 2010 with 
Centrica, announced on 5 November 2009. Under these contracts the Group will 
supply power on terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on 
international coal prices, and delivering matching CO2 emissions allowances 
amounting in aggregate to approximately 5.4 million tonnes in 2010 and 
approximately 7.2 million tonnes in each of 2011 and 2012. The contracts provide 
the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green spreads, with the spreads in the first 
contract having been agreed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006 and with those in the 
second contract having been agreed in October 2009. 
  
  
  
Our forward contracted position represents an accelerated hedge, captured mainly through 
mid-2009 in response to market conditions at that time. As previously described, we are now 
reverting to a hedge profile more in line with our historic practice. 
  
We will next update the market on the Group's positions under contract on 3 August 2010, 
when we announce our half year results for the six months ending 30 June 2010.   
  
Other than as described above, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any 
material change in the underlying financial position of the Group during the period.
