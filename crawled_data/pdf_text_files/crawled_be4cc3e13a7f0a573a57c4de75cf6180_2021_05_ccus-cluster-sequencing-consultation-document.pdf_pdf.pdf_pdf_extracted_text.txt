General information 
Why we are consulting 
The purpose of this consultation is to seek views on a possible approach to sequencing the 
deployment of carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) clusters. We wish to receive further 
thoughts on approaches to cluster sequencing through the consultation process, with a view to 
developing and refining our proposals in conjunction with interested stakeholders  
Proposals will necessarily be reviewed in light of consultation responses as well as ongoing 
policy developments, subsidy control rules and the timetable for development of any necessary 
supporting legislation. Nothing in this document creates any basis for any form of expectation 
or reliance. Government reserves the right to discontinue any proposed process at any time.

Territorial extent: 
This consultation proposes a method of allocating support to proposals relating to the energy 
markets in Great Britain as well as to support industrial carbon capture. Responsibility for 
energy markets in Northern Ireland lies with the Northern Ireland Executive’s Department for 
the Economy. Depending on the specific industrial process in question, some matters covered 
by this consultation may be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In general, we 
anticipate that the process of identifying clusters to support will be carried out across the UK, 
however the Government continues to discuss and refine its proposals in discussion with the 
devolved administrations and, in light of those discussions, may modify its processes to reflect 
devolved responsibilities.

Executive Summary  
The Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan announced a commitment to deploy two carbon capture 
clusters by the mid-2020s and a further two clusters by 2030. This document builds on that 
important announcement and the December update on carbon capture usage and storage 
(CCUS) business models, to set out a possible approach for determining the deployment 
sequence of carbon capture clusters to achieve the Ten Point Plan commitment. The proposed 
approach would prioritise two clusters for deployment in the mid-2020s through a two-phase 
process that is set out below. However, we are mindful that there are other approaches that 
could be taken; we welcome views on these alternatives and will continue to test and refine the 
sequencing approach through the consultation process. The two-phase process that we have 
proposed is as follows: 
• Phase-1 Provisional Cluster Sequencing – this phase would sequence clusters, with 
two clusters provisionally named onto Track-1. Track-1 is the term we use for the 
clusters that would be supported to deployment in the mid-2020s. Phase-1, as per our 
indicative timetable, would begin in April and conclude in October 2021. 
• Phase-2 Final Project Selection – this phase would determine which individual 
projects within, or that could feasibly connect to, the cluster locations identified in 
Phase-1, would receive CCUS programme support, and allocate this support to them. 
Phase-2, as per our indicative timetable, would begin in August 2021.  
This proposed two-phase process would focus on sequencing two clusters to be deployed in 
the mid-2020s; we refer to these clusters as Track-1. However, this is not the full extent of our 
ambition – we have publicly committed to a further two clusters by 2030 and we know that we 
will need all clusters to decarbonise if we are to reach net zero. Therefore, when announcing 
the two Track-1 clusters in October 2021, we would also: bring forward details of a future 
process to sequence Track-2 clusters, name a set of reserve clusters and continue to engage 
with potential Track-2 clusters. Further details on this can be found in Section 2.  
Phase-1 – Provisional Cluster Sequencing  
Phase-1 would sequence two clusters onto Track-1. To enter Phase-1 a cluster would need to 
identify a Cluster Lead and this Cluster Lead would be required to submit a Cluster Plan to 
BEIS. This Cluster Plan would be required to set out the transport and storage (T&S) proposal 
and a first phase of carbon capture projects. Phase-1 would have two stages: eligibility and 
evaluation.  
• Cluster Eligibility – the eligibility stage would screen Cluster Plans for eligibility against 
three criteria. It is expected that the results of the eligibility stage would be announced in 
August 2021 and only eligible clusters would progress to the evaluation stage. Refer to 
Section 3 for further details. 
• Cluster Evaluation - in the evaluation stage Cluster Plans would be assessed against 
five weighted evaluation criteria. The two highest performing clusters would be 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
8 
sequenced onto Track-1 with the results expected to be announced in October 2021. 
Further details on the evaluation process and criteria can be found in Section 4.  
No funding would be allocated at this point; the Phase-1 cluster decision would be provisional 
and fully reversible. Projects within these cluster locations would have the first opportunity to 
negotiate with government.  
Phase-2 – Final Project Selection  
Phase-2 would determine which individual projects within, or able to connect to, the cluster 
locations sequenced onto Track-1 will be selected and allocate support to these projects. The 
successful completion of Phase-2 within a cluster would also finalise the previously provisional 
cluster sequencing decision. The Phase-2 process would be different for each CCUS 
application (T&S, power, industry, hydrogen). 
For T&S the project would have been determined by Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing as there 
would be, by definition, only one T&S proposal included in each Phase-1 Cluster Plan. 
Therefore, for T&S, Phase-2 would be composed of negotiation and due diligence only.  
For capture projects this would be an open process where individual projects, able to connect 
to clusters sequenced onto Track-1, would be invited to submit applications to BEIS in 
October, following the announcement of the Phase-1 decision. Whilst the allocation processes 
would be adapted for each application (power, industry, hydrogen) the aim would be for 
support to be agreed through a process whereby BEIS would negotiate with and perform due 
diligence on capture projects for a limited number of contracts.  
These Phase-2 processes would be open to all capture projects that could feasibly connect to 
the cluster location, not just those included on the Phase-1 Cluster Plan submitted by the 
Cluster Lead. All projects, including those represented on the Phase-1 Cluster Plan, would be 
required to submit a project level application in October. The Call for these applications would 
be expected in August, alongside the announcement of Phase-1 cluster eligibility. Further 
detail on Phase-2 is set out in Section 5.   
 
Why We Are Consulting  
Through this consultation, we are seeking views on sequencing the deployment of CCUS 
clusters. This document seeks views on a proposal for doing so, based on five overarching 
evaluation criteria that are set out in Section 4. These have been developed recognising the 
different characteristics of potential clusters and the need to balance deployment against 
factors such as cluster maturity, cost reduction potential and economic benefits. We ask 
specific questions in relation to the approach set out in the document, but also welcome views 
on any alternative proposals that recognise the complexity of deploying multiple CCUS clusters 
and the constraints (such as technical maturity, complexity of projects and required level of 
subsidy support) associated with doing so.

Track-1 – the two clusters that are expected to be deployed by the mid-2020s.  
Track-2 – the two additional clusters, beyond those deployed in the mid-2020s, that are 
expected be deployed by 2030. Note, however, that this is not the extent of our ambition 
as all clusters will need to decarbonise to achieve net zero.  
Phase-1 – the first phase of the process which would provisionally sequence clusters 
onto Track-1. No funding would be awarded at this point.  
Phase-2 – the second phase of the process which would determine which projects, within 
the cluster locations sequenced onto Track-1 in Phase-1, would receive support, and 
allocate support to these projects.  
Cluster Eligibility – the first stage of the Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing Process which 
would determine whether Cluster Plans are eligible to proceed to the evaluation stage. 
Cluster Evaluation – the second stage of the Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing Process 
which would evaluate the performance of eligible Cluster Plans against a set of 
evaluation criteria to determine which clusters would be sequenced onto Track-1.

The proposals 
Section 1: Introduction 
A Green Industrial Revolution 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our lives and on the economy, 
both here in the UK and across the world. It is now more important than ever, as the UK looks 
to a future recovery from the impacts of Covid-19, that we focus on building a clean, resilient, 
and sustainable economy. This is why, in November, the Prime Minister committed to a green 
industrial revolution, focused on driving innovation, creating opportunities for exports, and 
generating green jobs and growth across the country to level up regions of the UK.  
We face a pivotal moment where action on climate change must be taken. In 2019 the UK 
became the first major economy to place a commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2050 into law. In the lead up to our 2021 presidencies of both COP26 and the G7, it is 
important that the UK continues to demonstrate global leadership on tackling climate change, 
and, by taking a leading stance, encourages other nations to follow. 
Further to the environmental benefits, a green industrial revolution will provide large-scale 
economic benefits to the UK. It can support up to 250,000 well-paid, green jobs by 2030, with 
additional high-skilled jobs being created in the lead-up to 2050. Furthermore, as the UK 
becomes a world leader in low carbon technologies and deployment, it will stimulate export 
opportunities across the country and help to level up regions of the UK.  
Importance of CCUS  
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that, to keep temperatures 
from rising by more than 1.5°C this century, CO₂ emissions will need to be reduced globally by 
between 40 – 60% by 2030 compared to 20101.  
The UK has already made significant progress in reducing CO₂ emissions. According to the 
Climate Change Committee (CCC), between 1990 and 2018 greenhouse gas emissions from 
the UK economy fell by 40% whilst the UK economy grew by 75%2. However, we must 
accelerate the rate of CO₂ reduction if we are to eradicate our contribution to climate change 
and reach the 2050 net zero commitment.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) will play a major role in this. The CCC state that 
CCUS is essential for reaching net zero: a necessity not an option. They advise that multiple 
CCUS clusters will need to be operational by the mid-2020s to enable the UK to reach net zero

by 20503. The various CCUS applications each can play a different, but crucial, role in 
eradicating the UK’s contribution to climate change.  
• By capturing and permanently storing industrial emissions CCUS can transform our 
industries into zero carbon global leaders, enabling key sectors to be competitive in a 
global economy, and attracting investment in new industrial facilities. This is significant 
given that manufacturing and refining are major contributors to UK carbon emissions, 
accounting for 16% of total annual emissions.  
• In the power sector, thermal generating stations with CCUS can deliver non-weather-
dependent low carbon electricity to balance renewable intermittency, maintain security 
of supply and keep total system costs low.  
• Low carbon hydrogen could transform the UK’s energy system. It could offer significant 
flexibility and optionality in hard to decarbonise sectors. However, some current 
hydrogen production methods, such as methane reformation and biomass gasification, 
create CO₂ as a by-product. CCUS could help solve this by capturing the CO₂ before it 
is emitted into the atmosphere.  
• CCUS will also have a role to play for some of the most scalable greenhouse gas 
removal (GGR) technologies, such as bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and direct air 
carbon capture with storage (DACCS). These technologies actively remove CO₂ from 
the atmosphere and are reliant on CCUS infrastructure for the transport and storage of 
the CO₂ they capture. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) have been clear that to 
achieve net zero, these technologies will be required to balance residual emissions from 
some of the most difficult to decarbonise sectors. 
CCUS also provides significant economic opportunities. Our geography means that the UK has 
one of the greatest CO₂ storage potentials of any country in the world. It is estimated that the 
UK Continental Shelf could safely store 78 billion tonnes of CO₂, which is the equivalent of 200 
years of the UK’s annual CO₂ emissions4. Unlocking this potential through the development of 
CO₂ transport and storage networks could generate strategic national assets that could, as 
well as storing our own emissions, store internationally imported CO₂; a market which, 
according to government commissioned analysis, could be worth up to £14 billion by 20505. 
Overall, it is estimated that CCUS could support up to 50,000 jobs by 20306. Importantly, many 
of these jobs will be well-paid and highly skilled and will be concentrated in the UK’s industrial 
regions. Investing in these areas can help to transform the UK’s industrial heartlands, 
revitalising and levelling up the local economy. This will be particularly important as the UK 
looks to start a green industrial revolution and begins to recover from Covid-19.

Increase in ambition 
At the 2020 Spring Budget, the Chancellor announced a CCS Infrastructure Fund (CIF) of at 
least £800 million, to establish CCUS in at least two sites, one by the mid-2020s and a second 
by 2030. However, in recognition of the vital role CCUS can play in meeting our net zero target 
we have increased this commitment. We are now, as announced in the Prime Minister’s Ten 
Point Plan speech, committed to supporting the deployment of two carbon capture clusters by 
the mid-2020s and a further two clusters by 2030. Our vision is that CCUS will enable these 
locations to be transformed into SuperPlaces – low carbon hubs of technological development 
where CCUS, renewables and hydrogen congregate. We also have an ambition to capture 10 
million tonnes of CO₂ per annum and to have 5 GW of low carbon hydrogen capacity by 2030.  
This increase in ambition will be supported by:  
• An extra £200 million of funding to increase the CIF to £1 billion. The Fund is expected 
to support the deployment of two clusters by the mid-2020s, with another two clusters to 
be created by 2030.    
• A £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Production Fund (NZHF), which will support a twin-
track approach of supporting both CCUS-enabled ‘blue’ and electrolytic ‘green’ 
hydrogen production facilities. 
• CCUS business models for T&S, power, and industrial capture as well as business 
models for low carbon hydrogen. Work on the detail of these models continues to 
progress in collaboration with the sector.  
• A revenue mechanism to bring through private sector investment into industrial carbon 
capture and hydrogen projects via our business models. Details of this revenue 
mechanism will be brought forward in 2021.  
Support for power CCUS will be funded by consumer subsidies, as announced at the spring 
2020 budget. Any power CCUS project will need to be in a location with access to a T&S 
network. 
Progress so far  
Since the Spring Budget announcement, we have taken significant steps towards being able to 
support the deployment of the first CCUS clusters in the UK. We have: 
• Published the Government Response on potential business models for Carbon Capture 
Usage and Storage, in August 20207. 
• Published a further update on the business models for Carbon Capture Usage and 
Storage in December 2020 which set out the high-level design of the transport and 
storage, power, and industrial capture business models. A consultation on the 
Government’s preferred hydrogen business models can be expected in Q2 20218.

This Document  
As committed to in the Ten Point Plan, we are now bringing forward further detail on 
progressing deployment of CCUS in industrial clusters in the 2020s. We want to work closely 
with industry to determine the optimal process for sequencing CCUS deployment throughout 
this period. This document sets out:  
• A potential two-phase process for allocating CCUS Programme support13 and a possible 
timeline on which we could execute this process. This is set out in Section 2.  
• Considerations in relation to potential entry requirements and entry process for Phase-1 
cluster sequencing. This is set out in Section 3.   
• Detailed considerations for Phase-1 cluster sequencing, including the proposed 
evaluation criteria and the way in which these criteria could be compared. This is set out 
in Section 4. 
• The direction of travel for Phase-2 of this process, including how we might approach 
allocating support to specific projects within clusters. This is set out in Section 5. 
 
Whilst clusters and individual projects will consider their own proposals best placed for 
deployment, the different characteristics of potential clusters and of the importance of CCUS in 
achieving net zero means that we need to develop our understanding of how best to sequence 
the deployment of CCUS. Through the approach set out in this document, we aim to develop a

greater understanding of the costs of deployment, and the contribution deployment can make 
to other factors such as economic benefits. Without this understanding, there is a risk that 
deployment occurs in a way that is not affordable or that potential benefits do not materialise. 
We are therefore consulting on a proposed process that can facilitate this ambitious timeline 
with a view to obtaining and considering feedback on our proposed approach.

Section 2: Overview of Two-Phase Approach  
We are consulting on a possible approach to allocate CCUS Programme support for Track-1 
clusters through a two-phase process:  
• Phase-1 – Provisional Cluster Sequencing  
• Phase-2 – Final Project Selection  
 
Phase-1  
The Phase-1 assessment would be at the CCUS cluster level. We propose defining a CCUS 
cluster as a T&S network and a first phase of carbon capture projects. This first phase of 
capture projects would need to consist of at least two projects and can be any combination of 
power, industrial capture, and hydrogen. We consider assessment at the CCUS cluster level, 
as opposed to running individual allocation rounds to specific applications, necessary to reflect 
the inherent interdependency between the different parts of the CCUS chain. This is best 
illustrated by highlighting the problems that would likely arise if government were to select early 
CCUS locations based only on the consideration of a single CCUS application. T&S is used 
here as an example, but the same would apply if sequencing were based only on any one 
capture application (power, industry, hydrogen). Specifically:  
• If capture projects at the location are not considered, the location judged to have the 
best T&S proposal may not have any, or enough, viable capture proposals. This would 
increase the risk of a timing mismatch between the T&S infrastructure being available 
and capture projects being online.  
• In the extreme, sequencing in this way could result in stranded T&S assets. 
• Furthermore, even if there were sufficient viable capture projects at the selected 
location, unless all parts of the chain are considered, an optimal sequencing decision is 
unlikely to be made. If the cluster location were sequenced based only on the merits of 
the T&S project, it could be the case that the merits of the capture projects in an 
alternative location were such that, had government considered them, it would have 
made a different sequencing decision.   
For these reasons, to enter the Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing Process, we propose that the 
cluster would be required to provide a Phase-1 Cluster Plan. The Cluster Plan would need to 
set out a T&S network proposal and an associated first phase of potential carbon capture 
projects that could connect to the network. This would enable government to evaluate which 
locations have the potential to offer the best value for money proposition, in the round, across 
the different components of the CCUS chain.  
In Phase-1, cluster proposals would be assessed according to a set of criteria and two clusters 
would be sequenced onto Track-1 to be deployed by the mid-2020s. This cluster sequencing 
decision would be provisional with no funding committed at this stage. The benefit of being 
sequenced onto Track-1 is that projects in Track-1 clusters would have the first opportunity to 
negotiate, subject to due diligence, a potential package of support with government. Further 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
17 
details on the Phase-1 process and the Phase-1 assessment criteria are set out in Section 3 
and Section 4, respectively.  
Two further clusters, Track-2, would then be deployed by 2030. We are currently minded not to 
finalise the composition of Track-2 through the process set out in this document. This is to 
encourage innovative proposals to continue to be brought forward across the decade. The 
rationale and trade-offs associated with this are discussed in further detail later in this section 
and we are interested in hearing stakeholder views on this point. 
Phase-2  
Phase-2 would allocate support to specific projects within those clusters that have been 
provisionally sequenced onto Track-1 in Phase-1. The design of the Phase-2 allocation 
process will be different for each application (T&S, power, industrial capture, hydrogen) with 
details of each provided in Section 5.  
Importantly, whilst the Phase-1 Cluster Plan would have set out specific capture projects, 
Phase-2 Final Project Selection will not be restricted only to projects on this plan. Government 
would use Phase-2 to provide an opportunity for other capture projects in the selected cluster 
location, and potentially at remote sites, to come forward to compete against the emitters that 
have been included within the Phase-1 Cluster Plan, where there is scope for such 
competition. Developers of individual capture projects which are not included on a Phase-1 
Cluster Plan, but are interested in entering in Phase-2, are encouraged to identify themselves 
to BEIS before the Phase-2 process formally opens (the consultation process can be used to 
do this).  
The rationale for proposing to allow alternative projects to enter, is:  
• That it provides a fair opportunity for all existing projects at the cluster location, whether 
affiliated with the cluster consortia or not, to participate in the project selection process. 
It also provides a potential opportunity for projects at remote sites to be considered. 
Taking this approach and clearly signalling it in this document could also stimulate new 
projects to come forwards, both within and outside of the cluster locations likely to be 
considered for Track-1.  
• Whilst a counter to this might be that the second phase is unnecessary as the Cluster 
Lead will already have down-selected the best projects to include within the Phase-1 
Cluster Plan, if such projects are reliant on support through the business models, the 
appropriate process will need to be carried out to confirm that such support is 
appropriately directed. Section 5 aims to provide forward visibility as to government’s 
likely Phase-2 considerations, such that the Cluster Lead has the opportunity to put 
forward a plan that is less likely to require alterations in Phase-2.   
• Multiple projects contesting for a limited number of contracts, at least where possible, 
also has the potential to drive better value for money outcomes for consumers and 
taxpayers.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing

The aim of the proposed two-phase process is to drive optimal outcomes for government, the 
sector, consumers, and taxpayers alike. Phase-1 is designed to ensure that the cluster location 
has the potential to offer a baseline value for money proposition across the full breath of CCUS 
applications; whereas Phase-2 seeks to optimise outcomes at that location, once selected.  
As well as the optimisation of capture projects described above, Phase-2 would also involve 
detailed due diligence and negotiations between government and projects. This would be with 
the T&S projects sequenced through Phase-1 and capture projects prioritised through Phase-
2. No support would be awarded to any project until full due diligence had been completed.   
 
Indicative Timeline  
 
A potential timeline on which we could execute this process is set out in Table 1. This timeline 
seeks to balance being able to facilitate the deployment of two clusters by the mid-2020s whilst 
also providing enough time to run a sufficiently robust process. It is intended to be indicative 
and will be subject to potential change following further engagement across government and 
through the consultation process.

Rationale  
 
We think it is important to run a robust and transparent process. We have therefore factored in 
the following stages for Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing: 
• Engagement – we consider it important to engage with the sector on this process before 
executing it. This engagement is firstly through this document, but we will also be 
holding engagement sessions in late February to work collaboratively with stakeholders 
to develop the process further.  
• Application window – we have timetabled a 10-week application window to give industry 
time to prepare submissions. We hope that this window, combined with the forward 
visibility provided by this document, will allow sufficient time for responses. 
• Assessment period – we have timetabled a 12-week assessment window so that we 
can make an accurate and robust Phase-1 sequencing decision. 
Following these stages, the Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing Process, if following this timeline, 
would conclude in October 2021.  
 
Phase-2 Overlay  
It is vital that early clusters can be ready to take final investment decisions in time to be 
operational in the mid-2020s, in line with the Ten Point Plan. This will enable CCUS to start 
making positive contributions to near term Carbon Budgets and the UK to start demonstrating 
leadership in this technology on the international stage. It will also enable industry to begin 
gathering the crucial learnings that will enable the CCUS to be deployed at scale in the 2030s. 
It is therefore important that we maximise the time we have for project assessment, 
negotiations, and due diligence in Phase-2. To facilitate this, rather than run Phase-1 
(Provisional Cluster Sequencing) and Phase-2 (Final Project Selection) sequentially, we are 
considering timetabling a partial overlay.  
In August, shortly after Phase-1 Cluster Plans have been received, BEIS would announce 
which clusters had passed the eligibility stage (details in Section 3) and those eligible clusters 
would progress into the evaluation stage (details in Section 4). Alongside this announcement 
BEIS would publish a Call for capture projects across power, industrial carbon capture and 
hydrogen, within, or that could feasibly connect to, these eligible clusters. All capture projects 
that wish to be considered for support, including those that have been represented in the 
Phase-1 Cluster Plan, would be required to prepare and submit an application. As above, 
capture projects, particularly those not associated with a Phase-1 Cluster Plan, that are 
considering this as an option are encouraged to identify themselves to BEIS in advance of 
preparing a bid (through the consultation process).  
 
These capture applications would be due in October shortly after the conclusion of Phase-1, 
when the Track-1 cluster decision is expected to be announced. Only projects with a credible 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
20 
plan to connect to one of the clusters sequenced onto Track-1 should submit bids. We 
recognise a challenge here that, in some cases, work would have been completed to prepare 
capture applications for projects in locations where the corresponding cluster proposal is not 
subsequently sequenced onto Track-1. BEIS would not take responsibility for any work or 
resources expended on these applications, or indeed on any applications within the selection 
process, any expenditure would be at the risk of the companies involved. However:  
• There will be future allocation rounds, for example for Track-2 clusters, in which parts or 
all the prepared information may be relevant.  
• The developers of any project for which the first-choice cluster has not been sequenced 
onto Track-1, but where the project could feasibly connect to a Track-1 cluster, would 
still have an opportunity to apply in October. This is discussed further in Section 5.  
Despite this challenge, BEIS considers that the overlay option could be the right balance 
between being able to move quickly whilst also allowing all projects, whether affiliated with 
cluster consortia or not, an opportunity to enter the process.    
We have not set out a detailed timeline for Phase-2 of the process. This is because the length 
of Phase-2 will be determined by a range of factors, not all of which can be controlled by 
government. Final investment decisions could be from H1 2022 onwards but this is provided as 
an indicative date only and is also subject to progress in the development of the CCUS 
business models. Any process will not conclude until BEIS has satisfied itself that the relevant 
projects represent value for money and an outcome that is fair to both taxpayers and 
consumers has been reached. The length of the Phase-2 process will also be influenced by the 
timelines of the clusters that are selected to be on Track-1; for example, government may take 
longer to execute Phase-2 if it is not on the critical path of the development of the relevant 
clusters. Section 5 sets out our proposal for how project bids could be assessed in Phase-2.  
Importance of Track-2  
The primary focus of the proposed 2021 process is to identify potential Track-1 clusters. Track-
1 clusters are the clusters that we intend to support to deployment in the mid-2020s. However, 
the deployment of two clusters by the mid-2020s is not the extent of our ambition. Specifically:  
• We are committed to a further two clusters by 2030 as announced by the Prime Minister 
in the Ten Point Plan. We refer to these later clusters as Track-2.  
• We are also aware that we will need more projects and clusters beyond 2030; all 
clusters will need to be decarbonised if we are to meet our legally binding commitment 
of net zero.  
Supporting the deployment of further clusters, beyond those on Track-1, will: 
• Be crucial to achieving our ambition of capturing and storing 10Mt of CO₂/year by 2030, 
a level of deployment supported by the CCC. It will also likely help meet our 5GW 2030 
hydrogen ambition. 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
21 
• Increase the range of CCUS applications, both of terms of storage types and capture 
applications, to maximise UK learning in CCUS. This learning will be crucial if we are to 
have the option to deploy at scale in the 2030s in line with the CCUS Action Plan.  
• Maximise the UK’s comparative advantage of ample storage capacity and engineering 
capability, an important step towards become a global leader in CCUS.  
• Be vital to achieving the Industrial Clusters Mission, which has recently been increased 
to four low carbon industrial clusters by 2030 and at least one net zero cluster by 2040. 
We have evaluated internally whether we should focus the Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing 
process on Track-1 clusters only, or whether to also use the process to identify Track-2 
clusters. In considering this we are trading off:  
• The importance of sending a strong signal to those that have performed well in the 
process to provide the confidence and motivation required to keep these clusters 
progressing at pace with their development work. This progress will be essential if we 
are to meet our public commitment to support four clusters to operations by 2030. This 
reasoning would lead us towards naming both Track-1 and Track-2.   
• The importance of retaining optionality and not locking ourselves into a decision 
prematurely. A lot could change between now and 2030 and it is important that 
government is able to respond this change; the previous CCUS competition cancelled in 
2015 was criticised for narrowing down options too early and it is important that we 
avoid this16. It is also important that clusters not developed enough to participate in the 
2021 process to have an opportunity to participate in the future and, indeed, for new 
clusters to emerge. Government may wish to maximise the opportunity for innovation in 
the sector and allow a pipeline of clusters and projects to develop. This would lead us 
towards naming Track-1 clusters only and leaving the Track-2 decision to a later point.  
Our current minded-to position, that we are hoping to test through this consultation, is a 
compromise position. This would be to name up to two reserve Track-1 clusters in October 
alongside those clusters sequenced onto Track-1. To be named as a reserve cluster, a cluster 
would need to have passed the eligibility and evaluation stages of the Phase-1 Cluster 
Sequencing Process. Publicly naming these reserve clusters would acknowledge their strong 
performance whilst also leaving open the opportunity for innovation in the sector by not 
finalising Track-2 clusters at this point. 
The reserve clusters would also be crucial if negotiations were to falter or due diligence were to 
fail on a Track-1 cluster. Should this happen government may pause negotiations with a 
Track-1 cluster and negotiate with a reserve cluster instead; a process we refer to as ‘reversing 
the Tracks’. Further detail on reversing the Tracks is included in Section 5.  
 
To encourage continued progress within potential Track-2 clusters we:

•
Have increased the size of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Industrial
Decarbonisation Challenge (IDC) fund to over £200m to enable important development
work to progress in more cluster locations.
•
Will continue to engage with potential Track-2 clusters and projects throughout the early
2020s, to understand their path to maturity and when further intensified support might
best be timed.
•
Are committing to publishing an allocation process for Track-2 clusters in October,
alongside the announcement of the successful Track-1 clusters. We are interested in
hearing views on how we might best approach the allocation process for Track-2
through this consultation and the timing for when the process might commence.
Further, BEIS also reserves the right to name more than two clusters onto Track-1 to be 
supported to deployment in the mid 2020’s. This would, of course, be subject to value for 
money considerations and affordability constraints. 
It is also important to note that for any future Track-2 process we will consider relaxing the 
eligibility criteria that have been used within the Track-1 process. Specifically, we are unlikely 
to make it a requirement of entry that a cluster includes a storage proposal. This is because if 
we already have two stores operational by the time Track-2 clusters are deployed it may not be 
necessary for all clusters applying for a Track 2 process to have their own store, providing they 
have a credible storage solution. This might include, for example, shipping to a store already in 
operation. 
Consultation Questions on Overview of Two-Phase Approach 
Do you have any comments on the two-phase process where provisional 
sequencing first takes place at the CCUS cluster level, followed by final selection 
at the individual project level? 
Do you have any comments on the indicative timeline? Specifically, does the 
10-week window give enough time for industry to gather and submit information
for Phase-1 (further information on application information is included within
Section 3)?
Do you have any concerns about the proposed overlay of Phase-2 (Final Project 
Selection) and Phase-1 (Provisional Cluster Sequencing)? 
Do you agree that the process should focus on identifying clusters for Track-1? 
Does the commitment to bring forward details of a process to select clusters for 
Track-2 mitigate the risks associated with not naming the second Track in 2021? 
What should the allocation process for Track-2 clusters look like? What factors 
will it be important for government to consider? 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
23 
Section 3: Entry into Phase-1  
Phase-1 would provisionally sequence two CCUS clusters onto Track-1. This section sets out 
the proposed Phase-1 eligibility criteria and rationale behind these requirements. Cluster Plans 
that pass the eligibility stage would progress into the evaluation stage for which details are set 
out in Section 4. 
Eligibility Criteria 
We are considering proposing three Phase-1 eligibility criteria:  
• The cluster must credibly demonstrate that it can be operational by 2030; 
• The cluster must be in the United Kingdom; and 
• The cluster must meet the definition of a CCUS cluster, which we define as a T&S 
network17 and an associated first phase of at least two carbon capture projects.  
Operational by 2030 
This eligibility criterion has been proposed because government is determined to deploy CCUS 
in the UK in the 2020s and we have a commitment to two clusters by the mid-2020s and a 
further two clusters by 2030. Deployment this decade is important is for three key reasons: 
• Foundation for net zero: It is estimated that 60-180 MtCO₂ per year need to be captured 
for the UK to meet its legally binding net zero commitment. CCUS projects have long 
lead times, so for the UK to be on track to meet this level of deployment we will need to 
be deploying CCUS at scale in the 2030s; and, in turn, if we are to deploy at scale in the 
2030s we will need to de-risk, learn and gain cost certainty in the 2020s. 
• Near-term Carbon Budgets: deploying CCUS in the 2020s can make an important 
contribution to near-term Carbon Budgets.  
• Maximising comparative advantage: the UK’s natural advantages of ample offshore 
storage capacity, engineering skills base and oil and gas supply chains make it well-
placed to capture up to £10bn of a £200bn global CCUS market18. However, if we do 
not move quickly, in the 2020s, we will be left behind by other countries that are making 
material progress in CCUS such as Norway, the United States and the Netherlands. 
To be clear, as stated previously in the document, we expect Track-1 clusters to be operational 
by the mid-2020s. However, we have not defined the end of the mid-2020s and included this 
as an eligibility criterion because: 
• If we did not receive two Cluster Plans that could credibly deploy by the specified date, 
we might wish to have the option to consider a cluster with a later deployment date. We 
would need to have received such a Cluster Plan to be able to do this. 
 
17 We in turn define a T&S network as a set of onshore pipelines, offshore pipelines and an associated offshore 
storage facility. The pipelines must be capable of transporting CO₂ to the storage site (for example a saline 
aquifer or depleted oil and gas field) that must be able to store this CO₂ safely and permanently. 
18 Pale Blue Dot: Progressing Development of the UK’s Strategic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resource (2016). 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
24 
• Similarly, we are minded to name reserve clusters such that, if negotiations falter or due 
diligence on a Track-1 cluster fails, BEIS will have the option to reverse the Tracks. 
Further information on reversing the Tracks is set out in Section 5. We may wish to 
consider clusters with later deployment dates for these reserve list positions. We will 
need to have received such Cluster Plans to be able to do this. 
Located in the United Kingdom  
This criterion has been proposed to reflect the UK government’s commitment to supporting 
decarbonisation across the UK. CCUS can support Scotland and Wales to meet their 
respective net zero targets of 2045 and 205019.  
We have not identified any industrial clusters or potential CCUS projects in Northern Ireland 
but would encourage any such projects or cluster to identify themselves through this 
consultation.  
Meets the Definition of a CCUS Cluster 
We are minded towards making meeting the definition of a CCUS cluster a requirement of 
entry to Phase-1 Provisional Cluster Sequencing. We define a CCUS cluster as a T&S network 
(incorporating the onshore and offshore network and offshore storage facility) and an 
associated first phase of carbon capture projects.  
This would restrict entry only to those clusters that can demonstrate a coordinated, full chain 
proposal. This is to reflect the inherent interdependency between the different parts of the 
CCUS chain. An explanation of the importance of this interdependency is set out earlier in this 
document, in Section 2. 
We are aware of some clusters that are developing decarbonisation plans that include carbon 
capture and hydrogen applications but do not contain a specific T&S network proposal. We are 
satisfied that these clusters are not eligible to be sequenced onto Track-1, because: 
• Such a cluster, inherently, cannot be Cluster 1 – any capture projects or proposals in a 
cluster without a store, without other cluster locations with storage first being developed, 
would be entirely redundant.  
• Importance of store resilience – we consider it important that the UK develops multiple 
storage locations. A single storage location would not offer resilience in the unlikely 
event of a permanent fault or, more likely, a temporary outage at the Cluster 1 store. It 
may therefore be unattractive for a cluster without a storage proposal to be named as 
Cluster 2. 
We are likely to relax this definition when we come to determine the Track-2 clusters that will 
be deployed later in the 2020s. Furthermore, individual capture projects within such locations 
 
19 Government continues to discuss and refine its proposals in discussion with the devolved administrations and, 
considering those discussions, may modify its processes to reflect devolved responsibilities.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
25 
may have the opportunity to bid into Phase-2 of the process; this is discussed further later in 
this section.    
Entry Process   
To enter the process, we would suggest that the CCUS cluster identifies a Cluster Lead. The 
purpose of the Lead will be to represent the cluster and give government a clear counterparty 
to coordinate with. It is our expectation that the most appropriate Cluster Lead is likely to be 
the entity primarily responsible for the T&S proposal and the party that will eventually hold the 
T&S licence. This should also encourage, even from this early stage, T&SCo to be responsible 
for identifying and coordinating customers for the network. Further details of what this role 
could entail are set out in the recent update on CCUS business models.20 
The Cluster Lead would be responsible for submitting the following materials to BEIS:  
• Phase-1 Cluster Plan   
• Supporting documents 
 
Phase-1 Cluster Plan 
The Phase-1 Cluster Plan submitted by the Cluster Lead would be required to set out the T&S 
network proposal and first phase of carbon capture projects that will connect to this network.  
We are currently minded towards requiring the Cluster Lead (T&SCo) to collect the information 
required for the Phase-1 submission from the individual capture projects and to submit this 
information to BEIS alongside its own T&S proposal. The capture projects would have to 
submit their own information about their projects in Phase-2 (Final Project Selection). This 
Phase-2 submission would be more detailed for which further information is provided in 
Section 5.   
We suggest that for the Cluster Lead to legitimately include an individual capture project within 
the first phase of the cluster plan:  
• There must be evidence that the emitter can credibly be operational by 2027. Note that 
this is intended as a backstop date for individual emitters; having some emitters 
operational earlier than this date will count favourably towards the cluster in the 
evaluation stage.  
• There must be commitment from each individual emitter. Our suggested level of 
commitment would be a signed Letter of Intent or Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
in place between the Cluster Lead and each emitter, at the point of entry into Phase-1. 
This is to protect against emitters being double counted in multiple cluster proposals 
and to offer level of comfort that the CO₂ volumes from these projects will materialise.  
Whilst the Cluster Lead would be encouraged to highlight other potential future capture 
projects for future expansion, only emitters that meet these two requirements would count 
 
20 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-ccus-business-models 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
26 
towards any quantitative metrics used to assess the cluster (evaluation criteria are discussed 
in Section 4).   
The Cluster Plan should also set out how the CCUS cluster meets each of the five Phase-1 
evaluation criteria (evaluation criteria details are set out in Section 4). A template and/or word 
limit for each criterion will likely be provided. 
Supporting Documentation  
To support and evidence the Cluster Plan the Cluster Lead would be required to submit a 
range of supporting documentation covering the T&S and the first phase capture projects 
proposed within the cluster. The purpose of the supporting documents will be to evidence the 
higher-level narrative set out in the Cluster Plan and is likely to require information such as:  
• An integrated project plan and schedule that incorporates the T&S network proposal 
and first phase of carbon capture projects that will connect to this network. This plan 
would be sought to provide and evidence a high level of certainty in relation to the 
timing, cost out-turns and CO₂ abatement volumes proposed. A strong project plan 
would be internally consistent and integrated across the full reach of the proposed T&S 
network and the first phase of emitters.  It would also be logic linked and include 
evidence showing where the resource is to be sourced. Any plan should be provided in 
an industry recognised software such as P6 or MS Project. 
• Commercial documentation to evidence the status of the intra-cluster arrangements for 
the continued development and delivery of the project is in place. Our expectation is that 
this would be, at a minimum, at and agreed Heads of Terms level with Board level 
evidence of commitment to executing fully termed agreements. 
• An integrated risk register in which risks would be fully detailed and clearly linked to 
project activities to support quantitative schedule and cost risk analysis if this is taken 
forward.  Risks will also be identified to confirm where these are allocated (which entity 
holds the risk) and the extent to which agreement has been reached on this allocation.  
• Verifiable technical documentation to support technical descriptions of the project and 
programme activities and agreed statements and scopes for future activities to complete 
any work in progress. 
• Information relating to the Storage Licence to evidence geological storage development. 
We might expect this to include completed studies and subsurface characterisation 
reports, primary storage complex data, a storage development plan and supporting 
documents, Measuring Monitoring and Verification (MMV) plan, and details of the 
planning and consents regime. 
• Evidence to support the preferred solution for the T&S network (onshore and offshore) 
and how this preferred solution is being progressed through FEED. This would include 
items such as: final concept selection with no key options outstanding; end to end flow 
assurance documentation consistent with the proposed options; metering approach, 
technologies and proposed accuracies consistent with the proposed range of operating 
conditions, CO₂ specifications and reporting requirements; preliminary major design 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
27 
documents should be complete and at the first review stage; integration with the 
consents process; and, completed survey documentation.  
• Technical study documents for emitter projects to evidence development progress 
showing the selected option, FEED scope and a project plan that is integrated with the 
wider cluster delivery plan.  
The information provided would need to be complete, internally consistent, and clearly 
supported by documentary evidence for technical, commercial, financial and programme 
statements. As referenced in Section 1 we are keen to understand from clusters whether this 
level of information will be available in July 2021, the point at which cluster submissions are 
due.  
Remote Sites  
We are aware of several carbon capture and hydrogen proposals being developed within 
clusters that do not contain a storage proposal and a range of individual capture projects being 
developed at remote sites, outside of industrial clusters. Engaging such ventures in the CCUS 
selection process is vital to government because:  
• We recognise that all major industrial clusters, including those without proximity to 
storage, will have to be decarbonised if we are to meet net zero by 2050.  
• We wish to explore all available options, for example, projects at remote sites might 
have unique strategic value. We also think that having more participants in a process is 
beneficial for competitive tension, with the potential to drive value for money outcomes.  
There are multiple options available for remote sites or clusters without stores to participate in 
the overall selection process:  
• Phase-2 Final Project Selection - individual projects would be able to bid into Phase-2 
of the selection process and contest in individual technology allocation rounds against 
projects that have been included within the Cluster Plan. However, these projects would 
be required to evidence a credible plan to transport and store their carbon with a 
Track-1 cluster.  
• Future Track-2 process - as CO₂ storage will be operational through the successful 
competition of Track-1 clusters, it may not be necessary for all Track-2 clusters to have 
a CO₂ store. Therefore, clusters without storage could be eligible to enter a future 
selection process for Track-2 clusters. We expect to bring forward details of this process 
in October 2021 alongside the Track-1 sequencing announcement.  
Furthermore, by supporting two clusters to deploy in the mid-2020s we will be paving the way 
for future projects and clusters to deploy in later years. This will be achieved by increasing 
technological knowledge to deliver cost certainty; de-risking and proving commercial viability; 
bringing about cost reductions; and developing the skill sets and supply chains to be able to 
scale at pace through the 2030s.

28 
Shipping  
We welcome capture project proposals that include shipping (or transportation by alternative 
means such as road or rail). However, at this stage, no additional support would be offered to 
such projects and they will be considered alongside capture projects connecting by pipeline. 
We will keep this under review and are open to discussing this through our consultation 
process.  
 
Consultation Questions on Entry into Phase-1 
 
Do you have any comments on the proposed eligibility criteria? 
 
Do you have any comments on the proposed requirement that an applicant has to 
meet the definition of a CCUS cluster to enter the process? Do you have any 
comments on the proposal to relax this requirement when considering Track-2 
cluster? 
 
We are suggesting that the T&SCo take on the role of Cluster Lead. Are there any 
challenges associated with T&SCo being an effective Lead for the cluster? 
 
We state that there should be a level of commitment from a capture project for it 
to be included on the Cluster Plan. Is an MoU an appropriate and achievable form 
of commitment? 
 
What should government be doing to facilitate remote sites and shipping and 
when should government be doing this?

Section 4: Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing Process  
Section 3 outlined a possible approach for determining which cluster proposals would be 
eligible to enter Phase-1 and the steps that clusters would need to take to enter the process. 
This section, Section 4, sets out a possible approach for evaluating eligible clusters.  
Evaluation Criteria 
Under this proposal clusters would be evaluated against a set of five evaluation criteria. The 
aim of having a small number of evaluation criteria would be to ensure that the methodology is 
simple and can be easily understood by a range of stakeholders, irrespective of their level of 
technical background. If a cluster can demonstrate a strong performance against each of these 
criteria, it would build confidence that the cluster has the potential to offer good value for 
money. These criteria are set out at a high level as follows: 
Table 2: Headline Evaluation Criteria for Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing 
Criteria 
Definition 
Deliverability  
The level of confidence we can have in the delivery plan put 
forward by the cluster and the date at which the cluster can, 
credibly, be operational21 by.  
Emissions Reduction  
The contribution the cluster can make to the UK’s emission 
reduction targets including Carbon Budgets and net zero.  
Cost Considerations 
The expected average cost of abatement and affordability of 
the cluster. 
Economic Benefits 
The contribution the cluster can make to the UK economy 
and the Government’s levelling up agenda.  
Learning and Innovation 
The contribution the cluster can make to both future CCUS 
projects and wider decarbonisation initiatives by generating 
and disseminating knowledge across a range of 
technologies.  
 
For each criterion, we have set out below why we consider it to be important to government 
alongside an indication of what a cluster would have to do to perform strongly against it. 
However, because of the relatively early stage we are at in the development of the sequencing 
process, full details as to how clusters performance will be assessed have not been included 
within this document. The metrics that will be used to determine cluster performance against 
each of the criteria will be developed over the coming months and further details would be 
provided in the April Launch document. The five criteria are each considered in turn below. 
 
 
21 Defined as first injection of CO₂ into the offshore storage facility and then continuous operation from that point. 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
30 
Deliverability  
This criterion has been proposed to reflect our commitment to having two clusters operational 
by the mid-2020s. To perform well against this criterion a cluster would be expected to put 
forward a clear Phase-1 project execution plan and timeline. The greater our level of 
confidence in the cluster’s delivery plan and the earlier the date that the cluster can, credibly, 
be operational by, the higher it would score under this criterion. 
It is proposed that the credibility of the project plan and timeline would be assessed through an 
evaluation of:  
• Offshore storage site characterisation. 
• Development work of the T&S network and emitter projects performed to date. 
• Storage licence and permit application stage. 
• Planning and consents regime progress. 
• Whether key contracts are in place for core suppliers. 
• Indicative financing plans, including proposed ownership for each part of the chain. The 
financing plans for projects within the cluster will be important as the approach taken, 
could impact whether the cluster can feasibly be operational by the mid-2020s. 
• Whether detailed risk registers are in place with mitigations populated and whether the 
proposed risk allocation coheres with that set out in the December business models 
update. 
• Adherence to safety regulations and level and nature of any residual risk.  
• Technical feasibility and integration of capture projects with a T&S network. 
• Whether each part of the cluster (T&S, power, industrial and/or hydrogen) is equally 
developed with plans in place to manage and minimise timing mismatches.  
• The organisational structure, competency and identification of skills shortages and plans 
to fill them.  
• The capability and capacity to deliver locally and related economic benefits.   
 
The mid-2020s date is important because:  
• It facilitates the positive contribution CCUS clusters can make to near term Carbon 
Budgets.  
• It enables jobs to be created at cluster locations, jobs that can make a vital contribution 
to the Covid-19 recovery.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing

• It provides an opportunity for the UK to capitalise on its comparative advantage22, to 
become a leader in CCUS. 
• It would demonstrate that the technology works in a UK context, enabling future clusters 
and projects to learn from this early deployment.  
 
Emissions Reduction Potential  
This criterion has been proposed to reflect government’s commitment to UK emission 
reductions targets, and in recognition of the essential role that CCUS will play in 
decarbonisation and the transition to net zero. 
To perform well against this criterion, it is proposed that, the cluster would be expected to:  
• Demonstrate that it can make a positive contribution to the UK’s efforts to meet our net 
zero commitments (including, where relevant, the Scottish 2045 net zero commitment, 
the Welsh 2050 net zero commitment and any local emission reduction targets23). 
• Set out planned volumes within the Phase-1 Cluster Plan that contribute to near term 
Carbon Budgets.  
• Demonstrate the credibility of early volumes, that these volumes will materialise and be 
retained through the contract period. This is important given that underutilisation risk, 
the risk that planned volumes do not materialise or fail within the contract period, is a 
key risk being mitigated and allocated through the T&S business model. Government 
would look favourably on proposals in which it can be confident in initial volumes and 
the sustainability of these volumes.  
• Set out alternative emitters that could connect to the network instead of those emitters 
that have been included on the Cluster Plan. The diversity of potential emitters is 
another potential protection against underutilisation risk. Government would also look 
favourably upon cluster proposals in which the T&S network can be flexible to different 
users.  
• Set out how the cluster proposal could develop, including a potential pipeline of future 
projects. This could be illustrated through projects in earlier phases of development, the 
size of the industrial region, or the potential to transport carbon (e.g. by ship) from other 
clusters or countries.  
• Can make a material contribution to UK hydrogen ambitions of 1GW by 2025 and 5GW 
by 2030.  
• Demonstrate that it can achieve synergies with other Government backed 
decarbonisation initiatives, facilitating emissions reduction within the cluster from other 
 
22 By comparative advantage we mean the UK’s natural advantages of ample offshore storage capacity, 
engineering skills base, and oil and gas supply chains make it well placed to capture up to £10bn of a £200bn 
global CCUS market. 
23 Government continues to discuss and refine its proposals in discussion with the devolved administrations and, 
in light of those discussions, may modify its processes to reflect devolved responsibilities. 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
32 
projects, programmes, or sectors (for example, green hydrogen projects, the Hydrogen 
for Heat trials or green transport hubs). 
• Have a low carbon intensity of infrastructure. 
 
Cost considerations 
This criterion has been proposed to ensure that the cost of delivering the first CCUS clusters is 
acceptable to the taxpayer and the consumer.  
To perform well against this criterion the cluster would be expected to:  
• Set out an attractive levelised cost of abatement across the Phase-1 Cluster Plan. The 
levelised cost of abatement methodology would be sufficiently sophisticated to consider 
financing plans; risk allocation, including any transitional arrangements; operating 
efficiency levels; operational flexibility; different useful economic lives (UELs) of the 
infrastructure; different levels of oversizing within Phase-1 proposals; and projected 
costs of future expansion. 
• Provide an indication of the range of what a reasonable and fair return could be in the 
context of the risk allocation included in the business models update. 
• Demonstrate that competition has, where possible, been built into procurement 
processes (e.g., for construction contracts).  
• Instil confidence in government that Phase-1 volumes will materialise and be retained 
through the contract period; and demonstrate there is a diverse range of possible 
emitter projects in the cluster location, to mitigate against the risk of underutilisation or 
stranded assets. 
It is also important to highlight that any cluster sequenced onto Track-1 must be affordable to 
government. Government has a commitment to two clusters by the mid-2020s and there will be 
a finite funding pot to support these clusters. This inherently means that whilst greater capacity 
and volumes are preferred, this can only be until a certain point; there has to be a limit on the 
size of the first phase of any one cluster if we are support two clusters by the mid-2020s. We 
cannot, however, describe an exact affordability limit because whether one potential Track-1 
cluster of a certain size is affordable would be determined, at least in part, by the size of the 
other Track-1 cluster proposal (considerations around this and other portfolio factors are set 
out later in this section).    
Given that Phase-1 Cluster Plan submissions would be prepared prior to the completion of 
development work, there will inherently be a degree of cost uncertainty within these Cluster 
Plans. Nevertheless, we are also aware that there will be a potential incentive for clusters and 
projects to understate costs to perform better in the Phase-1 assessment; this is a risk that we 
are monitoring closely. There are some existing mitigations that we shall be developing further 
in advance of the launch of the process, these include:  
• The 12-week assessment period would be used for BEIS and its advisors to examine 
submissions, which would include scrutiny of cost data. BEIS would ensure that it has 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
33 
the relevant capability, both from across government and external advisors, to 
thoroughly interrogate this data.  
• BEIS is currently carrying out a cost benchmarking exercise including the development 
of notional clusters. Information within Phase-1 submissions would be compared against 
these notional clusters and any cost deviations thoroughly queried.  
• BEIS will reserve the right to pause or abandon negotiations if it discovers that costs 
within the Phase-1 Plan have been materially or intentionally understated. In such a 
scenario BEIS may decide to reverse the Tracks and negotiate with a reserve cluster 
instead. Further detail on reversing the Track is provided in Section 5.  
Economic Benefits  
The Government is committed to maximising the economic opportunities of deploying CCUS in 
the UK. As the Prime Minister made clear, we will invest up to £1 billion to support the 
establishment of CCUS in four industrial clusters, creating ‘SuperPlaces’ in areas such as the 
North East, the Humber, North West, Scotland and Wales.  This significant new public 
investment will mobilise competitiveness and productivity across the UK, harnessing this 
country’s extraordinary powers of invention to repair the economic damage of Covid-19 and 
build back better. It will support high-skilled high-paid jobs, enabling the transitioning of the UK 
workforce towards the new green economy. 
In evaluating eligible clusters, Government is minded, therefore, to include specific criteria 
around economic benefits. To perform well against this criterion, the cluster would be expected 
to demonstrate how it: 
• Could deliver economic growth in places across the UK and contribute to the country’s 
longer term industrial transformation to a green economy and, in particular, by creating 
and maximising opportunities for investment and growth in local economies in the UK. 
• Will deliver and support high skilled, high paid jobs and, in particular develop a diverse 
workforce, and deliver training to employees to attain the skills needed for CCUS in 
ways that minimise skill shortages and increase productivity. 
• Can synergise with other government decarbonisation programmes for example in 
renewables or green transport in order to become a ‘SuperPlace’. 
• Intends to embed sustainable business practices, including how it intends to identify and 
resolve gaps in capability and productivity among international and UK supply chains. 
• Anticipates reducing the carbon intensity of the project and emissions of other GHGs, 
for example through reducing carbon miles or accessing green finance. 
• Intends to overcome the challenges it faces through investment in innovation and R&D. 
 
Learning and Innovation  
This criterion has been proposed as early CCUS clusters can potentially play an important role 
in de-risking and bringing about cost reductions in future CCUS clusters and projects. Building 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
34 
this foundation will put the UK in a position to be able to scale CCUS at pace through the 
2030s. 
To perform well against this criterion the cluster would be expected to:  
• Include a range of CCUS applications across a combination of power, industrial capture, 
and hydrogen within the Phase-1 Cluster Plan.  
• Set out how these applications would contribute to wider government objectives. For 
example, where hydrogen production proposals are included demonstrate that the 
hydrogen produced can be used in a range of important sectors.  
• Demonstrate how it can coordinate, synergise, and facilitate other decarbonisation 
initiatives and activities within the region (for example, but not limited to, green hydrogen 
projects, green transport hubs, low carbon products markets, or the Hydrogen for Heat 
trials).  
• Set out innovative proposals with the potential to generate learnings and be replicated 
to unlock future CCUS projects.  
• Have clear plans in place to disseminate knowledge within the cluster, to other clusters 
and projects and to government.  
 
Criteria Weightings  
As part of our commitment to a fair, objective, and transparent process when we launch 
Phase-1 in April we propose to set out clear weightings for each of the five evaluation criteria 
described above.  
We have further analysis to perform to fine-tune the exact weightings and therefore have not 
included precise weightings within this document.  We will be working through these between 
now and April with a range of cross-Whitehall stakeholders and our external advisors. 
Nevertheless, we want to provide as much clarity as possible to maximise the opportunity for 
clusters to be able to submit high-performing Cluster Plans. We have therefore set out a 
provisional set of weighting ranges for each of the evaluation criteria in Table 3 below. 
Table 3: Provisional Ranking of Phase-1 Evaluation Criteria

10-20% 
Learning and innovation  
10-15% 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing

We are also likely to stipulate minimum thresholds of performance that the Cluster Plan must 
achieve against each of the five individual criteria. This might include rating each Cluster Plan 
high, medium, or low against each of the five evaluation criteria. It could be that a rating of at 
least medium is required against each of the criteria or, as an alternative, at least one high 
required with only one low rating allowed. We are considering options for this and expect that 
full details on the thresholds will be provided in the April Launch document. 
Portfolio Selection   
As well as considering how each cluster individually performs against the criteria, it may also 
be important for government to consider how Track-1 clusters might perform as pairing. 
Government may consider portfolio factors such as:  
• Multiple stores - there could be benefit in having Track-1 clusters that are planning to 
develop different storage sites. This could provide resilience so that, in the unlikely 
event of a serious technical problem with one store, there would still be another storage 
site in development. Similarly, even once operational, in the event of a temporary 
outage of one store there could be opportunities to move carbon, by road, rail or ship, to 
the other storage site. This would not be possible if we selected two Track-1 clusters 
that were sharing a single store. Nevertheless, this is not intended to be a requirement, 
it is just one factor that we may consider and trade off against other relevant factors. For 
example, it may be that economies of scale or other cost benefits mean that it is 
preferable to sequence two clusters sharing a single store onto Track 1. 
• Diverse stores – as well as multiple stores, there could also be benefit in having 
different types of storage in the clusters on Track-1 such as one saline aquifer and one 
depleted oil and gas field. This is because there are significant differences when 
comparing the two types; for example, typically, saline aquifers are data poor and oil 
and gas fields data rich; oil and gas fields have had fluids produced, saline aquifers 
have not; and oil and gas fields often have infrastructure (platforms, wells, pipelines) 
that might be reused, saline aquifers have no infrastructure. Importantly, future stores 
are likely to be a mix of the two types, therefore, to maximise the replicability benefits for 
future clusters in the UK and the economic opportunity of the global market, it could be 
better to deploy one of each in the mid-2020s.   
• Diverse capture projects – we would want to see a diverse range of capture project 
deployed in the mid-2020s on Track-1. This applies to both diversity of application (the 
mix of power, industrial capture, and hydrogen) and diversity within application. A mix of 
applications is important as each application would deliver different learning or 
replicability benefits for future projects and contribute to different strategic objectives for 
government. Diversity within application may also be important; for example, for 
industrial capture it would be important to support projects in a mix of industries to 
maximise both resilience and learning. Whilst these factors can be achieved, in part, 
through diversity of emitters within the individual cluster plan, it may also be helpful to 
consider this across the Track. 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
36 
• Affordability – clusters on Track-1 would have to be affordable to government both in 
terms of their demands on capital and revenue envelopes. It may be that this can only 
be considered in combination, across the track.   
These are not the only portfolio factors government could consider and we welcome views on 
these factors and other potential factors that we have not listed.   
The importance of these combination or portfolio factors could mean that it would be a sub-
optimal decision for government to simply pick the individually highest performing two clusters 
for Track-1. We are therefore considering how the evaluation process could be adjusted to 
enable government to balance the importance of selecting individually high performing 
clusters, of selecting a sensible combination and of setting out a clear and transparent 
process.  
Decision-Making Process 
The assessment for the above process would primarily be executed by BEIS and its technical, 
commercial, and legal advisors. Support and expertise would also be drawn from across 
Whitehall including HM Treasury, the Infrastructure Project Authority (IPA) and UK 
Government Investments (UKGI) as well as from its various Partner Organisations including 
OFGEM, Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) and 
the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA).  
BEIS officials and their advisors would review Cluster Plans against the eligibility and 
evaluation criteria and engage with the Cluster Lead to understand further detail where 
required. Cluster Plans would be evaluated using the criteria, weightings and portfolio factors 
may also be considered. A recommendation would then be made, based on this assessment, 
to relevant ministers. The decision would ultimately be ministerial.  
The Launch document, which we expect to be published in April, will provide further detail on 
the internal execution of this process including the schedule of engagement between BEIS and 
applicants.   
 
Consultation Questions on Phase-1 Cluster Sequencing Process 
 
Do you have any comments on the proposed evaluation criteria? 
 
Do you agree with weighting ranges proposed for the evaluation criteria? 
 
Do you have any comments on the proposal to consider portfolio factors when 
selecting the Track 1 clusters?  In particular, do you have any comments on the 
potential portfolio factors that the Government should have regard to?

Section 5: Phase-2 Final Project Allocation 
During Phase-2 government would make the final selection decision as to the projects that 
would be supported by government and would allocate specific support to these projects. 
This process would take place within the cluster locations sequenced in Phase-1 and would be 
open to all projects that could feasibly connect to that location, irrespective of whether the 
project was included within the Phase-1 Cluster Plan or not. The rationale for this minded to 
position was set out earlier in this document, in Section 2.  
Applications from individual capture projects that wish to be considered for support would likely 
be due in October, shortly after the Track-1 sequencing decision has been announced. We 
expect that a Call for applications will be put out in August to facilitate this. All capture projects, 
including those set out on the Phase-1 Cluster Plan, would have to submit applications to enter 
Phase-2. Further detail on this timeline is set out in Section 2.  
This section sets out the direction of travel for the allocation process for each of the CCUS 
applications24 in turn. However:  
• The below information is indicative only and further policy development is required 
before this is executed from August 2021. However, we felt it would be helpful to set out 
a direction of travel for Phase-2 before CCUS clusters begin detailed preparation for 
entry into Phase-1. It would be helpful if any projects that are interested in entering 
Phase-2 but are not affiliated with a specific cluster, and therefore unlikely to appear on 
a Phase-1 Cluster Plan, discuss their projects with BEIS at the earliest opportunity in 
2021 (through this consultation). 
• The below considerations apply to the final allocation process that would take place 
within Track-1 clusters. Whilst it can be assumed that some of the same considerations 
will apply later in the 2020s for allocation to projects within Track-2 clusters, we expect 
that a greater degree of competition is likely to be feasible by that point. We therefore do 
not consider it helpful or necessary to cement the Track-2 allocation process now but 
will return to the sector on this topic in the future. 
• Funding would not be committed unless: all subsidy control requirements have been 
met, government is comfortable with any balance sheet implications, all relevant 
statutory consents have been complete, and government is comfortable that the project 
represents value for money for the consumer and the taxpayer.  
 
 
 
24 The primary focus of the process set out in this document is to select Track-1 clusters that will be deployed in 
the mid-2020s. We have therefore not included a Phase-2 process for DACCs and BECCs. This will, however, be 
kept under review and is likely to change when we come to allocate support within Track-2 clusters.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
38 
Transport and Storage  
 
Allocation 
By definition, there would only be one T&S proposal included within each Cluster Plan. 
However, a ‘Phase-2’ would still be required for the Track-1 T&S projects, pursuant to which, 
government would conduct detailed due diligence and agree the specific amount of financing 
support required.   
It is also important to highlight that BEIS sequencing the cluster onto Track-1 would not be 
sufficient to get the T&S proposal to the point of commercial operation. The T&S project lead 
will also require: 
• A Storage Licence and Storage Permit – obtaining the licence and permit would be the 
responsibility of the T&S project lead. The T&S project having Storage Licence and 
Permit, or at least a credible plan to obtain these, would count favourably towards the 
cluster within the Phase-1 sequencing process.  
• The relevant planning and consents for the T&S network - obtaining the relevant 
planning and consents would be the responsibility of the T&S project lead. Having these 
in place, or a credible route to doing so, would count favourably towards the cluster 
within the Phase-1 sequencing process. 
• An economic licence – this licence would be awarded to the T&S project within the 
cluster locations sequenced in Phase-1. This award would be made after the cluster has 
been sequenced and will be subject to an assessment by the relevant regulator. This 
consultation does not outline the process for granting the economic licence and this 
topic will be covered through future updates on the T&S business model.  
 
Support 
It is expected that the Track-1 clusters’ T&S proposals would be eligible to receive the 
following support:  
• An economic licence that grants the licensee a regulated revenue stream (the ‘Allowed 
Revenue’) facilitated by the right to charge a regulated fee (the ‘T&S fee’) from 
completion of construction. Further details as to the design of the T&S business model 
can be found in the update on business models,25 published in December.  
• Access to the CIF, if required. One application of the Fund being considered is to 
reduce the potential revenue gap for T&SCo. By revenue gap we refer to difference 
between calculated allowed revenue and the revenue T&SCo can collect from early 
users for their proportionate use of the network. Further detail on this potential 
application can be found in the recent update on business models26. This would be

Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
39 
traded off against other potential uses and be subject to further work on the design of 
the T&S business model. 
• Government Support Package (if required) for specified low probability but high impact 
risks that the private sector would not be able to bear at an efficient price or indeed any 
price. 
Entering a bilateral negotiation does not mean that any funding or licence will be awarded. Any 
decision to award support would only be made subject to the successful completion of any 
negotiation and due diligence. Any negotiation would only conclude successfully once 
government has satisfied itself of the desirability of the project through a robust and extensive 
value for money analysis. BEIS reserves the right to interrupt or terminate these negotiations at 
any time. The details of any support package offered would be published once negotiations 
have completed. Commercially sensitive information would be redacted.  
As set out in Section 2 government would continue to engage with potential Track-2 clusters. 
This would include engagement with the T&S project and would be to understand when further 
intensified support might best be timed.  
We will continue to give consideration of the ownership model of the T&SCo as consulted in 
summer 2019.  
  
Power  
Allocation  
We are currently minded towards using bilateral negotiations as the mechanism to allocate and 
award initial power CCUS contract(s) by way of a direction in accordance with section 10 
Energy Act 2013. Whilst, eventually, we expect Dispatchable Power Agreements (DPA) to be 
awarded through a deterministic competitive process, we currently do not think that this award 
process will be feasible for the first contract(s). Track-1 clusters are expected to be operational 
by the mid-2020s and the current view is that an insufficient number of power CCUS projects 
may be sufficiently developed to execute a full competition on this timeline. However, if enough 
sufficiently developed potential power CCUS projects were to come forward, we may 
reconsider a competitive process for the initial contract(s). 
Whilst we do not consider a deterministic competitive process likely to be a feasible option at 
this stage, we are minded to open up the allocation process such that alternative power 
projects (i.e. those within an identified Track-1 cluster that were not included in the Phase-1 
Cluster Plan) can be considered alongside any power project(s) within that plan. If multiple 
projects were sufficiently developed, Government would then look to run parallel negotiations 
with multiple power projects in identified Track-1 clusters.  
Having identified one or more power projects, Government would:  
• Negotiate limited areas of a DPA, focusing primarily on price, with other parts of the 
DPA remaining as fixed, as set out in the business model update.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
40 
• Drive improved value for money for the consumer, including where appropriate, by using 
competitive tension.  
• Ensure the proposal(s) which provide greatest overall value for money within 
affordability constraints is(/are) taken forwards. It is important that government explores 
all options and that all projects have a fair opportunity to come forwards. 
 
A set of qualification criteria would be used to screen and assess project applications prior to 
any negotiation. If a project passes this stage it would proceed into a bilateral negotiation and 
full due diligence. Some of the types of criteria and associated metrics government are 
considering for qualification are:  
• Emissions reduction potential – projected capture rates (%).  
• Dispatchability – capability to provide dispatchable generation capacity. 
• Cost – affordability and DPA payment rates. 
• Maturity of project – the stage of development and likely operation date. 
• Learning and proof of concept – cost reduction and knowledge transfer strategy.  
• Supporting industrial activity and jobs – projected contribution to employment and GVA, 
supply chain map. 
• Local community engagement – level of engagement and level of support from local key 
stakeholders.  
These criteria have not been finalised and this does not represent an exhaustive list. We will 
return to the sector to provide further detail on these criteria later in 2021. 
The above assessment of allocation options relates only to initial allocation rounds in Track-1 
clusters. The process for future allocation rounds, for example for projects in Track-2 clusters, 
will be established in due course, incorporating competition where practicable.   
Support  
Successful CCUS power projects are expected to receive a DPA which will be funded through 
consumer subsidies. For further details as to the design of the power CCUS business model 
please refer to the December update on business models.  
Entering a negotiation does not mean that a DPA will be awarded. Any decision to award 
support would only be made subject to the successful completion of any negotiation and due 
diligence. Any negotiation will only conclude successfully once government has satisfied itself 
of the desirability of the project through a robust and extensive value for money analysis. BEIS 
may direct the LCCC to enter into one or more power contracts. BEIS reserves the right to 
interrupt or terminate these negotiations at any time. 
Any DPA, including the agreed payment terms, will be published if offered. Commercially 
sensitive information will be redacted. 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
41 
Industrial Capture  
Allocation  
We are currently minded towards using bilateral negotiations as the mechanism to allocate and 
award initial industrial carbon capture contract(s). Whilst, eventually, we expect these industrial 
capture contracts to be awarded through a deterministic competitive process, we currently do 
not think that this award process would be feasible for the first contract(s). Track-1 clusters are 
expected to be operational by the mid-2020’s and the current view is that an insufficient 
number of industrial projects may be appropriately developed to execute a full deterministic 
competition on this timeline. Furthermore, projects may not be sufficiently mature for a price 
based competitive process, and government may wish to consider a range of strategic factors 
and gather information through the assessment. For these reasons we consider a negotiation 
to be more appropriate for selecting initial capture projects for Track-1 clusters.  
However, whilst we do not consider a deterministic competitive process to be a feasible option 
at this stage, we are minded to open up the allocation process such that alternative projects 
from outside the Track-1 Cluster Plan can be considered alongside industrial capture project(s) 
included within that plan. If multiple projects were sufficiently developed, Government would 
then look, where possible, to run parallel bilateral negotiations with multiple projects, for a 
limited number of industrial carbon capture contracts.  
We are minded towards parallel negotiations to: 
• Ensure the proposal(s) which provide greatest overall value for money within 
affordability constraints is(/are) taken forwards. It is important that government explores 
all options and that all projects have a fair opportunity to come forwards. 
• Drive improved value for money for the taxpayer, including where appropriate, using 
competitive tension. 
A set of qualification criteria would be used to screen and assess project applications prior to 
any negotiation. If the project passes this stage, it would proceed into a bilateral negotiation 
and full due diligence. Some of the types of criteria and associated metrics government are 
considering for qualification are:  
• Emissions reduction potential - projected capture rates (%) and projected volumes of 
CO₂ captured (Mt).  
• Cost - affordability and average cost of abatement (£/tCO₂). 
• Maturity of project – the stage of development and likely operation date. 
• Learning and proof of concept - cost reduction and knowledge transfer strategy.  
• Supporting industrial activity and jobs - projected contribution to employment and GVA, 
supply chain map. 
• Local community engagement – level of engagement and level of support from local key 
stakeholders.  
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage – Market Testing on Cluster Sequencing 
42 
These criteria have not been finalised and do not represent an exhaustive list - it is intended 
only as a direction of travel. We will return to the sector to provide further detail on these 
criteria later in 2021. 
The above assessment of allocation options relates only to initial allocation rounds in Track-1 
clusters. In future allocation rounds, for example for projects in Track-2 clusters, we would 
expect to be able to move to a deterministic competitive process. 
Support  
Industrial carbon capture projects that are selected following assessment against the criteria 
would enter into negotiations with BEIS. If those negotiations are concluded positively (i.e. 
judged to be affordable and value for money), an industrial carbon capture project is expected 
to be supported through:  
• Capex co-funding through the CIF (if required); 
• An industrial carbon capture contract which will be funded from the exchequer, to 
support the deployment of industry carbon capture. Further details on the design of the 
industrial carbon capture contract can be found within the year end update on CCUS 
business models27.  
Entering a bilateral negotiation does not mean that any funding or contract will be awarded. 
Any decision to award support would only be made subject to the successful completion of any 
negotiation and due diligence. Any negotiation would only conclude successfully once 
government has satisfied itself of the desirability of the project through a robust and extensive 
value for money analysis. BEIS reserves the right to interrupt or terminate these negotiations at 
any time.  
Any support, including the awarded strike price and the reference price, will be published if 
offered. Commercially sensitive information will be redacted. 
Hydrogen   
Work on the hydrogen business model is progressing at pace but the model is currently less 
developed than the equivalent carbon capture business models for power and industry. We will 
be consulting on the Government’s preferred hydrogen business models by the end of Q2 
2021. Therefore, allocation method and criteria have not been decided yet, but the process will 
be open to those hydrogen projects included within the cluster plan and any potential new 
hydrogen projects within, or that could feasibly connect to, the successful Track-1 clusters as 
part of the Phase-2 process.  
We will return to the sector to provide further details on the hydrogen project allocation process 
and assessment criteria later in 2021.

Hydrogen projects that are selected following assessment will enter negotiations with BEIS. If 
those negotiations are concluded positively (i.e., judged to be affordable and value for money), 
a hydrogen project could be supported through:  
• Access to the Net Zero Hydrogen Production Fund28 to support the scaling up and 
deployment of CCUS enabled low carbon hydrogen.   
• A hydrogen business model which will provide ongoing revenue support and further 
details on the revenue mechanism to support hydrogen (and industrial carbon capture) 
projects will be set out in 2021. Further details regarding the design of this business 
model will be consulted on by the end of Q2 2021.  
Entering a bilateral negotiation does not mean that any funding or contract will be awarded. 
Any decision to award support would only be made subject to the successful completion of any 
negotiation and due diligence. Any negotiation would only conclude successfully once 
government has satisfied itself of the desirability of the project through a robust and extensive 
value for money analysis. Any support will be published if offered. Commercially sensitive 
information will be redacted. 
Reversal of the Tracks  
If progress is not being made in Phase-2 with the projects in a Track-1 cluster, BEIS reserves 
the right to pause negotiations with that cluster. As well as pausing negotiations with the Track-
1 cluster we are suggesting that BEIS could have the right, but not an obligation, to begin 
negotiations with a reserve list cluster instead. We refer to such a swap as reversing the 
Tracks.  
Any reversal of the Tracks would only take place following a robust and transparent process 
through which BEIS would have to be able to demonstrate why the swap is taking place. The 
details of this process would be developed and shared as part of the formal launch of the 
Phase-1 process in April.  
However, to give an indication, a reversal might be brought about in the case of one or more of 
the following scenarios:  
• There is a material, adverse and unreasonable change in the costs, timelines, or 
specifications of a project between the information provided in the Phase-1 cluster plan 
submission and the information providing during Phase-2 negotiations. 
• There is evidence that the performance of the cluster against the evaluation criteria has 
deteriorated to a level below that of a reserve list cluster.  
• Negotiations between BEIS and the Track-1 cluster collapse and an agreement cannot 
be reached.  
 
28 Note the Net Zero Hydrogen Production Fund will also be available to Green Hydrogen projects outside cluster 
locations.

Note this would only apply whilst Phase-2 processes are still progressing; once a final 
investment decision has been taken contract terms would apply. Further information on any 
reversal process will be provided in the Phase-1 Launch document.  
Projects Changing Cluster  
As set out in Section 3 it is our expectation that the Cluster Lead, likely to be the T&SCo, would 
submit information both for its own T&S proposals and the capture projects that wish to 
connect with it in the first phase. Each capture project would only be allowed to appear on one 
Cluster Plan submission. 
Section 2 set out that that, as proposed, Phase-2, final project selection, would begin with a 
Call going out to capture projects in eligible clusters in August. Capture projects would then 
prepare bids over the early Autumn and then submit them shortly after the Track-1 clusters had 
been announced in October. Project applications would be prepared at the developers own 
risk, if the corresponding cluster is not sequenced onto Track-1, BEIS would hold no 
responsibility for resources utilised on the bid. 
However, if a capture project’s original cluster is not named on Track-1 that does not 
necessarily mean that the capture project should not submit its application into the Phase-2 
allocation process. If the projects original cluster is not named but the project developer 
believes it could feasibly connect to a one of the clusters that has been named on Track-1, for 
example if it is in relatively close proximity, it could submit its Phase-2 application to be 
considered for that cluster instead. A developer that thinks they may be likely to find 
themselves in this scenario may perhaps want to consider preparing multiple applications for 
their project based on different T&S solutions.  
We are aware there could be challenges associated with this, but it is something that we would 
like to test through this consultation process.  
 
Consultation Questions on Phase-2 Final Project Allocation 
 
Do you agree with the proposed approach for allocating the first power CCUS 
contract(s)?  
 
Do you agree with the proposed approach allocating the first industrial carbon 
capture contracts? 
 
If a developer has prepared a capture project bid and then the cluster it was 
planning to connect to is not sequenced onto Track-1, could it be feasible for the 
project to submit a revised bid to connect to a different cluster (i.e., one that was 
sequenced onto Track-1)? 
 
Do you have any comments on the proposal to swap out a Track 1 cluster, to 
begin negotiations with a reserve list cluster instead?  In particular, do you have

any views on the feasibility of a reserve list cluster replacing one of the Track 1 
clusters?

Next steps  
The purpose of this consultation is to seek a broad range of views on the Government’s 
proposed approach to CCUS cluster sequencing. We will use the responses to this 
consultation to help us continue our development of this process and to consider alternatives 
as appropriate, with a view to launching a sequencing process in April this year as per the 
indicative timeline set out in Section 2 of this consultation. 
Any publication in April will incorporate Government’s response to this consultation and will be 
accompanied by a summary of the responses received to this consultation.
