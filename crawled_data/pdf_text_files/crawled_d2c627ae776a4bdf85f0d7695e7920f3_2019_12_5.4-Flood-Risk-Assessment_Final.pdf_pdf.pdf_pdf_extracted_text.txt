Executive Summary 
 
This FRA has been prepared by PBA on behalf of MPL and in accordance with the National Planning 
Policy Framework to support an application for a DCO relating to the construction of a proposed 
Power Generation Plant in Bedfordshire.  The Project will comprise an OCGT peaking power 
generating station fuelled by natural gas, along with associated development including a new Gas 
Connection to bring in fuel to supply the plant and an Electrical Connection to export the power 
generated to the NETS. 
 
This FRA has been prepared following consultation with the EA, the Bedfordshire and River Ivel 
Internal Drainage Board and the Lead Local Flood Authority (Central Bedfordshire Council). It sets out: 
 
(i) 
the nature of the existing flood risk constraints associated with watercourses and water 
bodies within and in the vicinity of the Project Site, 
(ii) 
the likely nature of the impact of the proposed Project from a flood risk perspective and 
details of proposed mitigation measures; and 
(iii) 
the scope of technical work undertaken to enable a detailed appraisal of flood risk 
constraints to inform both development planning/design and the preparation of the FRA. 
 
The Project Site is partly located within The Rookery, between Milton Keynes and Bedford, extending 
over an area of some 210ha and comprising two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South) 
separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated clay. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Environment Act 1995, The Rookery has been the subject of 
a ROMP, which allows the minerals Planning Authority to update the older mineral planning 
permissions by imposing modern operating, restoration and aftercare conditions.  The landowner 
submitted an application for the determination of new conditions in June 2009 and this application set 
out details of a LLRS which seeks to restore the former clay workings to low-intensity agricultural use, 
with measures included to enhance biodiversity and landscape.  The LLRS works comprise the re-
profiling of the pit base, slope buttressing works, the implementation of a surface water drainage 
strategy and landscaping works.  These works will be completed in all aspects material to the Project 
prior to the commencement of construction works for the Project and the LLRS therefore provides the 
‘baseline’ for the purposes of assessing flood risk constraints, the impact of the proposals from a flood 
risk perspective and associated mitigation measures. 
 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western flank of Rookery South Pit 
and a Tributary of the Mill Brook, draining a catchment to the south of Rookery South Pit, joins the Mill 
Brook in the vicinity of the south-west corner of Rookery South Pit.  The FRA has considered the nature 
of flood risk associated with these watercourses and, through hydraulic modelling analysis, has shown 
that during the 1 in 100 year flood event, floodwater may discharge into Rookery South Pit from a 
localised area along the upper reach of the tributary of the Mill Brook.  However, the LLRS works are 
such that the Power Generation Plant Site will comprise a slightly elevated platform compared to current 
levels.  In addition, the LLRS surface water drainage strategy has been designed to cater for floodwater 
influx into the Pit from the Mill Brook Tributary.  On this basis, and within the context of Tables 1 and 3 
of the NPPF Planning Practice Guidance, the Power Generation Plant Site is categorised as Flood Zone 
1 – Low Probability.  This Flood Zone classification has been agreed with the EA. 
The LLRS includes the implementation of a surface water drainage strategy, this strategy having been 
designed to cater for the entire area of Rookery South Pit, including the consented Covanta RRF 
project.  This FRA has reviewed the Project within the context of the LLRS drainage strategy and 
demonstrates that the surface water drainage infrastructure brought forward as part of the LLRS offers 
adequate storage capacity to accommodate surface water run-off from the additional impermeable 
area associated with the Project.  On this basis, the Project is ‘compatible’ with, and accommodated 
by, the LLRS drainage strategy, such that no further mitigation measures are required as part of the 
Project.

The assessment considers the potential impacts of climate change upon (i) flood risk associated with 
the Mill Brook and its Tributary and (ii) the surface water run-off regime.  The potential implications of 
extreme flooding (1 in 1,000 year, or 0.1% probability event) and ‘residual risk’ issues relating to the 
operation/performance of the surface water drainage system are also addressed and the assessment 
concludes that flood risk considerations do not constitute a barrier to the granting of a DCO for the 
Project.

Introduction 
1.1 
Background and Development Proposals 
1.1.1 
Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) has been appointed by Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) (the 
Applicant) to prepare a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) in support of an application for a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) relating to the construction of a Power Generation Plant 
in Bedfordshire. The Project would comprise an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station fuelled by natural gas, along with integral infrastructure such as a 
new Gas Connection to bring in fuel to supply the plant and an Electrical Connection to export 
the power generated to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). 
1.1.2 
Government policy in respect of development and flood risk in areas in England is contained 
within the Department for Communities and Local Government National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF) published in March 2012 and the accompanying Planning Practice 
Guidance (PPG) published in March 2014.  In addition, the Overarching National Policy 
Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) requires that applications for energy projects of 1ha or 
greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zone 2 and 3 are accompanied by a 
FRA. 
1.1.3 
The NPPF requires Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) to consult the Environment Agency (EA) 
on all applications for development in flood risk areas (except minor development), including 
those in areas with critical drainage problems and for any development on land exceeding 1 
hectare outside flood risk areas (as set out in Section 15 of the Planning Practice Guidance).  
However, The Planning Inspectorate will make the final decision with regards to applications 
for Development Consent Orders. 
1.1.4 
This FRA has been prepared in accordance with the NPPF and associated Planning Practice 
Guidance and following consultation with the EA, Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal 
Drainage Board and the Lead Local Flood Authority (Central Bedfordshire Council).  The level 
of detail entered into in any appraisal of flood risk is dependent upon the scale and potential 
impact of the proposed development and EA Standing Advice 
(https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-assessment-standing-advice) outlines the 
requirements based upon the scale/nature of development and its location within the 
floodplain. 
1.1.5 
The NPPF requires that any appraisal of flood risk be undertaken by competent people as 
early as possible in the planning process.  PBA has many years of experience in, amongst 
other areas, the assessment of flood risk, hydrology, flood defence and river engineering. 
1.2 
Advisories and Exclusions 
1.2.1 
The revised Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 (CDM Regulations) 
came into force in April 2015 to update certain duties on all parties involved in a construction 
project, including those promoting the development.  One of the designer’s responsibilities is 
to ensure that the client organisation, in this instance MPL, is made aware of their duties 
under the CDM Regulations.  Further information on the CDM Regulations is provided in the 
client guide, available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg411.pdf 
1.2.2 
It should be noted that the insurance market applies its own tests to properties in terms of 
determining premiums and the insurability of properties for flood risk.  Those undertaking 
development in areas which may be at risk of flooding are advised to contact their insurers or 
the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to seek further guidance prior to commencing 
development.

1.2.3 
The findings of this FRA are based on data available at the time of the study (August 2017) 
and relate to the current development proposals as outlined in Section 2.  PBA does not 
warrant that the advice in this report will guarantee the availability of flood insurance either 
now or in the future.

Project Description 
2.1 
Overview 
2.1.1 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) pursuant to the 
Planning Act 2008 and therefore requires a DCO under that Act. 
2.1.2 
The Project would comprise: 
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an OCGT peaking power generating station, 
fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of 
the generating station as a whole, measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which 
are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
 a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown 
Area’); 
 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length (the ‘Pipeline’) 
to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System 
(the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection also incorporates an Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System; and 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National 
Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), comprising an 
underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will replace 
an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route 
corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two SECs, 
one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would then be 
connected via underground cables approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the 
‘Substation’). 
2.1.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the ‘Power 
Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant Site’. The Power 
Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area.  
2.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with all 
access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would be 
developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the ‘Project Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is 
described in more detail in Chapter 3. 
2.1.5 
A full glossary of defined terms is presented in the Project Glossary, Document Reference 4.1. 
2.1.6 
As a peaking plant, the facility would operate when there is a ‘stress event’, such as a surge in 
demand or a sudden outage, and would also operate at times when renewable energy 
sources, such as wind and solar farms, cannot generate sufficient electricity due to their 
intermittent operation.  The Generating Equipment would operate for up to a maximum of 
2,250 hours in any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does not exceed 1,500 
hours.

Legislation, Guidance and Policy Context 
4.1 
National Policy Statements 
 
4.1.1 
The principal planning policy for the determination of energy-related NSIPs is provided by the 
National Policy Statements issued by the Government’s Department for Climate Change.  The 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) identifies flood risk as a topic requiring 
consideration/assessment as part of energy-related projects and requires that: 
 
Where the Project is likely to have effects on the water environment, the applicant should 
undertake an assessment of the existing status of, and impacts of the Project on, water 
quality, water resources and physical characteristics of the water environment; 
 
An application should be accompanied by a FRA for energy projects of 1ha or greater in 
Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 3; 
 
Where a project may be affected by or may increase flood risk, pre-application 
discussions should be undertaken with the EA and other bodies; 
 
Any requirements for sequential testing are satisfied; 
 
Priority is given to the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). 
4.1.2 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure (EN-2) outlines 
the factors influencing site selection for fossil fuel generating stations and also sets out 
additional policy on the potential impacts of energy infrastructure projects.  This includes 
policy on water quality and resource impacts and is concerned principally with water 
demand/consumption and the impacts of abstraction and discharge of cooling water.  NPS 
EN-2 does not set out additional policy in respect of flood risk. 
4.1.3 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) provides the primary 
basis for decisions taken by the Secretary of State on applications it receives for electricity 
networks infrastructure and sets out the factors influencing route selection and the impacts 
that may arise from such development.  However, NPS EN-5 does not set out additional policy 
in respect of flood risk. 
4.2 
National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) 
 
4.2.1 
The NPPF and the accompanying Planning Practice Guidance sets out the Government’s 
national policy on development and flood risk and seeks to provide clarity on what is required 
at regional and local levels to ensure that flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the 
planning process, to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding and to direct 
development away from areas at highest risk.  The NPPF outlines a risk based approach to 
the planning process and is underpinned by the Sequential Test, which is designed to ensure 
that areas at little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to areas at higher risk. 
Where, following application of the Sequential Test, it is not possible, or consistent with wider 
sustainability objectives, for the development to be located in zones with a lower probability of 
flooding, the Exception Test can be applied.  Essentially, the two parts of the Test require 
proposed development to show that it will provide wider sustainability benefits to the 
community that outweigh flood risk and that it will be safe for its lifetime, without increasing 
flood risk elsewhere.  The Test therefore provides a mechanism to allow necessary 
development to go ahead in situations where suitable sites at lower risk of flooding are not 
available.

4.2.2 
The NPPF requires that the spatial planning process should consider the possible impacts of 
climate change and contingency allowances are provided to enable impacts to be considered 
over the lifetime of the development. 
4.3 
The Flood Risk Regulations (2009) 
4.3.1 
The Flood Risk Regulations transpose the EC Floods Directive (Directive 2007/60/EC) into 
domestic law.  The regulations require that preliminary flood risk assessments are prepared by 
the EA and Unitary/County Authorities (Lead Local Flood Authorities) and that areas at 
significant potential risk of flooding are identified.  For these "significant risk" areas, hazard 
maps must be produced and flood risk management plans developed to reduce flood risk. 
4.4 
Flood and Water Management Act & Sustainable Drainage Systems: 
Written Statement – HCWS161 
4.4.1 
The Flood and Water Management Act (FWMA) received Royal Assent on 8th April 2010 and 
takes forward some of the proposals set out in three previous strategy documents published 
by the UK Government: Future Water, Making Space for Water and the UK Government's 
response to the Sir Michael Pitt Review of the summer 2007 floods. In doing so it gives the EA 
a strategic overview of flood risk and gives local authorities responsibility for preparing and 
putting in place strategies for managing flood risk from groundwater, surface water and 
ordinary watercourses in their areas.  
4.4.2 
The Flood and Water Management Act (Schedule 3) proposed the establishment of SuDS 
Approval Bodies (the “SAB”) at County or Unitary local authority levels. The role of the SAB 
was envisaged as implementing the recommendations of the Pitt Review (2008) in promoting 
the use of SuDS within future development. 
4.4.3 
Following a period of consultation, the proposed role of the SAB has been amended, with the 
promotion of SuDS being incorporated into the planning process. This has been achieved by 
designating Lead Local Flood Authorities as statutory consultees with regards to ‘local’ 
sources of flood risk and surface water management.  Ministerial Written Statement 
HCWS161 details this change in policy, which came into effect in April 2015. 
4.4.4 
The FWMA also amends Section 106 of the Water Industry Act (WIA) in respect of the right of 
connection to a public sewer. In the future, the automatic right of connection will be revoked 
and all new connections must be made via a Section 104 Agreement for foul sewers and 
following the consent of the SAB for surface water connections. As the role of the SAB has 
been removed following HCWS161, this amendment to Section 106 of the WIA is now 
subsumed into the planning process under the purview of the Lead Local Flood Authority. 
4.5 
Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2017 
4.5.1 
These regulations transpose the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) (WFD) into law 
in England and Wales.  The WFD is a wide-ranging piece of European legislation that 
establishes a new legal framework for the protection, improvement and sustainable use of 
surface waters, coastal waters and groundwater across Europe in order to: 
 
Promote sustainable water use; 
 
 
Contribute to the mitigation of floods and droughts; 
 
 
Prevent deterioration and enhance status of aquatic ecosystems, including groundwater; 
 
 
Reduce pollution. 
 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
11 
 
4.5.2 
Water management has historically been co-ordinated according to administrative or political 
boundaries. The WFD promotes an approach based on management by river basin - the 
natural geographical and hydrological unit. River basin management plans include clear 
objectives in respect of water quality and pollution control and a detailed account of how 
objectives are to be met within a prescribed timeframe. 
4.6 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 
4.6.1 
The Regulations as amended provide the regulatory framework under which discharges to 
controlled waters and other emissions to the environment are controlled. 
4.6.2 
The Regulations also transpose the requirements of the Groundwater Directive into law in 
England and Wales. They place a duty on the EA to protect groundwater by prohibiting 
groundwater activities other than those carried out under a permit or exemption. Groundwater 
activities include discharges of pollutants to groundwater (whether direct or indirect).  
4.6.3 
The Regulations therefore require that the direct or indirect discharge of pollutants to 
groundwater must be subject to prior authorisation and also allow notices to be served to 
control activities which may lead to discharges of pollutants to groundwater.  
4.7 
Non-statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems 
4.7.1 
This document contains non-statutory technical standards for the design, maintenance and 
operation of sustainable drainage systems serving housing, non-residential or mixed use 
developments and was published by Defra in March 2015. 
4.8 
Water Resources Act 1991 
4.8.1 
The Water Resources Act 1991 (WRA) came into effect in 1991 and sets out the 
responsibilities of the EA in relation to water pollution, resource management, flood defence, 
fisheries, and in some areas, navigation. The WRA regulates discharges to controlled waters, 
namely rivers, estuaries, coastal waters, lakes and groundwater. Discharge to controlled 
waters is only permitted with the consent of the EA. Similarly, a licence is required to abstract 
from controlled waters.  
4.9 
Land Drainage Act 1991 
4.9.1 
The Act consolidates various enactments relating to Internal Drainage Boards and the functions 
of these Boards and local authorities in relation to land drainage.  Amongst other matters, the 
Act sets out provisions and powers in respect of the control of flow of watercourses and 
watercourse restoration/improvement works. 
4.10 The Building Regulations 2010 
4.10.1 The Building Regulations 2010, Requirement H3, stipulates that rainwater from roofs and 
paved areas is carried away from the surface to discharge to one of the following, listed in 
order of priority: 
1. 
an adequate soakaway or some other adequate infiltration system, or where that is not 
reasonably practicable; 
2. 
a watercourse, or where that is not practicable; 
3. 
a sewer.

4.11 Interim Code of Practice for Sustainable Drainage Systems (2004) 
4.11.1 This Code of Practice provides support for developers in promoting and implementing a 
sustainable approach to water management and in particular Sustainable Drainage Systems 
(SuDS), to ensure their long-term viability and to promote consistent use. The document sets 
out the key regulatory requirements that must be considered and adhered to before SuDS are 
installed and commissioned. 
4.12 Sewers for Adoption 7th Edition 
4.12.1 'Sewers for Adoption' is the standard in England and Wales for the design and construction of 
sewers to adoptable standards. It is a guide to assist developers in preparing their submission 
to a Sewerage Undertaker prior to entering an Adoption Agreement under Section 104 of the 
Water Industry Act 1991. 
4.13 Flood Risk Assessments: climate change allowances 
4.13.1 This guidance was published by the Environment Agency in February 2016 and should be 
used as the basis for preparing FRAs.  The guidance sets out the climate change allowances 
for peak river flow, peak rainfall intensity, sea level rise, off-shore wind speeds and extreme 
wave height. 
4.13.2 Allowances in respect of peak river flow vary according to River Basin District, flood zone and 
proposed land-use (and therefore the lifetime of the development).  The Project Site lies within 
the Anglian River Basin District. 
4.14 Surface Waters Plan - Plan for Strategic Management of Surface Waters 
and their Local Environment in the Forest of Marston Vale (Bedfordshire 
and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board and the Forest of Marston Vale, 
June 2002) 
4.14.1 This document was prepared to promote a series of policies that will encourage an integrated 
and sustainable approach to the management of surface waters in the context of major 
development in the area, including: 
 
An integrated approach to flood risk management, surface water drainage and the water 
environment; 
 
Promote government guidance such as PPS25 (since replaced by the NPPF), providing a 
framework for site-specific FRAs to be produced in support of planning applications; 
 
Implementation of strategic solutions to surface water drainage and flood risk that are 
sustainable and offer opportunities for environmental and recreational gains. 
4.14.2 It should be noted that Rookery Pit lies outside of the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal 
Drainage Board’s area of jurisdiction. However, Mill Brook, which flows along the western side 
of the Pit, outfalls to Stewartby Lake located just to the west, which is a water body maintained 
by the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board. 
4.15 Central Bedfordshire Council Local Flood Risk Management Strategy 
(February 2014) 
4.15.1 Central Bedfordshire Council, in its role as Lead Local Flood Authority (as defined by the 
Flood and Water Management Act, 2010), has prepared a Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy.  The strategy addresses flood risk arising from surface water, groundwater and 
ordinary watercourses, sets out a number of objectives for managing flood risk and the actions

and the measures identified to achieve these objectives.  The majority of the items set out in 
the strategy Action Plan are county-wide and the strategy does not identify any specific 
issues/actions/objectives for the area in the immediate vicinity of the Project Site. 
4.16 Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment 
4.16.1 In accordance with the requirements of the Flood Risk Regulations (2009), Central 
Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Council and Milton Keynes Council commissioned the 
Bedford Group of Drainage Boards to prepare a Preliminary FRA.  This constitutes a high 
level screening exercise to identify significant flood risk areas associated with flooding from 
surface water, groundwater and ordinary watercourses.  The assessment did not identify any 
significant flood risk areas and, being a high level, strategic study, it does not contain any 
information in respect of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook catchment. 
4.17 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (May 2017) 
4.17.1 Central Bedfordshire Council commissioned JBA Consulting Limited to prepare a Level 1 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to inform preparation of the Local Plan (to 2036).  The 
assessment is based upon historic flood records, hydraulic modelling data and the EA’s Flood 
Map for Planning.  The assessment does not present any detailed/site-specific information in 
respect of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook catchment.

Site and Surroundings 
5.1 
Site Location and Description 
5.1.1 
The Project Site is partly located within 'The Rookery', which extends over an area of some 
210ha and comprises two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South) separated by 
an east-west spine of unexcavated clay. 
5.1.2 
The Rookery is located in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, 
approximately 3km north of Ampthill, a local market town, and 7km south-west of Bedford. 
5.1.3 
The general location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1, Appendix A. 
5.1.4 
The Generating Equipment, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection would be located within part of Rookery South Pit, which is 
approximately 95ha in area and bounded by steep clay banks that are varied in nature and 
substrate.  The level of the pit base currently varies between approximately 10m and 15m 
below ground level and includes open water, reed beds, pools and bare inundated clay.  The 
land that remains at the original ground level (approximately 42m AOD) around the periphery 
of Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground that has previously been cleared of 
vegetation and maintained in this state for approximately the last 30 years. 
5.1.5 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located largely outside of Rookery 
South Pit, in a mostly undeveloped, agricultural landscape which comprises large arable fields, 
small areas of woodland, hedgerows and a number of drainage ditches. 
5.1.6 
Access to the Project Site is from the north near Stewartby, via the A421 Bedford Road and 
Green Lane.  A junction on Green Lane leads to an access track which extends south, along 
the western fringe of Rookery North Pit and into Rookery South Pit. 
5.2 
Wider Setting 
5.2.1 
The former chimneys of the Stewartby Brickworks and the settlement of Stewartby itself lie to 
the north of The Rookery. Other nearby residential areas include: Houghton Conquest 
approximately 1.5km to the east of the Project Site; Marston Moretaine approximately 1.2km to 
the west and Millbrook approximately 400m to the south.  These residential areas are shown on 
Figure 1, Appendix A. 
5.2.2 
To the west of the Project Site is the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park.  Millbrook Proving 
Ground, a vehicle testing ground covering 285ha, is located to the south-west of Rookery South 
Pit. 
5.2.3 
Overhead power lines run west to east, to the south of Rookery South Pit, and a number of 
public footpaths are located in and around the Project Site, linking it to the wider Marston Vale.  
5.2.4 
The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South Pillinge Farm, 
located approximately 130m to the west of the western boundary of the Project Site.  South 
Pillinge Farm is separated from the Project Site by a small deciduous woodland.  
5.3 
Watercourses and Water Bodies 
5.3.1 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western flank of Rookery 
South Pit.  The Brook rises in the vicinity of Millbrook, approximately 1.5km to the south of 
Rookery South Pit, and drains a predominantly rural catchment of approximately 3.8km2.  It 
passes through a culvert beneath the Marston Vale Railway Line and ultimately outfalls to 
Stewartby Lake, a further 400m downstream.

5.3.2 
A tributary watercourse draining a catchment of 0.9km2 passes to the south of Rookery South 
Pit within the Project Site and joins the Mill Brook to the east of South Pillinge Farm (Figure 1, 
Appendix A). 
5.4 
Flood Defences 
5.4.1 
There are no flood defences within/adjacent to the Project Site. 
5.5 
Geology, Hydrogeology and Groundwater Vulnerability 
5.5.1 
The 1:10,000 scale geological maps of the area indicate the presence of some superficial 
deposits covering the solid geology within Marston Vale.  The superficial deposits comprise 
Alluvium (up to 2m thick), Head Deposits (derived from solifluction processes which occurred 
during glacial and periglacial times and up to 2m thick) and glacial sand, gravel and till (shown 
sporadically overlying the solid geology in the southern areas of the Vale at Marston Gate, 
Brogborough and Lidlington). 
5.5.2 
In terms of solid geology, the geological map indicates that the majority of the Vale is 
underlain by the Oxford Clay Formation of the Jurassic Period which, regionally, is recorded at 
thicknesses of 70m.  The Oxford Clay Formation is underlain sequentially by the Kellaways 
Formation and the Great Oolite Group. 
5.5.3 
The groundwater vulnerability map for the Project Site indicates that the Oxford Clay is 
considered to be unproductive strata.  The Oxford Clay therefore behaves as an effective 
aquitard (i.e. it impedes groundwater movement) where left undisturbed.  The Alluvial and Head 
Deposits are designated as Minor Aquifers with variable soil leaching potential. 
5.5.4 
DEFRA publish indicative Groundwater Source Protection Zones (SPZs) for 2000 groundwater 
sources such as wells, boreholes and springs used for public drinking water supply 
(http://www.natureonthemap.naturalengland.org.uk/MagicMap.aspx). The zones define areas 
where a range of human activities may damage/pollute groundwater. The maps show three 
main zones (inner, outer and total catchment) and a fourth zone of special interest.  
5.5.5 
Examination of the mapping shows that the Project Site does not lie within any Source 
Protection Zone.  The closest Source Protection Zone (Total Catchment – Zone 3) is located 
approximately 2km to the south of the Project Site.

Planning Background 
6.1 
Context 
6.1.1 
The Environment Act 1995 requires owners and operators of mineral sites to periodically 
update the planning conditions that regulate and control extraction operations.  This review 
process is known as the Review of Old Minerals Permission (ROMP) and aims to allow the 
minerals Planning Authority to update the older mineral planning permissions by imposing 
modern operating, restoration and aftercare conditions. 
 
6.1.2 
O&H Properties Ltd (O&H), as landowner of Rookery Pit, submitted an application for the 
determination of new conditions in June 2009 (application number: BC/CM/2000/8).  This 
ROMP review application set out details of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS), the 
scope of which is summarised below and set out in the Drawings presented in Appendix B. 
6.2 
The Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
6.2.1 
The LLRS seeks to restore the former clay workings to low-intensity agricultural use, with 
measures included to enhance biodiversity and landscape.  The LLRS works within Rookery 
South Pit comprise: 
 
the re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils and clays from the 
permitted extraction area on the southern side with re-grading of the base of the pit to an 
approximate level of 15mbgl; 
 
implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction of an attenuation 
pond and pumping station to facilitate a managed surface water drainage strategy; 
 
a landscape strategy to include planting on the boundary of Rookery South Pit and the 
margins of the attenuation pond;  
 
provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to ensure the long-
term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through excavation; 
 
provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of Rookery North Pit and 
around the attenuation pond within Rookery South Pit; 
 
provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North Pit which connects 
to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along the western side of Rookery North 
Pit. Note that the ramp and existing track are both of an agricultural standard; and 
 
provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery South Pit from the south 
side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, near Millbrook Station. 
6.2.2 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-worked area 
situated directly to the south of the existing extent of Rookery South Pit will be undertaken. This 
area covers approximately 25 ha and forms part of the existing minerals extraction consent 
boundary, but has not historically been subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area 
will provide material for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to Rookery South 
Pit together with the implementation of a landscape and ecology strategy, which will integrate 
with ecological mitigation works and strategic landscape planting in Rookery North Pit. 
6.2.3 
Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 15m below the 
surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and 
the Substation. 
6.2.4 
The LLRS works will be completed prior to the commencement of construction works for the 
Project, with the possible exception of buttressing and re-profiling to the eastern side of Rookery 
South Pit, which has no bearing on the Project as it lies outside the boundary of the Project Site.

6.2.5 
The LLRS therefore provides the baseline for the purposes of assessing (i) the nature of flood 
risk constraints associated with watercourses and water bodies within and in the vicinity of the 
Project Site and (ii) the likely nature of the impact of the development proposals from a flood 
risk perspective and associated mitigation measures.

Stakeholder Consultation 
7.1.1 
In preparing this FRA, consultation has been undertaken with the EA, the Bedfordshire and 
River Ivel Internal Drainage Board (IDB) and the Lead Local Flood Authority (Central 
Bedfordshire Council). 
7.1.2 
The purpose of this consultation was to: 
 
identify the issues to be addressed; 
 
agree design criteria/principles; and 
 
agree the methodology for the technical assessment/analysis required to inform the FRA. 
7.1.3 
A joint FRA ‘scoping’ meeting was held with both the EA and IDB in December 2014, at which 
the scope of the FRA and associated methodology and design principles were agreed.  A 
copy of the meeting notes summarising the scope of matters discussed and agreed is 
enclosed within Appendix C. 
7.1.4 
Following the project being placed ‘on hold’ in 2015 and the subsequent change in legislation 
in April 2015 (following which the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) became a statutory 
consultee in the planning process in respect of surface water drainage), a further meeting was 
held with both the IDB and LLFA in July 2017 to (i) ‘re-cap’ on matters, (ii) ensure that any 
‘new’ information was identified and (iii) agree the scope of work required to finalise the FRA.  
A copy of the meeting notes summarising the scope of matters discussed and agreed is 
enclosed within Appendix C.  The EA advised that it was not necessary for a representative 
to attend the July 2017 meeting on account of (i) the site falling outside Flood Zones 2 and 3 
and (ii) matters relating to surface water drainage no longer being part of the Agency’s remit.

Flood Risk Assessment 
8.1 
Tidal/Coastal 
8.1.1 
Flooding arising from tidal or coastal sources is not an issue at this inland location given the 
distance to the sea. 
8.2 
Groundwater 
8.2.1 
Information in respect of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the site is set out in the 
report titled ‘Millbrook Power Project, Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment (Contamination 
and Ground Stability), July 2017’, prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP.  According to this 
report the solid geology of the area generally consists of the following sequence of strata: 
 
the Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation; 
 
underlain by the Kellaways Formation (including the Kellaways Clay Member); 
 
underlain by the Cornbrash Formation (limestone) and the Blisworth Clay Formation and 
Blisworth Limestone Formation at depth. 
8.2.2 
More specifically, the report indicates that the geological sequence in the base of Rookery 
South Pit comprises made ground in the form of Callow Clay fill (superficial deposits and 
weathered Oxford Clay not suitable for brickmaking which was removed and cast back into the 
Pit), underlain by Oxford Clay.   
8.2.3 
The report also indicates that the clayey deposits of the Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, 
Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay Formation can be considered as being 
aquicludes/aquitards (an impermeable body of rock or stratum of sediment that acts as a 
barrier to the flow of groundwater).  According to the report, the Cornbrash Formation is 
classified as a Minor Aquifer, but has been shown to be characterised by low permeability, 
such that it is considered to be an aquitard.  The Blisworth Limestone Formation is similarly 
characterised by low permeability. 
8.2.4 
The report indicates that groundwater elevations in the base of Rookery South Pit are around 
28.7m AOD (approximately 0.3m bgl). 
8.2.5 
Enquiries conducted as part of this assessment and information collated as part of the 
aforementioned Ground Condition Assessment have not identified any evidence of elevated 
groundwater levels or records of groundwater flooding.  Flooding arising from groundwater 
sources is not therefore considered to be an issue at this location. 
8.3 
Flood Risk from Surface Water Map 
8.3.1 
The site comprises a former clay pit that is being restored to low-intensity agricultural use.  
Surface water accumulating within the Pit is currently pumped to the Mill Brook, in accordance 
with the terms of an existing Consent to Discharge (EA reference PRCNF/14024) granted 
under Schedule 10 of the Water Resources Act 1991. 
8.3.2 
The ‘Flood Risk from Surface Water Map’ (https://flood-warning-
information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk) shows areas that may potentially be 
susceptible to surface water flooding following an extreme rainfall event (Insert 8.1 below). 
 
 
 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
20 
 
Insert 8.1: EA Updated Flood Map for Surface Water 
 
8.3.3 
It should be noted that this map is generated using a broad methodology applied at the national 
scale. The model utilises generalised information on infiltration, sewerage infrastructure, rainfall 
events and catchment topography to route rainfall over a ground surface model.  As such, the 
analysis does not take account of site-scale factors/characteristics that may exert an influence 
upon surface water flood depths and extents.  The map therefore only provides a guide 
regarding the areas that may be vulnerable to this source of flooding. 
8.3.4 
Moreover, this mapping is based upon the existing topography of the Pit base and is not 
therefore representative of the surface water drainage regime that will exist following 
implementation of the LLRS (as set out in Section 6 above). 
8.3.5 
As noted above, the LLRS provides the baseline for the purposes of assessing the nature of 
flood risk constraints.  The LLRS works include the implementation of a surface water 
drainage strategy, comprising construction of a surface water balancing pond within the north-
west corner of Rookery South Pit, the excavation of associated surface water interceptor 
channels within the base of the Pit and provision of a pumping station to enable surface water 
to be pumped to Rookery North Pit and the Mill Brook.  The surface water drainage strategy 
has been designed to accommodate the Covanta RRF, along with other future development, 
including the Project.  Proposals in respect of surface water management are set out in 
Section 10 of this report. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
21 
 
8.3.6 
It is therefore concluded that surface water will be appropriately managed such that flood risk 
arising from surface water sources, both within and outside the Pit, is not considered to be an 
issue at this location. 
8.4 
Watercourses 
8.4.1 
The EA publishes floodplain maps on the internet (https://flood-map-for-
planning.service.gov.uk)).  These maps show the possible extent of fluvial flooding for the 1 in 
100 year flood (that which would have a 1% probability of being exceeded each year) or the 
possible extent of tidal flooding to a 1 in 200 year event. Also shown is the possible extent of 
flooding arising from a 1 in 1,000 year event (0.1% probability). 
8.4.2 
In this instance, the EA’s flood maps do not extend to include the Mill Brook and its Tributary 
on account of the small size of the contributing catchment area. 
8.4.3 
The nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook and its Tributary was originally 
assessed in 2008 (‘the LLRS modelling study’) as part of the ROMP review application and 
the findings reflected in the design of the LLRS.  Flood risk was assessed by developing a 
HEC-RAS hydraulic model using a topographic survey of Rookery South Pit and the 
watercourse corridor and associated structures/crossings undertaken in 2003. 
8.4.4 
This analysis demonstrated that floodwater may discharge into the Pit during the 1 in 100 year 
flood event, the discharge occurring in a very localised area along the upper reach of the Mill 
Brook Tributary (Figure 2, Appendix D).  The LLRS was subsequently designed to cater for 
this flooding mechanism – floodwater being allowed to discharge into the Pit on a ‘managed’ 
basis, such that it would be intercepted and routed to the surface water attenuation pond (the 
routing channels and attenuation pond being designed to accommodate both floodwater 
discharge from the Mill Brook Tributary and surface water run-off arising from within the Pit 
itself).  This strategy was agreed with both the EA and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel IDB. 
8.4.5 
The LLRS modelling study was refined and updated in 2010 in support of proposals for 
development within the north-west area of Rookery South Pit (the Covanta RRF) and following 
further topographic survey of the Mill Brook corridor (‘the Covanta modelling study’).   
8.4.6 
Following consultation with the EA and IDB in July 2017, it was agreed that the 2010 Covanta 
modelling study provides the best available data in respect of flood risk associated with the 
Mill Brook such that it should be taken forward and used to inform the FRA prepared in 
support of the Project.  However, it was noted that in the time that had elapsed since the 2010 
study was concluded, the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) methodology and associated 
database (used to estimate flood flows for the purposes of hydraulic modelling) had been 
revised/updated.  It was therefore agreed that the 2010 assessment of flood flows should be 
reviewed/validated before being used to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Project. 
8.4.7 
A summary of the revised and updated FEH analysis is set out in the Technical Note 
presented in Appendix D.  This demonstrates that (i) flood flow estimates for the tributary are 
lower than those derived in 2010 and (ii) flood flow estimates for the Mill Brook are higher than 
those derived in 2010.  Model sensitivity testing has therefore been undertaken to quantify the 
impact of the revised flow estimates upon peak water levels and floodwater discharge from the 
watercourses and into Rookery South Pit.  Details of the modelling analysis are presented in 
the Technical Note enclosed in Appendix D.  In summary, it was found that: 
 
The volume of floodwater discharge into the Pit from the Mill Brook Tributary during the 1 
in 100 year plus climate change event amounts to c.5,000m3 (reduced from c.7,500m3 
assessed in 2010).  Floodwater discharge into the Pit does not occur along the main branch 
of the Mill Brook; 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
22 
 
 
The volume of floodwater discharge into the Pit from the Mill Brook tributary and the main 
branch of the Mill Brook during the 1 in 1,000 year event amounts to c.16,000m3 (reduced 
from c.21,000m3 in 2010). 
8.4.8 
In accordance with stakeholder requirements, consideration of the impacts of climate change 
is based upon the guidance titled ‘Flood risk assessments: climate change allowances’ 
published by the EA in 2016.  In this instance, an allowance of +35% peak river flow has been 
used. 
8.4.9 
It should be noted that the volume of floodwater discharge into the Pit following a 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event assessed as part of the LLRS modelling study in 2008 amounted to 
c.23,000m3.  The reduced volumes associated with both the 2010 and 2017 assessments are 
a result of revised catchment hydrology and improved model resolution. 
8.5 
Extent and Depth of Flooding 
8.5.1 
Hydraulic modelling has demonstrated that floodwater arising from the Mill Brook and its 
Tributary may discharge into Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 year, the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change and the 1 in 1,000 year events. 
8.5.2 
However, as outlined in Section 6 above, the LLRS includes (i) re-profiling of the base of the 
pit to create an elevated platform and (ii) implementation of a surface water drainage strategy, 
comprising construction of a surface water balancing pond within the north-west corner of 
Rookery South Pit, the excavation of associated surface water interceptor channels within the 
base of the Pit and provision of a pumping station to enable surface water to be pumped to 
Rookery North Pit and the Mill Brook.  The surface water drainage scheme has been designed 
to cater for floodwater influx into the Pit from the Mill Brook and its Tributary (the design and 
capacity of the surface water drainage scheme is discussed further in Section 10 of this 
report). 
8.5.3 
On this basis, and within the context of Tables 1 and 3 of the NPPF Planning Practice 
Guidance, the Power Generation Plant site is categorised as Flood Zone 1 – Low Probability.  
This Flood Zone classification has been agreed with the EA (ref correspondence included in 
Appendix C). 
Table 1 Flood Zones 
Zone 1 Low Probability 
Definition 
This zone comprises land assessed as having a less than 1 in 1000 annual probability 
of river or sea flooding in any year (<0.1%). 
Appropriate uses 
All uses of land are appropriate in this zone 
FRA requirements 
For development proposals on sites comprising one hectare or above the vulnerability 
to flooding from other sources as well as from river and sea flooding, and the potential 
to increase flood risk elsewhere through the addition of hard surfaces and the effect of 
the new development on surface water run-off, should be incorporated in a FRA. This 
need only be brief unless the factors above or other local considerations require 
particular attention. 
Policy aims 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities to reduce the 
overall level of flood risk in the area and beyond through the layout and form of the 
development, and the appropriate application of sustainable drainage systems. 
Zone 2 Medium Probability 
Definition 
This zone comprises land assessed as having between a 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 annual 
probability of river flooding (1% – 0.1%) or between a 1 in 200 and 1 in 1000 annual 
probability of sea flooding (0.5% – 0.1%) in any year. 
Appropriate uses 
Essential infrastructure and the water-compatible, less vulnerable and more vulnerable 
uses, as set out in Table 2, are appropriate in this zone.  The highly vulnerable uses are 
only appropriate in this zone if the Exception Test is passed. 
FRA requirements 
All development proposals in this zone should be accompanied by a FRA. 
Policy aims 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities to reduce the 
overall level of flood risk in the area through the layout and form of the development, 
and the appropriate application of sustainable drainage systems.

Zone 3a High Probability 
Definition 
This zone comprises land assessed as having a 1 in 100 or greater annual probability of 
river flooding (>1%) or a 1 in 200 or greater annual probability of flooding from the sea 
(>0.5%) in any year. 
 
 
Appropriate uses 
The water-compatible and less vulnerable uses of land (Table 2) are appropriate in this 
zone.  The highly vulnerable uses should not be permitted in this zone. 
 
The more vulnerable uses and essential infrastructure should only be permitted in this 
zone if the Exception Test is passed. Essential infrastructure permitted in this zone 
should be designed and constructed to remain operational and safe for users in times of 
flood. 
FRA requirements 
All development proposals in this zone should be accompanied by a FRA. 
Policy aims 
 
 
 
 
 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities to: 
i. reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area through the layout and form of the 
development and the appropriate application of sustainable drainage systems; 
ii. relocate existing development to land in zones with a lower probability of flooding; 
and 
iii. create space for flooding to occur by restoring functional floodplain and flood flow 
pathways and by identifying, allocating and safeguarding open space for flood storage. 
Zone 3b The Functional Floodplain 
Definition 
This zone comprises land where water has to flow or be stored in times of flood. 
 
Local planning authorities should identify in their Strategic Flood Risk Assessments 
areas of functional floodplain and its boundaries accordingly, in agreement with the EA. 
The identification of functional floodplain should take account of local circumstances 
and not be defined solely on rigid probability parameters. But land which would flood 
with an annual probability of 1 in 20 (5%) or greater in any year, or is designed to flood 
in an extreme (0.1%) flood, should provide a starting point for consideration and 
discussions to identify the functional floodplain. 
Appropriate uses 
Only the water-compatible uses and the essential infrastructure listed in Table 2 that 
has to be there should be permitted in this zone. It should be designed and constructed 
to: 
– remain operational and safe for users in times of flood; 
– result in no net loss of floodplain storage; 
– not impede water flows; and 
– not increase flood risk elsewhere. 
 
Essential infrastructure in this zone should pass the Exception Test. 
FRA requirements 
 
All development proposals in this zone should be accompanied by a FRA. 
Policy aims 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities to: 
 
i. reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area through the layout and form of the 
development and the appropriate application of sustainable drainage systems; 
 
ii. relocate existing development to land with a lower probability of flooding. 
 
8.5.4 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located within the lowest probability flood zone and, as

10 Surface Water Management 
10.1 LLRS Surface Water Drainage Strategy 
10.1.1 As outlined in Section 6 above, a surface water drainage strategy will be implemented as part 
of the LLRS works.  The LLRS works are taking place independently of the Project and will be 
completed in all aspects material to the Project prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project. 
10.1.2 The principal components of the surface water drainage strategy are presented in Drawing 
3.1, Appendix B and may be summarised as follows: 
 
the base of the pit will have been re-profiled such that surface water run-off sheds towards 
the north-west corner of the pit; 
 
construction of a surface water balancing pond within the north-west corner of Rookery 
South Pit; 
 
excavation of surface water interceptor channels within the base of the Pit to intercept 
surface water run-off and convey it to the attenuation pond; 
 
surface water run-off that collects within the Rookery South Pit attenuation pond will be 
pumped to Rookery North Pit as a strategic attenuation facility at a rate of 100l/s, and to 
the Mill Brook at a rate of 23l/s (in accordance with the existing Consent to Discharge, EA 
reference PRCNF/14024); 
 
the normal water level within Rookery North Pit will have been drawn down from 36m to 
35m AOD to provide an additional storage volume, thereby allowing Rookery North to be 
used as a strategic attenuation facility in higher order rainfall events; 
 
a gravity return connection will allow surface water to be discharged from Rookery North 
back to the attenuation pond in Rookery South at a rate of no more than 23l/s. 
Design Parameters 
10.1.3 The design parameters adopted for the purposes of designing the LLRS surface water 
drainage strategy are as follows: 
Impermeable Area 
10.1.4 Given the nature of the pit and its surrounding clay catchment, it was assumed that the base 
of the pit, the side slopes of the pit and the small areas of land draining towards the pit are 
100% impermeable. The total impermeable area assumed was approximately 105ha, the 
boundary of which is shown on Drawing No. 3.1 contained within Appendix B. 
Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) 
10.1.5 The sizing of the attenuation pond was undertaken using catchment specific rainfall 
parameters derived from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). 
Volumetric Run-off Coefficient 
10.1.6 A volumetric run-off coefficient (Cv) of 0.85 was adopted in the sizing of the attenuation pond. 
Climate Change 
10.1.7 In accordance with the NPPF and associated Planning Practice Guidance, the attenuation 
pond was sized to allow for an increase of up to 30% in rainfall intensity due to the effects of 
climate change. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project

Sizing of the Attenuation Pond 
10.1.8 The attenuation pond has been sized to accommodate rainfall events up to and including the 
1 in 100 year event plus climate change (taken as an increase of 30% in rainfall intensity) with 
a 1 in 10 year plus climate change event following within one week of the 1 in 100 year rainfall 
event. The attenuation pond is a ‘wet’ pond containing a 0.5m normal water depth, a further 
2m of storage depth (total depth of water when full of 2.5m), 1 in 3 side slopes and a 1.0m 
freeboard. 
Mill Brook Floodwater Influx 
10.1.9 In addition to catering for surface water run-off arising from within Rookery South Pit, the 
attenuation pond has been designed to accommodate floodwater influx from the Mill Brook 
and its Tributary associated with the 1 in 1000 year flood event. 
Storage Volumes 
10.1.10 In addition to assessing the quantum of surface water storage required to accommodate the 1 
in 100 year plus climate change event, the design of the surface water drainage infrastructure 
brought forward as part of the LLRS was informed by consideration of ‘residual risk’ scenarios, 
including: 
 
Pumping station failure and; 
 
A 1 in 10 year plus climate change follow-on rainfall event occurring within one week of the 
1 in 100 year plus climate change event. 
10.1.11 Storage volumes for the various design scenarios, defined as part of the LLRS design 
process, are summarised in the table below:

216,005m3 
29.45 
 
10.1.12 As set out in the table above, the Rookery South Pit attenuation pond has been sized to 
provide adequate storage to accommodate the 1 in 100 year plus climate change rainfall 
event, followed by the 1 in 10 year plus climate change rainfall event (i.e. total storage for 
surface water run-off amounts to 193,005m3).  Storage capacity also caters for floodwater 
influx from the Mill Brook associated with the 1 in 100 year plus climate change event 
(23,000m3, as assessed in 2008), such that the total volume of storage within the pond 
(including freeboard) amounts to 216,005m3. 
10.2 Proposed Project Site Surface Water Drainage 
Generating Equipment Site 
10.2.1 Surface water run-off arising from internal roads and areas of hardstanding will be conveyed 
by a private, gravity surface water drainage network to the LLRS interceptor channels, 
ultimately outfalling to the LLRS surface water balancing pond.  The private, gravity surface 
water drainage network will be designed in accordance with the requirements of the Building 
Regulations and BS EN 752. 
10.2.2 Surface water run-off that may be mobilised as overland flows during extreme rainfall events 
will be conveyed by the internal roads to the LLRS drainage system.  Site levels will therefore 
be designed accordingly. 
Access Road 
10.2.3 Surface water run-off from the access road extending from Green Lane will be conveyed via a 
gravity, highway drainage network and will outfall to the LLRS surface water balancing pond.  
Highway drainage will be designed in accordance with the requirements of the Design Manual 
for Roads and Bridges.  Surface water run-off that may be mobilised as overland flows during 
extreme rainfall events will be conveyed within the highway cross-section. 
Gas Connection 
10.2.4 The connection comprises a buried pipeline, such that it will not give rise to an increase in 
impermeable area within the catchment of the Mill Brook and impact upon the surface water 
run-off regime. 
10.2.5 The only permanent above ground structure associated with the gas connection is the Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System.  It is 
currently envisaged that surface water run-off arising from areas of hardstanding associated 
with the AGI will be managed/controlled using a soakaway or other similar infiltration method.  
Infiltration testing will be undertaken as part of the detailed design process. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project

Electrical Connection 
10.2.6 The Electrical Connection comprises an underground cable/circuit, such that it will not give rise 
to an increase in impermeable area within the catchment of the Mill Brook and impact upon the 
surface water run-off regime. 
10.2.7 The Substation and SECs are the only permanent above ground structures associated with 
the Electrical Connection.  Surface water run-off arising from the Substation will be conveyed 
to the LLRS interceptor channels, ultimately outfalling to the LLRS surface water balancing 
pond. It is currently envisaged that surface water run-off arising from areas of hardstanding 
associated with the SECs will be managed/controlled using a soakaway or other similar 
infiltration method.  Infiltration testing will be undertaken as part of the detailed design 
process. 
10.3 Review of The Project within the context of the LLRS Surface Water 
Drainage Strategy 
10.3.1 As summarised above, the surface water drainage infrastructure brought forward as part of 
the LLRS has been designed to cater for all future development within Rookery South Pit, 
including the consented Covanta RRF project. 
10.3.2 To establish whether the Project is ‘compatible’ with the LLRS drainage strategy (i.e. such that 
no further mitigation measures are required as part of the Project), the nature/extent of the 
contributing catchment area associated with the Project has been reviewed.  This review has 
concluded that: 
 
The Generating Equipment, substation, temporary Laydown Area and southern part of the 
Access Road fall within the surface water drainage catchment defined for the purposes of 
designing the LLRS surface water drainage infrastructure (i.e. such that the LLRS drainage 
strategy caters for surface water run-off arising from these areas); 
 
The length of Access Road extending from Green Lane to the north-west corner of Rookery 
South Pit falls outside the surface water drainage catchment defined for the purposes of 
designing the LLRS surface water drainage infrastructure. 
10.3.3 The additional impermeable area associated with the length of Access Road extending from 
Green Lane to the north-west corner of Rookery South Pit equates to approximately 17,200m2 
and it is proposed that surface water run-off from this area drains to the Rookery South Pit 
attenuation pond.  This will therefore give rise to an increase in the area contributing to the 
pond.  The impact of this additional contributing area draining to the pond has been assessed 
using the MicroDrainage design software and using design parameters previously established 
in respect of the LLRS.   
10.3.4 Storage volumes for the various design scenarios, defined as part of the LLRS design 
process, and taking account of the additional impermeable area associated with the northern 
part of the Access Road, are summarised in the table below:

29.38 
 
10.3.5 As set out in the table above, allowing for the additional impermeable area associated with the 
northern part of the Access Road, the storage volume required to cater for run-off associated 
with the 1 in 100 year plus climate change rainfall event, followed by the 1 in 10 year plus 
climate change rainfall event, increases from 193,005m3 to 198,283m3.  Allowing for 
floodwater influx from the Mill Brook associated with the 1 in 100 year plus climate change 
event, the total volume of storage required reduces from 216,005m3 (Table 10.1) to 
203,283m3.  This reduction in the total volume of storage required is due to the reduced 
volume of floodwater influx from the Mill Brook. 
10.3.6 The review set out above therefore demonstrates that the surface water attenuation pond 
brought forward as part of the LLRS offers adequate storage capacity to accommodate 
surface water run-off from the additional impermeable area associated with the length of 
Access Road extending from Green Lane to the north-west corner of Rookery South Pit.  On 
this basis, the Project is ‘compatible’ with the LLRS drainage strategy, such that no further 
mitigation measures are required as part of The Project. 
10.4 Extreme Flooding (0.1% Probability Event) 
10.4.1 As set out in Section 8 above, the hydraulic modelling analysis has assessed flood risk 
associated with the 1 in 1,000 year event and this has shown that floodwater may discharge 
from the upper reach of the Mill Brook Tributary and also over the right (eastern) bank of the 
main branch of the Mill Brook immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the Bedford to 
Bletchley Railway. 
10.4.2 As explained above, the LLRS surface water drainage scheme has been designed to cater for 
both surface water run-off and floodwater influx into the Pit from the Mill Brook and its 
Tributary.  The table below summarises the storage requirements associated with the 1 in 
1,000 year event.

28.67 
 
10.4.3 As outlined above, the total volume of storage within the pond (including freeboard) exceeds 
200,000m3.  The surface water attenuation pond therefore offers adequate storage capacity to 
accommodate both surface water run-off and floodwater influx into the Pit from the Mill Brook 
and its Tributary associated with the 1 in 1,000 year event. 
10.5 Pollution Control 
10.5.1 The Project includes the following potential sources of oil contamination: 
 
Oil-filled transformers; 
 
Lubrication systems for the Generating Equipment; 
 
Oil storage and; 
 
Areas of hardstanding for oil delivery vehicles. 
10.5.2 All designated oil retaining areas will include secondary containment measures (bunds) 
designed to contain 110% of the volume of oil stored. 
10.5.3 The surface water drainage system serving potentially contaminated oil retaining areas will 
pass surface water run-off through a Class 1 Full Retention Oil Separator (as set out in BS EN 
858) prior to discharging surface water to the LLRS drainage system. 
10.5.4 All private surface water drains will pass surface water run-off through an oil interceptor prior 
to outfalling to the LLRS surface water drainage system. 
10.5.5 Surface water run-off arising from the access road will pass through an oil interceptor prior to 
outfalling to the LLRS surface water balancing pond.  Highway drainage outfalls will include a 
penstock control to enable containment of contaminated run-off. 
10.6 Maintenance 
10.6.1 Private surface water drains will be operated and maintained by MPL.  The LLRS surface 
water drainage infrastructure will be maintained by O&H Properties Limited.

11 Climate Change 
11.1.1 In February 2016, the EA published guidance in respect of the climate change allowances that 
should be used as the basis for preparing FRAs (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-
assessments-climate-change-allowances).  The guidance sets out the climate change 
allowances for peak river flow, peak rainfall intensity, sea level rise, off-shore wind speeds and 
extreme wave height. 
11.1.2 Allowances in respect of peak river flow vary according to River Basin District, flood zone and 
proposed land-use (and therefore the lifetime of the development).  The Project site lies within 
the Anglian River Basin District. 
11.1.3 PBA consulted both the Bedford Group of Drainage Boards and the Lead Local Flood 
Authority (Central Bedfordshire Council) regarding the interpretation and application of the 
2016 guidance.  In accordance with stakeholder requirements, an allowance of +35% peak 
river flow has been used.  Although the analysis indicates that the volume of floodwater 
discharge into Rookery South Pit from the upper reach of the Mill Brook Tributary may 
increase as a result of climate change, it has been shown that the surface water conveyance 
and storage infrastructure within the Pit offers adequate capacity to accommodate such 
changes. 
11.1.4 Given the anticipated design life of the Project, and based upon the recommended 
contingency allowances set out in the 2016 guidance, a 20% increase in peak rainfall intensity 
would typically be adopted for the purposes of designing a surface water drainage strategy to 
accommodate the effects of climate change.  However, given the nature and location of the 
Project, a contingency allowance of 30% increase in peak rainfall intensity has been adopted 
in this instance (in accordance with the guidance in force at the time the LLRS was designed 
in 2008). 
 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project

12 Residual Risk 
12.1.1 Hydraulic modelling has demonstrated that floodwater arising from the Mill Brook and its 
Tributary may discharge into Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 year, the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change and the 1 in 1,000 year events. 
12.1.2 However, it has been shown that the surface water drainage infrastructure brought forward as 
part of the LLRS offers adequate capacity to cater for such conditions.  It should also be noted 
that the locations at which floodwater may discharge from the watercourse and into the Pit are 
‘remote’ from the Generating Equipment Site, and as such floodwater would not be expected 
to impact on sensitive power generation infrastructure. 
12.1.3 The principal residual flood risk issue in this instance relates to the operation/performance of 
the surface water drainage system.  As set out in Section 10, surface water run-off 
accumulating within the Rookery South attenuation pond is pumped to both Rookery North 
and the Mill Brook.  Should the pumping station fail, water levels within the attenuation pond 
would be greater than those anticipated under ‘normal’ operating conditions.  However, it has 
been shown (Table 10.2, Section 10 of this report) that the surface water drainage 
infrastructure brought forward as part of the LLRS offers adequate capacity to cater for a 
scenario where the pumping station is ‘off-line’ for up to three days, thus providing sufficient 
time for ‘stand-by’ arrangements to be brought into effect. 
12.1.4 Notwithstanding the above, an incident management plan should be prepared so that 
visitors/operational staff are aware of the action to be taken in the event of floodwater/surface 
water affecting the Generating Equipment Site and associated highway access.

13 Concluding Remarks 
13.1.1 National, Regional and Local planning policy requires that: 
 
Development is directed to sites at the lowest probability of flooding; 
 
Development accommodates the potential impacts of climate change; 
 
Development should not be permitted if it would be at unacceptable risk of flooding or 
create an unacceptable risk elsewhere; 
 
Where possible, development should contribute to reduced flood risk; 
 
New development should facilitate safe access and exit during flood conditions. 
13.1.2 Within this context, the Project is considered to fully comply with National, Regional and Local 
planning policy in respect of development and flood risk.  On this basis, it is concluded that 
flood risk considerations do not constitute a barrier to the granting of a DCO for the Project.

Meeting Title: 
Millbrook Power, Bedfordshire 
Attendees: 
Alys Bishop (CBC), Trevor Skelding (Beds IDB), Stuart Harwood (PBA) 
cc: 
Chris Leach (PBA), Nick Johnson (Millbrook Power Limited) 
Date of Meeting: 
4th July 2017 
Job Number: 
40335-3005 
 
Item 
Subject 
Actions 
1.  
Background/Introduction 
 
SH provided an overview of the project and introduced the applicant 
based upon the information set out in the PEIR document (both 
CBC and the IDB having confirmed receipt as part of the S42 
consultation).  It was noted that a DCO application was to be made 
towards the end of 2017. 
 
Explained that the project had been placed ‘on hold’ in early 2015, 
at which point both the FRA and ‘water’ ES chapter had been 
prepared.  The purpose of the meeting was therefore to: 
 
• 
‘re-cap’ on matters; 
• 
ensure that any ‘new’ information is identified and; 
• 
reach agreement regarding the issues to be addressed and 
the scope of any work that may be required to revise and 
update the 2014 FRA and ES chapter. 
 
 
2.  
Roles/Responsibilities 
 
SH explained that PBA had re-consulted the Environment Agency 
(EA) and been advised that they had no comment to make in 
respect of flood risk and drainage and that they had deferred to the 
IDB and CBC as LLFA on such matters. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB was principally interested in the surface 
water pumping regime from Rookery Pit (to the Mill Brook 
watercourse bordering the western boundary of the Pit) and 
ensuring that any pumping continued in accordance with the terms 
of the existing consent to discharge (which permits pumping at a 
rate of 23l/s).  TS advised that, on the assumption that the pumping 
regime would be unchanged, the IDB would have no comment on 
the proposals. 
 
It was noted that the Mill Brook watercourse falls outside the IDB’s 
District and would be classified as an Ordinary Watercourse, under 
the jurisdiction of the LLFA (CBC). 
 
AB acknowledged that CBC would ‘lead’ on flood risk/drainage 
matters, but noted that it’s a ‘legacy’ project, such that she would 
need to consult the EA to ensure agreement/clarity regarding the 
scope of issues to address. 
 
It was also noted that any works (permanent or temporary) to the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AB 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\40335 Millbrook Power Project\Word\Meetings\170704 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 2 of 6 
 
 
watercourses bordering Rookery Pit would require consent.  
Consent applications are dealt with by the IDB on behalf of Central 
Beds Council. 
 
TS queried whether Bedfordshire Borough Council (BBC) should be 
consulted (noting that the north-eastern corner of Rookery South Pit 
falls within BBC’s area).  AB commented that, as the application site 
and the vast majority of the Pit fell within CBC’s area, CBC and the 
IDB would lead. 
 
3.  
Policy, Guidance and Evidence Base 
 
AB advised that CBC’s draft Local Plan, and the associated 
evidence base, had been published for public consultation. 
 
AB advised that the principal evidence base studies relevant to both 
the FRA and ‘water’ ES chapter are: 
 
• 
Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (July 2017) 
• 
Water Cycle Study (July 2017) 
 
AB also highlighted (i) CBC’s Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy (February 2014), (ii) the Tri-Lead Local Authority 
Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (June 2011), (iii) Central 
Bedfordshire Sustainable Drainage Supplementary Planning 
Document (adopted April 2014) and (iv) CBC’s Advice Note ‘Advice 
for the provision of surface water drainage systems for new 
developments (April 2015)’. 
 
 
4.  
Site and Project Description 
 
SH provided a description of The Rookery (north and south - former 
clay pits) and an overview of the principal components of the project 
by reference to the information, figures, etc, included within the May 
2017 Preliminary Environmental Information Report (provided on 
the Millbrook Power website:  http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/). 
 
It was noted that the generating plant will comprise only one 
generator unit (previously up to five), running for up to 2,250 hours 
per year. 
 
SH explained that the project constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project pursuant to the 2008 Planning Act and 
therefore requires development consent under that Act.  PBA has 
been appointed to prepare the Environmental Statement and 
associated Flood Risk Assessment in support of the application for 
a Development Consent Order (DCO). 
 
5.  
PEIR and Section 42 Consultation 
 
TS acknowledged receipt of the PEIR, but confirmed that the IDB 
had yet to respond.  TS to draft a response ASAP. 
 
AB acknowledged receipt of the PEIR (uploaded to CBC’s file 
sharing/hosting site by SH on 2nd June) but had yet to review the 
document and would consult colleagues re: whether a response 
had been drafted. 
 
Post-meeting note:  AB advised via e-mail dated 4th July that CBC 
had responded to the consultation.

SH highlighted that the PEIR document incorporates a copy of the 
FRA as drafted prior to the project being placed on hold in March 
2015 (the FRA comprising Appendix G of the PEIR).  SH explained 
that it would be helpful to receive CBC’s feedback/comment on the 
draft FRA prior to finalising the document for submission.  AB 
agreed to review and comment on the document.  AB to advise re: 
timeframe for completing the review. 
 
SH referred to the EA’s response to the Section 42 consultation, the 
Agency having commented that the site is located in Flood Zone 1 
(according to their Flood Map) and that the IDB and LLFA should be 
consulted for ‘drainage advice’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AB 
6.  
Low Level Restoration Scheme 
 
SH explained that The Rookery is the subject of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) and that, once restored, Rookery 
South (the location of the Millbrook Power project), would be 
approximately 15m below the surrounding ground level. 
 
SH explained that the principal works associated with the LLRS 
comprise: 
 
• 
Re-profiling of the base of the pit to create a platform 
graded to fall to the north; 
• 
Implementation of a surface water drainage system, 
comprising a balancing pond, network of interceptor 
channels and pumping station; 
• 
Buttressing of the pit slopes; 
• 
Provision of access ramps; 
• 
Landscaping works/planting around the pit edge and 
balancing pond. 
 
It was noted and agreed that, as the LLRS is to be 
implemented/completed prior to any development within Rookery 
South Pit, the LLRS constitutes the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of 
the EIA and preparation of the FRA for the Millbrook Power project 
(this being consistent with the approach adopted for the Covanta 
project). 
 
AB queried provisions in respect of maintenance of the balancing 
pond, etc.  SH advised that responsibility for maintenance sat with 
O&H Properties Ltd. 
 
 
7.  
Surface Water Management 
 
SH explained that the LLRS drainage scheme comprises/operates 
as follows: 
 
• 
Surface water collecting in the balancing pond will be 
pumped to (i) Rookery North at a rate of 100l/s and (ii) the 
Mill Brook at a rate of 23l/s (as per the terms of the existing 
Consent to Discharge); 
• 
The water level in Rookery North will be drawn down by 
approximately 1m; 
• 
Water from Rookery North will return to the balancing pond 
in Rookery South via a gravity connection at a rate of no 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\40335 Millbrook Power Project\Word\Meetings\170704 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 4 of 6 
 
 
more than 23l/s. 
• 
By using Rookery North as a strategic storm water storage 
facility, the balancing pond would return to its normal water 
level approximately 12 days after the 1 in 100 year plus 
climate change event. 
 
SH explained that, in respect of design parameters, the base and 
side-slopes of Rookery South Pit are assumed to be 100% 
impermeable and the sizing of the balancing pond has been 
undertaken using catchment-specific rainfall parameters derived 
from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). 
 
The balancing pond has been sized to accommodate rainfall events 
up to and including the 1 in 100 year event including climate change 
and comprises a retained water depth of 0.5m. 
 
As the LLRS design has been prepared assuming the Pit to be 
100% impermeable and the Millbrook Power project falls within the 
catchment of the Pit, it was agreed that the LLRS drainage strategy 
offers adequate capacity to accommodate surface water run-off 
from the Millbrook Power project, such that no additional mitigation 
would be required in respect of surface water run-off control. 
 
SH explained that design of the surface water drainage strategy 
caters for residual risk scenarios comprising (i) the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event and a period of pumping station failure 
(pumps off-line for 3 days) and (ii) a "follow-on" event - a 1 in 10 
year plus climate change event occurring within 1 week of the 1 in 
100 year plus climate change event.  The pond has been sized to 
provide sufficient residual capacity above that required for the 1 in 
100 year plus climate change event to accommodate both residual 
risk scenarios. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the design of the drainage strategy 
is robust. 
 
8.  
Flood Risk Associated with Mill Brook 
 
SH explained that a HEC-RAS hydraulic model of the Mill Brook and 
its tributary (running along the southern fringe of Rookery South Pit) 
had been developed as part of PBA’s previous work (to inform 
design of the LLRS (2008) and the FRA for the Covanta RRF 
scheme (2010)).  The analysis had shown that floodwater may ‘spill’ 
into Rookery South Pit from a localised area of the tributary, albeit 
at a relatively low rate (peak spill rate of approx. 0.2m3/s). 
 
SH explained that, as per the LLRS proposals, floodwater will be 
allowed to spill into the Pit as per the “existing” situation, but will be 
“managed” by being intercepted and conveyed to the attenuation 
pond.  SH confirmed that the surface water drainage channels and 
attenuation pond being brought forward as part of the LLRS had 
been designed to accommodate floodwater influx from the Mill 
Brook tributary. 
 
In addition, it was noted that the ‘raised’ platform created by the 
LLRS works will be such that the site of the Millbrook Power project 
will be elevated above water levels within the balancing pond and 
associated drainage channels, etc. 
 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\40335 Millbrook Power Project\Word\Meetings\170704 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 5 of 6 
 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the project site would be 
adequately safeguarded from flooding, such that no further 
mitigation works would be required as part of the project. 
 
SH explained that consideration of the 1,000 year event in 2010 had 
shown that floodwater may spill over the eastern bank of the Mill 
Brook immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the railway (in 
the vicinity of the north-west corner of the Covanta RRF site).  
Given the distance from the Millbrook Power site, coupled with the 
topography across the base of the Pit following implementation of 
the LLRS, it was agreed that mitigation measures would not need to 
be brought forward as part of the Millbrook Power project.  (It was 
also noted that measures had been incorporated within the design 
of the Covanta RRF scheme to cater for this floodwater spill). 
 
The requirement to divert the lower reach of the Mill Brook tributary 
(as part of the LLRS) was noted and SH advised that the diverted 
reach had been designed to convey 100 year plus climate change 
flood flows ‘in bank’.  TS and AB confirmed this is an adequate 
design standard. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB would deal with any consent applications 
for watercourse works on behalf of CBC. 
 
SH highlighted the fact that the hydraulic modelling analysis dates 
to 2010.  The EA has previously (2014) advised that the model 
provides the best available data in respect of flood risk associated 
with the Mill Brook, such that it should be taken forward and used to 
inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power Project. 
 
It was noted that the assessment of catchment hydrology (flood 
flows) was revisited in 2014 to establish whether estimates were 
higher/lower than those derived in 2010.  SH confirmed that the 
2014 analysis resulted in lower flood flow estimates than derived in 
2010 and, as agreed with the EA, the modelling analysis was not 
therefore updated. 
 
TS and AB advised that the hydrology assessment should be 
revisited.  TS and AB agreed that, where the updated, 2017 
analysis provides flow estimates that are less than or equal to the 
2010 estimates, it would not be necessary to revisit the hydraulic 
modelling analysis (i.e. the 2010 modelling data/output could be 
taken forward and used to inform the FRA). 
 
9.  
Climate Change 
 
It was noted that guidance regarding the allowances to be used for 
the purposes of preparing FRA’s had changed following the 
publication of EA guidance titled ‘Flood risk assessments: climate 
change allowances (February 2016)’. 
 
Whilst both TS and AB noted that the LLRS benefits from planning 
permission and acknowledged that the 2016 guidance would not 
need to be applied ‘retrospectively’, the FRA prepared for the 
Millbrook Power scheme should comply with the 2016 guidance. 
 
It was noted that the current guidance requires that a rainfall 
intensity allowance of between 10% and 20% is adopted (based 
upon a project design life of c.25 years).  SH confirmed that the 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\40335 Millbrook Power Project\Word\Meetings\170704 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 6 of 6 
 
 
LLRS surface water drainage strategy had been designed using a 
30% increase in rainfall intensity and it was therefore agreed that 
the strategy was robust when reviewed within the context of the 
current climate change allowances guidance (i.e. such that the 
Millbrook Power Project would not need to bring forward additional 
mitigation for surface water run-off). 
 
In respect of peak river flow allowances, it was noted that the 
current guidance requires that an allowance of between 20% and 
35% is adopted.  SH confirmed that the modelling analysis 
undertaken in 2010 and the draft FRA prepared in 2014 assessed 
the implications of a 20% increase in flood flows within the Mill 
Brook and its tributary. 
 
TS and AB suggested that model sensitivity testing was undertaken 
to establish the impacts of a 35% increase in flood flows upon flood 
water influx to Rookery South Pit (i.e. whether the balancing pond 
offers adequate capacity to accommodate additional inflows). 
 
10.  
Water Framework Directive 
 
AB queried whether a Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
compliance assessment was being prepared in support of the DCO 
application. 
 
SH explained that this had not been identified as a requirement 
following EIA scoping and stakeholder consultation completed 
previously (2014). 
 
AB noted that the Mill Brook watercourse outfalls to Stewartby Lake, 
a WFD designated water body, and will therefore consult the EA to 
establish whether a WFD compliance assessment is required in this 
instance and, if so, the scope required. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AB 
11.  
AOB 
 
AB suggested that a multi-disciplinary ‘follow-up’ meeting/workshop 
may be beneficial to ensure the various technical strands are ‘joined 
up’, there are no conflicting/competing requirements, etc.

Hayley/Trevor, 
 
Please find attached a copy of the notes prepared following our meeting in respect of the above on 12th December 
2014. 
 
We would be grateful if you would confirm that the attached constitutes an accurate record of the points 
discussed/agreed, etc.  Should you consider that the notes require amending or wish to offer further comment 
regarding flood risk/water management matters, please feel free to call. 
 
Hayley – you will note that the penultimate paragraph under Item 6 (flood risk associated with the Mill Brook) 
refers to the hydraulic modelling analysis undertaken in 2010 and the fact that this assessment, submitted in 
support of the FRA, would have been reviewed/audited by the EA.  Consultation in respect of the Rookery South 
Resource Recovery Facility was dealt with under your reference   AC/2010/113063/02-L01    (IPC Application 
Reference EN01011) – we would be grateful if you would refer back to your records and confirm that the 2010 
modelling analysis was indeed reviewed and deemed ‘fit for purpose’, etc.

Hayley, 
 
Thanks for the confirmation. 
 
As discussed, PBA previously undertook a detailed assessment of the baseline environment from a flood risk 
perspective in 2010 in support of the Covanta energy from waste proposal.  We subsequently prepared the FRA in 
support of the DCO application for the Covanta facility (located within the north-west area of Rookery South 
Pit).  This included (i) hydraulic modelling to assess the nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook and its 
tributary and (ii) details of a surface water management strategy to serve development within the Pit.  You will note 
that Rookery Pit is subject to an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS).  As these works are being 
implemented prior to construction of the Millbrook Power scheme, the LLRS therefore constitutes the ‘baseline’ for 
the purposes of EIA and preparation of the FRA (as per the Covanta scheme). 
 
The Covanta scheme was to be located in the north-west of Rookery South Pit, whereas the Millbrook Power 
scheme is located in the south-west of the Pit, so the flood risk/water management issues are fundamentally the 
same.  As far as we are aware, nothing has changed since 2010, so the 2010 technical assessment and associated 
design principles, parameters and flood risk mitigation works/strategy can be taken forward as the basis for the 
Millbrook scheme. 
 
See link below to the FRA prepared in support of the Covanta scheme – this should set the scene and provide 
adequate background ahead of our meeting on 12th Dec.

As below, the purpose of the meeting is to ‘re-cap’ on matters, ensure that any ‘new’ information is identified and 
ensure that we are all ‘on the same page’ in respect of the issues to be addressed and the scope of technical 
assessment required in respect of flood risk and wider water management matters.

Hayley Baldock at the EA is available on 12th and 15th Dec – are you available for either of these dates ? 
 
I think there would be some value in a ‘joint’ meeting (EA & IDB) if we can find mutually convenient 
dates.  Alternatively we’ll need to run with separate mtgs as we need to complete stakeholder consultation by the 
Xmas break. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Stuart.

Hayley, 
 
Further to the e-mail below, I have spoken with Paul Henderson and understand that you now deal with flood risk 
matters associated with sites/proposals in the Bedford/Marston Vale area. 
 
You will note from the e-mail below that we are seeking to convene a joint meeting with both the EA and the 
Bedford Group of Drainage Boards to discuss the scope of FRA required in respect of the Millbrook Power project.  It 
would therefore be appreciated if you could confirm your availability to attend a meeting at the IDB’s Stewartby 
office during the weeks commencing 8th and 15th of December.  We understand that the Agency will levy a fee for 
pre-application advice and would be grateful if you could confirm fees for attendance at a meeting so that we may 
seek client approval in advance (we would anticipate a meeting of no more than 2hrs, plus your travel time). 
 
Trevor – apologies, we will need to cancel the meeting scheduled for this Thursday 4th Dec.  Could you confirm 
your availability for the weeks as above – thanks. 
 
Should you have any queries or wish to discuss, please feel free to call. 
 
Thanks and regards, 
 
Stuart.

Gents, 
 
PBA has been appointed to prepare the EIA in respect of the DCO application for the above.  As part of this work we 
are also preparing the Flood Risk Assessment, which will comprise an appendix to the relevant ES chapter. 
 
You may recall that PBA previously prepared the FRA in support of the DCO application for the Covanta Resource 
Recovery Facility (located within the north-west area of Rookery South Pit).  This included (i) hydraulic modelling to 
assess the nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook and its tributary and (ii) details of a surface water 
management strategy to serve development within the Pit.  You will note that Rookery Pit is subject to an ongoing 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS).  As these works are being implemented prior to construction of the Millbrook 
7
Power scheme, the LLRS therefore constitutes the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of EIA and preparation of the FRA (as 
per the Covanta scheme). 
 
We are progressing the technical work in accordance with the scope, design principles and parameters previously 
agreed with both the EA and IDB in respect of the Covanta scheme.  However, given the time that has elapsed since 
this work was undertaken (2010), it would seem appropriate to convene a joint meeting to ‘re-cap’ on matters, 
ensure that any ‘new’ information is identified and ensure that we are all ‘on the same page’ in respect of the issues 
to be addressed and the scope of technical assessment required in respect of flood risk and wider water 
management matters.  It would therefore be appreciated if you could confirm your availability to attend a meeting 
during the first two weeks of December (1st – 12th). 
 
Trevor/John – would it be possible to hold the meeting at your offices in Stewartby ? 
 
In terms of attendees, and in addition to yourselves, I would anticipate no more than x2 PBA staff and x1 
representative from the client team. 
 
 
Should you have any queries or wish to discuss, please feel free to call. 
 
 
Thanks and regards, 
 
Stuart.

Item 
Subject 
Actions 
1.  
Background/Introduction 
 
SH explained that the purpose of the meeting was to: 
• 
provide the EA and IDB with an overview of the project; 
• 
set out and agree the design principles and parameters to 
be taken forward in respect of flood risk and surface water 
management; 
• 
agree the scope of the Flood Risk Assessment to support 
the DCO application. 
 
 
2.  
Roles/Responsibilities 
 
HB and TS confirmed the scope/extent of both the EAs and IDBs 
remit in the area. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB was principally interested in the nature of 
the surface water pumping regime from Rookery Pit (to the Mill 
Brook watercourse bordering the western boundary of the Pit) and 
ensuring that any pumping continued in accordance with the terms 
of the existing consent to discharge (which permits pumping at a 
rate of 23l/s). 
 
It was noted that Central Beds Council, as LLFA, has a remit that 
extends to include surface water (as set out in the Flood and Water 
Management Act).  Given the current ‘transitional’ period regarding 
allocation of roles/responsibilities relating to flood risk management, 
HB confirmed that the EA would assess/review the FRA in its wider 
sense, considering flood risk associated with watercourses and 
surface water management. 
 
It was also noted that any works (permanent or temporary) to the 
watercourses bordering Rookery Pit would require consent.  
Consent applications are dealt with by the IDB on behalf of Central 
Beds Council. 
 
 
3.  
Site and Project Description 
 
SH provided a description of The Rookery (north and south - former 
clay pits) and an overview of the principal components of the project 
by reference to the information, figures, etc, included within the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (provided on the 
Millbrook Power website:  http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/). 
 
The generating equipment (x5 turbines), 400kv sub-station,

electrical connection and gas connection were highlighted. 
 
SH explained that the project constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project pursuant to the 2008 Planning Act and 
therefore requires development consent under that Act.  PBA has 
been appointed to prepare the Environmental Statement and 
associated Flood Risk Assessment in support of the application for 
a Development Consent Order (DCO). 
4.  
Low Level Restoration Scheme 
 
SH explained that The Rookery is the subject of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) and that, once restored, Rookery 
South (the location of the Millbrook Power project), would be 
approximately 15m below the surrounding ground level. 
 
SH explained that the principal works associated with the LLRS 
comprise: 
 
• 
Re-profiling of the base of the pit to create a platform 
graded to fall to the north; 
• 
Implementation of a surface water drainage system, 
comprising a balancing pond, network of interceptor 
channels and pumping station; 
• 
Buttressing of the pit slopes; 
• 
Provision of access ramps; 
• 
Landscaping works/planting around the pit edge and 
balancing pond. 
 
It was noted and agreed that, as the LLRS is to be 
implemented/completed prior to any development within Rookery 
South Pit, the LLRS constitutes the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of 
the EIA and preparation of the FRA for the Millbrook Power project. 
 
 
5.  
Surface Water Management 
 
SH explained that the LLRS drainage scheme comprises/operates 
as follows: 
 
• 
Surface water collecting in the balancing pond will be 
pumped to (i) Rookery North at a rate of 100l/s and (ii) the 
Mill Brook at a rate of 23l/s (as per the terms of the existing 
Consent to Discharge); 
• 
The water level in Rookery North will be drawn down by 
approximately 1m; 
• 
Water from Rookery North will return to the balancing pond 
in Rookery South via a gravity connection at a rate of no 
more than 23l/s. 
• 
By using Rookery North as a strategic stormwater storage 
facility, the balancing pond would return to its normal water 
level approximately 12 days after the 1 in 100 year plus 
climate change event. 
 
SH explained that, in respect of design parameters, the base and 
side-slopes of Rookery South are assumed to be 100% 
impermeable and the sizing of the balancing pond has been 
undertaken using catchment-specific rainfall parameters derived 
from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). 
 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\31116 Rookery Pit Gas Power Station\Word\Meetings\141212 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 3 of 4 
 
 
The balancing pond has been sized to accommodate rainfall events 
up to and including the 1 in 100 year event including climate change 
and comprises a retained water depth of 0.5m. 
 
As the LLRS design has been prepared assuming the Pit to be 
100% impermeable and the Millbrook Power project falls within the 
catchment of the Pit, it was agreed that the LLRS drainage strategy 
offers adequate capacity to accommodate surface water run-off 
from the Millbrook Power project, such that no additional mitigation 
would be required in respect of surface water run-off control. 
 
SH explained that design of the surface water strategy caters for 
residual risk scenarios comprising (i) the 1 in 100 year plus climate 
change event and a period of pumping station failure (pumps off-
line for 3 days) and (ii) a "follow-on" event - a 1 in 10 year plus 
climate change event occurring within 1 week of the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event.  The pond has been sized to provide 
sufficient residual capacity above that required for the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event to accommodate both residual risk 
scenarios. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the design of the drainage strategy 
is robust. 
 
In terms of details/commentary to be included within the FRA for the 
Millbrook Power project, HB agreed that a scope similar to that set 
out in the document prepared in support of the Covanta RRF 
scheme would be appropriate. 
 
6.  
Flood Risk Associated with Mill Brook 
 
SH explained that a HEC-RAS hydraulic model of the Mill Brook and 
its tributary (running along the southern fringe of Rookery South Pit) 
had been developed as part of PBA’s previous work (to inform 
design of the LLRS (2008) and the FRA for the Covanta RRF 
scheme (2010)).  The analysis had shown that floodwater would 
‘spill’ into Rookery South Pit from a localised area of the tributary, 
albeit at a relatively low rate (peak spill rate of approx. 0.2m3/s). 
 
SH explained that, as per the LLRS proposals, floodwater will be 
allowed to spill into the pit as per the “existing” situation, but will be 
“managed” by being intercepted and conveyed to the attenuation 
pond.  SH confirmed that the surface water drainage channels and 
attenuation pond being brought forward as part of the LLRS had 
been designed to accommodate floodwater influx from the Mill 
Brook tributary. 
 
In addition, it was noted that the ‘raised’ platform created by the 
LLRS works will be such that the site of the Millbrook Power project 
will be elevated above water levels within the balancing pond and 
associated drainage channels, etc. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the project site would be 
adequately safeguarded from flooding, such that no further 
mitigation works would be required as part of the project. 
 
In terms of the flood zone classification of the project site post 
implementation of the LLRS, it was noted that the 2010 assessment 
indicated that the raised platforms within Rookery South Pit would 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\31116 Rookery Pit Gas Power Station\Word\Meetings\141212 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 4 of 4 
 
 
be classified as Flood Zone 2.  It was agreed that the Millbrook 
Power project site could most likely be classified as Flood Zone 1 
(low probability of flooding) – the hydraulic model to be used to 
confirm. 
 
SH explained that consideration of the 1,000 year event in 2010 had 
shown that floodwater may spill over the eastern bank of the Mill 
Brook immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the railway (in 
the vicinity of the north-west corner of the Covanta RRF site).  
Given the distance from the Millbrook Power site, coupled with the 
topography across the base of the Pit following implementation of 
the LLRS, HB agreed that mitigation measures would not need to 
be brought forward as part of the Millbrook Power project.  (It was 
also noted that measures had been incorporated within the design 
of the Covanta RRF scheme to cater for this floodwater spill). 
 
The requirement to divert the lower reach of the Mill Brook tributary 
was noted and SH advised that the diverted reach had been 
designed to convey 100 year plus climate change flood flows ‘in 
bank’.  TS and HB confirmed this is an adequate design standard. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB would deal with any consent applications 
for watercourse works on behalf of CBC. 
 
SH highlighted the fact that the hydraulic modelling analysis dates 
to 2010 and that the FEH method has evolved/been updated in the 
interim.  It was agreed that the 2010 hydrology/assessment of Mill 
Brook flood flows should be reviewed/validated.  HB agreed that, 
where the updated, 2014 analysis provides flow estimates that are 
less than or equal to the 2010 estimates, it would not be necessary 
to revisit the hydraulic modelling analysis (i.e. the 2010 modelling 
data/output could be taken forward and used to inform the FRA). 
 
It was noted that the hydraulic model files had been submitted to 
the EA as part of the 2010 Covanta RRF FRA and HB advised that 
the EA would ordinarily review/audit such work to ensure it is ‘fit for 
purpose’, etc.  HB agreed to check the EA’s records. 
 
HB advised that consideration should be given to provisions for 
maintenance of the flood risk/surface water management 
infrastructure – outline details of the options available should be set 
out in the FRA (the detail to be brought forward at a later date as 
part of conditions, etc). 
 
7.  
Summary 
 
It was agreed that little had changed in the time that has elapsed 
since PBA’s previous (2008 and 2010) assessments, such that this 
work and associated design principles/parameters, etc, could be 
taken forward as the basis for the Millbrook Power project. 
 
It was also agreed that, as the LLRS scheme and associated flood 
risk/surface water management strategy is essentially ‘fixed’ (and 
caters for the site of the Millbrook Power project) no additional flood 
risk related mitigation works will need to be brought forward as part 
of the Millbrook Power project.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Peter Brett Associates has been appointed by Millbrook Power Limited to prepare a Flood 
Risk Assessment (FRA) in support of an application for a Development Consent Order 
relating to the construction of a power generation plant.  The proposed plant is located in The 
Rookery, comprising two former clay pits (Rookery North and South).  The Mill Brook 
watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western flank of Rookery South Pit and a 
tributary of the Brook, draining a catchment to the south of the Pit, joins the Mill Brook in the 
vicinity of the south-west corner of the Pit. 
 
Environment Agency floodplain maps do not extend to include the Mill Brook or its tributary 
on account of the small size of the contributing catchment areas.  The nature of flood risk 
associated with the Mill Brook and its tributary was originally assessed in 2008 in support of 
a planning application relating to the Review of Old Mineral Permissions (ROMP), which set 
out details of a Low Level Restoration Scheme for the Rookery Pits.  Flood risk was assessed 
by developing a HEC-RAS hydraulic model using topographic survey of Rookery South Pit 
and the watercourse corridor.  This study was subsequently refined and updated in 2010 in 
support of proposals for development within the north-west area of Rookery South Pit and 
following further, more detailed survey of the watercourse corridor. 
 
Following consultation with the EA and Bedford Group of Drainage Boards in December 2014, 
it was agreed that the 2010 study provides the best available data in respect of flood risk 
associated with the Mill Brook and its tributary, such that it should be taken forward and used 
to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power Project.  However, it was noted 
that in the time that has elapsed since the 2010 study was concluded, the Flood Estimation 
Handbook (FEH) methodology and associated database (used to estimate flood flows for the 
purposes of hydraulic modelling) has been revised/updated.  It was therefore agreed that the 
2010 assessment of flood flows should be reviewed/validated.  The 2014 appraisal concluded 
that the 2014 flood flow estimates were lower than those derived in 2010, such that it was not 
necessary to revisit the 2010 hydraulic modelling analysis. 
 
The DCO submission is now to be made towards the end of this year and following re-
consultation with both the IDB and LLFA (July 2017), they have requested that a further 
review of the hydrology is undertaken to establish whether 2017 flood flow estimates are 
higher/lower than those derived in 2010. 
 
This Technical Note sets out a summary of (i) the revised and updated FEH analysis and (ii) 
the scope of hydraulic modelling analysis undertaken as part of the 2010 and 2014 studies.

2. HYDROLOGY 
 
A hydrological and hydraulic modelling assessment of the Mill Brook and its tributary was 
carried out in 2010.    Flood flows were estimated using the ReFH methodology and the 
appraisal found that the contributing catchment extended to include an additional area 
outside the FEH catchment boundary.  Both the catchment area and URBEXT descriptors 
were therefore amended accordingly. 
 
Both the EA and IDB have been consulted and have confirmed that there have been no 
changes within the catchment that would impact upon the hydrological analysis.  However, 
as noted above, the FEH methodology and associated database has been revised/updated 
in the time that has elapsed since the 2010 and 2014 studies  Catchment hydrology has 
therefore been re-assessed to establish whether the flood flows estimated in 2010 may be 
taken forward and used to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power 
Project.   
 
Flood estimation has been based upon the Flood Estimation Handbook Statistical (FEH) 
methodology and ReFH methodology.   
 
Catchment Delineation & Modelling Approach 
 
Flows have been estimated at the downstream extent of the reach of watercourse 
represented in the hydraulic model - at the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston 
Vale railway line, as per the 2010 assessment (see Figure 1).  The FEH catchment was 
derived at grid reference 501085, 241335 using the new FEH web service 
(https://fehweb.ceh.ac.uk/) .  The total catchment area as defined by FEH is 3.49km2 (red 
outline shown in Figure 2) and the tributary catchment is 1.49km2 (green outline shown in 
Figure 2).

The FEH catchments were reviewed against 1:25,000 scale OS mapping, historical 
mapping and based upon site observations.  This identified two areas that fall outside the 
FEH catchment boundary and which should therefore be removed from the catchment area 
(shown as blue hatched areas on Figure 3).  These include: 
 
• 
Area to the east of the Midland Mainline railway (0.44km2) 
• 
Area within the southern part of Rookery South Pit (0.32km2)  
 
In addition, the FEH defined catchment does not include several areas which were found to 
fall within the contributing catchment of the Mill Brook (i.e. such that the catchment should 
be modified to include these areas): 
 
• 
Additional area associated with the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground (highlighted in 
pink in Figure 3 and totalling an area of 0.85km2. (Default FEH catchment included 
0.19km2 of the Millbrook Proving Ground , such that the ‘net’ addition is 0.66 km2). 
• 
Area located to the north of the Proving Ground and east of the Bedford to 
Bletchley/Marston Vale railway (highlighted in pink hatching and totalling an area of 
0.18km2) 
• 
Area immediately to the south of the proving ground (highlighted in pink hatching 
and totalling an area of 0.24km2) 
 
Figure 3 below shows the revised catchment area in bold red and also includes the proving 
ground highlighted in pink.  The original default FEH catchments can be seen in the 
background (in green).  The 2014 revised total catchment area of the Mill Brook is 3.81km2 
(revised FEH total catchment of 3.15km2 plus the 0.66km2 Proving Ground area) and the 
revised tributary catchment is 0.86km2.  The 2010 assessment used a catchment area of 
4.49km2 for the Mill Brook and 1.49km2 for the tributary catchment.  The 2014 amended 
catchment areas have been taken forward in this assessment.

The 2010 assessment included a detailed assessment of the urban/suburban areas within 
the FEH catchment and proving ground area.  Ordnance Survey mapping was used to 
determine that approximately 2% of the proving ground area was urban and 2% was 
suburban (in accordance with FEH definitions).  Of the FEH catchment, approximately 0.8% 
of the catchment was deemed to be urban and approximately 1% of the catchment was 
deemed to be suburban.

Using equation 6.2 from FEH Volume 5 (URBEXT = URBEXT + 0.5SUBURBEXT) the 
URBEXT value for the Proving Ground was estimated to be 0.03 and for the FEH 
catchment was 0.013. 
 
There has been no change in the urban extent since the 2010 or 2014 assessment (as 
confirmed by a review of up to date aerial imagery and mapping) and therefore there was 
no need to update these URBEXT values. 
 
In order to determine the updated URBEXT value for the updated total catchment at the 
downstream extent of the modelled reach, area weighting (as per the methodology outlined 
in Section 7.2.2 of FEH Volume 5) was used to combine the FEH catchment and Proving 
Ground URBEXT values based on the parameters shown in Table 1 (using the revised 
catchment areas outlined above)

Using the methodology outlined in FEH Volume 5, the updated URBEXT value for the total 
catchment was estimated to be 0.0159. 
 
The other catchment descriptors (apart from DPLBAR) are not area dependent and 
therefore the revised catchment area would not result in any significant changes to the FEH 
descriptors.  The DPLBAR value based on the revised catchment area of 3.81km2 would 
decrease slightly and therefore the original FEH value was used. 
 
The key catchment descriptors are shown in Table 2 (with revised AREA and URBEXT 
values).  The SPRHOST and BFIHOST values indicate that the catchment is not 
permeable.

ReFH Flow Estimation 
The ReFH method can be used to provide peak flows and also hydrographs.  Parameters in 
the ReFH model are derived from catchment descriptors. 
 
Since the 2014 ReFH assessment, ReFH2 software has been released that uses the 
updated FEH2013 DDF rainfall data and this has been used to generate hydrographs. 
Hydrographs were derived at the downstream extent of the reach of watercourse 
represented in the hydraulic model - at the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston

considered for the 1% annual probability (1 in 100 year) event to identify the critical storm 
duration.  For this analysis, the 7 hour storm is shown to produce the highest peak flow 
using a time-step of 1 hour.

FEH Statistical Estimation 
QMED Estimation 
QMED was calculated using the updated QMED equation for rural catchments based on 
standard FEH relationships, as follows: 
 
 
This yields QMED cds ss rural (the as rural QMED estimate for the total rural catchment based 
upon FEH catchment descriptors).  The calculated QMED cds ss rural for the downstream 
extent of the Mill Brook is 0.66m3/s.  The URBEXT2000 value is below the threshold at which 
FEH recommends an urban adjustment is made (URBEXT2000>0.03) and therefore no urban 
adjustment was applied to the QMED. 
 
The FEH highlights that the validity of the QMED value estimated simply from catchment 
descriptors can be improved by using a data transfer procedure.  EA Guidance on 
Improvements to the Flood Estimation Handbook statistical method, published in July 2008, 
identifies the need to find a single donor site to adjust the QMED estimate that is both 
hydrologically similar and geographically close.  In this instance no suitable donor stations 
were found that are hydrologically similar and geographically close (within 30km) and 
therefore a donor adjustment was not made to the QMED estimate. 
 
Derivation of Pooled Growth Curve 
 
WINFAP-FEH Version 3 and HiFlows data version 5 were used in this hydrological analysis.  
WINFAP-FEH was used to identify hydrologically similar gauged sites, define a pooling 
group at the downstream extent of the reach and derive a flood frequency curve for the 
reach.  The initial pooling group was defined with a target of 700 station years of data (on 
account of the likelihood that a number of catchment gauging station records may need to 
be removed during the pooling group review process).  The default pooling group is shown 
in Appendix A. 
 
The pooling group was created using HiFlow dataset ‘Sites suitable for Pooling’:

Derivation of Flood Frequency Curve 
 
The flood frequency curve provides estimates of design flood flows for a range of flood 
return periods and is derived by factoring up the estimate of QMED using the pooled growth 
curve fittings. 
 
In this instance, the default pooling group was used as a comparison to ReFH flows.   
 
In this instance the URBEXT2000 value is less than 0.03 and therefore an urban adjustment 
was not applied to the flood frequency curve.  The 1 in 1000 year flow was obtained from 
WINFAP by selecting further return periods before calculating the growth factors.  The 
resulting flood frequency curve is presented below in Table 4 along with the ReFH flow 
estimates.

As the ReFH peak flows were greater than the default pooling group flows no further 
modifications to the pooling group were made and no further FEH Statistical assessment was 
completed.  In accordance with the latest EA Flood Estimation Guidelines (2015) ReFH is 
generally preferred for smaller catchments as uncertainties exist in pooling via WINFAP for 
normal (i.e. non permeable, non-urban) small catchments.

Table 5 – Comparison of ReFH peak flows (2010 and 2017 assessments) 
 
It can be seen that the flood flow estimates based upon the current (2017) methodology and 
parameters are lower than those derived in 2010 for the 100 year and very similar for the 
1,000 year.  The peak flow estimate for the 2017 1 in 100 year plus climate change scenario 
is higher than that adopted in 2010 (on account of the publication of new guidance requiring 
that a 35% up-lift is applied). 
The flow estimates summarised in Table 5 above relate to the total contributing catchment 
area taken at the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley railway (i.e. comprising flows 
within the Mill Brook AND its tributary).  For the purposes of the hydraulic modelling, inflows 
are derived by areal weighting of the ‘lumped’ flow estimates.  A summary of the inflows 
derived by areal weighting for both the 2010 and 2017 assessments is presented in

Appendix A.  The 2017 estimates of the tributary inflows are significantly lower than the 
2010 estimates and the 2017 estimates of the Mill Brook inflows are higher than the 2010 
estimates.  This has arisen as a result of the adjustment of catchment areas discussed 
above, resulting in the tributary catchment now comprising a smaller proportion of the 
overall catchment (and the Mill Brook catchment therefore comprising a larger proportion of 
the overall catchment) than was the case in 2010.  As a result, the areal weighting ratios 
have changed (in favour of the Mill Brook catchment). 
It is therefore concluded that further model sensitivity tests should be undertaken to quantify 
the impact of the revised flow estimates upon peak flood levels and floodwater discharge 
from the watercourses and into Rookery South Pit.  A summary of the analysis undertaken 
is presented below. 
4. HYDRAULIC MODELLING 
The 2010 hydraulic assessment was undertaken using the HEC-RAS modelling software 
(Version 4.0.0) and using an ‘unsteady’ modelling approach on account of the fact that 
issues relating to floodwater storage and ‘discharge/spill’ from the watercourse system 
needed to be considered. 
The objective of the modelling was to derive a series of design flood levels and establish 
whether Rookery South Pit would be at risk of inundation as a result of flooding on the Mill 
Brook and its tributary during the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 100 year plus climate change flood 
events. 
Schematisation 
A model schematic plan is presented in Appendix B (Drawing No. 31116/3014/003) and 
shows model extents and the locations of cross-sections and hydraulic structures. 
The Mill Brook and its tributary both consist of a single channel which is represented as a 
series of river and structure cross-sections based upon topographic survey undertaken in 
2009. 
The lower reach of the Mill Brook tributary is to be diverted as part of the LLRS.  The 
diverted reach will consist of a trapezoidal channel profile with a base width of 2m, depth of 
1.5m and top width of 6m.  The diversion works will be implemented prior to construction of 
the Millbrook Power Project and details of the proposed channel configuration were 
therefore included in the HEC-RAS model. 
There are nine structures within the study area (as shown on Drawing No. 
31116/3014/003, Appendix B).  These structures are modelled as culverts, with the 
exception of Structure S2a, which is represented using a deck/roadway component within 
the model. 
Seven lateral structures (representing floodwater ‘discharge/spill’ from the watercourses) 
are included in the model (as shown on Drawing No. 31116/3014/003, Appendix B). 
The Mill Brook outfalls to Stewartby Lake approximately 400m downstream of the culvert 
beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway.  The Bedfordshire and River Ivel 
Internal Drainage Board provided peak water level data for Stewartby Lake associated with 
historic flood events.  However, the highest recorded water level within Stewartby Lake 
(35.71mAOD) does not extend to influence the modelled reach of watercourse.  The 
downstream boundary of the hydraulic model is therefore based upon ‘normal depth’, 
calculated using the topographic survey. 
5. RESULTS 
The model provides a design series of flood levels for the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change events.  The modelling analysis indicates that floodwater may 
discharge into Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 year event. This discharge occurs in a 
very localised area along the upper reach of the Mill Brook tributary at a peak rate of 
approximately 0.2m3/s, giving rise to a volume of approximately 6,500m3. Floodwater

discharge does not occur along the main branch of the Mill Brook – the minimum freeboard 
between the 100 year flood level and the discharge threshold being approximately 250-
300mm along the reach immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the Bedford to 
Bletchley/Marston Vale railway. 
During the 1 in 100 year plus climate change flood event, the model indicates that discharge 
from the upper reach of the Mill Brook tributary increases marginally, resulting in a 
discharge volume of approximately 7,500m3. Floodwater discharge does not occur along 
the main branch of the Mill Brook – the minimum freeboard between the 100 year plus 
climate change flood level and the discharge threshold being approximately 150-200mm 
along the reach immediately upstream of the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway. 
A CD containing the model files is included in Appendix B. 
6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to quantify the sensitivity of model results to (i) 
assumptions regarding model parameters and (ii) more extreme conditions than those 
considered above. 
The results associated with sensitivity testing for (i) Mannings ‘n’ plus 20% and (ii) partial 
blockage of the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway are 
summarised below. 
Mannings ‘n’ +20% 
Modelling analysis has shown that water levels may increase by up to approximately 
100mm as a result of a 20% increase in Mannings ‘n’.  This results in a marginal increase in 
the peak rate of floodwater discharge into Rookery South Pit from the upper reach of the 
Mill Brook tributary, such that the discharge volume increases by approximately 2,500m3 for 
the 100 year event. 
Structure Blockage 
The culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway constitutes a constriction 
to river flows.  The potential impact of culvert blockage upon flood levels was simulated by 
blocking 50% of the opening area of the culvert.  This test indicated that the water level 
immediately upstream of the culvert would increase by approximately 0.6m, thereby giving 
rise to floodwater ‘spill’ over the eastern bank of the Mill Brook.  This increases the volume 
of floodwater discharge into Rookery South Pit by approximately 13,000m3 when compared 
to the 100 year scenario without culvert blockage. 
7. 2017 REVIEW AND MODEL SENSITIVITY TESTING 
As part of the 2014 review, catchment areas were revised/adjusted, resulting in the tributary 
sub-catchment comprising a smaller proportion of the overall catchment (and the Mill Brook 
sub-catchment therefore comprising a larger proportion of the overall catchment) than was 
the case in 2010.  As a result, the areal weighting ratios applied to derive inflows changed, 
from approximately 70:30 (2010) to 80:20 (2017) in favour of the Mill Brook catchment.  
This, coupled with the fact that the 2017 lumped flow estimates for the total contributing 
catchment to the culvert beneath the railway are higher than those derived in 2014 (but 
marginally lower than those derived in 2010), means that (i) the 2017 estimates of the 
tributary inflows are lower than the 2010 estimates and (ii) the 2017 estimates of the Mill 
Brook inflows are higher than the 2010 estimates. 
Model sensitivity testing has therefore been completed (using the HEC-RAS modelling 
software Version 4.1.0) to quantify the impact of the revised flow estimates upon peak flood 
levels and floodwater discharge from the watercourses and into Rookery South Pit.  This 
analysis has shown that the volume of floodwater discharge into the Pit during the 1 in 100 
year plus climate change event is reduced from c.7,500m3 to c. 5,000m3.  Similarly, 
floodwater discharge into the Pit during the 1 in 1,000 year event is reduced from 
c.21,000m3 to c.16,000m3.  The reduction in discharge volumes occurs as a result of

reduced flows and therefore water levels within the tributary (resulting in a reduction in the 
duration of floodwater spill from the channel). 
Although flood flows within the Mill Brook are higher than the 2010 estimates, the right bank 
of the Brook is not readily overtopped, thereby constraining the magnitude/duration of 
floodwater discharge from the channel to Rookery South Pit.
