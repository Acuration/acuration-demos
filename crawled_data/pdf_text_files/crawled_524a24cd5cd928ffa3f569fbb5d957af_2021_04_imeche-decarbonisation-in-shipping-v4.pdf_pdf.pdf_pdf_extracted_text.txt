Wind is free, clean, abundantly and exclusively 
available to ships equipped to harness it. It 
decouples ship owner/operators from volatile 
land based commodity fuel supply, critical 
in an energy-constrained future – and, most 
importantly, has the capacity to drive emissions 
out of the shipping sector immediately

This short technical policy paper from the 
Institution of Mechanical Engineers provides 
an introduction to the propulsion solutions 
available to shipping that will enable rapid 
decarbonisation. This includes the use of wind 
as the primary energy, hybrid wind and/or fossil/
alternative fuels and the potential for biofuels, 
hydrogen and ammonia as drop-in replacements 
for bunker fuel. The Institution of Mechanical 
Engineers promotes a complete move away 
from using fossil fuels for use in transport or 
any part of our energy system in the future. In 
the interim however we must use solutions that 
provide the biggest and fastest reductions in 
emissions that affect our climate and air quality.
This report aims to demonstrate how by 
changing the propulsion systems used in 
shipping we can move more rapidly towards ‘net 
zero’, a target put forward by the Committee on 
Climate Change and ratified into law in 2019[1], 
and simultaneously reduce ocean pollution. The 
overall goal is to use our existing and emerging 
technologies and to be active in reducing the 
immediate impact our global supply chains have 
on the planet. Today shipping is responsible 
for between 2–3% of global emissions[2] and 
is not required to be included in a nation’s 
emissions monitoring, developed nations will 
be responsible for a larger proportion of the 
emissions from global shipping in a similar way 
to aviation. Countries with more money ship 
more goods.
As an international business, shipping has not 
received the type of attention other sectors 
have and it does not have a UK national 
regulatory framework that can be used to reduce 
emissions. This is compounded by existing 
failings from the industry, in November 2020 the 
International Maritime Organisation brokered 
an agreement with the majority of countries, 
including the UK, that would allow shipping to 
continue polluting unabated to 2030[4]. 
In addition to the lack of action around shipping, 
we have seen a slowing of overall CO2 emissions 
reduction recently with the UK reducing by 
just 2% in 2018 and indeed global emissions 
increasing by 0.6% in 2019. We did see an initial 
sharp drop in emissions in 2020, however this 
is likely to be due to the global pandemic and 
unlikely to persist. A recent report from the 
Office for National Statistics, shows the UK 
to be the largest importer per capita of GHG 
emissions in the G7 from outsourced activities, 
such as manufacturing and food production[5], 
these are all critical users of the shipping sector. 
This means that there is an imperative to act 
now and apply technologies that will reduce our 
impact on the environment and human health.

Policy Background
Before addressing the technical possibilities for 
reducing emissions in shipping it is important to 
refl ect on the policy background, why shipping 
has received minimal attention for emissions 
reduction and why the Institution of Mechanical 
Engineers believes that addressing this sector is 
critical to developing a clean global supply chain 
for the future. Every day we are reminded of the 
globalisation that has taken place over the past 
fi fty years from the interconnectedness of our 
fi nancial systems, the spread of new viruses 
and the unequal impact that climate change 
has, with some nations suff ering more from the 
eff ects of extreme weather. This has led in 2019 
and 2020 to greater public awareness of the 
need to act now to reduce the environmental 
impact of our lifestyles on other nations and 
the planet.[6]
Increasingly, albeit slowly, other sectors where 
the UK has a recognised responsibility are 
beginning to reduce their emissions, electricity 
is a good example, and we are now addressing 
passenger vehicles with renewed vigour with a 
target to phase out the sale of new petrol and 
diesel vehicles by 2030 under the new 10-Point 
Climate Plan[7]. This means that sectors where 
less attention is paid will begin to increase their 
contribution to global emissions. Shipping and 
aviation combined this could become as high 
as 40% by 2050[8] with shipping’s contributions 
dependent on the technological and demand 
changes made between now and 2050.
This technical policy paper aims to identify 
some solutions for the shipping sector that 
will provide both, rapid decarbonisation 
while maintaining the opportunity to seek a 
completely new system in the future. 
Accelerating Decarbonisation in Shipping: A No Regrets Approach Using Wind Power
Shipping Hierarchy
MORE SUSTAINABLE
Priority 1
Minimise demand
Manage the reasons why shipping is needed 
on such a large scale, what goods and 
services can be obtained with reduced need 
for shipping.
Priority 2
Optimise system effi  ciency
Increase all effi  ciency modes for shipping, 
this means route optimisation and 
connectivity through autonomy, increased 
capacity and slowing the ships down to 
reduce fuel use.
Priority 3
Implement existing technologies for 
emission reduction
After optimisation there is need to implement 
existing technologies that can rapidly 
reduce emissions, this can include wind and 
hybrid systems.
Priority 4
Plan for implementation of new 
technologies for emission reduction
Following implementation of existing 
technologies plan for new ships to be built 
and retrofi tted with emerging technologies 
such as in-board hydrogen systems and 
digital fuel autonomy.
Priority 5
Continue with business as usual
This is an unsustainable solution that will 
result in shipping being responsible for 
potentially 20% of global emissions by 2050.

Bunker fuel is a generic description for any 
fuel poured into a ships bunker. It is usually 
the residual oil that is left over once the more 
valuable lighter hydrocarbons, such as gasoline 
and diesel which have been extracted from 
crude oil during the refining process. It is used  
to power the engines of large cargo ships.
Bunker fuel is classified as hazardous and very 
toxic to aquatic life, it is a persistent oil and likely 
to spread large distances. It is made from long 
hydrogen carbon chains and when burnt emits 
particulate matter, carbon dioxide and sulphur 
oxide as well as other emissions. 
In 2018, 300 million tonnes of bunker fuel were 
used for ship bunkering. Shipping uses 6.1% of 
all global oil use[9].
There are currently three ways that shipping can 
be rapidly decarbonised and build a foundation 
for developing the next wave of technologies 
that enable long term decarbonisation.
1. Wind Power
The use of wind as a primary source of 
propulsion for ships is not a new concept. 21st 
century wingsails retrofitted on to cargo ships 
that do not carry goods on the deck will allow 
for a significant decrease in emissions. This 
reduction is made by allowing the fixed sails 
to be used at sea and subsequently use less 
bunker fuel. A careful analysis of ship types 
working on suitable routes could allow for even 
greater to reductions in emissions by optimising 
automated wingsails to harness maximum 
amount of wind. 
A recent feasibility study supported by the 
Institution showed the potential for reducing 
emissions on a ship retrofitted with fixed 
sails could be as much as 30% given the 
right conditions[10]. By ignoring the abundant, 
exclusive, and freely available wind potential at 
sea to decarbonise our shipping industry in the 
short term we will miss a pivotal opportunity to 
get in ahead of the curve immediately, driving 
down emissions from the sector giving time 
for the harder segments to adapt sectors in 
shipping to develop alternative more expensive 
zero emission fuels. 
2. Slowing down
This is probably the shipping industry’s most 
quoted solution to emissions reduction[11], and 
it is true that like many forms of transport you 
can optimise your fuel use by slowing down. The 
flaw in this process, is that it does not address 
the need to move away from bunker fuel as an 
energy source for propulsion. The Institution 
of Mechanical Engineers firmly believes that 
ultimately, we should move away from the use of 
fossil fuels in all areas of our energy system.

Existing Technologies
3. Hybrid systems - combining the two 
In the short-term, maximising our opportunity 
is key. By retrofi tting fi xed wind sails to cargo 
ships and slowing down we have the potential 
to reduce our emissions from shipping by 
up to 40% or more as technologies improve. 
The Institution strongly advocates the use of 
these techniques in the UK, beginning today 
to demonstrate our commitment to emissions 
reductions across our transport sectors.
In the future we will on/inboard new propulsion 
systems that on fully optimised ships enable 
fully autonomous fuel management. This could 
include wind, solar and hydrogen/biomethane as 
propulsion solutions as well as looking at wind 
and ammonia hybrid systems. We cannot wait 
for the silver bullet for shipping, but we can act 
now to increase renewables penetration in our 
energy systems.

Recommendations
The Institution of Mechanical Engineers 
recommends that: 
1. The UK Governments support the 
development of a ship demonstrator using 
retrofi tted wind sails. This will allow ship 
owners and users to understand how 
renewable wind can be used as primary 
propulsion on modern ships and could 
provide a compelling exhibition at COP26.
2. The UK shipping industry and users work with 
government on creative funding sources to 
build a ‘2050 now’ ship that demonstrates 
how a fully autonomous fuel ship, that creates 
and manages its fuel could operate.
3. The International Maritime Organisation 
rethinks its recent low ambition announced 
in November 2020 to and seeks to aim for a 
substantial reduction closer to 70% to meet 
the requirements of the Paris Agreement.
4. The UK Government actively creates funding 
schemes to invest in technologies that will 
specifi cally decarbonise shipping and meet 
the urgent need to reduce our emissions 
at sea.
