Conductors and insulators
Materials are either conductors or insulators; a good conductor is a bad insulator 
and a bad conductor is a good insulator.
A conductor allows electricity to pass through it. 
An insulator doesn’t allow electricity to pass through it. 
Test it!

Insulators
Build a complete circuit and then use it to test whether a material is a conductor or 
an insulator. 
Now make a break in the circuit. To see whether the items you’re testing are conductors 
or insulators, connect each one to the wires either side of the gap in the circuit.
The circuit you create will already have a good conductor in it – the metal wire that 
allows the electricity to flow from the battery to the other components. Think about 
why there’s plastic around this wire. 
If they allow the electricity to flow through them, they’re conductors. If they don’t 
they’re insulators.
