on Friday 21st March 2014 and accepted for examination on Tuesday 15th April 2014. The reference number applied by the Planning Inspectorate, on behalf of the Secretary of State, to the 
Application is EN010059. 
 
2. 
The Application seeks consent for the construction, operation and maintenance ofa new gas fired thermal generating station of up to 299MW and integral electrical and gas connections on 
land at the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, near Aberdare, South Wales in the County Borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf (the "Project"). 
 
3. 
The Project comprises the following elements which form the nationally significant infrastructure project and are all integral to one another: 
 
a. 
The Power Generation Plant - a simple cycle gas turbine gas fired ‘peaking’ power generating plant. To generate up to 299 MWe, between 1 and 5 gas turbine generators would be 
used, each with its own emission flue stack between 30m and 35m in height. The Power Generation Plant would include the gas turbine generators; a banking compound; a gas 
receiving installation; a black start generator; water tanks; and support buildings, structures and equipment. 
b. 
The Electrical Connection - a new underground electrical cable connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant into the National Electricity Transmission System at the 
Rhigos Substation. This would be composed of a cable, laid within the roadway and/or pavement of Main Avenue and Fourteenth Avenue from the Power Generation Plant to the 
Rhigos Substation.  
c. 
The Gas Connection - a new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the existing high pressure gas network National 
Transmission System. The Gas Connection would include an Above Ground Installation comprising of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge ("PIG") Trap Facility alongside a Minimum Offtake 
Connection, and an approximately 849 metre gas pipeline laid to the gas receiving installation within the Power Generation Plant. 
 
4. 
The DCO will, if granted, authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of the Project and would, amongst other things, make provision for the following:  
 
a. 
Tree and hedge removal along the routes of the Electrical Connection and the Gas Connection. 
b. 
Replacement and compensatory planting, landscaping and ecological mitigation. 
c. 
The temporary stopping up of public footpaths during the construction works described above. 
d. 
Creation of three new permanent accesses from the highway network for the Project, modification of existing accesses and creation of other temporary accesses along with temporary 
lane closures and streetworks. 
e. 
The permanent and temporary compulsory acquisition of land and rights in land for the Project. 
f.

h. Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works (including demolition), provisions, permits consents, waivers or releases as are necessary and/or convenient for the successful 
construction, operation and maintenance of the Project.
