STATEMENT OF COMMUNITY CONSULTATION 
 
OCTOBER 2013

Statement of Community Consultation 
 
This Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) is published in connection with a 
proposed new gas-fired electricity generation project including a power generation 
plant and gas and electrical connections on land at the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, 
Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf (the Project).  It explains how individuals and other 
interests living and working in the vicinity of the Project can comment on the 
proposals to construct, operate and maintain the Project.   
 
The proposed Project is being promoted by Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL) a 
company established by Watt Power Limited. Watt Power is seeking to develop gas 
fired power stations at Hirwaun and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. 
  
HPL has consulted Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCT) about the 
content of this SoCC and has had regard to their responses.   
 
The capacity of the proposed power generation plant will be in excess of 50 MW of 
electricity. As such, the plant, and its electrical and gas connections, is classified as 
a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the Planning Act 2008. 
This requires a Development Consent Order (DCO) to build and operate, granted by 
the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change. 
 
The SoCC is part of a consultation process that HPL is carrying out before it makes 
a formal application to the Secretary of State for a DCO. 
 
A consultation plan has previously been developed and is available from HPL or via 
its website www.hirwaunpower.co.uk. 
 
This Statement explains: 
 what the proposed Project is about; 
 how HPL is publishing preliminary environmental information about the proposed 
Project; 
 how HPL is going to consult local people and communities about the proposed 
Project and what activities will be undertaken to give them access to information 
about the proposal and help them to understand what particular aspects of the 
proposal may mean to them, enabling them to provide informed feedback; 
 how people can become involved in shaping the proposal before a DCO 
application is submitted by putting forward their views to influence the proposal, 
particularly regarding specific options under consideration; and 
 how people can provide feedback to HPL from consultation activities and ensure 
that they are informed about the proposed Project.

The Project 
The key details of the proposed Project are: 
 the construction, operation and maintenance of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
power generation plant capable of producing up to 299 MW of electricity; which is 
enough energy to supply up to 400,000 homes;  
 the power generation plant will have up to 5 stacks and will be up to 35m in 
height;  
 the site for the power generation plant covers an area of approximately 7.5ha and 
is located on land at the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. However, the footprint of the 
power generation plant would be smaller than the full site; 
 the power generation plant is designed to provide back-up generation capacity 
which can operate flexibly to respond quickly and efficiently to both short-term 
variation in customer demand and intermittent output from renewable power 
generation. It is anticipated that it will operate for no more than 1500 hours per 
year; 
 the power generation plant will produce electricity from natural gas; 
 besides the plant, the project will include the construction, operation and 
maintenance of a new underground/overground electrical connection to the 
existing National Grid Rhigos sub-station and the construction, operation and 
maintenance of a new underground pipeline to bring natural gas to the power 
generating plant from the National Transmission System;  
 it will create approximately 150-250 jobs during a construction period lasting up to 
three years and create up to 15 permanent jobs once commercial operations 
have begun;  
 it responds to the UK Government’s need for new gas generation in order to 
underpin the country’s energy security and its transition to a low-carbon 
economy; 
 the station would emit about 50% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than an equivalent 
sized coal-fired power plant;  
 it is acknowledged that during construction and operation there is potential for 
negative impacts on some local communities and the environment: for example, 
noise from on-site construction plant, impacts on the local and regional transport 
network as a result of construction traffic and landscape and visual impacts of up 
to five 35m stacks. An Environmental Impact Assessment is being undertaken to 
understand and minimise these and other potential effects of the Project’s 
construction, and thereafter its operation and maintenance. More information on 
this process is provided below. The Environmental Impact Assessment process is 
also considering the potential positive effects of the Project. 
 
At this stage the routes for the gas and potential electricity connection corridors have 
yet to be finalised. Continued consultation and environmental assessment on the 
connection route options are required before each can be confirmed. In addition, 
although a preliminary preferred location of the power generation plant within the 
 
3 
 
7.5ha has been identified, the final location and layout are yet to be determined. The 
consultation materials and events will provide further information.  
 
The Planning Process 
DCO applications for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are submitted to 
the Planning Inspectorate which will process and examine the application before 
making a recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State. The final decision on 
the application is made by the Secretary of State.  
 
The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs). The proposed Project has been developed with regard to the 
relevant energy NPSs, in particular, EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure), EN-4 (Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  EN-1 states that "gas will 
continue to play an important role in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility to 
support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of 
supply."  The need for this type of Project is established through the NPSs and is 
therefore not a topic for consultation. 
 
When determining a DCO application, the Secretary of State is required under 
Section 104 of the Planning Act 2008 to have regard to the relevant NPS (and thus 
the national need for such development) and make a decision in accordance with 
this unless contrary to other legal requirements, or if the adverse impacts of the 
proposed development would outweigh the benefits. 
  
When considering whether to accept an application for examination, the Planning 
Inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has undertaken adequate pre-
application consultation.  Pre-application consultation is essential in allowing HPL to 
understand and minimise the impacts of the proposed Project and to facilitate the 
examination by the Planning Inspectorate. HPL is required to submit a Consultation 
Report with its application for a DCO.  This report will include details of the local 
community feedback received, explain how HPL has had regard to the feedback and 
will detail how HPL has carried out the consultation proposed in the SOCC and 
complied with the consultation requirements of the Planning Act 2008. 
 
The community consultation described in this statement is carried out under Section 
47 of the Planning Act 2008. It is in addition to consultation that will be carried out 
with specific statutory consultees (such as Natural Resources Wales) and those with 
relevant interests in land (including owners and occupiers within the Project 
boundary) under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008. It is also in addition to wider 
publicity of the proposed Project under Section 48 of the Planning Act 2008.

Environmental Information & Impacts 
The proposed Project will be designed and developed to meet or exceed relevant 
current quality, safety and environmental standards and efforts will be made to 
minimise its impact on the local environment, both during its construction and its 
operation.  The design of the development and HPL’s proposals to mitigate its 
impacts will be amongst the issues considered by the Planning Inspectorate on 
behalf of the Secretary of State. 
 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, HPL is undertaking an EIA. The Project is 
classed as EIA development under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009.  The EIA considers the potential impacts of 
the project including air and water quality, noise, visual and landscape, traffic, local 
ecology, archaeology and heritage, socio-economics, and cumulative impacts.   
 
HPL has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the scope of the EIA, 
including RCT, Natural Resources Wales, South Wales Trunk Road Agency, BBNPA 
and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate on 03 June 2013, accompanied by a Scoping Report. The Scoping 
Report outlines which environmental topics will be covered by the EIA and how the 
assessments will be undertaken. The Planning Inspectorate issued its formal 
Scoping Opinion on 10 July 2013. 
 
All documents are available on the HPL website (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk). 
 
As part of the pre-application consultation materials on the proposed Project, HPL 
will publish a Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) and a Non-
Technical Summary (NTS).  The PEIR presents the information gathered to date and 
provides the results of HPL’s preliminary assessments as to the likely significant 
environmental effects both positive and negative, of the construction, operation, 
maintenance and decommissioning phases of the Project. It does not set out the 
final findings; these will be included in the Environmental Statement that will 
accompany the DCO application when it is submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for 
examination. However, the PEIR includes information on provisional mitigation 
measures. The NTS presents a summary of this information. 
 
During consultation, HPL will make available details on landscaping proposals and 
other measures to mitigate the Project’s impact.  HPL will provide copies of the PEIR 
and the NTS to RCT; both documents will also be made available at local authority 
offices, 
local 
libraries, 
at 
public 
exhibitions 
and 
on 
the 
HPL 
website 
www.hirwaunpower.co.uk.

When the EIA process is complete and HPL submits its application for a DCO, it will 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement. This will report on the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project identified in the EIA and, where 
negative effects are identified, will explain the mitigation measures to avoid or reduce 
these.  
 
Public Consultation 
The views of the local community about the Project are important.  In June 2013, 
HPL shared its initial plans with people living in the vicinity of the site at exhibitions 
held over three days at Rhigos Community Centre and at Hirwaun YMCA. At the 
exhibition and since, HPL has received and responded to comments on the 
proposed project and its impact on the environment, local communities and the local 
economy.    
 
a. What are we now consulting on and when? 
In a second, formal phase of consultation commencing on Thursday, 17 October 
2013, HPL will seek views on: 
 the Project, including the location and layout of the proposed power generation 
plant within the 7.5Ha site; 
 the route options of the gas and potential electrical connections; 
 the findings of the preliminary environmental studies including construction and 
operation impacts, for example, any visual impacts; and  
 the community benefits anticipated for the Project. 
 
Only after all inputs have been considered will designs be finalised and the 
application for a DCO be submitted.  
 
The consultation explained in this Statement will run until Thursday, 28 November 
2013. Comments about the project must be received by HPL by Thursday, 28 
November 2013.    
 
b. Who will we consult with? 
The Planning Act 2008 states that those ‘living in the vicinity of the land’ should be 
consulted.  We have discussed the scope of the consultation with RCT and have 
identified Consultation Zones that form the basis of the consultation.  
 
HPL will carry out its consultation in two areas: a core consultation zone (CCZ) of an 
approximate 3km radius from the site of the Power Generation Plant, and an outer 
consultation zone (OCZ) of an approximate 8km radius from the site  
 
The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of 
the site that could be affected by the Project and where people may be expected to 
have the greatest interest in the Project.  These are the villages of Rhigos, Hirwaun 
and Penderyn, as well as dispersed households in this semi-rural area. The village of 
 
6 
 
Penywaun has also been included in the CCZ, although it is beyond the 3km radius 
from the site, as it is contiguous to Hirwaun. 
 
Communities in the OCZ will be informed about the Project in various ways and will 
be given the opportunity to comment on the plans.  The OCZ includes the main 
population area of Aberdare to the east and Treherbert to the south. HPL does not 
anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the OCZ will be 
significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation although HPL 
recognizes that they might be interested in it.  
Outside these zones, there may well be others interested in HPL’s plans. They will 
also be reached through local/regional newspaper advertising and media coverage 
(print, broadcast and social media). All feedback received will be considered. 
 
c.  How will we consult?  
HPL will seek and receive people’s views through a number of activities: 
 public exhibitions will be held at four locations within the CCZ and one in 
Aberdare, the nearest town and population centre of scale; 
 a leaflet will be delivered to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ, 
and made available at local council offices, local libraries and other civic 
community venues in the area. It will give background on the Project, the 
consultation process and how individuals can engage in it.  The leaflet will be 
made available at libraries and council offices in the OCZ;  
 these local libraries will host copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report and the Non-Technical Summary; 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
 Requests for the leaflet and other information about the Project in other formats 
(e.g. large print or braille), will be considered upon request. Key information will 
be available in the Welsh language; 
 a website (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk) provides information on the Project as well 
as access to documents, and provide visitors the opportunity to ask questions or 
make comments online; 
 an email address to which individuals can write; 
 a dedicated free telephone line on which people can ask questions or submit 
comments; 
 a Freepost address (Freepost RTEY-JYYB-ERSR c/o Hirwaun Power Ltd, 49 
York Place, Edinburgh EH1 3JD) to which people can send questions or 
comments; 
 HPL will also notify the local community about the Project and the consultation 
exhibition events via posters on local noticeboards and other community 
locations, newspaper advertisements and media coverage; and 
 in addition, HPL will contact a broad spectrum of local stakeholders. These will 
include elected representatives, local community and special interest groups 
(including those ‘hard to reach groups’ such as the young, elderly and the 
disabled), and local business groups. HPL will provide them with background 
material on the Project and undertake briefings where appropriate. 
 The consultation period will be open until Thursday, 28 November. HPL will 
however endeavour to take into account responses and comments received after 
this date and before submission of the application, during the finalisation of the 
plans.
