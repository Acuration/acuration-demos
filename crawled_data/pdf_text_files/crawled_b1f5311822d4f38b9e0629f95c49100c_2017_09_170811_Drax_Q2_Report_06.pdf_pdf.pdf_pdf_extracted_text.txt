Britain’s power system keeps breaking records: this issue charts the continued rise of 
clean electricity and its benefits across the wider energy system.  Renewables hit a new 
milestone by producing 25% of Britain’s electricity over the quarter; while all low-carbon 
sources together produced 55% (see Article 1).
The carbon intensity of grid electricity is now its lowest ever, falling below 200 g/kWh 
over the quarter.  It dipped below 100 g/kWh on four days, representing an important step 
towards hitting the crucial 2030 target set by the Committee on Climate Change (see 
Article 2).  Clean electricity can enable electric vehicles to deliver clean personal transport.  
Article 3 dispels the myth that charging electric cars raises emissions compared to petrol 
and diesel, showing how they now produce less than half the CO2 per mile of the best cars 
on the market.
Solar power grew 17% on this quarter last year and hit three new records.  Article 4 
looks at the rise of solar power, its variability, and Britain’s ‘camel curve’ of net demand.  
As a consequence, a growing share of Britain’s electricity no longer uses the national 
transmission system.  For the first time, more than a tenth of demand over the quarter was 
produced and consumed locally, highlighting the shift towards a more decentralised power 
system (see Article 5).
Article 6 covers the statistics for the quarter, discussing the continued decline in coal 
output and prices spiking to over £1,500/MWh.

Clean electricity sources are once again breaking records in Britain.  Renewables powered 
more than a quarter of demand between April and June, as shown in the figure below-left.  
Output from all low-carbon sources (including nuclear and imports from France) met 56% of 
demand over the quarter, a tenth higher than the previous high reported in our first issue.
Wind, solar, biomass and hydro peaked at a 51.5% share of demand on June 7th at 1 PM, with 
a combined output of 19.1 GW.  At the same time, the output from all low-carbon sources 
hit a new record of 28.6 GW, meeting 89% of demand.  The figure below-right shows the 
generation mix during that week: on the Sunday afternoon wind and solar each produced 
more electricity than all fossil fuels combined.
For comparison, Germany hit a new record of 85% renewable electricity for an hour in May, 
showing that we can go further still.  With more than 6 GW of wind capacity currently under 
construction1 and plans to convert more of Britain’s coal units to biomass,2  it is likely these 
records will continue to be broken in the months to come.
1 
 Of this, 3.6 GW is offshore (Hornsea 1&2, Race Bank, Dudgeon, Rampion, Galloper and Walney 1&2) and 2.5 GW is onshore, primarily 
in Scotland and Wales (Kilgallioch, Pen y Cymoedd, Clyde Extension, Muaitheabhal and Bhlaraidh are each over 100 MW).

Drax Unit 4 and Lynemouth are under consideration, totalling 1.1 GW.

Low-carbon is the new normal for Britain’s power system.  Carbon intensity over the quarter 
averaged 199 g/kWh: 10% lower than the previous minimum set last year.  For context, the 
carbon intensity averaged 740 g/kWh in the 1980s and 500 g/kWh in the 2000s.
The carbon intensity of Britain’s electricity now regularly dips below 100 g/kWh, showing 
that deep decarbonisation is already plausible.  The sunny and windy Sunday afternoon of 
June 11th (see previous figure) saw grid carbon intensity hit an all-time low of 71 g/kWh, and 
remain below 100 g/kWh for several hours.
The figure below shows the carbon intensity of electricity supply during each half-year.  In 
2010/11, a third of hours were high-carbon with emissions over 500 g/kWh, the rest were 
mid-carbon (250-500 g/kWh).  Lower coal and higher gas prices in 2012/13 saw more high-
carbon hours as coal stations displaced gas until the Carbon Price Support made coal-fired 
generation less economic.  With strong growth of renewable output, low-carbon hours 
(125–250 g/kWh) are now rapidly emerging, and occurred half the time over the last twelve 
months.  There hasn’t been a single high-carbon hour in the last two years, and we are now 
seeing the first ‘lowest-carbon’ hours with less than one quarter of the carbon intensity.  So 
far, 2% of hours in 2017 have been in this lowest carbon category, but in future these will 
need to become the norm to hit the country’s decarbonisation targets.
The Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation for 2030 (electricity below 100 
g/kWh) can now be achieved for short periods of time, although meeting the target on 
individual days is easier than over the year as a whole.  Nonetheless, the path to low-carbon 
electricity supply appears more certain these days, but major challenges lie ahead in 
decarbonising the heating and transport sectors.

Future projections are based on an average carbon intensity of 175 g/kWh in 2020 (from National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios) 
and 100 g/kWh in 2030 (from the Committee on Climate Change recommendations).  The share of each category was estimated 
by reducing the carbon intensity of each hour during 2016 by 74 g/kWh for 2020 and 149 g/kWh for 2030.  This preserves the 
distribution of carbon intensities across the year, which has remained similar since 2009 with a standard deviation of ± 66 g/kWh.  
This gives one possible share of generation that is consistent with meeting the annual target, rather than a precise forecast.

Electric cars get greener
The recent switch from coal to renewables means electric vehicles now create half the CO2 
of the cleanest conventional and hybrid cars on the road.  It is widely accepted that electric 
cars dramatically reduce air pollution in cities, but can they reduce overall CO2 emissions 
when the electricity they use largely comes from fossil fuels?  The lack of transparency 
around power systems has helped fuel the debate about how clean electric cars really are.
The calculation is complex because it depends on what time of day or night a vehicle 
is charged, and which power stations increase output to meet the additional demand.  
Nonetheless, Electric Insights can illustrate how these emissions have changed recently 
by assuming that vehicle charging is spread evenly across the day, and uses the average 
electricity mix during each period.  This reflects the longer-term situation if the extra 
demand from electric vehicles was met by building the same mix of power stations as 
currently exists.4
The number of plug-in vehicles on Britain’s roads recently surpassed 100,000, in part 
because batteries are rapidly becoming cheaper.  Pure electric and plug-in hybrid numbers 
have grown 30-fold in four years, and now represent 1.8% of new car registrations.
Electric vehicles are now better than ever for lowering carbon emissions.  The figure  
below shows the monthly average carbon intensity of electricity, and how this translates 
into emissions from charging electric vehicles.  Producing the electricity to charge a 
Tesla Model S back in 2012 would have created 124 g per km driven – the same as a 180 
horsepower Range Rover.  Nowadays that has halved to 74 g/km in winter and 41 g/km in 
summer.  Smaller cars like the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3 can be charged for less than half the 
CO2 of the cleanest non-electric car on the market – the Toyota Prius hybrid.

Solar power is reaching new heights in Britain, and having a growing influence on system 
operations.  For eight hours over the quarter, solar power produced more power than all fossil 
fuels combined.  It set two new records for instantaneous output: supplying 25% of demand 
on the 8th of April, and producing 8.91 GW on May 26th.  Over the quarter, solar panels 
produced 4 TWh of electricity, 12% above the previous maximum set back in 2015.
Solar panels rely directly on the levels of sunshine, so their output varies across the seasons 
and also from one day to the next.  The figure below-left shows the maximum solar output 
during each day over the last 18 months.  This peak output normally occurs between midday 
and 2 PM, and can vary by up to 5 GW from one day to the next if the weather suddenly shifts.
Solar output is depressing the need for other generation during afternoons, which we 
explored last quarter.  California coined the phrase ‘duck curve’ to describe the shape of 
their daily demand profile as more PV is added.  The figure below-right shows what might 
be better described as Britain’s ‘camel curve’.  The increasing amount of solar power creates 
two humps in the profile of net demand which other power stations must produce, one at 9 
AM, one at 9 PM.  The difference between 2013 and the 2021 prediction is equivalent to the 
country’s entire nuclear fleet powering up for a few hours every sunny afternoon.
The UK has 12.4 GW of solar PV capacity installed; more than many analysts once thought 
would be installed by 2050.  The majority of this capacity (57%) is concentrated in 1,400 large 
ground-mounted and standalone farms, averaging 5 MW each.  The rest is distributed over 
910,000 small rooftop systems less than one-thousandth the size.

Britain is moving towards a decentralised power system as a tenth of June’s electricity 
did not use the national grid.  Small renewables (particularly solar) make up a growing 
portion of electricity supply.  These are embedded into local distribution networks rather 
than connected to the high-voltage transmission system.  They can meet demand locally if 
output comes at a useful time, though they do not necessarily reduce the need to have those 
transmission wires available for other times. 
The proportion of generation that bypasses the grid has been steadily rising, surpassing 10% 
for the first time in June.  More than 25% of demand was met by ‘embedded generation’ for 41 
hours over the quarter, primarily on sunny weekend afternoons.
Some of this embedded generation would be consumed “behind the meter” where a building 
with solar panels runs appliances while the sun is shining.  These consumers make no 
contribution towards the cost of the network when they are doing so.  Since these costs are 
largely fixed, tariffs have to rise for everyone else, making it ever-more attractive to bypass 
the network: a phenomenon known as the “utility death spiral”. 
National Grid and the other transmission companies collect much of their revenue on the 
basis of the peak demand measured on the transmission system.  There are still times when 
embedded generation provides less than 1% of total demand, so this peak is falling much more 
slowly.
Companies that buy power from embedded generators at peak times reduce their metered 
demand and hence their charges, passing on these “embedded benefits” to the generator.  
National Grid is still allowed the same amount of revenue, so charges for everyone else go 
up.  Ofgem, the regulator, has recently ordered a change in the way some of the charges are 
calculated, and embedded benefits will be gradually reduced from April 2018.

Output from renewables is up 25% on this quarter last year, while output from 
fossil fuels is down 16%.  Over the last 12 months, wind and solar accounted for 
80% of new capacity installed.
Coal fell to less than 2% of the generation mix.  This quarter saw the first full 
day when no electricity was produced from coal, on April 21st.  There were 315 
hours this quarter with zero coal output, already twice as many as during all of 
2016.  Coal stations ran at just 4% of full output over the quarter, seeming to 
have found a new ‘floor’ of generating 600 MW on average, from 14,000 MW of 
capacity.  There were only eight days in the quarter when coal produced more 
than biomass, and five days when it produced more than wind or solar.
Prices eased back to £40/MWh day-ahead and £41.50/MWh real-time, after 
a small rise over winter.  Negative prices were seen in 12 hours over 7 days, 
including four hours overnight on June 7th, and four hours in mid-afternoon on 
June 24th.  At the other extreme, prices spiked to £388/MWh day-ahead (over 
£1,500/MWh real-time) on May 17th, when wind and solar output dropped by 
two-thirds from the previous day, margins were tight, and several coal units were 
started up to fill the gap.

8 Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider.  For example, BEIS Energy Trends 
records an additional 900 MW of wind, 600 MW of biomass and 500 MW of solar, respectively producing 1.4, 1.2 and 0.2 TWh 
extra per quarter.  These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity system and so cannot be reported on here.
