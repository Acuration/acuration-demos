										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em><strong>By Angela Hepworth, Commercial Director at Drax</strong></em></h3>
<p>In their Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has clearly stated that to limit warming to 1.5C we will need carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) on a gigaton scale. The magnitude of this challenge lays starkly before us, but in equal measure with the size of the task, its importance has never been more evident.</p>
<p>It’s long been accepted that the world must decarbonise by reducing emissions, but the necessity of carbon removals is more newly recognised. CDRs are now acknowledged to be a crucial part of the effort to achieve net zero emissions, both to neutralise hard-to-abate emissions and sectors (like mining, transportation and aviation) and to remove excess historic carbon, or overshoot, already in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>At Drax we are developing Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), which is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously.</p>
<p>Engineered carbon removal technologies like BECCS are crucial to achieving long-term climate goals. BECCS is the most scalable of these technologies that can be deployed rapidly and is affordable compared with other permanent removal solutions.</p>
<h2><strong>Credibility, transparency and trust</strong></h2>
<p>Historically, the voluntary carbon market has struggled with demonstrating credibility, transparency and trust and this has proven to be a significant weight on the industry’s ability to scale. We have seen reports of low-quality offsets sold as high integrity credits and projects that don’t deliver the carbon benefits claimed, which has diminished investor trust in the market as a whole.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, we are now seeing significant initiatives being put in place to implement the high standards and good governance in carbon removals credits that we need to effectively scale the market to levels required. The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets (ICVCM) is a prime example of this, serving as an independent governance body for the voluntary carbon market.</p>
<p>The ICVCM is working to champion standards across the industry and has set out its Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) – set of principles that all carbon offsets and removals must meet in order to be considered high integrity.</p>
<p>We welcome this initiative and hope it will raise standards across the market.</p>
<p>Similar to what we are seeing in the AI industry at present, in order to build trust in this nascent market and in turn scale it, it is also imperative that industry looks outside of itself and engages with other stakeholders who are impacted or interested in it. We must; develop ethical principles and guidelines for the design, development and deployment of carbon markets; implement transparent and accountable mechanisms for the oversight and governance of them; educate and engage the public and stakeholders on the benefits of CDRs; empower and protect the customers; and foster collaboration and dialogue among the industry, academia, civil society and policymakers.</p>
<h2><strong>Why we need standards for BECCS</strong></h2>
<p>At Drax we already recognise that addressing quality concerns is the only way that the market will work for everybody – buyers rightly want to have confidence that they are buying a high-integrity removals which are robustly quantified and verified, sellers need to be able to demonstrate the validity of their claims, and government needs a well-functioning market and a baseline from which to regulate it.</p>
<p>Our partnership with <a href="https://www.stockholmexergi.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockholm Exergi</a> and <a href="https://www.ecoengineers.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EcoEngineers</a> is doing just that &#8211; developing a world-leading methodology to ensure the integrity of BECCS CDRs. The methodology was created to align with the ICVCM’s CCPs and to closely consider how to ensure everyone around the table is getting what they need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantification:</strong> For the methodology to be successful it requires a thorough approach to quantifying net-negative carbon removals from BECCS. Quantification in the methodology starts with the gross volume of CO2 we capture and store, then subtracts any supply chain emissions, and/or emissions associated with the carbon capture and storage process, as well as any “leakage” impacts (increases in CO2 emissions outside the project boundary). We have intentionally developed this approach to be both robust and conservative so that BECCS CDRs verified under the methodology are a truly net negative product.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guardrails:</strong> It is also crucial in any methodology for BECCS that there are robust guardrails in place to ensure biomass used comes from sustainable sources – for example, from forests where the carbon stock is stable or increasing, and excluding biomass sourced from sensitive areas where there’s high levels of biodiversity. Our methodology also provides that any potential social or environmental risks must be evaluated and mitigated for biomass to be used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> We aim to register our credits with one of the major registries, and once a methodology is adopted, we will ensure that our credits are independently verified to confirm that they meet all the requirements set out in the standard, and that there is robust governance in place, for example to ensure credits cannot be double counted.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Taking the methodology forward</strong></h2>
<p>Pioneering this work for BECCS standards is an important step toward increasing investment in BECCS CDRs – a climate critical technology – and it needs to be done collaboratively. It has been developed in partnership with Stockholm Exergy and EcoEngineers and we are now working to gather feedback from other stakeholders with the aim of making it comprehensive and representative.</p>
<p>As a part of this we’d like to invite further feedback – from other developers, standards bodies, potential customers and others, and welcome constructive comment on the text.</p>
<p>The methodology has also been submitted to the European Commission to help shape their proposals for the framework for CDRs that they are developing.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of all parties to work towards common standards for CDRs, to avoid current fragmentation of standards that causes confusion for customers, and we appreciate your feedback on this important work as we drive it forward.</p>
<h2><strong>Capturing the opportunity</strong></h2>
<p>We have an opportunity to change our current climate trajectory, but that will only happen if we take action now. We to need to reduce emissions and rapidly scale the market for high integrity, sustainable CDRs. Putting the required standards and governance into place to build a resilient and trustworthy carbon removals market is a core part of that.</p>
<p>We hope that this methodology has a part to play in that work and that it will bring us one step closer to manifesting the potential of BECCS done well at scale.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Department for Energy Security &#038; Net Zero (“DESNZ”) has, as part of a market update to the sector, set out an indicative position that large-scale Power BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) projects be eligible to participate in an expansion of the Track-1 carbon cluster sequencing process. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the update, DESNZ set out its draft expectation to run the Track-1 extension and Track-2 processes in parallel, subject to T&amp;S capacity and ministerial sign off. Following the designation of the Viking CCS cluster as a Track-2 cluster in July 2023, there are now two potential routes which could support the Drax Power Station BECCS project and wider CCS in the Humber region by 2030 – the East Coast Cluster and Viking CCS cluster.</p>
<p>DESNZ also set out an indicative timeline that shortlisted projects would commence negotiations from Autumn 2024. DESNZ will now receive feedback on its draft proposals pending further updates and the publication of final guidance in due course.</p>
<h3>Will Gardiner, Drax CEO, said:</h3>
<blockquote><p>“The Government’s statements are a helpful step forward not just for BECCS in the UK, but for the wider fight against climate change. We can only reach net zero by investing in critical, new green technologies such as BECCS. I welcome the Government’s draft position and urge them to progress with both Track-1 expansion and Track-2 processes in parallel this winter”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Separately, in August 2023 the UK Government published a Biomass Strategy which set out its position on the use of biomass in the UK’s plans for delivering net zero. The Biomass Strategy outlined the potential “<em>extraordinary”</em> role which biomass can play across the economy in power, heating and transport, including a priority role for BECCS, which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide large-scale carbon dioxide removals. This is in addition to formal bilateral discussions between Drax and the Government in relation to a potential bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS at Drax Power Station.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">July was the hottest month ever recorded, the impact of climate change is being felt here and now. Tackling the causes of global warming is now more pressing than ever. We are currently on track for a 14% rise in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The EU has already taken a number of steps to support the development of carbon removals in the region. The CCS Directive establishes a regulatory framework for the geological storage of CO2 and the proposal for a Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) will support the development of a voluntary carbon market which is a cornerstone for the development of CDR.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, to support the scaling up of the sector it is essential to (1) assess the scale of removals required, (2) define binding EU targets and (3) develop roadmaps for the scale up of carbon removals in Europe.

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Certification of carbon removals is essential for driving technological development and deployment.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> It provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes. We need transparent and robust rules and procedures to ensure that only high-quality removals and removals that would not have taken place are credited, and to prevent the same activity from being certified twice or using the same certificate twice. This is what the EU proposal for a regulation establishing a Union certification framework for carbon removals aims to do.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet, the scope of the EU certification proposal does not go far enough.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">BECCS is one of the best examples of this.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is also very well regulated. Sustainability of biomass is already covered by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The sustainability criteria for biomass in RED were updated in 2023 and has been formally adopted by the European Parliament. It is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world. It applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against over-sourcing. It also safeguards biodiversity, ensures forest regeneration and sets strict limits on all supply chain emissions, including transportation. The 2023 revision of the RED specifically took account of the projected growth in biomass demand to 2050, including for BECCS, and amended the sustainability criteria appropriately. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As part of its plan to accelerate decarbonisation efforts across all sectors of Britain’s economy, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has today published its long-awaited Biomass Strategy. </p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/opinion/biomass-and-beccs-are-essential-in-the-uks-journey-to-net-zero/">Biomass and BECCS are essential in the UK’s journey to Net Zero</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com">Drax Global</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Strategy provides an important steer on the short-, medium- and long-term use of biomass in the UK’s 2050 Net Zero target.</p>
<p>With the Government’s Strategy in hand, I am more certain than ever on two things.  First, that there remains a clear and powerful role for biomass and BECCS in helping the UK balance harder to abate sectors, like aviation, and reach Net Zero.</p>
<p>And secondly, that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has a vital role to play in our global energy transition – and that Drax is well placed to deliver.</p>
<h2><strong>Why we should be confident </strong></h2>
<p>In developing the Strategy, the Government has considered several factors including: availability of biomass and the priorities for end use; impacts on air quality; the sustainability of biomass use; as well as the role of BECCS in helping to reach our long-term climate goals.</p>
<p>The ‘Priority Use Framework’ evaluates where biomass would be most sustainably and efficiently used across sectors, given supply constraints. This framework is an important tool, which has been developed with four key principles in mind; sustainability; air quality; the circular economy and resource efficiency; and ability to support us getting to Net Zero.</p>
<p>Critically, the Priority Use Framework states that:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the short-term (2020s) <em>government will continue to facilitate sustainable biomass deployment through a range of incentives and requirements covering power, heat and transport </em></li>
<li>In the medium-term (to 2035) <em>government intends to further develop biomass</em> <em>use</em> for utilities such as heat and power <em>with a view to where possible transition to BECCS</em></li>
<li><em>Biomass for use in BECCS should be prioritised in the long term </em>(to 2050)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s very encouraging to see Government recognise the important role that biomass plays in our energy transition in both the short and medium term, as well as its prioritisation of BECCS in the long term.</p>
<p>Although there are various routes for deploying BECCS across different industries, the strategy further prioritises the deployment of BECCS on existing biomass generation plants with established supply chains, further supported by the development of the Power-BECCS business model for the first BECCS projects.</p>
<p>The Strategy is also promising as it presents an evidence-driven basis for long-term policy stability and I believe if the Government continues in this direction, it will draw investment to the UK’s bioenergy industry.</p>

<h2><strong>Why this is critical for the country</strong></h2>
<p>Biomass has already played an important role in supporting energy security while helping the UK decarbonise, displacing fossil fuels with a source of renewable, dispatchable power. Our work has also made a significant contribution to the UK economy, adding an estimated £1.8 billion to the UK GDP and supporting 17,800 jobs in 2021 alone.</p>
<p>And, looking to the future, BECCS presents an enormous opportunity to the UK.</p>
<p>Early investment in this critical technology has the potential to support energy security, and climate targets whilst creating jobs and making the UK a leader in the potentially trillion-dollar global CDR market.</p>
<p>This work needs to happen now &#8211; nearly all realistic pathways to limit warming to 1.5C require the carbon removal technology and renewable power BECCS offers, and expert voices at the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UK’s Climate Change Committee, and Forum for the Future have said that carbon removals will be needed to address the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Today’s Strategy is a clear signal from Government that they recognise the importance of BECCS and the urgency with which we must employ it within the UK.</p>
<h2><strong>Why this is encouraging for Drax</strong></h2>
<p>Drax is an international, growing, sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver Net Zero and energy security and I believe the Strategy we have seen from Government today is a clear indication of their support for the work that we do.</p>
<p>With BECCS, Drax has the ability to become a global leader in carbon removals technology. We are engaged in formal discussions with the UK Government about the project and, providing these are successful, we plan to invest billions in transforming Drax Power Station into the world’s largest carbon removals project. The prioritisation of BECCS within the Priority Use Framework shows the Government is aligned to this vision.</p>
<h2><strong>As we look forward</strong></h2>
<p>We welcome the Government’s Biomass Strategy and will continue to unpack what it means for our business over the coming days and weeks with a mind to our next steps.</p>
<p>Government must now ensure that as it progresses its consultation on biomass sustainability that that process is equally evidence-driven and ensures that science-based methods drive the policy forward. We hope to continue to work alongside Government to support these efforts.</p>
<p>Our formal discussions with the UK Government on BECCS and a ‘bridging mechanism’ to support the transition to BECCS have been productive, but to realise the scale of the ambition included in the Government’s Strategy, we need commitment through the delivery of a clear business model that supports BECCS.</p>
<p>Today’s support from Government brings us a big step closer and we look forward to continuing the work.</p>

<p>“We welcome the UK Government’s clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that BECCS can play in achieving the country’s climate goals.</p>
<p>“The inclusion of BECCS at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the UK wants to be a leader in carbon removals and Drax is ready to deliver on this ambition. We are engaged in formal discussions with the UK Government about the project and, providing these are successful, we plan to invest billions in delivering BECCS at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire, simultaneously providing reliable, renewable power and carbon removals.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working alongside the Government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy, through further progression of plans for BECCS and ensuring an evidence-driven, best practice approach to sustainability.”</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>A priority role for BECCS</strong></h2>
<p>The Strategy reiterates the Government’s ambition to deliver 5Mt pa of carbon removals by 2030, with the potential for this to increase to 23Mt by 2035 and up to 81Mt by 2050, with BECCS expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050.</p>
<p>In the period to 2035 Government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating, whilst supporting projects transitioning to BECCS. BECCS projects, which includes Drax Power Station, are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology ready to be deployed. Beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without BECCS in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security.</p>
<p>The Strategy notes the active work in government to support BECCS, including the development of business models.</p>
<h2><strong>Biomass availability and sustainability</strong></h2>
<p>The Strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass, finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6<sup>th</sup> Carbon Budget.</p>
<p>Alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass, Government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and Drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors.</p>
<p>A link to the Strategy can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/biomass-strategy">here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Scientific assessment of carbon removals from BECCS</strong></h2>
<p>Alongside publication of the Strategy, the Government has published an evidence-based assessment of BECCS as a route to negative emissions. The report sets out how “well regulated” BECCS can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people, the environment, and the climate.</p>
<h2><strong>BECCS at Drax Power Station</strong></h2>
<p>In March 2023, the Government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of large-scale Power-BECCS projects by 2030 and that the Drax Power Station BECCS project had passed the deliverability assessment for the Power-BECCS project submission process.</p>
<p>Formal bilateral discussions with the Government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the Government’s ambition to deliver 5Mt pa of carbon removals by 2030. These discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS at Drax Power Station.</p>

<p>Drax believes that BECCS at Drax Power Station is the only project in the UK that can enable the Government to achieve this ambition, in addition to the large-scale renewable power and system support services it provides to the UK power system.</p>
<p>In July 2023, the Government designated the Viking CCS cluster as a Track 2 cluster. Progressing a CO<sub>2</sub> transport and storage network in the Humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of high-skilled jobs and energy security for decades to come. Along with the East Coast Cluster, Viking creates an additional potential pathway to support BECCS at Drax Power Station.</p>
<p>The Government has also confirmed that during 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of its wider CCS programme for individual projects, including BECCS (Track 1 expansion and Track 2).</p>

<h3>Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:</h3>
<blockquote><p>“In the first half of 2023, we delivered a strong system support and generation performance, providing dispatchable, renewable power for millions of UK homes and businesses. Drax Power Station remained the UK&#8217;s single largest provider of renewable energy by output during the period.</p>
<p>“We continue to focus on our role as the UK’s leading generator of flexible renewable power and our ambition to be a world leader in carbon removals. To that end, in the US, we have made good progress screening options for BECCS projects which can deliver long-term, large-scale carbon removal and attractive opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>“We are excited about the opportunity for BECCS in the UK and are in formal discussions with the UK Government to facilitate the transition to BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030. Our plans could create thousands of new jobs in the Humber region, help the UK meet its carbon removals targets and support long-term energy security.”</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The world’s leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC are clear – the planet cannot solve the climate crisis without the combination of reliable, renewable electricity and carbon removal technologies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Drax is a growing and sustainable, international business providing flexible, renewable energy and carbon removals solutions, via BECCS, which put us at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Our plans to invest billions in critical renewable energy and carbon removal technologies will help to tackle the climate crisis and could create thousands of jobs whilst generating secure, renewable power. This investment is underpinned by our strong operational performance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Capital Markets Day</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax is today hosting a Capital Markets Day for investors and analysts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Will Gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the Group’s strategy, market opportunities and development projects, including the progress Drax is making in the development of BECCS in North America and the opportunities this represents for the Group.</p>
<h3>Purpose and ambition</h3>
<div>
<p class="xxmsonormal">The Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030. The Group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars, which are closely aligned with global energy policies that increasingly recognise the role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="xxmsonormal">The Group’s three strategic pillars remain (1) to be a global leader in carbon removals, (2) to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets, and (3) to be a UK leader in dispatchable, renewable generation.</p>

<h3>Global need for carbon removals</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<sup>(3)</sup>, the world’s leading authority on climate science, states that CDR methods, including BECCS, are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5<sup>o</sup>C.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the IPCC’s latest report use significant volumes of carbon removals, including BECCS, as a key tool for mitigating climate change. The IPCC believes that globally up to 9.5 billion tonnes of CDRs via BECCS will be required per year by 2050.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the USA, the supportive investment environment created by the Inflation Reduction Act is stimulating action and robust pricing for CDRs.</p>
<h3>BECCS – North America</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two years, Drax has been progressing a number of work streams to develop its options for BECCS, with a primary focus on North America.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax has continued to develop plans for a new-build BECCS power unit capable of producing c.2TWh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and capturing c.3Mt of carbon per year. Two initial sites in the US South have been selected and are progressing to option, although the precise details remain commercially sensitive. The two sites combined could enable the capture of c.6Mt of carbon per year by 2030.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-17055" src="https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="567" srcset="https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-320x480.jpg 320w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-100x150.jpg 100w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-767x1150.jpg 767w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8920-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px" />Total investment would be in the region of $2 billion per plant with a target FID in 2026 and commercial operation by 2030. The capital cost reflects the construction of new-build power generation as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The design of new-build BECCS enables a wider choice of biomass materials, including non-pelletised material, such as woodchips. Drax aims to locate new plants in regions which are closer to sources of sustainable biomass and T&amp;S systems to permanently store CO<sub>2</sub>. This is expected to significantly reduce the operating cost of new-build BECCS compared to retrofit, as well as carbon emissions in the supply chain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Group is continuing to evaluate nine further sites in North America, creating a pipeline of development opportunities into the 2030s.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Commercial arrangements</u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The commercial model for US BECCS includes Power Purchase Agreements, long-term CDR offtake agreements and a direct pay tax incentive under the Inflation Reduction Act of $85/tonne.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax believes that the role of high-quality, permanent removals, such as BECCS and Direct Air Capture, will grow significantly as governments and companies take action to address their own carbon footprints. In September 2022, Drax announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for one of the world’s biggest carbon removals deal with Respira, a carbon broker. Under the terms of the MoU, Respira will be able to purchase up to 2Mt of CDRs over a five-year period from Drax’s North American BECCS projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax has also agreed MoUs with C-Zero, a carbon broker, for the sale of CDRs at c.$300/tonne.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Resourcing </u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To support the development of its BECCS projects in North America, Drax has hired 80 employees across the US and Canada and is in the process of establishing a Global BECCS headquarters in Houston, Texas, which will provide access to the highly skilled workforce needed to support the growth of this part of the Group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Other developments</u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to new-build BECCS, Drax is currently developing an option for a project to add a carbon capture process to an existing pellet plant in Louisiana. The project would have the capacity to capture over 100k tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year from the pelleting process, providing an early demonstration of the technology and creating CDRs which can help to stimulate this nascent market. The project, which has a capital cost in the region of $150 million, is targeting FID in 2024/25 and commissioning in 2026.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Group is also assessing options for BECCS on existing non-Drax assets and is continuing to screen other regions, including Europe and Australasia.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17053" src="https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="667" srcset="https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-480x320.jpg 480w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-1800x1200.jpg 1800w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/H18A8956-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Capital allocation</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Group has previously outlined a fully funded plan to invest c.£3 billion in two BECCS units at Drax Power Station, pellet production and pumped storage hydro.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Group expands on this plan to include two new-build BECCS plants and CCS on a pellet plant, increasing the total potential investment to c.£7 billion between 2024 and 2030.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Any final investment decisions will be subject to the achievement of project milestones, including further progress on commercial arrangements as well as clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting strong expected cash generation from existing assets and new investments, Drax can fully fund the £7bn of opportunities and return to net debt to Adjusted EBITDA below 2x by the end of 2031. Drax will also continue to assess a wider range of funding options, including project finance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Group remains committed to its capital allocation policy, which was established in 2017, and has delivered average annual dividend per share growth of around 11%.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Group has commenced a £150 million share buyback programme, which is expected to complete by the end of 2023. The programme is not expected to have any impact on the Group’s medium and long-term growth plans and, beyond the current buyback programme, will continue to assess its capital requirements in line with the current policy, including the return of excess capital to shareholders.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Outlook</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Group’s outlook for 2023, as set out in its recent Trading Update, remains unchanged and provides a strong platform for long-term investment and returns to shareholders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax continues to expect full year Adjusted EBITDA<sup>(1)</sup> for 2023 to be in line with analysts’ consensus estimates<sup>(2)</sup>, subject to continued good operational performance.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Webcast and presentation material </strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The event will be webcast from 2pm (UK) and the material made available on the Group’s website at that time. Joining instructions for the webcast and presentation are included in the links below.</p>

<h3><strong>Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said: </strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“In the first quarter of 2023, we have delivered a strong system support and generation performance, providing renewable, secure, dispatchable power for millions of homes and businesses across the UK.</p>
<p>“We remain excited about the opportunity to do BECCS in the UK. Whilst the project is not currently in the Track 1 process, we have commenced formal discussions with the Government to facilitate the transition to BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030.</p>
<p>“At the end of March, we formally closed the remaining two coal units at Drax Power Station. This is a significant moment for the business and I’d like to thank the many hundreds of people involved in making this happen and transforming Drax into a global leader in biomass power generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the US, we continue to make good progress screening options for over 10 BECCS projects which will deliver long-term, large-scale carbon removal.”</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Generation</strong></h3>
<p>Drax has continued to optimise generation across all four biomass units (ROC and CfD), based on system need and sustainable biomass supply. The Group’s biomass, pumped storage and hydro assets have continued to support UK security of supply, providing a wide range of system support services and renewable electricity generation, which included forward power sales from pumped storage in the first three months of 2023.</p>

<h4><u>Coal</u></h4>
<p>Following the completion of a “winter contingency” service agreement (October 2022 – March 2023) with National Grid, Drax has commenced the decommissioning of its two coal units. There was no coal generation during the agreement period.</p>
<h3><strong>Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) – UK </strong></h3>
<p>In March 2023, the UK Government provided an update on its plans for the deployment of carbon capture and storage infrastructure and projects. This confirmed that Power BECCS and certain other shortlisted projects were not included in the initial Track 1 process, which relates to projects targeting commissioning in the mid-2020s. The Government confirmed that during 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of Track 1 and has also launched a Track 2 process. Power BECCS is eligible for both tracks.</p>

<p>Alongside this update the Government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of large-scale Power BECCS projects by 2030. Drax has now commenced formal bilateral discussions with the Government to move the project at Drax Power Station forward and ensure that the Government is able to fulfil its restated commitment of achieving 5Mt pa of engineered Greenhouse Gas Removals by 2030. Drax believes that BECCS at Drax Power Station is the only project in the UK that can enable the Government to achieve this goal<sup>(6)</sup>. This process will also include discussion of a bridging mechanism for biomass power generation between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government has now published its response to the Power BECCS business model consultation, which took place in 2022, confirming its preference for the use of a CfD mechanism to remunerate renewable power and carbon removals in BECCS. The Government has also committed to publish its biomass strategy by the end of June 2023 which will set out how the technology could be deployed.</p>
<p>Drax’s plan of record for investment in UK BECCS was based on a first BECCS unit commissioning in 2027 and a second by 2030. Since Power BECCS is not currently in the Track 1 process and Government’s aim is to support BECCS by 2030, Drax has paused further investment in its UK BECCS project in 2023 and will revise its UK BECCS investment schedule subject to further clarity on support for BECCS at Drax Power Station.</p>
<h3><strong>Pellet Production</strong></h3>

<p>The Group’s sustainable biomass pellet business has continued to support efforts to optimise biomass power generation and security of supply in the UK. In the US, the focus has remained on ensuring the Demopolis plant reaches full capacity and reliable, safe operation.</p>
<p>As outlined in the 2022 Full Year Results (February 2023), inflationary pressures, primarily in transportation and utilities have contributed to an increase in pellet production costs. Taken together with costs incurred in providing supply-side flexibility, Drax continues to expect production costs to be higher in 2023.</p>
<p>While continuing to optimise its supply chain to maximise value for the Group, Drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce the cost of biomass.</p>
<h3><strong>Full Year Expectations</strong></h3>
<p>Reflecting these factors, Drax continues to expect full year Adjusted EBITDA<sup>(1) </sup>for 2023 to be in line with analysts’ consensus estimates<sup>(2)</sup>, subject to continued good operational performance.</p>
<p>Reflecting the reprofiling of investment in UK BECCS, Drax now expects capital investment in 2023 to be in the range of £520-580 million (was £570-630 million).</p>
<h3><strong>Capital Returns and Share Buyback Programme</strong></h3>
<p>In line with its capital allocation policy and reflecting (a) a strong net debt to Adjusted EBITDA position, (b) the revised timing of UK BECCS investment and (c) the mitigation of equity dilution associated with the vesting of share schemes<sup>(7)</sup>, the Group plans to return up to £150 million to shareholders via a share buyback programme. The programme is expected to commence in Q2 2023 and be completed by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>The programme is not expected to have any impact on the Group’s medium and long-term growth plans which continues to include UK BECCS, US BECCS, pellet plant and pumped storage hydro expansion.</p>
<p>The Group remains committed to its current capital allocation policy, which remains unchanged and, beyond the current buyback programme, will continue to assess its capital requirements in line with the current policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Other</strong></h3>
<p>Drax will host a Capital Markets Day on 23 May 2023, updating on its plans for growth with a focus on BECCS.</p>
<p>Drax will report its half year results on 27 July 2023.</p>

<li>As of 21 April 2023, analyst consensus for 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was £1,156 million, with a range of £1,100 – 1,200 million. The details of this company collected consensus are displayed on the Group’s website. <a href="https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Company_Collected_Consensus_April_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Company_Collected_Consensus_April_2023.pdf</a></li>
<li>Includes structured power sales in 2023 and 2024 (forward gas sales as a proxy for forward power), transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to forward power prices. 2024: 1.1TWh, 2025: 0.8TWh, presented net of cost of closing out gas positions at maturity and replacing with forward power sales.</li>
<li>Typical estimated annual biomass generation from ROC and CfD units c.13-14TWh based on estimated biomass availability, incrementally lower in 2023 due to major planned outages on two ROC units, resulting in lower ROC cap versus 2022.</li>
<li>2023 includes limited forward selling of pumped storage generation resulting in higher captured prices but lower system support availability.</li>
<li>Biomass is the only large-scale source of dispatchable, renewable electricity and Drax power station in Yorkshire is the largest provider of secure supply in the UK’s electricity system. Its renewable biomass generation provides 2.6GW of electricity, representing c.4% of the UK’s dispatchable capacity and supplies millions of homes and businesses with dispatchable, reliable power. BECCS at Drax Power Station is expected to be one of the world’s biggest engineered carbon removal projects, permanently removing 8Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere every year by 2030. The project would see the addition of post combustion carbon capture to two of the existing biomass units, using sustainable biomass and technology from Drax’s technology partner, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Captured CO<sub>2</sub> would be transported and permanently stored by the Group’s partners in the East Coast Cluster. <a href="https://www.vivideconomics.com/casestudy/capturing-carbon-at-drax-delivering-jobs-clean-growth-and-levelling-up-the-humber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivid Economics</a> concluded that it could deliver £370 million of economic benefit for the UK during construction, creating and supporting more than 10,000 jobs during peak construction. Recent <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-power-station-and-gb-power-supplies-at-risk-in-the-late-2020s-without-government-support-for-beccs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baringa research</a> also demonstrates that Drax is the UK’s largest source of energy security and will continue to play a vital role in the UK security of supply in to the late 2020s. Drax aims to source 80% of materials and services for the project from British businesses and is also working with British Steel to explore opportunities for its UK production facilities to supply a proportion of the steel needed for BECCS.</li>
<li>Of the total share options outstanding as at 31 March 2023 (18.6 million), an aggregate number of approximately 9.4 million are expected to vest in 2023 under the Company’s various share plans. This includes approximately 6.8 million under the all-UK employee Sharesave Plan which matures in June 2023 when the three-year savings contract period concludes for approximately 900 participating employees. More information on outstanding awards and associated share-based payments can be found in note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022.</li>
