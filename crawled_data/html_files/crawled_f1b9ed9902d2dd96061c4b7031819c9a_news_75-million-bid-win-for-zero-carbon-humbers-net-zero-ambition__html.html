      </div>      <div class="caption w-full md:w-3/4">Humber Bridge</div>      <div class="articleBody w-full md:w-3/4">        <div class="body-content old-content"><p>The Humber’s news is further boosted by a successful bid from the ‘Northern Endurance Partnership’ (NEP) which provides the offshore pipeline and safe storage for emissions captured both in the Humber and in Teesside, which was also successful in a separate bid. The three projects total nearly £240m of private and public funding to decarbonise the North East of England and potentially around 50% of the UK’s industrial carbon emissions.</p>
<p>In October 2020, twelve leading companies and organisations across the Humber jointly submitted a £75 million bid, with more than two-thirds privately funded, to accelerate decarbonisation in the UK’s most carbon-intensive industrial region, helping to support clean growth, future-proof vital industries and protect and create new jobs.</p>
<p>The ZCH Partnership’s plan could help the region reach net zero by 2040 through low carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and carbon removal technology. This will be enabled by a shared pipeline network to carry hydrogen to industrial customers and remove carbon dioxide from power generation and industrial emitters, transporting it to permanent storage in an offshore aquifer in the UK’s Southern North Sea via pipelines developed by NEP, serving both ZCH and Net Zero Teesside (NZT).</p>

[caption id="attachment_832" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZCH_Key_visual_3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-832 size-large" src="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZCH_Key_visual_3-1024x545.jpg" alt="Spurn Point Lighthouse" width="1024" height="545" /></a> Click to view/download[/caption]

<p>The ZCH proposals alone could reduce the UK’s annual industrial cluster emissions by around 37% and safeguard 55,000 existing jobs in the region, whilst creating thousands of new STEM roles and developing skills, apprenticeships and educational opportunities in the area. It will also help to secure the future for the Humber’s traditional heavy industry and related supply chains by enabling decarbonisation and creating opportunities for growth in new technologies.</p>
<p>The ZCH Partnership includes Associated British Ports, British Steel, Centrica Storage Ltd, Drax Group, Equinor, Mitsubishi Power, National Grid Ventures, px Group, SSE Thermal, Saltend Cogeneration Company Limited, Uniper, and the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC).</p>
<p>The public funding to the ZCH Partnership is from Phase 2 of the Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge, which forms part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, while the private funding comes from the companies within the ZCH Partnership.</p>

[caption id="attachment_845" align="aligncenter" width="10602"]<a href="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_10_05_drax_zch_isometricmap_RGB_print.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-845" src="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_10_05_drax_zch_isometricmap_RGB_print.jpg" alt="Zero Carbon Humber map" width="10602" height="5335" /></a> [Click to view/download][/caption]

<p>The ZCH bid’s anchor project is the Equinor-led Hydrogen to Humber (H2H) Saltend proposal, which will establish the world’s largest hydrogen production plant with carbon capture on the Humber’s north bank. H2H Saltend will convert natural gas to hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the process. In the first phase, this could reduce emissions by circa 900,000 tonnes per year as industrial customers at px Group’s Saltend Chemicals Park switch fuel to low-carbon hydrogen while Triton Power’s gas power plant blends hydrogen into the fuel supply of its converted Mitsubishi turbines. H2H Saltend is expected to grow over time, contributing to further emissions reductions from the Chemicals Park and across the Humber.</p>

[caption id="attachment_860" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.-Producing-low-carbon-hydrogen-fuel_RGB_V7_-1024x742.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-860" src="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.-Producing-low-carbon-hydrogen-fuel_RGB_V7_-1024x742-1024x742.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="742" /></a> [Click to view/download][/caption]

<p>A pipeline network, developed by National Grid Ventures, will link H2H Saltend to energy-intensive industrial sites throughout the region, to enable further decarbonisation from projects across the Humber through the capture of at least 17 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year and the supply of up to 10 gigawatts of hydrogen by the mid-2030s. The CO<sub>2</sub> will be compressed at Centrica Storage’s Easington site and stored under the Southern North Sea using offshore infrastructure developed by <a href="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/news/northern-endurance-partnership/">NEP</a> (in which Equinor and National Grid are two of the partners) and shared with NZT (in which Equinor is a partner). Net Zero Teesside and the Northern Endurance Partnership made separate bids to the same fund but are closely aligned due to their shared offshore infrastructure and storage options.</p>

<p>The matched funding to ZCH covers obtaining land rights, development consents and front-end engineering design for H2H Saltend and the onshore pipeline infrastructure for CO2 and hydrogen, enabling the scheme to move towards a final investment decision on construction during 2023, with H2H Saltend and associated infrastructure expected to come online around 2026.</p>
<p>At Selby in North Yorkshire, Drax Power Station would connect to the completed CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline network, underpinning the ZCH scheme with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – a vital negative emissions technology that Drax is pioneering and which will be essential to decarbonising the Humber Cluster and helping the UK achieve its legally binding 2050 net zero carbon target. Drax has started the planning process to develop BECCS and its first unit could be operational in 2027, delivering the UK’s largest carbon capture project.</p>

<p>The pipeline network will also run via SSE Thermal’s Keadby site, where it is developing Keadby 3. This could become the UK’s first gas-fired power station equipped with carbon capture technology by the mid-2020s, providing decarbonised flexible power to complement intermittent renewables generation and maintain security of supply. The network will also run via Immingham, where Uniper is planning to add to its European hydrogen ambitions by developing clean hydrogen production at its Killingholme site, in line with Uniper’s pledge to be carbon neutral in Europe by 2035.</p>
<p>As one of the UK’s leading steel manufacturers, and a significant local employer, British Steel could benefit from the ZCH infrastructure as part of its drive to lower emissions. ABP, the major ports and logistics provider for the region,  will support the global reach of the low carbon products and chemicals produced at Scunthorpe and at Saltend.</p>
<p>The ZCH projects are supported by the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, which will work with its sister centre, the Nuclear AMRC, to support the anchoring of supply chain opportunities in the UK provided by these new technologies. Both centres are part of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult.</p>
<p>In addition to the key sites that are part of the ZCH scheme, there is further potential for other future projects to attract inward investment and cement the Humber’s reputation as the UK’s Energy Estuary and a world-leading net zero region. These include integrating offshore wind power into hydrogen production, decarbonising the regional gas grid, supplying hydrogen transport fuelling hubs, providing links to CO<sub>2</sub> storage services to other industrial clusters and creating the world’s first sustainable maritime refuelling port.</p>

<p>“Triton Power is delighted that the government (via Innovate UK) has seen the unbelievable potential for the Humber to take centre stage in the country’s transition to net zero. Converting our turbine generators to burn hydrogen and then provide cogeneration to our customers at the chemicals park is both strategically right but also deliverable due to the skills and infrastructure that is unique to our partnership. We have often seen new initiatives fail due to lack of commitment and private sector investment but this time I feel the energy building around this exciting opportunity!”</p>

<h3>Mike Lockett, Uniper UK Country Chairman and Chief Commercial Officer Power, commented:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is really great news for the Humber region and the project partners’ decarbonisation plans in the area. We know that hydrogen and the decarbonisation of industrial clusters, will be crucial to the UK’s commitment to reach net-zero by 2050; the Zero Carbon Humber project will provide the infrastructure that enables Uniper’s ambitions for the development of clean hydrogen production at our Killingholme site.”</p>

<h3>Ben Morgan, Research Director of University of Sheffield AMRC, said:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The successful award of this £75m project represents a huge vote of confidence in the Humber region and the wider North of England. We are pleased that the ambition of this project to support the net zero agenda and our collective capability to build back greener has been recognised. The AMRC is looking forward to engaging local supply chains and enabling growth of high value jobs through the programme. The hard work in earnest starts now and we hope that a successful outcome of the project will make an important step toward levelling up the economy.”</p>
