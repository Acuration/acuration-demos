					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Department for Energy Security &#038; Net Zero (“DESNZ”) has, as part of a market update to the sector, set out an indicative position that large-scale Power BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) projects be eligible to participate in an expansion of the Track-1 carbon cluster sequencing process. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the update, DESNZ set out its draft expectation to run the Track-1 extension and Track-2 processes in parallel, subject to T&amp;S capacity and ministerial sign off. Following the designation of the Viking CCS cluster as a Track-2 cluster in July 2023, there are now two potential routes which could support the Drax Power Station BECCS project and wider CCS in the Humber region by 2030 – the East Coast Cluster and Viking CCS cluster.</p>
<p>DESNZ also set out an indicative timeline that shortlisted projects would commence negotiations from Autumn 2024. DESNZ will now receive feedback on its draft proposals pending further updates and the publication of final guidance in due course.</p>
<h3>Will Gardiner, Drax CEO, said:</h3>
<blockquote><p>“The Government’s statements are a helpful step forward not just for BECCS in the UK, but for the wider fight against climate change. We can only reach net zero by investing in critical, new green technologies such as BECCS. I welcome the Government’s draft position and urge them to progress with both Track-1 expansion and Track-2 processes in parallel this winter”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Separately, in August 2023 the UK Government published a Biomass Strategy which set out its position on the use of biomass in the UK’s plans for delivering net zero. The Biomass Strategy outlined the potential “<em>extraordinary”</em> role which biomass can play across the economy in power, heating and transport, including a priority role for BECCS, which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide large-scale carbon dioxide removals. This is in addition to formal bilateral discussions between Drax and the Government in relation to a potential bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS at Drax Power Station.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scotland’s ambitious plan to expand its wind capacity­ and reach net zero by 2045 will require greater levels of energy storage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Plans to expand the storage and generation capacity of Cruachan pumped storage hydro station from 440 MW to over 1 GW can help support a re­­newable future</strong></li>
<li><strong>Greater levels of energy storage can also reduce the costs of operating the grid and enable the greater utilisation of renewable electricity sources such as wind.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Expansion plans for Cruachan would bring as many as 900 jobs during the construction phase across the supply chain and continue Drax’s commitment to local communities and environments</strong></li>
<li><strong>The project is a large-scale and long-term infrastructure solution to some of the critical issues faced by Scotland’s electricity network.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The hit Star Wars TV series <em>Andor </em>might be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but audiences in Argyll and Brute may recognise a local landmark on the titular distant planet.</p>
<p>Cruachan Power Station’s 316-metre-long buttress-style dam served as a setting for the space thriller. However, here on planet Earth, it has another big role to play in supporting Scotland and the UK’s efforts to reach net zero emissions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/power-generation/what-is-pumped-storage-hydro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pumped storage hydro</a> station, known as the ‘Hollow Mountain’, complements Scotland’s wider strategy to expand its onshore wind capacity to 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. The plant’s ability to absorb excess electricity at times of low demand, and discharge it again when needed, allows it to play a key role in balancing and supporting the national transmission system.</p>
<p>As Scotland and the rest of the UK move to a future increasingly powered by intermittent renewables, ambitious plans to <a href="https://www.drax.com/about-us/our-projects/cruachan-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase Cruachan’s capacity</a> to more than 1GW, will also help create jobs in Argyll and Bute and support communities through the net zero transition.</p>
<h2><strong>Scotland’s wind power potential </strong></h2>
<p>Scotland’s famously blustery, wet weather and dramatic landscapes of mountains and lochs has long enabled it to pioneer hydro schemes along its rivers, pumped storage hydro on its mountainsides, and wind turbines on and offshore.</p>
<p>Wind power contributed heavily to Scotland achieving <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-56530424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97% renewable electricity generation in 2020</a>. And with more than <a href="https://www.scottishrenewables.com/our-industry/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 GW of additional capacity</a> in the pipeline, Scotland has the potential to be the wind powerhouse of the UK – in 2021, Scotland <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1126101/Regional_electricity_generation_and_supply_2017-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exported 33% of its generation in net transfers</a> to England and Northern Ireland, having previously set a record 37.3% in 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631.jpeg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-6229" src="https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="1801" height="1201" srcset="https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-1920x1280.jpeg 1920w, https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-480x320.jpeg 480w, https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/09/AdobeStock_95148631-150x100.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1801px) 100vw, 1801px" /></a></p>
<p>However, simply <em>generating </em>a lot of power isn’t the whole story. Generating too much power can even be a problem for grids if there is nowhere for that power to go. Currently, constraints in the transmission system limit how much power can be exported from Scotland to meet demand in other parts of the UK.</p>
<p>When generators start producing these surpluses, the grid operator has to pay wind farms to turn them off. It’s estimated that wind curtailment costs added <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/cost-of-turning-off-uk-wind-farms-reached-record-high-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">£806m to energy bills in Britain</a> in 2020 and 2021. This is where energy storage comes in, offering somewhere for power to be redirected and reducing curtailment costs.</p>
<p>Enter Cruachan. At maximum load Cruachan Power Station can generate 440 MW, enough to power 1 million homes, when water from the upper reservoir is released, flowing through the plant’s four turbines, and entering Loch Awe below. But when there is more electricity on the system than demand, excess electricity can be used to power turbines that pump water up from Loch Awe to the upper reservoir where it’s stored until needed.</p>
<p>Pumped storage hydro, as this system is called, offers long-term, large-scale energy storage to the UK’s electricity system, helping to reduce costs and prepare for a renewable-led future.</p>
<h2><strong>The large-scale, long-term storage solution </strong></h2>
<p>Since opening in the 1960s Cruachan has only become more important in helping to stabilise an increasingly renewable UK, while <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/why-spin-a-turbine-without-generating-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplying ancillary services like inertia to the grid</a>. The Cruachan expansion plan to expand the facility and bring its ability to absorb and discharge electricity to more than 1 GW can offer a host of benefits to the grid and power to consumers across the country.</p>

<p>Cruachan’s ability to reach full generating capacity in less than 30 seconds means that it can respond quickly to fluctuations in supply and demand. When Cruachan provides power back to the system in times of high demand, it can in turn lead to lower peak power prices. This becomes even more important at a time of high gas prices, when ordinary consumers are feeling the impact of rising energy costs more than ever.</p>
<p>Increasing Cruachan’s capacity to generate and absorb power can help reduce transmission system costs and wind curtailment. It also offers a zero-carbon source of stabilising ancillary services to the grid, which have historically been provided by gas generators. As the proportion of gas generation decreases and the proportion of intermittent renewables generation increases, low-carbon generators that are able to provide these services will become increasingly more important.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Cruachan expansion is a long-term solution. The expanded facility would have an operational life span of more than half a century, significantly longer than the 10-15 years offered by lithium-ion battery storage solutions.</p>
<p>However, there is a need for a financial mechanism to de-risk the project for investors and offer value for money for consumers. The <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/getting-britain-ready-for-the-next-generation-of-energy-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cap and floor mechanism</a>, which ensures generating revenues remain within a specific range, is currently used for interconnectors to stabilise revenues by offering sufficient certainty to investors that income will cover the cost of debt, which unlocks finance for new projects. A similar mechanism could be introduced to support energy storage technologies that will be needed to support a renewable future, such as the Cruachan expansion. The UK government must act quickly to implement the mechanism and realise the opportunity that storage can provide to the UK and Scotland.</p>
<h2><strong>Making the Cruachan expansion a reality  </strong></h2>
<p>Expanding Cruachan is a long-term, large-scale project that will create a range of jobs and economic benefits and help support the local economy through the transition to net zero.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe loading="lazy" title="What Is Cruachan 2" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/710423009?h=e71b26e011&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<blockquote><p>“I am absolutely delighted that Drax is progressing plans to expand the Ben Cruachan site,” <strong>says Jenni Minto, Member of Scottish Parliament.</strong> “This will not only support 900 jobs and create a pumped storage facility that will be able to provide enough renewable energy to power a million homes, it will provide £165 million benefit to the local economy during construction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to 150 on-site local construction jobs, the project’s supply chain will create opportunities across a range of industries, from quarrying and engineering, to transport and hospitality.</p>
<blockquote><p> “The Cruachan extension is a really exciting project and one that’s really important for Scotland.” <strong>says Claire Mack, CEO Scottish Renewables.</strong> “It brings together a number of our really important skills, including civil engineering and electrical engineering. What we really want to see is a renewables industry that’s thriving but also driving economic gain in Scotland.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cruachan has operated in the region for more than half a century and has supported local communities through more than just job creation. This includes a donation to <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/press_release/drax-donates-2500-to-set-up-new-community-space-in-oban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rockfield Centre in Oban</a> to help fund a new community hub, offering education as well as a social space. Following Cruachan’s appearance in <em>Andor,</em> Drax also made a five-figure donation to several charities and good causes across Argyll, including <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/press_release/power-stationss-blockbusting-support-for-argyll-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oban Mountain Rescue’s efforts to create a rural defibrillator network</a>.</p>
<p>As well as lending a helping hand to local communities, Cruachan’s teams have always taken precautions to minimise any impact on the natural environment and <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/sustainable-business/cruachan-power-station-protecting-biodiversity-while-generating-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preserve the area’s biodiversity</a> and natural beauty.</p>
<p>The Cruachan expansion is an engineering project on an epic scale. It will involve carving huge new underground caverns, tunnels, and waterways out of the rock below Ben Cruachan. But in doing so it will create long-term opportunities for the local community and a key piece of infrastructure to take Scotland into a net zero future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>What is the carbon cycle? </strong></h2>
<p>All living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another. Most carbon is stored in rock and sediment, but it’s also found in soil, oceans, and the atmosphere, and is produced by all living organisms – including plants, animals, and humans.</p>
<p>Carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations, also known as reservoirs, on Earth. They do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis, the decomposition and respiration of living organisms, and the eruption of volcanoes.</p>
<p>As our planet is a closed system, the overall amount of carbon doesn’t change. However, the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir, including the atmosphere, can and does change, as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"></div>
<h2><strong>What is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>Carbon exists in many different forms, including the <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-carbon-dioxide/">colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a><sub>. </sub>During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the sun, water through their roots, and CO<sub>2</sub> from the air – converting them into oxygen and glucose.</p>
<p>The oxygen is then released back into the air, while the carbon is stored in glucose<sub>,</sub> and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem, branches, leaves, and roots. Plants also release CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere through respiration.</p>
<p>Animals – including humans – who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes. The cells in the human body then break down the glucose, with CO<sub>2 </sub>emitted as a waste product as we exhale.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is also produced when plants and animals die and <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/carbon-capture/can-carbon-capture-take-the-uk-beyond-net-zero/#chapter-2">are broken down</a> by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the fast carbon cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>The natural process of plants and animals releasing CO<sub>2 </sub>into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle. Biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism. This cycle also incorporates CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed and released by the world’s oceans.</p>
<p>The biogenic carbon cycle is also called the “fast” carbon cycle, as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly. There are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter06_FINAL.pdf">Reservoir turnover times</a> – a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location – range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the slow carbon cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>In some circumstances, plant and animal remains can become fossilised. This process, which takes millions of years, eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels. Coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock. And we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was, over time, buried by sediment.</p>
<p>The rocks and sedimentary layers where coal, crude oil, and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle. From this cycle, carbon is returned to the atmosphere through, for example, volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks. In the slow carbon cycle, reservoir turnover times exceed 10,000 years and can stretch to millions of years.</p>
<h2><strong>How do humans impact the carbon cycle? </strong></h2>
<p>Left to its own devices, Earth can keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels balanced, with similar amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> released into and absorbed from the air. Carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time. However, human activity has upset this natural equilibrium.</p>
<p>Burning fossil fuel releases carbon that’s been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years, transferring it from the slow to the fast (biogenic) carbon cycle. This influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2, </sub>that the biogenic carbon cycle can’t cope with.</p>
<p>As a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the Earth and its atmosphere, CO<sub>2</sub> is essential to human existence. Without CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, the planet could become too cold to sustain life.</p>
<p>However, the drastic increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between Earth and the atmosphere. This has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature, a development that is part<a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-business/what-is-climate-change/"> of climate change</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle? </strong></h2>
<p>One way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, including <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-bioenergy/what-is-biomass/">sustainably sourced biomass</a>. Feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material, wood, and forest residue – organic matter that absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> as part of the biogenic carbon cycle. When the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation, the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>This is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil, gas, and coal. The addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy – creating <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/">BECCS</a> – means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered, permanently removing it from the atmosphere. By capturing CO<sub>2</sub> and transporting it to geological formations – such as porous rocks – for permanent storage, BECCS moves CO<sub>2 </sub>from the fast to the slow carbon cycle.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of burning fossil fuels, which takes carbon out of geological formations (the slow carbon cycle) and emits it into the atmosphere (the fast carbon cycle). Because BECCS removes more carbon than it emits, it delivers negative emissions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15471" src="https://www.drax.com/uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2022/05/PromPart-UoN-3.jpg" alt="" width="5293" height="1039" /></p>
<h2><strong>Fast facts </strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Key takeaways </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Since 2021, there has been a sharp rise in the price of electricity, driven by a steep increase in wholesale gas prices in Europe in particular. </strong></li>
<li><strong>A number of factors, including the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of the war in Ukraine have contributed to driving gas prices to record highs. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The volatility of gas prices means the UK needs to find replacements for the role of gas in helping to balance the electricity grid. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Biomass and pumped storage hydro have the capacity to provide reliable, renewable energy to UK homes and businesses, while contributing to keeping the grid stable.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Great Britain, and many other parts of the world, are in a phase of energy uncertainty. Since 2021, soaring power prices have caused energy bills to <a href="https://reports.electricinsights.co.uk/q2-2022/the-cost-of-energy-crisis/">escalate as much as five-fold</a> and led to a string of collapses of UK energy suppliers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As of October 2022, the annual energy bill for a UK household with “typical” energy consumption has been capped at £2,500 a year –  <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9491/">96% higher than the winter 2021/22 price cap</a> – the upper limits the rates suppliers can charge for their default tariffs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of energy to end consumers would be even higher were it not for this energy price guarantee introduced by the UK government on 1 October and currently due to be in place until 31 March 2023. In Germany, the government has <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-agrees-200-billion-euro-defence-shield-against-soaring-energy-prices">committed €200 billion</a> towards a ‘defensive shield’ against surging energy prices, while France has capped energy price increases at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/26/france-budget-shield-energy-price-shocks">4% for 2022 and 15% from January 2023</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The primary factor in this change is the rise in natural gas prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Periods of turbulence driven by commodity prices emphasises the need for a diverse, secure supply of power generation available to the UK grid. As the energy system works through the necessary transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources, the need for a reliable, low-carbon, affordable power becomes even greater.<img class="size-full wp-image-16124" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" srcset=" 2560w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-1024x513.jpeg 1024w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-1536x769.jpeg 1536w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-2048x1025.jpeg 2048w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-1920x961.jpeg 1920w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-480x240.jpeg 480w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-150x75.jpeg 150w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_95919816-1198x600.jpeg 1198w" alt="" width="2560" height="1282" /></p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What’s driving up gas prices?</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the world went into lockdown in 2020 the demand for energy, including gas, dropped – and so did supply. When countries began to emerge from lockdown in 2021 and economies started to reboot, supply struggled to keep up with renewed demand, triggering a rise in the price of wholesale gas, and other fuels. The cold winter in 2020-2021 and unusually hot summers in 2021 and 2022 also dented European gas storage levels, further contributing to rising gas prices.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> </strong>An already uncertain energy market was further destabilised by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was particularly true in Europe, (most notably Germany) where Russian gas at the time accounted for <a href="https://reports.electricinsights.co.uk/q2-2022/the-cost-of-energy-crisis/">around 40% of total gas consumption</a>. Gas prices began increase rapidly as a result of factors including fears that Russia would restrict the supply of gas to Europe in response to sanctions against the country, or that an embargo on Russian gas would be introduced.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Constrained gas supplies also increased global demand for alternative sources like liquified natural gas (LNG) imports, which account for about 22% of the UK’s gas. This increase in demand has pushed up the price of these alternatives, forcing countries to compete to attract supplies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are several reasons why higher gas prices have such a significant impact on UK energy prices. Firstly, a considerable proportion of UK electricity comes from gas. In the second quarter of 2022, gas represented <a href="https://reports.electricinsights.co.uk/q2-2022/capacity-and-production-statistics-20/">42% of the UK energy mix</a>, making it the country’s single largest source of electricity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The UK also relies heavily on gas to heat its homes. And with those homes being some of the oldest and least energy-efficient in Europe, it takes more gas to heat them up and keep them warm.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The role of biomass and pumped storage hydro in ensuring security of supply</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the pressures placed on gas and electricity supplies since 2021, the UK’s journey to net zero depends on increasing reliance on intermittent sources of power, such as wind and solar. As such, there is a renewed need to ensure a diverse range of power generation sources to secure electricity supply globally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As gas becomes less economical, biomass offers a renewable reliable, dispatchable source of power that can <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/great-balancing-act-takes-keep-power-grid-stable/">balance the grid</a> and supply baseload power regardless of weather conditions.</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-14429" class="wp-caption-text">The Turbine Hall at Cruachan Power Station</p>
</div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our four 645 MW biomass-fuelled generating turbines at Drax Power Station make it the largest single renewable source of power in the UK. The plant can produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of five million homes come rain or shine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax’s <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/what-is-pumped-storage-hydro/">Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station</a> in the Scottish Highlands also offers National Grid the capacity to store 440 MW of renewable power. By absorbing excess electricity from zero carbon sources, like wind and solar, Cruachan can store and deploy power when the grid needs it most.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of pumped storage hydro and biomass plants to store energy and quickly adjust output as required will become ever more important as the UK’s use of renewables grows and there are fewer spinning turbines connected to the grid.  As renewable, non-intermittent sources of electricity, biomass and pumped storage hydro are central to a safe, economic, and stable electricity grid – and to the UK’s low-carbon energy future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Angela Hepworth, Commercial Director, Drax </strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>In brief:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACS) at scale. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market is developing a set of Core Carbon Principles (CCPs). </strong></li>
<li><strong>Drax support proposed principals if they’re applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Standards around additionality and the permeance of carbon removals may apply very differently to nature-based and engineered removals, something that needs to be addressed explicitly. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s growing recognition, in governments and environmental organisations, of the urgent need to develop high-integrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective Paris-aligned climate goals.</p>
<p>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (<a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BECCS</a>), and direct air carbon capture and storage (<a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-direct-air-carbon-capture-and-storage-dacs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DACS</a>) are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely. The technology is proven, developers are bringing forward projects, and the most forward-thinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from BECCS and DACS developers.</p>
<p>Yet there’s a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals.</p>
<p>Drax is a world-leader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions. Our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of high-integrity, permanent CO<sub>2</sub> removals by 2030 from its BECCS projects in the U.K. and the U.S. We support the development of rigorous standards for CO<sub>2</sub> removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the CO<sub>2</sub> removals they’re buying. Such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to.</p>
<p>However, the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits, rather than removals. To create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale, re-thinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Carbon Removals by Drax [60s/16x9]" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/752019011?h=c9568c8e57&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Core Carbon Principles</strong></h2>
<p>The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market is in the process of developing a set of <a href="https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) and Assessment Framework (AF)</a> intended to set new threshold standards for high-quality carbon credits.</p>
<p>At Drax, we welcome and support the principals proposed by the Integrity Council. However, it’s crucial they’re applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals, and support rather than prevent their development.</p>
<p>Many CCPs are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies. Among the most important principals include those stating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removals must be robustly quantified, with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made.</li>
<li>Key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity, while safeguarding commercially sensitive information.</li>
<li>Removal credits should be subject to robust, independent third-party validation and verification.</li>
<li>Credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits.</li>
<li>Registries must be subject to appropriate governance, to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome.</li>
<li>Removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability, taking account of impacts on nature, the climate and society.</li>
<li>There should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates, or between countries. Bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel, and that the Article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldn’t trigger corresponding adjustments to countries’ carbon inventories.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>However, as pioneers in the field, we believe that two of the Core Carbon Principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Supporting additionality and development incentives </strong></h2>
<p>The CCPs state: “The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional, i.e., they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues.”</p>
<p>Engineered carbon removal credits such as BECCS and DACS are by their nature additional. They are developed for the specific purpose of removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere. They also rely on revenue from carbon markets – largely the voluntary market at present, but potentially compliance markets such as the U.K. and E.U. ETS in the future.</p>
<p>However, most early projects are likely to have some form of Government support (e.g., 45Q in the U.S., or Contracts for Difference in the U.K.) from outside carbon credit revenues. But that support isn’t intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment – project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets.</p>
<p>Engineered carbon removals have high up-front capital costs, and it’s clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable.</p>
<p>Additionality assessments should be risk-based. If it’s clear that a technology-type is additional, a technology-level assessment should be sufficient. This should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects.</p>

<h2><strong>Compensating against non-permanent storage </strong></h2>
<p>On the topic of permeance that CCPs state: “The GHG emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent, or if they have a risk of reversal, any reversals shall be fully compensated.”  A key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal. <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/how-do-you-store-co2-and-what-happens-to-it-when-you-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small</a>.</p>
<p>The risk of reversal for nature-based credits, by contrast, is much greater. Schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for nature-based credits, are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals.</p>
<p>Requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool, potentially as much as 10%, are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a well-manged geological store. They also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place.</p>
<p>Any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators. Similarly, where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with CO<sub>2</sub> storage risk, which place liabilities on storage owners, operators, or governments, the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them, and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers.</p>
<p>At Drax, we believe the CCPs provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals. If applied pragmatically, they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product they’re buying and provide a clear framework for project developers. They can ensure that standards support, rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as BECCS and DACS, which are essential to achieving our global climate goals.</p>

<h2><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h2>
<div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Drax, we have a long-lasting commitment to promoting Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) education in the Yorkshire and Humber region and beyond.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering the <a href="https://www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk/">Zero Carbon Humber</a> and the <a href="https://eastcoastcluster.co.uk/">East Coast Cluster</a> initiatives means that we will need a highly skilled labour force to help us reach the region’s goal of building the world’s first <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-net-zero/">net zero industrial region</a>. In practice, this will create roughly 50,000 new jobs in the region – requiring a workforce who are proficient in new and emerging low carbon technologies.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">But investing time and resources into local education is about more than just preparing for the energy transition. It’s about working with our local communities to build a longer term support framework for them and helping to support social mobility from primary school upwards.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Businesses in education </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have a responsibility to be a good neighbour, support education in our local area, to help secure our talent pipeline, and provide inspiration.</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-15147" class="wp-caption-text">Bruce Heppenstall Drax Plant Director, Lewis Marron, Drax 4th Year Apprentice, and Liz Ridley Deputy Principal at Selby College.</p>
</div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One way we’re helping to develop the next generation of green economy colleagues is through our partnership with nearby Selby College. In 2020, <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-to-boost-skills-and-training-with-five-year-selby-college-partnership/">we announced</a> a £180,000 five-year partnership with the college, aimed at supporting education and skills. Last year, we expanded our partnership even further and developed <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/selby-college-and-drax-secure-funding-to-support-the-green-workforce-of-the-future/">the UK’s first educational programmes</a> dedicated to carbon capture.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Working together, we secured more than £270,000 in funding from the government for the programme, enabling the college to create a new training course in <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-carbon-capture-usage-and-storage/">carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS)</a> technologies. Our engineers work closely with the college, developing a syllabus that will equip both current and future Drax employees with the vital skills needed to operate negative emissions technology.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This even includes a rig that mirrors the CCUS equipment used in our <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/">bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)</a> pilot, giving students the chance to work with real equipment rather than just the theory. We believe that by showing students the kind of work we do on-site we can give them a deeper understanding of how we operate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education highlighted the success of our partnership as an example of how business and education can work together – something I believe is crucial to bridging the emerging low carbon skills gap.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The skills gap and future STEM workers </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our work with Selby College has highlighted the significant need to educate and upskill the UK’s workforce in low carbon technologies as quickly as possible. Although most organisations recognise the need to decarbonise, they are uncertain about what they and their employees need to do to achieve this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of conversations about the need for green skills and re-skilling employees in carbon-intensive sectors but to put a real definition on what’s needed is a lot harder. Every company must examine its business plan and try to unpick what skills they will need in 10, 20, or even 50 years down the line – and in such a fast moving world this can prove to be a real challenge.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Drax, we’re committed to building on <a href="https://www.drax.com/about-us/corporate-governance/our-vision-and-values/">our values</a>, as an innovative and best in class place where we care about what matters. We aim to do this by identifying training needs that are linked with new technologies beyond just BECCS, and working together with educators to make sure the relevant courses can either be distributed to other SMEs and large companies or adapted to help retrain people in other sectors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our commitment to STEM and education starts with young people and a hands-on curriculum delivered by our engineers to help support teachers. We want to develop deeper, more impactful education programmes that offer them multiple interactions with Drax, our engineers and operations throughout a person’s education.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In my role, you don’t always see the immediate impact. However, when you start talking to people, you realise that you’ve impacted them at some stage on their career journey. That impact is what’s really important to us and to building a net zero Humber.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Long duration energy storage is vital for Britain’s energy security, and the next Tory leader must urgently respond to industry proposals to grow the market, writes Drax CEO Will Gardiner</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">For many years energy security was an issue resolved by complex, continent-wide gas pipelines which stretched from Russia into the heart of Europe.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We now know this reliance on Russian gas didn’t strengthen Europe’s energy security – in fact it weakened it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The UK is less reliant on foreign gas than many countries in Europe in part due to the renewables revolution which has transformed our energy system over the last decade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rollout of biomass, wind and solar power has enabled the UK to decarbonise its power grid at a faster rate than any other major economy. And in order to reduce energy bills in the years ahead we need to have more clean, green, renewable power, which is generated in the UK for the UK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Getting more green energy onto the grid can only be achieved through partnerships between government and private companies. For businesses like Drax, that means having the right policies now, to make large-scale investment decisions for the future, in vital green energy technologies like pumped storage hydro and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax has submitted planning applications for two major infrastructure projects designed to deliver both of these vital technologies in the 2020s. They form part of a £3bn investment strategy which Drax stands ready to implement this decade, underlining the company’s significant role as a growing, global business at the heart of the green energy transition.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside strengthening the UK’s long-term energy security, these projects will support thousands of jobs and provide a real opportunity for economic growth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We aim to double the capacity of our Cruachan pumped hydro storage facility in Scotland, supporting energy security and further decarbonisation of the grid, at lower costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two years, due to bottlenecks on the transmission system and a lack of energy storage capacity, enough wind power to supply 800,000 homes each year with renewable electricity, went to waste.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As household bills and global temperatures continue to rise, we can’t afford to let renewable power go to waste like this. We need more storage to harness the wind power available now, as well as the increased capacity being developed the coming years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The only proven grid scale technology that can store vast quantities of energy for long durations is pumped storage hydro. Sites like Cruachan act like giant water batteries, using excess power from the grid to pump water to an upper reservoir where it is stored, before re-releasing it to generate electricity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While the UK’s policy and market support mechanisms have evolved to support new build renewables, the current framework isn’t suitable for pumped storage projects that can have a lifespan of many decades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax’s plans would enable more homegrown renewable power to come online to strengthen the UK’s energy security and lower carbon emissions. This additional capacity could be available within eight years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To secure private investment in these projects, get shovels in the ground and work underway, developers need to know the policy environment they will be operating in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Abandoning or delaying net zero will not save the country money, it will increase our reliance on foreign gas, leaving households at the mercy of international markets which no UK government can control.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In Scotland alone there is more than 4.3 GW of storage projects in planning or awaiting construction – this is enough capacity to power around three million homes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax, alongside the developers of some of these other projects, has put forward plans for policies which would create the certainty needed to incentivise investment and kick start work to build the storage capacity this country needs for energy security.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These include introducing a cap and floor regime &#8211; the same support mechanism which was instrumental in the successful roll-out of interconnectors in Britain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I urge the new Conservative Party leader to make the government’s response to these proposals a priority, as part of the package of measures needed to bolster the UK’s long term energy security and to bring the longer-term cost of energy down.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With the right policies to unlock investment, the UK can lead the world in energy storage technologies which are urgently needed to keep the lights on, cut carbon emissions and keep us on track to reach net zero.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 1990 and Chris Waddle, England midfielder, steps up to the penalty spot. The 60,000 people in Turin’s Stadio delle Alpi watching him and the fate of England football go silent.</p>
<p>He takes a breath and fires a shot at Bodo Illgner, the German goalkeeper. It careers over the crossbar and misses – England are out of the World Cup. The now famous image of Paul Gascoigne crying into his shirt is beamed across millions of UK television screens.</p>
<p>There’s a shuffling on the sofas in front of those TVs as the population gets up to make a cup of tea, get a drink or turn on the oven. Millions of kettles, lights and fridges are powered up as the country collectively despairs. The demand for electricity across the country soars.<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgofwp0my/images/w_500,h_281/v1475159161/biggest_tv_moments_kettle-1_c8fh3f/biggest_tv_moments_kettle-1_c8fh3f.gif" alt="kettle boiling" width="500" height="281" />This is what’s called a ‘TV pickup’ – the moment during a popular television event when there’s a break and viewers unwittingly cause a huge surge of demand from the National Grid.</p>
<p>It’s these moments that have caused some of the biggest spikes in UK electricity demand. Here we look at what’s caused them:</p>
<h3>One:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> Football World Cup Semi Final: England v West Germany<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Wednesday, 4 July 1990<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 2,800MW – equivalent to 1,120,000 kettles (based on 1MW = 400 kettles), or 4.3 Drax-sized generation units (there are six 645MW units at Drax)</p>
<p>After that fateful penalty miss the population made for the kitchen. The match was watched by an estimated 26 million people in the UK, and when full time was called they caused a 2,800MW surge in electricity demand.</p>
<h3>Two:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> The Thorn Birds<br />
<strong>When?</strong> 22 January 1984<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 2,600MW – 1,040,000 kettles – 4 Drax units</p>
<p>A sleeper hit, The Thorn Birds was a one-off American mini-series about a fictional sheep station in the Australian outback. Based on the novel of the same name, it was broadcast in the UK following building up a huge following in the US when it was aired in 1983. By the time it arrived on UK shores there was clearly enough of that excitement to create a surge of electricity demand – one of the largest in UK TV history.</p>
<h3>Three:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> Football World Cup Quarter Final: England v Brazil<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Friday, 21 June 2002<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 2,570MW – 1,028,000 kettles – 4 Drax units</p>
<p>Broadcast early on a Wednesday morning in the UK due to time differences with South Korea, where the game was played, the match saw England put up a solid fight against overall tournament winners Brazil. A goal from Michael Owen provided early hope and at half time TV viewers left their screens to cause a huge 2,570MW spike in demand. By the time the game had reached its conclusion, Brazil had won thanks to a chipped Ronaldinho free kick that fooled England keeper David Seaman and those viewers who had lasted the duration caused a slightly smaller 2,300MW surge.</p>

<h3>Four:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> Eastenders: Lisa admits shooting Phil<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Thursday, 5 April 2001<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 2,290MW – 916,000 kettles – 3.5 Drax units</p>
<p>In one of the most dramatic plot developments in UK TV history, Lisa Shaw, played by actress Lucy Benjamin, admitted to shooting her former boyfriend, Phil Mitchell. An estimated 22 million viewers turned on to see the dramatic reveal. When it was all over they caused a surge of 2,290MW, more than five times the normal pickup of 400MW seen at the end of an average Eastenders episode.</p>
<h3>Five:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> The Darling Buds of May<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Sunday, 12 May 1991<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 2,200MW – 880,000 kettles – 3.4 Drax units</p>
<p>One of the more wholesome entries to the list, this British comedy drama racked up a huge following during its 20-episode run from 1991 to 1993. The peak was early in the first season, when the third ever episode saw the Larkin family take an unhappy holiday to Brittany. The family’s escapades drew a large audience and prompted a surge equivalent to 880,000 kettles being switched on at the same time.</p>
<h3>Six:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> Rugby World Cup Final: England v Australia<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Saturday, 22 November 2003<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 2,110MW – 844,000 kettles – 3.3 Drax units</p>
<p>A unique sporting entry to the list as England ended as winners. More than 12 million people watched England beat Australia, with the largest electricity demand coming at half time and not at full time, when audiences were presumably still celebrating Jonny Wilkinson’s last minute drop goal.</p>
<h3>Seven:</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What?</strong> European Football Championship 2020 final: England vs Italy<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Sunday, 11 July 2021<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 1,800MW – 720,000 kettles – 2.8 Drax units</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent heartbreaker for England fans, the match came as COVID-19 restrictions were only beginning to lift around the UK. The team, led by Gareth Southgate, conquered old foes Germany on their way to a final in Wembley, only to lose to Italy on penalties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The sense of disappointment was almost palpable in the energy demand, peaking at 1,800MW at half-time, when England went into the changing rooms one-nil up. Demand then surged again to 1,200MW at the end of the 90-minute stalemate, followed by a deflated 500MW at the end of the game. Had things gone differently, National Grid ESO was preparing for a peak of 2,000MW.</p>

<h3>Eight:</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> The Royal Wedding – Prince William and Kate<br />
<strong>When?</strong> Friday, 29 April 2011<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 1,600MW – 640,000 kettles – 2.5 Drax units</p>
<p>The biggest and most celebrated Royal Wedding in a generation, the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton attracted an audience of 24 million in the UK alone. Energy demand peaked at 1,600MW when the bride’s carriage procession returned to Buckingham Palace. This is the largest TV pickup in recent years, which hints at how changing viewer habits, on demand watching and smart TVs are changing the need for power and making TV pickups a rarer occurrence.</p>

<strong>When?</strong> Thursday, 16 April 2020<br />
<strong>Electricity demand:</strong> 950MW – 320,000 kettles – 1.5 Drax units</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns had several interesting <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/covid-lockdown-made-britains-electricity-system-cleaner-and-cheaper-but-harder-to-control/">effects on the UK’s energy system</a>. One feature was a return in regular demand spikes, with Thursday evenings’ Clap for Carers events prompting notable surges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The gestures, held at 8pm on Thursdays between 26 March and 28 May 2020, saw millions across the UK stand outside their homes and clap in appreciation of emergency services workers. As people went back inside to put on kettles and turn on TVs electricity demand spiked. The particularly cloudy evening of 16 April saw demand reach 950MW as more people reached for light switches.</p>

<div>
<p>Because the level of electricity needed to power the country can’t be stored, when there is a spike in demand it needs to be met quickly by a similar increase in real time generation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To manage the supply and demand for events likely to cause electricity surges, the National Grid forecasts electricity need for large events like World Cups and major TV events.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The grid can then put contingency measures in place to manage the huge changes in demand in real time. It does this through a<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://www.drax.com/technology/great-balancing-act-takes-keep-power-grid-stable/">suite of tools</a><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>called balancing mechanisms, which allows it to access sources of extra power in real-time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The rise of more energy efficient home appliances and on-demand streaming means that the ‘shape’ of electricity demand has become flatter since the days when most of the country was tuned into the same must-see moments.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>However, it’s still crucial for the grid to forecast periods of high demand, when it will keep the necessary power stations on reserve, ready to deliver additional electricity if needed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If it wasn’t for this careful management of electricity by the grid and the power stations like Drax supplying it, that cup of tea next time England crash out of a major sporting event would not only be tainted with disappointment but cold, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>As the UK continues to expand its renewable capacity the cost of curtailing wind generation at times of low demand is increasing, adding £806 million to bills over the last two years. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Curtailment costs arise from the grid paying to turn down generation due to energy balancing or system balancing issues. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Long-duration storage, such as pumped storage hydro, offers a way to absorb excess wind power, reducing the cost of keeping the system balanced. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Drax’s plans to expand Cruachan Power Station would increase the amount of excess power it can absorb </strong><strong>from 400 MW to over one gigawatt, and rapidly deliver the same amount back to the grid when needed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>New financial mechanisms, such as a cap and floor regime, are needed to enable investors to back capital-intensive, long-term projects that will save consumers and the grid millions. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Meeting big ambitions takes big actions. And there’re few ambitions as big, or as urgent, as achieving a net zero power sector by 2035.</p>
<p>This energy transition must mean more low carbon power sources and fewer fossil fuels. But delivering that future requires new ways of <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/great-balancing-act-takes-keep-power-grid-stable/">managing power, balancing the grid</a> and a new generation of technologies, innovation, and thinking to make big projects a reality.</p>
<p>As the system evolves and more renewables, particularly wind, come online, the UK is forecast to need <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/power-generation/expanding-cruachan-an-epic-energy-storage-project-to-help-unlock-a-renewable-future/">10 times more energy storage</a> to deliver power when wind-levels drop, as well as absorb excess electricity when supply outstrips demand, and to maintain grid stability. <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/what-is-pumped-storage-hydro/">Pumped hydro storage</a> offers a tried and tested solution, but with no new long-duration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the UK, the challenges of bringing long-term projects to fruition are less engineering than they are financial.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cruachanexpansion.com/">Drax’s plan to expand Cruachan Power Station</a> to add as much as 600 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity will help support a renewable, more affordable, net zero electricity system. But government action is needed to unlock a new generation of projects that deliver electricity storage at scale.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Cruachan Expansion Project - Cruachan 2" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/710422555?h=c58fa0de7e&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Reigning in excess wind power </strong></h2>
<p>Wind is the keystone power source in the UK’s renewable ambitions. Wind capacity increased from 5.4 GW in 2010 to 25.7 GW in 2021 – enough to provide renewable power for almost 20 million homes – and the government aims to increase this to 50 GW by 2030.</p>
<p>However, wind comes with challenges: the volume of electricity being generated must always match the level of demand. If there is a spike in electricity demand when there are low wind-levels, other technologies, such as electricity storage or carbon-emitting gas power, are required to make up the shortfall.</p>
<p>Conversely, if there is too much wind power being generated and not enough demand for electricity the grid often has to pay windfarms to stop generating. This is known as wind curtailment and it’s becoming more expensive, growing from £300 million during 2020 to more than £500 million in 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>An independent report by Lane Clark &amp; Peacock (LCP), by Drax, found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added £806 million to energy bills in Britain.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15817 size-large" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset=" 1024w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-1920x1279.jpg 1920w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-480x320.jpg 480w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-1801x1200.jpg 1801w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Agriculture_wind_turbine-900x600.jpg 900w" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></p>
<p>There can also be a carbon cost to curtailing wind power. As more intermittent renewables come onto the system the grid can become more unstable and difficult to balance. In such an event the National Grid is required to turn to fossil fuel plants, like gas generation, that <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/great-balancing-act-takes-keep-power-grid-stable/">can deliver balancing and ancillary services</a> like inertia, voltage control and reserve power that wind and solar can’t provide.</p>
<p>“It’s lose-lose for everyone,” says Richard Gow, Senior Government Policy Manager at Drax. “Consumers are paying money to turn off wind and to turn up gas generation because there’re not enough sources of ancillary services on the system or renewable power can’t be delivered to where it’s needed.”</p>
<p>“Curtailment costs have spiked this year because of gas prices, and while they might dip in the next two or three years, curtailment costs are only ever going to increase. If there’s wind power on the system without an increase in storage, the cost of managing the system is only going to go up and up.”</p>

<p>The proposed Cruachan 2 expansion would help the grid avoid paying to turn off wind farms by increasing the amount it would be able to absorb from 400 MW to over 1,000 MW, and rapidly deliver the same amount of zero carbon power back to the grid should wind levels suddenly drop or the grid need urgent balancing.</p>
<p>Adding this kind of capability is a huge engineering project, involving huge new underground caverns, tunnels and waterways carved out of the rock below Ben Cruachan. However, the challenge in such a project lies less with the scale of the engineering than with its financeability.</p>
<h2><strong>From blueprints to real change</strong></h2>
<p>The original Cruachan Power Station’s six-year construction period began in 1959. The work of digging into the mountainside was carried out by a <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/the-men-who-built-a-power-station-inside-a-mountain/">team of 1,300 men, known affectionately as the Tunnel Tigers</a>, armed with hand drills and gelignite explosives in an era before modern health and safety practices.</p>

<p>Expanding Cruachan in the 21<sup>st</sup> century will be quite a different, and safer process, and one that’s practically, straightforward.</p></blockquote>
<p>“There is no reason why we physically couldn’t build Cruachan 2,” says Gow. “Detailed engineering work has indicated that this is a very feasible project. There’s no technological reason or physical constraint that would prevent us. It has a large upfront cost, and requires drilling into a mountain, but the challenge is much more on the financial, particularly securing the investment, side of the project.”</p>
<p>Pumped storage hydro facilities today generate their revenues from three different markets: the capacity market, where they receive a flat rate per kilowatt they deliver to the grid; the wholesale and balancing market, where they buy power to store when it’s abundant and cheap and sell it back to the grid when it’s needed, more valuable and used to support the Electricity System Operator in matching supply and demand on a second-by-second basis; and through ancillary services contracts, <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/why-spin-a-turbine-without-generating-power/">dedicated to specific stability services</a>.</p>
<p>These available markets present challenges for ambitious, capital-intensive projects designed to operate at scale. With the exception of the capacity market, revenues from these markets are often volatile and difficult to forecast, with no long-term contracts available.</p>
<p>Sourcing the investment needed to build projects on the scale of Cruachan 2 requires mechanisms to attract investors comfortable with long project development lead times that offer stable, low risk, rates of return in the long-term.</p>
<h2><strong>Cap and floor </strong></h2>
<p>An approach that can provide sufficient certainty to investors that income will cover the cost of debt and unlock finance for new projects is known as a ‘cap and floor’ regime.</p>
<p>With cap and floor, a facility’s revenues are subject to minimum and maximum levels. If revenues are below the ‘floor’ consumers would top-up revenues, while earnings above the ‘cap’ would be returned to consumers. This means investors can secure upfront funding safe in the knowledge of revenue certainty in the long term, whilst also offering protection to consumers.</p>
<p>Such an approach won’t attract investors looking to make a fast buck, but the vital role that it could play in the ongoing future of the UK energy system offers a long-term, stable return. At the same time, the system would save both the grid and energy consumers hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
<p>The cap and floor system is also not unique, with a similar approach <a href="https://www.drax.com/power-generation/joined-volts-role-will-interconnectors-play-great-britains-electricity-future/">currently used for interconnectors</a>, the sub-marine cables that physically connect the UK’s energy system to nearby countries allowing the UK to trade electricity with them. This means investors are already familiar with cap and floor structures, how they operate and what kind of returns they can expect.</p>
<p>“It’s not just pumped storage hydro that this could apply to,” explains Gow. “There are other, different large-scale, long-duration storage technologies that this could also apply to.”</p>
<p>“It would give us revenue certainty so that we can invest to support the system and reduce the cost of curtailment while ensuring consumers get value for their money.”</p>

<p>Cruachan was originally only made possible through the advocacy and actions of MP and wartime Secretary of State for Scotland Tom Johnston. Then it was needed to help absorb excess generation from the country’s new fleet of nuclear power stations and release this to meet short term spikes in demand. Today it’s renewable wind the system must adapt to.</p>
<p>For the UK to continue to meet an ever-changing energy system the government must be prepared to act and enable projects at scale, that bring long-term transformation for a net zero future.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>What is carbon transportation? </strong></h3>
<p>Carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another. In nature, carbon moves through <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-the-carbon-cycle/">the carbon cycle</a>. In industries like energy, however, carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage.</p>
<h3><strong>Why does carbon need to be transported?</strong></h3>
<p>Anthropogenic (man-made) CO<sub>2 </sub>released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the atmosphere and <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-business/what-is-climate-change/">contributes to global warming</a>.</p>
<p>However, these emissions can be captured as part of <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-carbon-capture-usage-and-storage/">carbon capture and storage (CCS</a>). The CO<sub>2</sub> is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground.</p>
<p>Capturing and storing CO<sub>2</sub> prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. Processes that can deliver negative emissions – such as bioenergy with <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/">carbon capture and storage</a> (BECCS) and <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-direct-air-carbon-capture-and-storage-dacs/">direct air capture and storage</a> (DACS) – aim to permanently remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere through CCS.</p>
<p>In CCS, carbon must be transported from the site where it’s captured to a site where it can be permanently stored. This means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs.</p>
<p>As of September 2021, there were 27 operational CCS facilities around the world, with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of CO<sub>2</sub>. It’s estimated that the UK alone has <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/transporting-carbon-how-to-safely-move-co2-from-the-atmosphere-to-permanent-storage/">70 billion tonnes of potential CO<sub>2</sub> storage space</a> in sandstone rock formations under the North Sea.</p>

<h3><strong>How is carbon transported?</strong></h3>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> can be transported via trucks or ships, but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline. Moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure. Gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations.</p>
<p>Gas pipelines are common all around the world, including those transporting CO<sub>2</sub>. In the US there are, for instance, more than 50 CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines – covering around 6,500 km and transporting approximately <a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/archive/hub/publications/191083/fact-sheet-transporting-co2.pdf">68 million tonnes of CO<sub>2 </sub>a year</a>.</p>
<p>Gas takes up less volume when <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/srccs_chapter4-1.pdf">it’s compressed,</a> and even less when it is liquefied, solidified, or hydrated. Therefore, before being transported, captured CO<sub>2</sub> is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/transporting-carbon-how-to-safely-move-co2-from-the-atmosphere-to-permanent-storage/">a supercritical fluid</a>.</p>
<p>In a supercritical state, CO<sub>2</sub> has the density of a liquid but the viscosity (thickness) of a gas and is, therefore, easier to transport through pipelines. It’s also 50-80% less dense than water, with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid.</p>
<p>This means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when it’s moving through pipes and, subsequently, into geological storage sites.</p>
<h3><strong>How safe is it to transport carbon?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s no riskier to transport CO<sub>2</sub> via pipeline or ship <a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/archive/hub/publications/191083/fact-sheet-transporting-co2.pdf">than it is to transport oil and natural gas</a>, and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>To enable the safe use of CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines, CCS projects must ensure captured CO<sub>2</sub> complies with strict purity and temperature specifications, as well as making sure CO<sub>2</sub> is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines’ operations.</p>
<p>Whilst there are a growing number of CCS transport systems around the world, CCS is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48317/4899-the-ccs-roadmap.pdf">identify best practises, materials and technologies</a> to optimise the process. This includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation.</p>
<p>In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive regulates health, safety, and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines, which are covered by legislation. The legislation ensures the safety of pipelines, pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for CO<sub>2</sub> transport regulation.</p>
