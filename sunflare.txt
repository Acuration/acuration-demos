	Sunflare is a renewable technology that offers thin, lightweight, and flexible solar panels made of copper indium gallium and selenide semiconductor materials that require minimal heat. Their solar modules are made of high-quality stainless steel and are designed to meet exacting specifications for outstanding performance and reliability. Sunflare's precise cellbycell manufacturing produces superior quality and superior energy efficiency, with no need for air circulation beneath them to cool down. The production process is very energy-efficient and uses an extremely thin lightabsorbing layer with less than 1mm of elemental materials in its production process. The sunflare solar modules have a low carbon footprint and do not produce pollutants or release co 2 into the atmosphere, making them better for the environment. They require no glass and the flex60 has no aluminum frame, and they can flex with the shape of any roof and are far more durable than rigid and fragile silicon cells. The solar panels have a lower temperature coefficient, create more power during the warmest hours, and require less labor and less stress to produce than typical silicon solar panels. They also require less water to manufacture and recycles the little water used materials, and are recycled when spent unlike fossil fuels. The SunFlare solar panels are the cleanest mass produced solar power on the planet and have the lowest carbon footprint among all electricity sources, with a co2 foot print of only 15% compared to typical silicon modules. They are also the most energy-

	The article discusses the history of the carrington event, a large solar storm that occurred in September 1859. It was caused by a powerful coronal mass ejection and lasted for about five minutes. The event sparked a huge geomagnetic storm that caused satellites to plummet from orbit. The origins of space weather can be traced to contortions in the sun's magnetic field, leading to dark blotches or sunspots on its surface. These spots can emerge from solar flares and other electromagnetic phenomena, with potentially hazardous consequences for our technological way of life. The solar storm is on an 11-year cycle and is approaching the next solar maximum in 2025. The article also mentions other extreme solar storms such as the polar light shows and the northern lights aurora borealis. Additionally, there have been reports of sparks showering from telegraph machines and papers setting ablaze.
